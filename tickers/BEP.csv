operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. and welcome to the bep's second-quarter 2020 results conference call. [operator instructions] it is now my pleasure to introduce ceo sachin shah.
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
thank you, operator. good morning, everyone. and thank you for joining us for our second-quarter 2020 conference call. before we begin, i'd like to remind you that a copy of our news release, investor supplement, and letter to unit holders can be found on our website.
i also want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements on this call. these statements are subject to known and unknown risks, and our future results may differ materially. for more information, you are encouraged to review our regulatory filings available on sedar, edgar and on our website. this morning, i will provide an outlook on the business and an update on our recent growth initiatives.
after my remarks, wyatt will provide an overview of our operating results, as well as an update on our balance sheet and funding plan. following our remarks, we look forward to taking your questions and comments. over the past 20 years, we have built a scaled global renewable power business with over $50 billion of operating assets and an 18,000-megawatt development pipeline and deep expertise across all major renewable technologies. the world continues to be in the early stages of a global transition to the decarbonization of electricity grids.
this shift, which is fueled by a push to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to meet increasingly stringent carbon reduction targets, and solar and wind power becoming the lowest cost easiest to build providers of bulk power will require significant investment over the coming decades. accordingly, there is considerable room for our business to grow for many years ahead. and as subsidies decline or fall away, the opportunity will increasingly favor investors like ourselves who can drive value and enhance cash flows from our global scale and depth of operating expertise. we believe that we have established ourselves as one of the few entities of scale with the track record and global capabilities to partner with governments and businesses to help them achieve their goal of greening the global electricity grids, while earning a strong return for our investors.
our solar business has grown substantially over the last five years. today, we have over 3,000 megawatts of solar in operations and an additional nearly 10,000 megawatts of solar under development. as a result of technology advances and reductions in construction costs, solar can stand on its own without subsidies and more importantly is now among the lowest cost sources of conventional power globally. to put this in perspective solar costs over the last five years the period in which we have built our business have gone from over $4 per watt to install to less than $1 per watt in almost all jurisdictions around the world.
as a result of these favorable economics, as well as the renewable nature and perpetual source of free energy, we believe it is possible that in 10 years from now the majority of the production capacity of brookfield renewable will be solar capacity. it is not that we do not believe in wind or hydro, but the growth in solar and the ability for us to develop and earn strong risk-adjusted returns should enable us to grow our solar operations at a far greater pace. recently, we executed two transactions that highlight the strength and scale of our solar capabilities and demonstrate the various ways we approach creating value for our shareholders. first, we completed the merger of terraform power into brookfield renewable on an all-stock basis.
terraform power was one of the largest owners of solar globally prior to the bankruptcy of its sponsor in 2016. given our scale, we were one of the few organizations that could acquire it through the restructuring and immediately stabilize the business by implementing an operating plan and resuming growth. as a result, we have driven significant value in the business delivering terraform power shareholders, including bep a 35% annualized total return and over two times their money, since our involvement. the merger is accretive to brookfield renewable strengthens our business in north america and europe and further enhances our position as one of the largest publicly traded pure-play renewable power businesses with an equity market capitalization of approximately $20 billion.
the second transaction, we executed was to acquire a 1,200-megawatt solar development project in brazil. this is one of the largest solar development projects in the world and requires both development and energy marketing capabilities to bring the project to completion. the project is 75% contracted and we intend to leverage our deep energy marketing capabilities to contract the remaining power. in addition given our global scale, we expect to drive down equipment procurement, installation and operating cost to deliver additional value over time.
accordingly, we expect to achieve approximately 20% returns on this investment. the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2020. in total, this quarter, we have agreed on transactions to invest approximately $600 million or $130 million net to bep of equity. also of note last week, we completed the special distribution of bepc shares providing investors with greater flexibility in how they invest in our business.
bepc is listed on the same exchanges as bep offering investors the optionality to invest in brookfield renewable through either a partnership or a corporation, which we believe should lead to increased demand and enhance the liquidity for our securities. we completed the special distribution on july 30 by providing unit holders with one share of bepc for every four units of bep. we have subsequently seen strong support for bepc shares in the market with strong trading volumes over the first few weeks of trading and the share price trading slightly above the bep unit price. we are very pleased with the launch and positive market reception thus far.
i will now turn the call over to wyatt to discuss our operating results and financial position. 
wyatt hartley -- managing partner and chief financial officer
thank you, sachin. and good morning everyone. during the second quarter, we generated ffo of $232 million or $0.75 per unit, which is up slightly from the prior year as the business benefited from recent acquisitions, strong operational performance and execution on margin enhancement initiatives. on a normalized basis, our results are up 19% over the last year.
with an increasingly diversified portfolio of operating assets, limited off take or concentration risk and a strong contract profile, our cash flows are highly resilient. while generation for the quarter was below the long-term average, driven largely by drier conditions in new york and colombia, generation so far this year has been roughly in line with long-term average. as we have reiterated, we expect this type of resource cyclicality and, therefore, do not manage the business based on under or over performance of generation relative to the long-term average in any given period. our focus continues to be on diversifying the business, which mitigates exposure to any single resource, market or counterparty.
we continue to be focused on maintaining a highly diversified investment-grade customer base with over 600 customers around the world under long-term power purchase agreements. for example, our commercial and industrial counterparties, which comprise less than 20% of our generation, are well diversified across regions and sectors with our largest c&i customer representing only 2% of our total contracted generation. our contract profile remains strong with 95% of total generation contracted in 2020 and a weighted average remaining contract length of 15 years. therefore, our cash flows are well protected from exposure to short-term price volatility and are expected to remain stable over the long-term.
turning to our segment results. during the quarter, our hydroelectric segment delivered ffo of $193 million. in north america, we remain focused on securing short-term contracts in this low power price environment to retain upside optionality for when prices improve. in our brazilian and colombian portfolios, we continue to focus on extending the duration of our contract profile while maintaining a certain portion of uncontracted generation to mitigate hydrology risk.
this quarter we secured 17 new contracts in latin america for a total of over 430 gigawatt hours per year, including one contract in colombia with a seven-year term. our weighted average remaining contract duration is now nine years in brazil and three years in colombia. next, our wind and solar segments generated a combined $85 million of ffo, representing a 29% increase over the prior year as we continue to generate stable revenues from these assets and benefit from the diversification of our fleet and highly contracted cash flows with long duration power purchase agreements. this quarter, we commissioned almost 100 megawatts of solar projects and secured five long-term ppas with investment-grade counterparties to support our 1,500-megawatt wind development pipeline in the u.s.
and europe. our liquidity position remains strong with close to $3.4 billion of total available liquidity, which allows us to support our current operations, as well as to opportunistically pursue new investments. our investment-grade balance sheet has no material maturities over the next five years, an average overall debt duration of 10 years and approximately 80% of our financings are nonrecourse to debt. during the quarter, we executed over $1.1 billion of financings across the business.
we also continue to execute on our capital recycling strategy of selling mature derisked or noncore assets to lower cost capital buyers and redeploying the proceeds into higher-yielding opportunities. so far this year, we generated close to $500 million of proceeds or $80 million net to bep from these activities. in summary, our business remains resilient as we continue to actively look for opportunities to grow our portfolio on a value basis. as such, we remain firm in our belief that brookfield renewable is one of the strongest best-positioned platforms to contribute to the decarbonization of the globe through investment in multiple renewable technologies.
in short, we believe the prospects for growth of our business are better than they ever have been. and looking forward, we remain well-positioned to achieve our objective of delivering total returns on a per-unit basis of 12% to 15% over the long term. that concludes our formal remarks for today's call. thank you for joining us this morning.
with that i'll pass it back to our operator for questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of sean steuart with td securities.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
thanks. good morning. a couple of questions, sachin with respect to your comments on solar cost declines and this being a focus increasingly for bep going forward. can you give us some thoughts about how you expect costs and capacity factors for the technology to trend from here? when i reverse engineer the economics of your project in brazil, it looks like the intent is to build that at less than $0.5 million per megawatt, which would suggest ongoing declines.
how do you think about the longer-term cost trends for the technology and efficiency of the technology as well?
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
hey, sean. sure. so i'd say, first of all with brazil and often in developing markets, i would just remind you that construction and labor tends to be a lot lower than what you would see in north america and europe. so a big portion of that is construction and labor costs.
that being said the u.s. is also weighed down by tariffs. so you kind of get it on both ends. you get cheaper overall build costs in most markets around the world relative to the u.s.
because of tariffs. and then, when you add in labor and overall construction costs, the developing world, costs come down to that level that you are ascribing. in terms of where we go from here, what i would say is, two things we are seeing in the solar market. one is that the manufacturers largely in china continue to make significant advances in manufacturing, which means that, they will continue to be able to deliver some cost savings; but more importantly, what they'll be delivering is, higher capacity factor panels and larger panels, which have just a better performance overall, which means less degradation, longer lifespan, lower ongoing maintenance costs.
and if you combine that with our ability to operate and maintain plants in-house do much of the development work on our own, it just gives us a huge advantage. and plus, look we have a business in china. so we have a very strong relationship with a lot of the panel manufacturers. and given our scale, we can drive a global procurement program, which, if you're solely a u.s.
solar developer or solely a european developer, you just cannot procure in the scale we can. and therefore, we have a number of advantages. and we think that those advantages will allow us to differentiate ourselves over the coming decade.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
thanks for that detail. wyatt, a question for you, there was a $22 million positive contribution in proportion of adjusted ebitda from the corporate segment. can you give us some context on what that relates to?
wyatt hartley -- managing partner and chief financial officer
yeah, sean. so as we mentioned at the last quarter, we have undertaken some public market activities. and really what that reflects is some of those activities in the quarter just given where markets traded to we exited those positions and were able to realize some gains.
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
yes. one thing, i would just add to that is in our business we are always rotating capital. sometimes we're selling assets. sometimes we're in the market of buying shares.
we sometimes buy debt at distressed levels. and we're selling those out. and the thing that you should be reminded of is that that is just normal course rotation of capital for us buying investments for value and then selling them when markets normalize. obviously, with all the disruption we had in the quarter -- last quarter given the economic shutdown, we picked up significant securities at pretty compelling valuations.
we sold some of that, but not all of it. so we booked the gains. but it's no different than us selling a half interest in the solar facility or selling, bringing a partner into one of our hydros. the only difference is, sometimes the accounting shows up as a gain or shows up as equity.
i'd say most importantly what you should realize is, we're creating value for our shareholders by doing this type of activity and it's stuff that we've done for many years now.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
understood. ok, thanks for that, i will get back in queue.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of rupert merer with national bank.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
good morning.
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
good morning, rupert.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
sachin, so you talked about the move to solar. how does this change your forward view on power prices both the cost of energy and the cost of capacity? and what do you think are the implications for your existing assets?
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
yeah. it doesn't really change our forward view. i'd say, if you asked us seven to 10 years ago, what our views on power prices were, i'd say generally we were fairly bullish, largely driven by underlying fundamentals of gas in the ground. obviously, all of that's evolved over that time.
our thinking has evolved around just the cost of wind and solar coming down and really representing the marginal cost of power. and what you've seen us do over the last decade is transition our business very quickly into that dynamic, such that we have a scaled wind and solar business. i think, what we're saying to you now is that that trend continues. power prices should, on a pure-energy basis, stay low for the foreseeable future.
what it means though is that, the value of storage and capacity continues to go up and continues to be deeply valuable. and if you look at the pump storage facilities we own or the capacity payments or what i'd say ancillary services revenues that we earn in our hydro fleet. they have gone up for 10 years now and have really compensated against declining energy prices. so that being said, i think our view continues to be the same where energy -- stand-alone energy prices will be low because wind and solar is very economic to build-out.
but given that they are intermittent technologies, if you have the ability to store power, to provide backup power, to provide stabilization services to the grid, those services are deeply valuable and increasingly becoming scarce. so i think we actually have a really nice hedge in the business. and given the complementary nature of the assets we have, we get a lot of diversity not only technologically, geographically but also from a revenue -- pure revenue stack perspective, we have a lot of diversity of the type of revenue we earn, but no change in outlook of pricing. we're not more bullish.
and what you'll continue to see from us is a priority on contracting out our power.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
so if you move into building more solar, can we imagine that you'll want to maintain the existing storage assets you have and maybe build out more storage in parallel with solar?
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
for sure, rupert, that is a key part of our strategy that having this complement of different technologies, it allows us to provide better overall solutions to customers, whether those customers are governments utilities or through our c&i business because, we can provide 24/7 power with backup capability by bundling different technologies we have. so it is pretty important that we maintain that diversity and it just gives us a more valuable product to the end customer.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
and then, just a quick follow-up housekeeping question. it seemed like the solar generation this quarter came in significantly lower than the lta. was that related to a radiance, or did you see some curtailment in your fleet?
wyatt hartley -- managing partner and chief financial officer
yes, rupert, it's wyatt here. no you're exactly right. that all had to do with the resource the underlying resource. we really didn't see any meaningful curtailment across our fleet.
as we've mentioned before with respect to the markets we are in, our assets as renewable assets generally have priority dispatch onto the grid. and so curtailment wasn't really a meaningful impact to our business this quarter.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
thanks. i'll leave it there. thanks very much.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of rob hope with scotiabank.
rob hope -- scotiabank -- analyst
good morning, everyone. just thinking about the m&a market, debt levels seems elevated, but there's a lot of liquidity out there in the market. how do you think this plays out in the future? and could we see you acquire some distressed assets maybe in 2021 when markets start to normalize and liquidity normalizes?
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, look, it's been an expensive highly competitive market for 10 years now. nothing's really changed. i think, maybe if you asked us three or four months ago, we would have thought we were turning and the opportunity to acquire for deeper value was becoming more interesting.
but with all the stimulus and government support, that quickly went away. i would say, our playbook really allows us to always look for deep value distress, but we also do things that differentiate ourselves through our operations, like the brazil deal, we announced. and therefore, we've stayed away from the highly competitive, low-risk, low-return-type investments that may be others have had to go into. and we'll continue to stay away from those types of opportunities.
and what i'm really getting at is those sort of single-digit-return type of opportunities where there really is no differentiator, other than a cost of capital. that's not our playbook. it's not where we focus our time and effort. for us, if we can drive operational enhancement and create value by doing something different, then that's really our area of focus.
and you can see that from both transactions, we highlighted this quarter they really signified that strategy.
rob hope -- scotiabank -- analyst
all right. that's helpful. and just to follow up on sean's question. just the public securities that you're buying in q2 and you've sold a portion of.
are you still looking to get toeholds in certain ftes, or is it that the market has rebounded a little quicker than you anticipated?
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
yeah. look, they did rebound quicker than we anticipated without a doubt. so the short answer is, we're pretty disciplined as an investor group and we will sell-out if we don't see the room to keep acquiring for value. from a total strategy perspective, it's always been a core part of our -- the way we originate transaction flow.
look, ironically, while we were selling out securities this quarter we completed the final stages of the terraform merger, which it also started out as a total strategy four years ago. so i think what you should expect is that it will always be a part of our strategy. we'll always be in the market looking for deep value. but from time to time if we can't secure it we'll sell-out and hopefully realize some gains for shareholders.
rob hope -- scotiabank -- analyst
all right. thank you for the answers.
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
no problem.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of mark jarvi with cibc capital markets.
mark jarvi -- cibc world markets corp. -- analyst
good morning. you guys have sort of been involved in advocacy for maybe looking at a carbon tax in the u.s. market. do you guys have any updated thoughts on that in light of maybe a change in administration or a preferred structure on what you'd like to see if they went forward with the carbon tax?
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
look, we don't get too up or down based on changes in politics or regime or governments. when trump came into office, we continue to be bullish on the sector recognizing this trend that we are investing into is a multi-decade global trend and really politics can't stop it based on all the things we've talked about over the years. obviously, if you get a government coming in that is supportive, that's always good, but we're not banking on anything that is in the form of a subsidy or carbon tax to drive our business nor are we investing assuming those things come into place. so if they do and it's helpful great.
but we have a good business and we know how to invest through different governments and whether we're supported or not we just think that these technologies make sense today, and therefore, they're going to survive much longer than people's views.
mark jarvi -- cibc world markets corp. -- analyst
ok. and then, as you continue to grow the solar business just curious how that changes how you guys think about financing your business? does it change your view on access to medium-term notes or green bonds, or how does that change if the mix changes a little bit from less hydro and a bit more solar over time?
wyatt hartley -- managing partner and chief financial officer
yes. thanks, mark, it's wyatt here. so in terms of the majority of our financing, as i mentioned in my comments, more than 80% of our financing is at the project level. it's financed on a mass-maturity basis.
so it is reflective of the underlying asset. if it's hydro it's a perpetual asset. so it will be reflective of that. if it's wind or solar it's a finite life asset so it would be an amortizing structure.
so the majority of our financing won't change it will be just reflective of the underlying asset. in terms of the corporate level, we've always been aware that when we issue medium term notes that we were doing so on the back of a perpetual hydro business. and so over time, we may look to moderate our overall issuance of mtms to reflect the fact that they are a more finite business. but that's a long way off.
we continue to have a very strong base hydro business and so for the most part, we don't really see it overall impacting our financing strategy.
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
the only thing i would just add is that one very significant change that's occurred in the last five years is that wind and solar in particular solar has a much longer lifespan than the lender community would ascribe to it. and what we're seeing play out in our wind fleet and in our solar fleet is that when these things were typically being underwritten for 25 years the technology is now being built -- the manufacturing specs for the technology are now being built for 35 to 40 years and it's just getting better and more robust. and once you get out to that level, it's largely a perpetual asset. i mean, there's component parts in our hydros that also need to be replaced in 40 years.
so i think what's going to happen in our sector -- and i could be wrong, but i think one of the great potential value drivers that changes our business is that over time, wind and solar financings start to reflect a more perpetual asset base. and what happens is if you're running a solar price for 40 to 50 years and you're just replacing component parts over that period it effectively turns the asset into a perpetual asset. and therefore, it's going to start to look and feel a lot more like our hydro business. and once that happens, and there will be an inflection point when this happens, the banks insurance companies and all the lenders who lend in the space will start to gravitate to longer duration interest-only financings and you will see the next leg up in cash flows in our business.
and we think that that will happen sooner than people think, almost similar to what happened with our hydro business just 15 years ago when people put their mind to it and realize these are very, very long duration assets that ultimately properly maintained with the right sponsor, can act look and feel like a perpetual asset base.
mark jarvi -- cibc world markets corp. -- analyst
that's interesting. and maybe just to follow up on that, two things, one, how does sort of resource stability maybe solar or less variable than hydro or wind factor into how you think we're financing them longer term? and then, on the perpetual perspective how does sort of jurisdiction and maybe access to different markets and liquidity from an energy marketing perspective really change how you think about what your dollar should be spent on solar going forward?
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
so first of all, wind, i would say wind tends to be the most variable resource, then hydro, then solar. solar is the most stable resource. and that stability should drive a lower cost of capital in the financing markets. i also think that because of that my comments around being able to finance them with interest-only long duration bonds, that could be the technology that leads the charge with wind pretty closely behind.
in terms of your question around markets and energy marketing, obviously, for us, it's a huge advantage to have energy marketing capabilities in latam in europe and in north america because as these projects increasingly age and ppas, fall off there will be sellers who really just cannot operationally commercializes the back end of these projects. and if we can do it with our marketing capabilities, and our ability to invest the capital needed to bring another 40 years of life to the site that's a real advantage. so again, it all speaks, to why we really prioritize building and investing in our operations, and my comments around these assets starting to look and feel more perpetual in nature. our view is just that this is sooner than people think.
and the technology has really, really matured, as has the entire apparatus that supports the technology from an ongoing maintenance and operations perspective. and therefore, as always, the financing markets should follow. and if that happens, again, we've never factored it into our business but it will be a very meaningful driver of value going forward.
mark jarvi -- cibc world markets corp. -- analyst
ok, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of ben pham with bmo capital markets.
ben pham -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok, thanks, good morning. it's a feedback after seven months. i just wanted to touch base. first question is some of your commentary around just where you are right now.
i think wyatt mentioned, you're seeing a ton of growth opportunity i think best positioned in the cycle. so does that mean, when you think about all the tailwinds that maybe just not brookfield but the renewal energy that you have to cycle where the growth rates are more at the upper end of your targeted range rather than mid to low point?
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
look, what i would say is, our view on this sector hasn't changed in a long-time. i know that maybe if we were on a call five years ago or 10 years ago people were still unsure whether or not this business could grow in size or scale. but the perspective we've always taken is that, the electricity markets around the world represent trillions of dollars of investment opportunity. generation alone is the largest component of that and has the most transition that has to go through because it represents significant carbon dioxide output.
and so we are in the sweet spot of that because we are global, we can invest across multiple technologies and the disruption and transition in the entire energy supply stack is going to be most felt, on the generation side. so we have believed and continue to believe, that this is an enormous opportunity that we are building our business into and that opportunity will last for 25 years, at least. so i wouldn't say, we think it's bigger today. we thought it was big for many, many years.
and what you've hopefully seen is that, we've been able to deliver. and we'll continue to employ the same strategy and playbook, as we build out the business around the world.
ben pham -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. and maybe related to that, when you think about achieving your payout ratio target that 70% of ffo i think a few quarters ago you mentioned, probably a few years. but really when you think about the terp transaction and some of these other initiatives, that you've done have -- are you of the view now that maybe reaching that payout ratio target is a bit quicker than, what you thought six months ago?
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
ben, we're not stressed at all about our payout ratio. candidly, we weren't stressed when it was 100%. we have always said it's just one indicator of financial health. the more important indicators of financial health are having an investment-grade balance sheet, having a high degree of liquidity, having very stable assets that produce consistent cash flows.
it's nice that our payout ratio is down into the high 70s. it gives people lots of comfort. and we'll continue to chip away. but it is not the driver of what we're trying to achieve.
and over the years, if i look out over the next 10 years, there will be times where it's 80%. there will be times worth 70%. there might be times where it's 90%. most importantly though, we will make sure that we have an investment grade balance sheet with a very high degree of liquidity, we, obviously, have very strong sponsorship with brookfield asset management owning a very large stake in the company.
and therefore, it's one indicator of financial health that we, obviously, pay a lot of attention to and it's in a great place, but we're not overly focused on it.
ben pham -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
i know you had a lot of questions on solar. but i was wondering, can you remind me when you look at solar versus offshore wind. and you mentioned that offshore wind, you didn't want to get into it because of the high subsidization, the cost curve has gone down dramatically. so you don't want to get caught in a situation in 10 years pricing drops and you get some pressure on the other side.
so is solar a bit different there where the levelized cost is also dropping, pricing could drop as referenced by an earlier question? is that compare contrast a little bit different there when you look at the two?
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
they are different. look both are mature, both are very good technologies. the difference being on solar what i would say is typically the contract structures on solar, almost everywhere around the world have been much longer than what we've seen in offshore wind. offshore has typically had 15 years at the beginning.
it's in many jurisdictions it's 10 years of contract life and very, very high ppa prices that it's tough to make the bet that they will persist post the ppa environment. it could happen, but it's a tough bet for us to make. the second thing that we wanted to see in that sector is just a little bit more time to understand just some of the impact and implications around the operations of running deepwater or offshore generation. and i would say, the market has really matured.
it's done a good job. would we invest in offshore? absolutely we would. it would have to be under the right conditions and at the right returns. and what we don't want to do is invest in offshore wind with a bet on the future power price.
we'd rather invest in a way where we can drive operational value to create the returns we need to create. if we find that opportunity, we will absolutely invest in offshore wind.
ben pham -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok, got it. ok, thanks.
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
thanks a lot, ben.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of nelson ng with rbc capital markets.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
good morning, everyone. i just had a few questions on the development pipeline. so in brazil now that you have about three good sized solar developments. and i think for the 1,200-megawatt solar facility you mentioned that 75% is contracted.
could you just give a bit of color on the term that that one is contracted for and whether the other two, the 210 and 270 -- sorry, 278-megawatt projects, whether those are fully contracted or not?
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
yeah. so all three projects have contracts in the range of 20-plus years. and the first two are contracted. the second one is 75% contracted and we will use our client base, our customer base in the country to contract out the balance, which, to remind you, we have around 600 customers in the country that buy power from us through all of our facilities and very strong ongoing relationships that we can use to lay off the final 25%.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. ok. and then, can you talk about -- given that you have a sizable footprint in colombia as well, are you seeing the same type of wind or solar opportunities in colombia where even if it's not fully contracted you can leverage your footprint to derisk those projects?
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
similar. i'd say, the big difference in colombia is the contract market isn't as long as you see in brazil. brazil is just much more mature. so you can sign with a counterparty a 12-, 15-year contract and that happens on a regular basis.
in colombia, it's more difficult. and therefore, when you're doing development, you're typically looking for a government ppa to start out with. and then, if you have a little bit of exposure left, maybe you don't get a full wrap, we then have a very large marketing group and we are probably one of the, only ones in the country signing 10-year ppas. so it is certainly an advantage we have, but the depth of the market is just not as strong.
so i would say, we probably are -- we're just being more careful in colombia and you'll see more development in brazil than you would see in colombia from our perspective.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. and like, on that point like for the -- i think two of those brazilian assets you bought into an advanced development. is that the strategy whether it's in colombia or brazil to get involved at a later stage of development?
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
yeah. typically, that's been our strategy for many years is anywhere in the world we are looking more at later stage opportunities. they tend to have the best risk reward paradigm for us. and look, the strategy ebbs and flows.
for a few years in brazil, it was more of an m&a strategy when we felt that there was a scarcity of capital on m&a transactions. right now, we see a scarcity of capital on the development side, and therefore, that's been our focus. we'll always be nimble around those types of things. but in general, we prioritize late-stage development and we're not going to burn a lot of capital on early stage, greenfield-type transactions.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. and then, just one last question. the projects to be completed over the next few years, i think the ffo contribution is about $53 million. roughly, what's the investment required to achieve that? should we be thinking, that you invest at seven times to eight times ffo multiple to get a mid to low-teen ffo yield?
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
less than that. this is going to be a 20%, return on the development stuff it will be a 20% return target. so you should -- wyatt can follow up, but your investment sounds a little high.
wyatt hartley -- managing partner and chief financial officer
yeah. the basic math i would think about, nelson, is that our proportionate capacity on that under construction is around 700 megawatts assume 1 million per megawatts less than $700 million of total capital. you get 60% leverage on that, and then a 20% ffo yield on that. that's going to drive you to your $50 million to $55 million ffo contribution.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok, got it. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of andrew kuske with credit suisse.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you. good morning. sachin, you mentioned earlier on about partnering and partnerships. given some of the comments that have come out earlier from, let's call them conventional energy producers, about their aspirations in this cycle for renewable investment, how do you think about alignment for brookfield on a bigger-picture basis with either conventional energy producers or really off-takers and the technology industry is another example where there's a lot of demand for renewables.
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
both groups are groups that we are actively talking to, and i would even add oil and gas firms as potential offtakes are also groups that we're talking to. and what i would say is this is all part of an energy transition thesis that's happening or trend that's happening. the technology firms have very stringent carbon reduction targets because of their supply chains and their data centers, which are heavy consumers of conventional thermal generation. the oil and gas firms, obviously, by the nature of what they do produce a lot of co2.
and traditional conventional power producers, which have coal and gas in the ground, are also looking to put capital to work in renewables. we are actively talking to all three groups looking for ways to partner to help with the broad thesis around energy transition. i would say in many respects that was part of how we got involved with transalta last year, was to help them with their transition story. so i think given our capabilities and given our scale, we could be a really good partner around transition where it's a big area of focus for us.
and i think to the extent that we can do it in a way that our investors understand that there is a bridge to a greener place and that we're part of that story that could be a really compelling area of growth for us.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok, that's helpful. and i guess, maybe just the context it's taking you 25 years to build the company to where it is now. and there are some players out there that have talked about trying to add like 2.5 brookfield renewables within a 10-year period of time, which is a big aspiration. do you see that as a big opportunity? do you clearly have and i'm not trying to be patronizing about it, but you've got a big global footprint and you could be poised for accelerated development.
you're not coming from a standing start, right? and how do you price that in the energy transition for a larger player like in the energy producer space?
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
yeah. so first what i'd say is that our business -- first from a trading perspective, our business has generally always just reflected the in-place business and growth has been something that people -- investors have struggled to get their minds around in spite of the fact that we continue to deliver growth. i think what you're getting at is that the growth will not only continue, but could accelerate because of the shift that we're seeing from very large corporations that were previously doing things like oil and gas development and exploration moving into renewables. i'd say two things.
one is i think it's excellent. it just adds more credibility and capital to the sector and it will drive increased opportunity for us because there's a lot that we can do that those who are starting from scratch just cannot. no. 2, we could be a great partner to those organizations and do things together, so that they're not starting from ground zero, but they're working with somebody, to your point, who's been at it for 25 years.
and no. 3, if those investors are looking for bulk or scale, we could sell into that trend, mature assets that we have on our balance sheet and continue to build out the business like we always have. so there's a lot we can do because of that. and to your comments about their aspirational targets, i think, they are aspirational.
and if they can achieve them, more power to them, this is a tough business. we've said it for 25 years, as you've noted and it takes a long time to build it properly.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
one final one, if i may. and it's just -- you've mentioned solar cost. we've seen it plummet over the last 20, 30, 40 years, if you want. how do you think about battery costs? and how does that fit into your portfolio?
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
yeah. we have a few batteries in the portfolio, that we acquired largely in wind projects, actually one also in a hydro facility that we have because either the existing infrastructure reduced the costs and made it competitive, or because we had some high-priced ppas that let us invest in the batteries and secure that ppa price for more hours than we could otherwise achieve. and therefore, the returns worked. but batteries continue to be expensive and i think will take time to properly commercialize.
the biggest difference that we've seen is that batteries aren't attracting the subsidies that were given to wind and solar in the early days, that helped drive capital into manufacturing and r&d. and therefore, what you're seeing on batteries is the vast majority of the r&d and capital going in is really coming from the transportation sector, as opposed to from a pure electricity application. so i think batteries will absolutely be a key component of generation and stability 10 to 20 years from now. it's just the path to get there might be slower than what we saw with wind and solar.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok, that's great. thank you.
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
no problem. thanks andrew.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of anthony crowdell with mizuho.
anthony crowdell -- mizuho securities -- analyst
hey, good morning. if i could just follow up on an earlier comment. if i looked at slide six in the deck. can you give a percentage by generation, i guess, is there a sweet spot that you're going to manage to? and also, if you think about how hydro present this nice natural hedge for declining power prices because of some of the fixed payments or capacity payments, are you limited to how much you could add the other source of generation, so that that natural hedge is still sizable for your portfolio?
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
yeah, thank you for the question, anthony. we've got this question a lot over the years. look, we're not targeting a certain breakout between the technologies. we're a very opportunistic organization.
and we will grow all three segments. to the earlier comments, we'll likely add a couple more segments in the future, whether that's offshore wind, whether that's battery storage, as those technologies evolve, mature and provide an investment opportunity for us. i think what we are more interested in, is having the ability to move our capital across the different technologies where the deepest value opportunity presents itself and being able to buy in bulk across portfolios that have different technologies within them. around the hedging and the diversity, we think that if we keep growing all of our segments, the natural diversity that that presents actually gives us a higher quality cash flow stream for our investors because you have more things working for you.
but what i would say is, if you look forward, solar will be the segment that should grow the fastest. wind will be second and hydro will be third. they'll all grow, but that proportion of hydro will likely shrink over time, just -- not because we are selling the hydro. in fact, it should grow, but it will be growing at a lower rate.
anthony crowdell -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions.
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
no problem.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of naji baydoun with ia securities.
naji baydoun -- ia securities -- analyst
hi. good morning. just a couple of questions. i guess, following up on nelson's question.
outside of colombia or brazil, just wondering what markets you think would have the most potential to build out the types of solar projects you're targeting today.
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
today, we're adding a lot of development through our business x-elio in europe. so that's a big area of growth for us, european solar, in particular in spain and southern europe. we are, obviously, in latin america we have, active development in the united states. the emerging markets i'd say, the biggest two that we focus on are india and brazil.
and both markets have very, very strong solar potential. you're starting to see it in brazil, but india will quickly get there, just given its solar resource, its sun resource. we're focused on all of the markets. they all have different risk reward profiles, and we want to make sure that we also manage our exposure to emerging markets in the way that we've always communicated to our investors.
so we focus on all the markets to balance out the portfolio.
naji baydoun -- ia securities -- analyst
and i guess, more broadly on your positioning in solar. when you think about transforming or transitioning your business, what does becoming a predominantly solar company mean to you? obviously, faster and shipper build-out of projects, let's say, versus hydro, taking on maybe earlier stage projects because the returns you're targeting. and also maybe you made a comment about not selling hydro assets. i guess, part of your funding strategy is also asset sales.
i mean, we should expect maybe more wind asset sales going forward relative to hydro and solar?
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
ok. again, i'll make a couple of comments. one just on sales and things like that we are entirely opportunistic. it doesn't mean we'll never sell hydro.
it doesn't mean we'll never sell solar. we're going to sell into markets that we think -- where we think we can sell at a value that goes beyond what we could create being an owner. in terms of transitioning the business, really, we've already transitioned the business. i think five years ago we started to, maybe seven years ago we really started to focus on building out the operating depth that you need for both wind and solar, hiring people with strong expertise in those areas, taking some of our most well-seasoned engineers and making sure that we had a good handle on the technical issues around those technologies.
and then, really bringing a lot of our knowledge from hydro operations to bear into wind and solar. and what i would say is today we have over 3,000 megawatts of solar. if all we did was solar that would be a pretty large business in its own right? similarly, wind we have almost 5,000 megawatts of wind. if all we did was that that would be a very sizable business in its own right.
so we've already transitioned and our operations have very, very significant depth. the amount of experience we have in these technologies with our people is very strong. and therefore, we feel very comfortable growing each of those lines of business without the need to hire or build out a certain type of capability.
naji baydoun -- ia securities -- analyst
ok, that's great. thank you. maybe just a final question for wyatt. you've been drawing down your interest expense or your financing costs lower and lower.
just wondering how much more run rate savings do you think you have there or that you're targeting going forward maybe more refinancing in terp or other initiatives that you want to conclude over the near-term?
wyatt hartley -- managing partner and chief financial officer
yes. what i'd say is we're constantly looking to optimize our cost of borrowing. we are also focused on fixed rate bonds. so the vast majority of our borrowing in place is fixed rate.
so the opportunity to refinance that. there may be opportunities here and there but because of the make hold that would be factored in it's not something that we would do in broad scale. but in terms of the maturities over the next three to five years, we're actively looking to push those out and get duration across our portfolio. and as a result, we would benefit from lowering our borrowing costs.
so we'll continue to see that as a benefit to our business but i don't want to position it as a sizable drop in our financing costs because of the fixed rate debt we have in place.
naji baydoun -- ia securities -- analyst
ok, thank you.
operator
thank you. and i'm showing no further questions at this time. i would now like to turn the call back to ceo sachin shah for closing remarks.
sachin shah -- chief executive officer
thank you, everyone. we appreciate your ongoing support and your interest in the business. we look forward to giving you an update next quarter. thank you.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the bep fourth-quarter 2020 results conference call and webcast. [operator instructions] i'd now like to hand the conference over to your host today, mr. connor teskey, chief executive officer. please go ahead.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
thank you, operator. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth-quarter 2020 conference call. before we begin, we would like to remind you that a copy of our news release, investor supplement and letter to unitholders can be found on our website. we would also like to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements on this call.
these statements are subject to known and unknown risks, and our future results may differ materially. for more information, you are encouraged to review our regulatory filings available on sedar, edgar and our website. to kick off today's call, we would like to provide an outlook on our business and an update on our recent growth initiatives. afterwards, wyatt will provide an overview of our operating results, balance sheet and funding plan as well as an esg update.
following our remarks, we look forward to taking your questions and comments. 2020 was another year of significant growth for brookfield renewable. despite the economic challenges around the world, we delivered record results and continued to broaden our operations as we look forward to a multi-decade opportunity to advance decarbonization and assist with the transition of global electricity grids to a more sustainable future. advancing the transition to a lower-carbon future will require substantial capital, in excess of $100 trillion over the next three decades.
it will also require significant operating expertise. over 70% of the world's carbon emissions can be traced directly or indirectly back to power generation and the energy sector. this will translate into even greater build-out of renewables and in various regions, a substantial conversion of carbon-intensive industries to cleaner and more sustainable methods of production. our size, scale across multiple technologies and depth of operating and development expertise continues to be a meaningful differentiator in sourcing growth opportunities.
in 2020 alone, we invested nearly $4.6 billion of equity across various transactions. we will now spend the next few minutes going through a few key highlights for the fourth quarter. in the united states, we continue to build the largest distributed generation business in the country, with over 2,000 megawatts of operating and development solar. this business helps commercial and industrial customers procure renewable power that is produced directly on site, decarbonizing their own businesses by reducing their consumption from fossil fuel based generation.
in canada, we invested in a large power producer, looking to reduce its carbon emissions in order to meet federal carbon targets. further, we also partnered with a utility to pursue green hydrogen opportunities, leveraging our existing fleet of operating hydro projects. in europe, we are building new wind farms backed by long-term contracts with both leading global technology companies who are looking to support an increasing carbon-free electricity requirement for their green data centers as well as global energy companies that are looking to transition their businesses. we are also investing in offshore wind development and scale.
lastly, in brazil, we started construction on one of the largest greenfield solar projects in the world. this solar park will total 1,200 megawatts once completed and will sell power to commercial customers as well as utilities in the country. in the quarter, we also increased the size of our global development pipeline to approximately 23,000 megawatts. development remains a core competitive advantage of ours, extending across solar, wind, hydro and distributed generation and storage in every market we operate in.
while we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us, we remain focused on delivering strong shareholder results. we are pleased that over the last 20 years, we have generated an annualized 20% per share compounded total return, while maintaining a very strong balance sheet and a robust liquidity position. equally as important, we continue to be a leader in accelerating decarbonization globally, and our total portfolio of approximately 42,000 megawatts of operating and under development assets, once completed, will help avoid approximately 56 million tons of co2 emissions or the equivalent of planting almost 1 billion trees. next, we want to spend a few minutes walking through three recent transactions.
first, in december, we agreed to acquire exelon generation company's u.s. distributed generation business, comprising of 360 megawatts of operating generation across nearly 600 sites, with an additional over 700 megawatts of under development projects for $810 million. in 2017, we took our first step into distributed generation after having identified a significant opportunity to build a high-quality scale business in a highly fragmented and rapidly growing market. since then, through both acquisitions and organic initiatives, we've expanded the business as demand for on-site generation continue to grow, as both cost declines in solar technology and the decarbonization ambitions of commercial and industrial clients accelerated.
with this acquisition, we will own one of the leading dg businesses in the united states with deep operating, development and origination capabilities and a 2,000 megawatt portfolio that generates high-quality contracted cash flows that are diversified by geography and customer. this investment represents the continuation of this strategy and furthers our goal of offering corporates and institutions a one-stop solution for both on and off-site energy generation, storage and procurement and energy efficiency services to help them achieve their decarbonization goals and transition to a more sustainable future. secondly, and also in december, we agreed to acquire the shepherds flat wind farm, an 845-megawatt fully contracted wind generation facility located in oregon for $700 million. the project which is fully contracted with a high-quality off taker, is one of the largest onshore wind projects in the united states and includes an attractive repowering opportunity that we expect to deliver by the end of 2022.
this repowering opportunity is one of the largest in the world and is expected to increase total generation by approximately 25%, increasing the clean energy produced by approximately 400 gigawatt hours annually. having the expertise to undertake a project of this size showcases our decades of experience in driving operational efficiencies, while generating attractive returns. the third transaction to highlight was that we also continued to use our differentiated operating and commercial capabilities to acquire ready-to-build development assets in brazil at premium returns. in december, we agreed to acquire a 270-megawatt late-stage development wind project, including an option over a further 200-megawatt expansion.
ahead of construction, we intend to leverage our energy marketing capabilities to contract the project, which is located in one of the highest wind regions in the country. our relationships with global turbine manufacturers as one of the largest acquirers globally should enable us to outperform on equipment procurement, installation and operating costs. with this latest addition, in the last 18 months, we have acquired a collection of projects that, once constructed, will represent a combined portfolio of over 2,000 megawatts of long term, recently built contracted wind and solar assets more than doubling our renewable energy capacity in the country. in conclusion, we'd like to finish by summarizing our activities in 2020.
we advanced key commercial priorities, including delivering on almost four -- sorry, including delivering on almost $40 million of cost-saving initiatives, securing contracts to deliver 3,500 gigawatt hours of clean energy annually, which has the equivalent carbon avoidance of planning almost 30 million trees. and we also signed a number of strategic contracts with key corporate offtakers. also in 2020, we completed the merger of terraform power, both increasing and consolidating our activities in north america and europe. during the year, we commissioned approximately 460 megawatts of new capacity and progressed almost 4,200 megawatts through construction and advanced stage permitting.
and we also broadened our investor base with the creation of bepc and through the addition to several u.s. and global indices. given our strong outlook and financial position, we are pleased to announce a 5% increase to our distribution to $1.22 per unit on an annualized basis. with that, we will now turn the call over to wyatt to discuss our operating results and financial position. 
wyatt hartley -- managing partner and chief financial officer
thank you, connor. in 2020, we generated ffo of $807 million, a 6% increase from prior year as the business benefited from recent acquisitions, strong underlying asset availability and execution on organic growth initiatives. on a normalized basis, our per unit results are up 23%. turning to our segment results.
during the year, our hydroelectric segment delivered ffo of $662 million. although we experienced some drier conditions across our fleet, particularly in regions with higher value contracts, overall generation for the year was in line with long-term average and our reservoirs are well positioned for a strong first quarter, which underscores the benefit of our diverse portfolio. next, our wind and solar segments continue to generate stable revenues and benefit from the diversification of our fleet and highly contracted cash flows with long duration power purchase agreements. these segments generated a combined $376 million of ffo, representing a 51% increase over the prior year as we benefited from contributions from acquisitions and approximately 440 megawatts of solar and wind projects commissioned during the year.
our energy transition segment generated $103 million of ffo as our portfolio continues to help commercial and industrial partners achieve their decarbonization goals and provides critical grid stabilizing ancillary services and backup capacity required to address the increasing intermittency of greener electric grids. for example, our first hydro storage portfolio in the u.k. achieved five of its highest revenue days ever in the last couple of months as we sold essential stabilizing services to the u.k. power grid in response to high demand from cold weather and low wind and solar generation levels.
across our portfolio, we continue to focus on partnering with a broad range of customers in their decarbonization efforts. during the year, we executed agreements to supply 100% renewable energy to one of the first planned industrial scale green hydrogen production plants in north america with plug power and over 90% of j.p. morgan's real estate operations in new york state. in south america, our focus continues to be on extending the average duration of our power purchase agreement, which stand at eight years in brazil and three years in colombia.
we signed two long-term inflation-linked power purchase agreements for our recently acquired solar development projects in brazil, substantially contracting these assets. in recent months, many governments in our target markets have outlined new policies to address climate change. in north america, where the majority of our hydro fleet is located, governments are increasingly considering potential carbon pricing mechanisms for which our business is uniquely positioned to benefit. as examples, the current u.s.
administration has reestablished a working group that is expected to increase the social cost of carbon to more than $50 per ton. and in canada, a carbon tax has been set at $30 per ton for 2020 and is set to increase almost 6x to $170 by 2030. carbon taxes or carbon pricing provide long-term support for growing wind and solar capacity, which also increases the value of our hydroelectric power facilities due to their dispatchable nature and the grid stabilizing services they can provide. while we always prioritize contracted generation for our perpetual electric facilities we always look to ensure we retain upside optionality for when we believe prices will improve.
across our hydroelectric fleet in north america, we have contracts rolling off for assets that are -- that primarily deliver power to highly liquid markets in the u.s. northeast. fortunately, these contracts, on a net basis, deliver power at prices in the range of the current market. therefore, on renewal, we expect minimal impact to our overall revenue, while retaining meaningful potential upside, should prices see future support from carbon pricing mechanisms.
we also continue to advance our global development activities, including progressing almost 2,800 megawatts of construction, diversified across distributed and utility scale solar, wind, storage and hydro in over 11 different countries. we are also progressing almost 1,400 megawatts of advanced stage projects through final permitting and contracting. in total, we expect these projects to contribute approximately $110 million in ffo on a run rate basis when completed. we also continue to maintain a robust financial position.
we have approximately $3.3 billion of total available liquidity, and our investment-grade balance sheet has no material maturities over the next five years, and almost 85% of our financings are non-recourse to brookfield renewable. during 2020, we continue to take advantage of the low interest rate environment and executed on almost $3.5 billion of investment-grade financing, extending our average corporate debt maturity to 14 years and reducing our borrowing costs by $5 million per year. we continue to advance our green financing strategy to benefit from growing demand for green securities and diversifying our investor base. turning to esg.
operating in a business with strong esg principles is simply the right thing to do. and we have always believed that strong esg practices drive long-term value to our business and create high barriers to entry. inherent in our position as one of the largest publicly traded renewable energy companies is the understanding that climate change possesses a serious threat to communities, businesses and ecosystems around the world. we have established ourselves as one of the preeminent renewable franchises and are playing a critical role in addressing climate change and reducing carbon across the world by shifting power generation, which accounts for more than 70% of global carbon emissions to a sustainable pathway for the future.
to demonstrate our commitment, we were proud to announce in our second esg report which was published today, our ambition to double our avoided carbon emissions by 2030. to summarize, with our scale, track record and global capabilities, we are well situated to partner with governments and businesses to help them achieve their goal of greening the global electricity grids. we believe the prospects for the growth of our business are better than they have ever been and we look forward to further opportunities to provide capital and solutions to drive decarbonization. that concludes our formal remarks for today's call.
thank you for joining us this morning. with that, i'll pass it back to our operator for questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of rob hope with scotiabank.
rob hope -- scotiabank -- analyst
good morning, everyone. first question is just on repowering. we're seeing a number of projects in the hopper right now for repowering. and when we take a look at shepherd, it would seem that this could be the driving force of the m&a opportunity there.
can you just talk about how you're viewing repowering? do they have to be the older turbines with around 10 years left of contract? and could this provide you an advantage when you're looking at, we'll call it, mid-life wind assets in north america.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
thanks, rob. the way we look at repowering is, it's really the halfway house between an operating asset and a development asset. and it's that development component that allows us to differentiate ourselves. and when you look at a project like shepherds flat, the scale of the repowering opportunity is something that we feel that very few other operators around the world could take on.
it requires significant operating expertise, it requires a very deep relation with the turbine supplier providing the new technology. and it also requires a strong understanding of that power market because at the same time, you're extending the life of the project you're repowering. to answer your question specifically, every situation is a little bit different. depending on the wind resource in the region, the technology you're replacing and what you're replacing it with, along with, as you mentioned, the remaining contracted life of the project that you are repowering, there's always going to be different dynamics.
but the punchline we'd want to leave everyone with is, this is going to be a tremendous growth area in any developed renewables market around the world. and that's really a byproduct of two things: one, technology has come so far in the last five to 10 to 15 years that older projects can be built with significant improvements in production; and two, the demand for that -- that increased clean power generation is simply accelerating, whether it be utility offtakes or corporate offtakes. so we see this as a major growth area and one that we'll look to pursue in all of our major developed markets.
rob hope -- scotiabank -- analyst
all right. i appreciate the color there. and then switching over across the ocean. can you give us an update on kind of the poland opportunity there and kind of the timing you expect? and we have seen some kind of competing projects announced there as well.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. so rob, we have a live tender in the market. so it's probably not prudent for us to comment on the tender itself. the tender is due on february 17, and we will have the results of our offer at that point.
we spoke about on our last call that we view it as an attractive market that has growth opportunities, but needs investors with very significant scale, access the capital and operating capabilities in order to build out the growth opportunities that are available in that country. since we launched our tender, other foreign investors have also seen the opportunity, and we're seeing more activity in that market, but we'll wait till february 17 to comment on our tender.
rob hope -- scotiabank -- analyst
all right. appreciate the color. thank you.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
sure.
operator
our next question comes sean steuart with td securities.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
thanks. good morning. a couple of questions. just following up on shepherds flat.
how should we think about the costs for that repowering opportunity, dollar per megawatt? and and how do you guys think that type of opportunity fits on your total return spectrum when you highlight the range you gave for irr across m&a or development opportunities?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
sure. so with redevelopment, and i'll tie back to the comments from the previous question, it's halfway between an operating asset and a development opportunity. with shepherds flat, the fantastic thing about this opportunity is the project itself will never stop producing. it will remain operational the whole time through the redevelopment process -- or sorry, through the repowering process, that will take place over the next 18 months.
and as a result, we do not foresee the need to inject future equity into the project. the repowering will be funded through financing and ongoing cash flow. in terms of the cost of the repowering, we aren't -- there is no need to rebuild the entire wind turbine. what we're doing is we're installing enhanced technologies, largely, near the top of the wind turbine.
and therefore, as a rough metric, you can think of the cost of repowering as being somewhere between a third and a half of a new build construction cost. in terms of returns, pretty down the fairway, partway between our operating targets and our development targets. so we expect this to be a low to mid-teens type return, which we think is a fantastic outcome, given the contracted nature of the project and the core geography of the united states.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
thanks for that, connor. wyatt, i have a question for you. in the proportionate breakdown for the quarter, brazil hydro and solar ebitda were above revenues for the quarter on a proportionate basis. and i gather some of that's probably the balancing pool in brazil, but any other context you can give on that discrepancy this quarter?
wyatt hartley -- managing partner and chief financial officer
yeah. so in each case, we would have received -- we would have recorded other income that would have increased that ebitda above the revenue. in the case of brazil hydro, what occurred is we had, in 2015, we had filed a claim, and this was a collective claim that generators across the country had filed where there -- we are challenging the way we were being allocated our generation under the central pooling mechanism in brazil, and we were successful in obtaining a positive resolution in that case. and so it resulted in a effectively a onetime catch-up of value for lost revenues over prior periods.
so that was the impact in brazil hydro. and then on the solar side, at x-elio, just given the nature of that business where there is a lot more capital recycling, building new assets and flipping them at lower returns than what we built and driving accretion that way. we do -- given a core part of that business in terms of how it creates value, is that kind of value arbitrage. we are recognizing the gains from sale of those activities through our other income.
and so there were some of those recognized in the quarter.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
ok. thanks. i'll get back in the queue.
operator
our next question comes from mark jarvi with cibc capital markets.
mark jarvi -- cibc -- capital markets
thanks. good morning, everyone. just wanted to go on to the comments around carbon tax potentially coming in the u.s. and i guess a couple of questions would be, just based on your comments around where you can clear power in the spot market versus where you're on your prior contracts.
are you implying that you'll probably sit a little bit higher uncontracted generation until you see how this plays out?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
hi, mark. so we obviously focus on maintaining a very strong contracted profile across our fleet of assets. but what we always like to do, especially with our perpetual assets, our hydros, is maintain the optionality in the back end. if we think there is a strong likelihood of higher power prices in the future.
wyatt was referencing in his comments is, while we do have some shorter-term contracts in that region rolling off, they're rolling off at net revenues that are very in line with current power prices. and therefore, if we were simply to recontract at current market levels, we would see very little impact on our financials. but with increasing potential power price support from carbon mechanisms, whether it be taxes or carbon prices, we will look actively to retain that upside optionality in the future, in particular, with our perpetual assets being our hydros that are located in two of the core markets where carbon taxes are being considered.
wyatt hartley -- managing partner and chief financial officer
yeah. mark, the only thing i would add is, right here, is that, for sure, we're aiming to be contracted. and so i don't think it should be interpreted that we will reduce our percentage of our portfolio that's contracted. but unless we're seeing long-term values on power prices, we'll focus on, say, a five year contract versus a 20.
so it doesn't change our perspective on being contracted. it just means that the duration that we're looking for, unless we see real value kind of for that long duration price that appropriately compensates us for that long duration upside.
mark jarvi -- cibc -- capital markets
ok. that makes sense. and then just one more in that area. so new york, the governor cuomo came out and said that they would be looking at contract with wind and hydro put into service before 2015.
i suspect, obviously, some of your assets would qualify for that. is that something that you guys will be actively involved in. and again, in the context, would you like that long term contract? or you rather just kind of continue to be looking sort of five year contracts you just spoke about and preserve that optionality?
wyatt hartley -- managing partner and chief financial officer
so mark, when it comes to developing new assets and pulling new wind and solar projects out of the ground, we do really like to back that new council investment with a long-term contract that will ensure that we'll get both our targeted return -- will get both our return of capital and our targeted return on capital. so whether it be in the united states, california, new york or whether it be what we're seeing in our business in europe. we are increasingly pulling new assets out of the ground, either backed by long-term contracts with governments, as you mentioned, like in new york state, or increasingly from technology companies that are trying to service an ever-increasing green energy requirement for their green data centers. and for energy companies that are looking to transition their business.
but to answer your question directly, when we are investing new capital in new projects to pull them out of the ground, we do like to focus on a longer-term contract to ensure we get that return of and targeted return on capital.
mark jarvi -- cibc -- capital markets
i think there was an opportunity to take existing assets and try to contract them just given the ambitious targets in new york state. so is that something that you would be comfortable with, in terms of locking in on a longer-term contract for some of your hydro assets? or would you rather keep that mentality of a shorter duration contract and preserve a bit more freedom around optionality on carbon pricing?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
we'll look at it on a case-by-case basis. it's certainly something we would consider, and we will look to manage our contract profile appropriately. but part of the joy of our business is our embedded commercial capability and our power marketing capability, where other operators may see the government's comments in that state and now have a sole way of contracting their power. we have the optionality to compare that versus a corporate contract with a tech or an energy or an industrial company and do the one that offers us the best value upside.
so we wouldn't want to necessarily commit to doing those contracts or not doing those contracts. we'll look at it versus the other commercial power marketing opportunities we have within that region.
mark jarvi -- cibc -- capital markets
ok. and my last question is just on the distributed generation business. as you're starting to build scale, if you close the excellent transaction and you've done some other deals. just wondering, if we look forward a year from now, what would be the target in terms of the development opportunity sort of on an annual basis and sort of the blue sky scenario, what do you think about that business, where does that kind of take over time and sort of the go-to-market strategy in terms of -- is it -- i guess, like the origination strategy in terms of how you expect to kind of grow that business on an organic basis?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
sure. so there's a few different things to unpack there. our strategy hasn't changed. we look to buy for value and then we grow through operations.
when we look at distributed generation, our strategy hasn't changed in the three and a half to four years that we've been investing in this space. we view it as having three or four of some of the strongest market themes supporting this business, which are increased focus on decentralized power, declining solar costs and distributed generation really being one of the best examples of how corporates and industrials are looking to decarbonize their own production processes. really, what it is, is we're building on-site clean power generation that they can draw to power their business without needing to pull from a typically thermal supported central grid. this is a platform that we own, that is probably one of the ones that has the most exciting growth prospects.
and it has growth prospects both in terms of the products it can offer, but as well as simply delivering more size in its core strategies. we expect to develop hundreds of megawatts, a year, of new dg business -- or new dg assets across the united states. we equally will look to continue to do acquisition roll-ups. but perhaps the most exciting thing is what distributed generation does is it gives us an interface with a commercial and industrial customer that is looking to decarbonize their business.
and while our primary product is that provision of on-site clean power, it gives us the opportunity to sell them storage, to sell them energy efficiencies and a number of other products that can help that business achieve its decarbonization goals. and as a result, we don't think it's only an increase of existing revenue streams that will drive this business. but an increase in existing revenue streams and continuously adding new revenue streams as corporate and industrials get a little bit more advanced in their thinking of how they're going to hit their 2030 and 2050 targets.
mark jarvi -- cibc -- capital markets
great. thanks a lot connor. appreciate it.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer

our next question comes from rupert merer with national bank financial.
rupert merer -- national bank financials -- analyst
good morning, gentlemen.
wyatt hartley -- managing partner and chief financial officer
good morning.
rupert merer -- national bank financials -- analyst
so a follow-up on the organic growth of wind in the u.s. can you talk about your tax equity strategy? do you have an appetite for tax equity or you're looking to work with tax equity partners? and how will you account for tax equity?
wyatt hartley -- managing partner and chief financial officer
yeah. look, rupert, for sure, we have an appetite for tax equity with the tax credits that are available in the u.s. it provides a really effective source of capital that reduces the overall cost of capital in the project and it just optimizes our structure. going back to connor's point earlier about shepherds flat, is one of the great things about shepherds flat is we can effectively complete the repowering, which is going to give us 25% to 30% of incremental generation, and we can fund that entirely with investment-grade debt because of the incremental yield you're getting off of it in the incremental revenue or tax equity because of the tax credits that are available.
and so all of that incremental -- we get all that incremental cash flow with no new capital required from us, which is a great thing. so for us, tax equity, it will be -- where it is applicable it will continue to be a way we think about optimizing the capital structure. in terms of the way it's accounted for it's just like any other liability. it's on our balance sheet.
it's factored into our maturity profile. and so it shouldn't be thought of as any different really outside of the nuance of how it earns it's return.
rupert merer -- national bank financials -- analyst
so would that be showing up in your ebitda line, if you're selling your tax equity to a partner?
wyatt hartley -- managing partner and chief financial officer
no, it won't be going through -- so there are certain companies in the space who recognize the ebitda of the tax credit and then -- the show that as a reduction below ebitda. we don't show it that way. so we kind of just look through the tax credit and really just factor in the cash impact of the tax equity on our business.
rupert merer -- national bank financials -- analyst
all right. great. and then secondly, a very high-level question here. last year, you invested $2.5 billion in growth initiatives.
i believe, historically, you've talked about targeting about $1 billion of investment per year. can you discuss your goals for investment in 2021? how it might be split between organic growth and m&a? and then also what we might anticipate in capital recycling to support that growth?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
sure. to put it very simply, our pipeline is as strong today as we've ever seen it before. we have the benefit of a massively growing renewables industry as more wind and solar is being added in every market around the world. we've got increasing opportunities to be a solutions provider to corporates and industrials and utilities that are looking to decarbonize.
and at every opportunity, we're finding new ways to leverage our competitive advantages, our size, our scale, our operating and technical capabilities across new types of transactions. we mentioned earlier in the call, the growth potential we see in repowering. well, that's only going to accelerate, going forward, given that the installed base of wind and solar did nothing but increase over the last 15 years. and therefore, on a lag basis, the repowering opportunities are going to increase over the next 15 years.
similarly, we're seeing growth in new asset classes that leverage renewable power and decarbonization solutions, whether it be green hydrogen or green data centers. and you can see through some of our contracting activities as well as some of the partnerships we've formed in the last six months. these are areas where we expect to be a significant player going forward. so while we aren't going to commit to a dollar amount here on this call, the growth opportunities we see today are bigger than they've ever been before.
and we have the benefit of a very strong balance sheet that allows us to pursue as many of those attractive growth opportunities as we can find. i think the second part of your question was around organic growth versus m&a. and if you looked at our business, maybe five or seven or 10 years ago, we've always done development, but it was maybe 90% m&a and 10% development. over the last three to five years, we've really enhanced our development capabilities in every one of our target markets around the world.
we now have local, fully integrated development capabilities across all major technologies in every one of our target markets. and what this does is, it really just gives us a flexibility in how we pursue growth. we're always going to pursue those m&a targets. but they are large and, by their nature, chunky.
but what the organic growth lever that has been consistently growing inside our business allows us to do is just have a constant pipeline of projects where we can invest capital at very attractive returns and pull-through those projects as quickly or as timely as we want to. and well, five to 10 years ago, we may have been 90% m&a and 10% development. i think, going forward, that portion is going to increase, but increase slightly. it might be 80-20 or 85-15 but it is an additional growth lever that gives us added flexibility as we look to grow our business.
the last comment i think you touched on, and apologies if i've missed anything, was capital recycling. and capital recycling is very core to our business and something that we have been doing for a number of years now, we were very active in 2020, and we expect to be active again in 2021. one question we often get is with the flood of capital flowing into renewables and esg strategies. is that having an impact on your return targets? are you having to compress returns? and the answer is absolutely not.
we've never competed on cost of capital. we've looked for those opportunities where we can differentiate ourselves using something other than cost of capital. and therefore, we've never compromised on our return targets. that hasn't changed today.
and with the pipeline we see, we see no need to compromise on our long-term return targets. but what the flood of capital into renewables has done is, it's created a new value lever for our business when it comes to capital recycling. increasingly, when we've executed our business plan, and we're in a position to sell an operating, derisked, likely contracted asset that we have cleaned up and simplified through our ownership, we are seeing offers from that increasing amount of renewables capital that far exceed the value that we believe the business has, if we're going to hold it within our own platform. and therefore, we do think we will use capital recycling to fund the tremendous growth we see.
but we actually see it as an incremental value lever because we're only going to pursue capital recycling in situations where we're selling assets at a greater value than we see in holding them in our own portfolio.
rupert merer -- national bank financials -- analyst
great. thanks for the color.
operator
our next question comes from ben pham with bmo.
ben pham -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok, thanks. good morning, everybody. i had a couple of questions on the 23-gigawatt development pipeline. i was wondering if you can unpackage that a bit.
you did at -- similar to investors day in terms of the -- toward the technology mix, what geographies and maybe the breakdown between early stage and late stage.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
yeah. sure. so maybe i'll start, ben, and then i'll hand to wyatt. the growth in our development pipeline is really being driven by two things.
one, it is the fact that we have built our development capabilities in every market that we operate in around the world. and therefore, we are just far more comfortable in seeing far more opportunities to leverage that enhanced capability. and you're seeing that flow through in the growth in our development pipeline. maybe just as an indicative anecdote, we mentioned three transactions in -- that we completed in q4.
shepherds flat, which -- the excitement of the opportunity is primarily around the repowering opportunity also comes with a 400-megawatt development pipeline. the exelon dg business has a large in place operating portfolio, but also comes with a 700-megawatt development pipeline. and similarly, our transaction in brazil is a close to 500-megawatt development opportunity. so what we are seeing is increasingly an ability to differentiate ourselves by pursuing those transactions that have, both really strong downside protection because of the in-place cash flows from the existing operating business, but a nice upside value growth lever through an embedded development option as well.
with that, maybe i'll pass to wyatt on the breakdown.
wyatt hartley -- managing partner and chief financial officer
yeah. so ben, in terms of the 20-gigawatts, what i would say is, it's diversified across regions. similar to our business, it's across all of the regions. it is -- we're 75% right now in developed markets as an overall business, 25% emerging markets.
the development pipeline can be thought of similarly in terms of breakdown between those two markets. and then in terms of technology, it is -- the most abundant are wind and solar. solar on the back of our investment in x-elio and just the development pipeline we have there, off of the distributed generation businesses we're pursuing in the u.s. as well as in china in some degree.
and on the wind side, as connor mentioned, we have very attractive wind pipeline in the u.s. we added to that with the acquisition of shepherds flat. so it is definitely going to be tilted toward wind and solar because those are the technologies that are being in the -- renewable space that are being developed in the most significant form. and so that's reflected in our development pipeline, but it is diversified across the various technologies we look at.
and i think just further breaking that down, out of the 23 gigawatt, as i mentioned in my remarks, close to 5 gigawatts of that is either under construction or is in advanced stage where we're kind of in the final period -- final point of, again in permits or contracting or what have you. and then obviously, the remaining 18 gigawatt has a bit farther to go, but we're very confident that a good portion of that will be developed over the foreseeable future.
ben pham -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok, thanks for that. and is there -- you're a relatively large company. as you bring on more development, there's a development expense that's rising as well. but really, what's -- is there a sweet spot on -- or maybe how much more you can go before there are certain stresses in your system that you can't handle? is there a magic number out there you can share?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
not really. what we would say is the joy of our scale is we get tremendous operating leverage out of the expertise we have across the platform. so within our business, we have experts in every geography and every asset class. and while those experts are located all over the world, we're able to draw on that expertise whenever we're pursuing growth in any of our target regions.
so as our business grows, our costs will grow as well. but we expect there to be significant operating leverage in that growth. so we see it as an upside going forward.
ben pham -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. and maybe one last question is, how do you think about your cost of equity, top of today, relative to other sources. and i want you to bring it up because i think in the past, you've always kind of ignored the market cost of equity, you've always looked at, i think, you targeted growth rates, which are north of 10%, and you've always said your cost of equity, your hurdle rates are 10% plus. and if you look at that versus better sources and you include a matching fee to ban in that analysis.
so how do you think about that now, just given your stock has done incredibly well, but at the same time, your management fees have also doubled at the same time?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
sure. so our approach is consistent. we have and always will be value investors. and tying back to the comments from a previous question, the growth pipeline today is tremendous.
and continuing to leverage the same capabilities and the same competitive advantages that we've had for years and decades. we see no reason that we would need to change our targeted returns, and we have a very robust pipeline that we think we can execute on in those targeted returns range. so there is very little appetite internally, given the growth that we see and the attractive opportunities ahead of us, we don't really see ourselves changing our return targets. now that being said, our share price is performing well.
and all that does is it does give us an incremental flexibility when we think about funding and growing our business. we've always looked to maintain a number of funding sources as we look to fund the massive growth opportunity ahead of us. and the performance of our share price can be helpful there. but we're never going to use it, unless it's going to create long-term value for our shareholders.
ben pham -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok, thanks guys.
operator
our next question comes from andrew kuske with credit suisse.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks. good morning. i think the question is for connor. and i guess over the last 10 years or so, we've all become pretty comfortable with the interplay with brookfield asset management's private funds and the business that they run and the interplay with bep.
could you maybe provide some color and an outlook on how bam's impact fund category may work with bep's business into the future?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. so brookfield is looking to launch an impact fund that will focus on the transition of the global economy to net 0. and a component of that fund will be focused on the build-out of new renewables globally as well as the operations surrounding investment by businesses to accelerate that transition to carbon neutrality. we think there's many companies that will have the capital and skills to do this themselves, but equally, there are a huge portfolio of companies that could use our expertise and our capital and our development capabilities to help them achieve their goals.
our view is this launch of a new fund by brookfield, creates just an additional growth opportunity and an additional equity deployment opportunity for brookfield renewable to participate in investments that fit brookfield renewable's strategy of growth in renewables and offering decarbonization solutions. so we view it as an incremental growth lever and incremental upside.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then maybe just an extension on that. can you give some color just on what you're seeing from corporate -- the corporate community and primarily that has been interested in engaging in the longer-term contracts? are you getting some of the tech companies and others that are actually are more interested in owning the underlying assets to -- on possibly a co-investment basis with yourselves?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
it's a really good question. and we will answer it directly, but perhaps some background context is helpful here. if you go back 10 years, it was really governments that were the preeminent force in trying to drive climate change. and then maybe four to seven years ago, a handful of leading corporates set voluntary decarbonization initiatives.
over the last two to four years, you're seeing investors be more discerning about their capital, allocating it to sustainable strategies. and now in the last 12 to 18 months, you're seeing banks and lenders do the same in being more subjective in terms of where they allocate their loan book. all of this can be viewed on a transition as there is an acceleration in the commitment by all stakeholders to decarbonization. and what we've seen over that time period is the demands of corporate and industrial customers that are looking to procure green power change over time.
and andrew, rather than say it's a trend one way or the other, what we would rather say is there is simply more types of contracts being executed in the market. some corporates are looking for shorter term contracts, some corporates are looking for longer-term contracts. some corporates are happy to take the intermittent power that comes from a wind or solar facility. others are looking for unique situations where they can procure 24/7 renewable power that few can provide, but we're in a luxurious position to be able to do by matching our wind and solar generation with our hydro portfolio.
we are increasingly seeing situations where some of those corporates are considering different ownership structures of the underlying assets, but by and large, we would say the theme hasn't shifted. if you're talking to an industrial company or a corporate company or a tech company, they want to focus on what their business is, they are good at. which is providing a good or service that is core to their, call it, business objective. in most cases, they are very happy for us to be the capital provider and the owner and operator of whatever power production or generation or decarbonization solution is required to decarbonize their core business.
there may be some flexibility on the edges of that. but more often than not, they're still very comfortable and prefer for us to own that asset, which is core to our business, and they keep their focus on what's core to their business.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
that's great. thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from pearce hammond with simmons energy.
pearce hammond -- simmons energy -- analyst
good morning and thanks for taking my question. and i know you kind of addressed this earlier, with a question, as it related to project returns and were they changing. but i am curious, given the surge in interest and capital wanting to get deployed into wind and solar projects. are you seeing any inflationary pressures at the project level as far as getting wind and solar projects installed, for example, like trucking cost to deliver the turbine to the site or electricians or skill personnel working on the site? or maybe put it another way, are you seeing the expected cost deflation for wind and solar moderating relative to expectations you may have had, say, a year ago? thank you.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
pearce, thank you. it's a great question. and in general, no and really two things driving that. yes, there is more demand for these products and services, and that can lead to very, call it, regional and short-term shortages or that may temporarily increase prices.
but they're de minimis and don't really affect our business. there's two probably broader themes that are still at play that overwhelm any of that short-term disruption. one is the overall cost of wind and solar continue to decline. and that is, as the industry grows, there's still economies of scale being achieved.
there are still incremental technology improvements that are driving costs down. and really cementing renewables as the lowest cost form of energy production. that trend may have plateaued versus the rapid declines of three, five or seven years ago. but the trend is still certainly downward.
the second point we would make is, at brookfield renewable, our growth which we've spoken about at length on this call, is continuing to deliver a further competitive advantage, which is, we are developing and achieving very significant economies of scale when it comes to procuring parts or services to build, construct, developed or even simply operate our renewables facilities around the world. and we, across all major technologies, are one of the biggest buyers in the world. and as a result, we are largely insulated by any of those short-term disruptions because we are viewed as a core customer to the biggest suppliers, whether it be of equipment or services within the renewable sector.
pearce hammond -- simmons energy -- analyst
that's very helpful answer. thank you very much.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the bep first-quarter 2021 results conference call and webcast. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] it is now my pleasure to introduce ceo connor teskey.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
thank you, operator. and good morning, everyone. and thank you for joining us for our first-quarter 2021 conference call. before we begin, we would like to remind you that a copy of our news release, investor supplement, and letter to unitholders can be found on our website.
we would also like to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements on this call. these statements are subject to known and unknown risks, and our future results may differ materially. for more information, you are encouraged to review our regulatory filings available on sedar, edgar, and on our website. to kick off today's call, i will first provide an outlook on the business and an update on our recent growth initiatives.
then, wyatt will provide an overview of our operating results, as well as our balance sheet and funding plan. following our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions and comments. our business performed well in the quarter. we continued to focus on acquiring quality assets for value, enhancing cash flows through our operational capabilities and maintaining a strong balance sheet; all of this with the objective of delivering total returns to our investors of 12% to 15% growth on a per-unit basis over the long term.
the tailwinds for renewables are accelerating. governments and businesses around the world are intensifying their focus on decarbonization. with each passing quarter, governments are committing to greater emissions targets and business leaders are adopting plans to transition their businesses toward net-zero. over the past couple weeks, the united states, the e.u., canada and japan have each announced plans to reduce emissions by approximately half by 2030.
the u.k. announced plans to reduce emissions by almost 80% by 2035. these plans will require significant capital, as well as the operating expertise to build out and implement more efficient and sustainable solutions. as this occurs, growth opportunities are expected to increasingly favor investors who have global platforms and strong development capability.
this will position us to participate in the accelerating build-out of renewables. our power marketing expertise allows us to provide green power to businesses across all sectors of the economy. and further, due to our size and expertise across all major renewables technologies, we are increasingly seeing attractive large-scale opportunities to help businesses transition existing generation to cleaner forms of electricity production, as utilities and power producers begin a multi-decade decarbonization process. looking forward, we remain focused on participating in growth from both the continued build-out of wind and solar, as well as the increasing demand for decarbonization and energy transition solutions.
we will now go through a few of the key highlights for the quarter. we generated ffo of $242 million or $0.38 per unit, a 21% increase on a normalized per-unit basis over the same period in the prior year. we progressed approximately 6,000 megawatts through construction and advanced stage permitting and added nearly 4,500 megawatts to our development pipeline. we invested or agreed to invest $1.6 billion or nearly $410 million net to brookfield renewable, of equity across a range of transactions including onshore wind, offshore wind, utility scale solar and distributed generation in the united states, europe and india.
we also issued a $350 million perpetual green subordinated note at a fixed rate of four and five-eights, and our balance sheet remains robust with $3.4 billion of available liquidity and no meaningful near-term maturities. and finally, we raised over $850 million or approximately $410 million net to brookfield renewable from asset recycling initiatives, including the sale of mature onshore wind portfolios in ireland and the united states at attractive values, returning approximately two times our invested capital. next, we'd like to spend a few minutes walking through recent growth and corporate contracting initiatives. as the opportunity to invest in renewables and decarbonization expands, we continue to exercise a value-oriented approach to growing our business.
we remain disciplined in focusing on opportunities that play to our strengths, where we can invest for value, then leverage our operating capabilities to increase cash flow, as well as deploy incremental capital at attractive returns to grow our existing businesses over time. recently, we executed on a number of transactions that highlight this approach. for the past several years we have monitored the offshore wind sector while not investing. but as the technology has grown and matured, we have become more comfortable.
in this quarter, we closed our first investment in offshore wind. it included a pipeline to build 3 gigawatts of capacity supported by attractive contract structures over the next several years. similarly, in india, one of the largest and fastest-growing renewable markets globally, we have continued to grow our business following our initial investment in 2017. having expanded our capabilities in the region, we are now seeing a steady pipeline of opportunities to incrementally add to our platform at attractive returns.
recently, we signed or closed a few transactions we would like to highlight. the first is shepherds flat, which is an 845-megawatt wind farm in oregon that includes one of the largest repowering opportunities in the world. once completed, we expect total generation to increase by approximately 25%. we are making good progress on the repowering and are also advancing a 400-megawatt newbuild development project that was included as part of that transaction.
we also made an investment in polenergia, a scale renewable business in europe with an interest in a 3-gigawatt offshore wind development pipeline. we believe polenergia has tremendous growth prospects, and we are well-positioned as both a supportive operating partner and a capital provider to that business. further, we acquired exelon distributed generation, a dg business, comprising of 360 megawatts of operating capacity with an additional over 700 megawatts under development. we now own one of the leading dg businesses in the united states with deep operating, development and origination capabilities and an almost 2,000 megawatt portfolio that generates high-quality contracted cash flows that are diversified by both geography and by customer.
and lastly, on the back of a relationship established through our acquisition of a portfolio of loans from a nonbank financial company near the end of 2020, we signed an agreement, which gives us the right to acquire a 450 megawatt shovel-ready solar project from one of the largest developers in india. the project is expected to be commissioned by the end of the year and is backed by a 25-year power purchase agreement with a high-quality state utility. we expect to invest $70 million or $20 million net to brookfield renewable of equity in the project and are targeting 20%-plus return. looking ahead, we believe the global trends toward decarbonization will continue to accelerate and impact all industries.
this will lead to increased adoption of renewable technologies, the electrification of industry and transport and the conversion of carbon-intensive processes to cleaner methods of production. the dramatic increase in demand for green power has shifted industry dynamics in favor of businesses that can provide differentiated solutions and the ability to meet customers' large-scale 24/7 green power or unique load shaping requirements. our diversification across geographies and technologies, including baseload dispatchable power, positions us well to capitalize on this trend. further, our corporate contracting expertise allows us to acquire development projects that are not yet fully contracted at attractive returns with less competition.
we have the ability to then utilize our global contracting capabilities to source long-term contracts with high-quality counterparties, both enhancing and de-risking a project's future revenues and allowing us to generate attractive returns on our capital with strong downside protection. as a result, we are seeing an opportunity to accelerate the build-out of our 27,000 megawatt development pipeline. leveraging our deep customer relationships, we dispatch clean energy to over 700 creditworthy customers globally. in the last quarter, we signed 29 agreements for approximately 2,300 gigawatt hours of renewable generation with corporate off-takers across all major industries, including many of the largest counterparties by market capitalization in the world.
let us walk you through a few recent examples of our contracting activities. first, we leveraged our global platform and relationships with a number of leading global technology companies, including signing an agreement to support the development of almost 100 megawatts of solar capacity to power data centers in the u.s. northeast. we also signed agreements to provide green electricity to leading industrial companies and manufacturers, including a tailored solution for a large u.s.
manufacturer that bundles both a long-term ppa from a new build development with a zero-carbon retail agreement. in addition, we signed agreements to provide green electricity to several global energy players, including the super majors, as well as with a hydrogen company for their planned industrial scale green hydrogen production plant, the first of its kind in north america. we also signed ppas to provide global utilities with carbon-free generation, including with a spanish utility to support the build-out of 150 megawatts of solar capacity in that region. and finally, we signed an energy agreement with j.p.
morgan chase to supply clean renewable electricity to over 500 of their real estate operations in new york state from our hydroelectric facilities in the region. with that, i'll turn the call over to wyatt to discuss our operating results and financial position. 
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
thank you, connor. during the first quarter, we generated ffo of $242 million or $0.38 per unit, reflecting solid performance as our operations benefited from strong asset availability, growth and efficiency initiatives. on a normalized basis, our per unit results were up 21% year over year. with an increasingly diversified portfolio of operating assets, limited concentration risk with counterparties and a long-term contract profile, our cash flows are highly resilient.
while generation for the quarter was marginally below the long-term average, driven largely by drier conditions in new york, we expect this variability and therefore, manage our business for the long term. further, we are continuously diversifying the business. this increasingly mitigates exposure to any single resource, market or counterparty and our variability becomes less and less every year. during the quarter, our hydroelectric segment delivered ffo of $170 million.
across this portfolio, we continue to focus on securing contracts that value the uniqueness of our fleet as a generator of dispatchable, clean electricity and ancillary services. our wind and solar segments generated a combined $158 million of ffo. we continue to generate stable revenues from these assets and benefit from the diversification of our fleet and highly contracted cash flows with long duration power purchase agreements. there was severe winter weather in the quarter, in particular, in texas.
the conditions did not have a material impact on our financial results due to our operating and power marketing capabilities, which reacted to mitigate risk. we are proud of how our teams performed during these difficult times, keeping our employees safe and our operations running. our energy transition segment generated $33 million of ffo during the quarter. our portfolio continues to grow as we assist commercial and industrial partners achieve their decarbonization goals and provide critical grid stabilizing ancillary services and backup capacity required to address the increasing intermittency of greener electricity grids.
our financial position continues to be strong. we have approximately $3.4 billion of available liquidity, and our investment-grade balance sheet has no meaningful near-term maturities, and approximately 90% of our financings are non-recourse to brookfield renewable. we continue to take advantage of the low interest rate environment and executed on $3.1 billion of investment-grade financings, including a $350 million four and five-eights fixed rate green perpetual subordinated note offering. the notes have the same accounting and rated treatment as our preferred lp unit.
we also continue to execute on our capital recycling strategy of selling mature de-risked or noncore assets to lower cost of capital buyers while redeploying the proceeds into higher-yielding opportunities. the proceeds from these transactions will be used to fund growth opportunities executed in the quarter, as well as our robust future growth pipeline. in april, we agreed to sell our remaining 360 megawatts of operating assets and development pipeline in ireland and approximately 270 megawatts of ready-to-build wind assets in scotland for an aggregate equity value of approximately $450 million. we entered the european renewable market in 2014 with the acquisition of bord gais' wind portfolio in ireland.
when we acquired this business, it was part of a state-owned utility with approximately 300 megawatts of operating wind capacity. under our ownership, we grew the business to over 700 megawatts of total operating assets by building out the development portfolio, and we expanded the development pipeline to approximately 1,000 megawatts. consistent with our strategy when we enter new markets, we used this investment as a stepping stone to grow our business across europe, including the acquisition of our development pipeline in scotland in 2015. today across europe, we have expanded our capabilities to become a fully integrated platform with extensive corporate contracting, operating and growth capabilities.
following the completion of these sales, we will have more than 300 employees and over 10,000 megawatts of operating and development assets in the region. with this sale, we will have fully exited our initial investment in ireland, having previously sold 375 megawatts of operating assets. in aggregate, we generated more than 15% compound annual returns on this investment. these sales are expected to close in the second quarter.
we also signed an agreement to sell 390 megawatts of wind assets, primarily in california, for a total equity value of approximately $370 million, generating returns of approximately two times our invested capital. under our ownership, the facilities were substantially de-risked by completing our business plan, which included developing several of the assets, establishing long-term revenue certainty, reducing operating and maintenance costs and optimizing the capital structure. this sale is expected to close in the third quarter. looking ahead, we continue to focus on growing our business and executing on our key operational priorities, including maintaining a robust balance sheet and access to diverse sources of capital and servicing value through enhancing cash flows from our existing portfolio.
we believe that with our scale, track record and global capabilities, we are well situated to partner with governments and businesses to help them achieve their goal of greening the global electricity grids. we believe the prospects for growth of our business are better than they ever have been, and we look forward to further opportunities to provide capital and solutions to drive decarbonization. as always, we remain focused on delivering on our long-term total return targets. that concludes our formal remarks for today's call.
thank you for joining us this morning. with that, i'll pass it back to our operator for questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from the line of rob hope with scotiabank.
rob hope -- scotiabank -- analyst
good morning. our first question is on the baltic projects. so we see that in your project development backlog, you do have some onshore stuff with poland. but what are you thinking about the timing in terms of the baltic offshore projects there, as well as how do you see your ownership in polenergia trending over time?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
thanks, rob, great question. so we made an investment in polenergia this last quarter and the structure of our investment is together with our partner. we own 75% of the company, while brookfield owns 23%. the reason why we like this opportunity is the tremendous growth prospects for polenergia.
and our thesis of making this investment is we see ourselves as both an operating partner and a capital provider to that business, as it looks to build out its development pipeline. and rob, you made a great point there. there are two components to that development pipeline. there is the very large offshore development pipeline, 3 gigawatts across three large projects.
we are hopeful to receive positive feedback from the government on fee-up deeds in the coming months, at which point we will look to start to see those projects advance and built out over the next couple years. but what shouldn't be overlooked within polenergia is their onshore development and growth prospects as well. they have construction and development pipeline across both wind and solar, and have been very active participants in the recent auctions in the country. and in the last auction, in fact, they bid three projects and all three projects were awarded subsidies under the new feed-in tariffs.
so we are very, very encouraged about the growth prospects for that business and we very much intend to be a capital provider to that company to fund that growth going forward. and alongside our partner, we would expect our ownership interest to creep up over time.
rob hope -- scotiabank -- analyst
all right. that's helpful. ok. and then, other side of the world, i just want to get some perspective on how you're looking at opportunities in india.
you've had boots on the ground for a number of years there. it seems like you're in the early days of starting to put capital to work there. where in your mind are we in that investment cycle? are you fully confident in that jurisdiction that you could put some larger capital to work?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. and it's a great question. and it's important right now to separate, call it, our long-term strategy in india versus what's happening on the ground right now. right now our focus is just about keeping our people and our operations safe as that jurisdiction works through the peak of covid.
from a longer-term perspective, we entered the indian market in 2017, and this is one of the largest and fastest growing renewables markets in the region. and what we've done in india is very similar to what we do whenever we enter a new region. we spend some time building out our capabilities, our boots on the ground operations, such that we have tremendous flexibility to invest across the opportunity set in that region. and what we are seeing now is a very steady pipeline of opportunities where we think we can incrementally add to our portfolio at very attractive risk-adjusted returns.
i would say we do recognize it is a country that is developing, and therefore we do not intend to deploy a very meaningful portion of brookfield renewable's capital in the jurisdiction. but we do absolutely intend to grow our platform on a continuous basis, and our pipeline in the region remains very strong. i think i'll leave it there.
rob hope -- scotiabank -- analyst
all right. appreciate the color. thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of mark strouse with j.p. morgan.
mark strouse -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, good morning. thank you very much for taking our question. just curious in the grand scheme of things, longer-term, i think the supply chain issues ultimately resolve themselves. but just curious how you are managing rising input costs as you're looking at new projects.
are you locking in some of those pricing now? or are you looking to kind of float and maybe lock in pricing in the future? and maybe talk about the pricing environment and the spreads that you're seeing, the return on equity or return on investments, whatever the best way of looking at it is. are you seeing any squeeze there? thank you.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. thanks, mark. i appreciate the question. maybe to start with procurement, perhaps it's helpful to explain how we look to procure equipment for our global construction and development activities.
and one thing we've spent a lot of time on over the last several years is centralizing our procurement functions around the world, such that whenever we are looking to acquire equipment or services to support any of our projects, we're not looking to procure those products and services on a project-by-project basis, but we rather do it with the economies of scale of the entire brookfield renewable platform. we've spent some time internally dedicating people to procurement of certain products, whether it be wind turbines or solar panels. and through that process, we are ensuring that, one, we would like to think we are getting some of the best prices around the world because we're always leveraging our economies of scale to get full discounts. and then, two, we are increasingly building these very strong relationships with both equipment suppliers and service providers.
and within service providers, i include o&m providers, epc providers. we're always ensuring that we're getting the best terms on the contracts that support those services. and as a result of that, when there are things like some of the short-term supply shortages that the industry has seen over the last few months, we often find that the suppliers work with us very collaboratively and view us as a, call it, tier 1 partner and somebody they want to support and not disrupt our operations. so i would say the centralization of our procurement is really what we use to ensure that we are, one, getting the best prices, but also ensuring that our business isn't interrupted by any short-term disturbances in the supply chain.
the second part of your question was around returns and i think are we seeing any returns compression. and the answer to that is, are we seeing returns compression in certain types of assets in certain types of sales processes within the renewable power space around the world? the answer is absolutely yes. but those aren't the investments that brookfield renewable has ever targeted in the past or is looking to target today. we look for unique situations where we can bring something to the table, we can differentiate ourselves using something other than cost of capital.
that can be our repowering or development capabilities. that can be our corporate contracting capabilities. that can be our size, that can be our global reach. and when it comes to identifying and sourcing opportunities where we can differentiate ourselves, we are not seeing any returns compression from that perspective.
we're very much committed to the same 12% to 15% return targets we've had for many years at this point and see no reason to adjust those return targets in the current market environment.
mark strouse -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
makes sense. that's it fro me. thanks, connor.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of mark jarvi with cibc capital markets.
mark jarvi -- cibc world markets -- analyst
thanks. i just want to touch on the asset sales announced over the last couple months in terms of the buyers being strategics and not necessarily being the lowest cost of capital players you've talked about in the past. maybe just walk us through in terms of maybe your views on post-ppa value that you don't see where they might see something? and do you think that buyers in the market are taking more bullish views on long-term fundamentals, and maybe just sort of your differentiate in terms of why you it's right to sell those assets today?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
thanks, mark. we might perhaps see the situation a little bit differently. it was interesting to us that both of our significant asset sales in the last quarter went to strategics. but what we would say is we ran robust sales processes in both these scenarios and those strategics outbid those low-cost of capital financial buyers that have been the winning bidders for these types of assets quite regularly over the last couple of years.
and i think what we were seeing there is the assets that we were selling in both cases fit a strategic goal of those counterparties, where they saw significant strategic value in the assets that maybe we did not see. and that allowed them to not only acquire the assets at a value that is greater than what we viewed we could earn by holding the assets. that's always our threshold for selling. but it also allowed them to pay a value that was greater than some of the more recent competition from those low cost of capital buyers.
so i would say that it was more the strategic benefit of both those portfolios that drove those buyers to pay the price that made them the winner.
mark jarvi -- cibc world markets -- analyst
got it. so based on those comments, you don't anticipate seeing a material shift in terms of who is typically showing up in the processes and who would likely be buyers of your assets when you do recycling going forward?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
not particularly. certainly not as a result of these two discrete sales. we don't see any meaningful trend there at this point.
mark jarvi -- cibc world markets -- analyst
ok. and then, wyatt, in one of your last comments, you made a remark about providing capital in solutions to help decarbonize. and maybe just picking up the word on provide capital as opposed to invest capital. was there anything to read through there in terms of you're looking at different ways to help other companies or it's like the transalta type of investment that you can just help us see whether or not there's that's sort of foreshadowing certain types of investments going forward?
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
yeah. look, mark, i think you hit on it exactly with the ta transaction, where, in effect, what we did through that transaction was on a structured basis, we acquired a piece of the hydro that allowed ta to use that capital to execute a coal-to-gas conversion, which meaningfully is decarbonizing their business. so what our focus has always been as a deployer of capital for value is working with partners and being flexible around how we work with them to provide them with the solution that best works for their needs. and so that can come in various ways.
and one of those is through transactions like the ta one, where we, in effect, we're a provider of capital, as i mentioned, to help with the decarbonization trend. and we expect looking forward, that the number of transactions we do in this space will increase, and our flexibility to do that will be one of the things that allows us to deploy capital for value.
mark jarvi -- cibc world markets -- analyst
and are you seeing opportunities today? are you working on things like that? i'm trying not to get too far ahead of it, but is that something that we'll see more in the near term? or is that something that you think is going to play out over the next couple of years?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
well, we certainly see this as a very broad long-term trend that we think is going to drive significant growth in our business for the next several years. and really, what we're focusing on here is if you look at, call it, the power generation stacks of utilities or independent power producers, over the next five, 10, 15, 20 years, there needs to be a very large transition away from carbon-intensive forms of power production to cleaner forms of power production. and on the clean side, that is primarily renewables. and many of those independent power producers or utilities, through no fault of their own, don't necessarily have the expertise, or renewables development capability or the capital to make those transitions on their own, and therefore, are looking for a sponsor, or a capital provider or an operating partner.
and we view ourselves as being very well-positioned to participate in that transition. we think it's both, mark, to answer your question, we think it's both a near-term and medium-term and a long-term opportunity.
mark jarvi -- cibc world markets -- analyst
makes sense. thanks for all the details.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of nelson ng with rbc capital markets.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks, and good morning, everyone. so my first question relates to colombia. you have a small 32-megawatt wind project there.
i think you've been in colombia for, i think, just over five years. and i don't think you've been that active on the development side in that market in the past. but are things changing over there? and are you seeing more opportunities on the wind and solar side?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. and maybe -- it's a great question, nelson. and maybe just to take a step back, not even specific to wind or solar, we are just seeing more growth opportunities. when we bought isagen, you would have heard us for many years talk about our key objectives were to reduce cost in that business and extend the contract profile of that very large hydro portfolio, and the team has done a tremendous job of doing that and continues to execute on those initiatives.
but over the last couple of years, we've increasingly looked for more growth opportunities around that colombian portfolio. there's the wind ones you've mentioned. we're also pursuing some solar opportunities in the region. and in the last quarter, we closed on the bolt-on of a couple of small hydros to the portfolio.
so i would say it's more broadly -- we are now seeing more growth opportunities across the spectrum of asset classes to bolt onto that portfolio.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok, thanks. that's great color. and then, just a quick modeling question, maybe it's for wyatt. so this quarter, you recognized some gains for the scottish developments.
i'm just wondering, will you be recognizing gains for the rest of the u.k. assets or for the sale of the u.s. wind assets in a future quarter? i just wasn't too sure which asset sales would result in gains that are included in ebitda or your cafd calculation? thanks.
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
yeah, no, that's a good question, nelson. and so what was reflected there is the gain on our development assets. and really, the reason we're including those into ffo is that really, we've owned those development assets since 2015, as i mentioned. and over the last six years, we've been working to bring those -- to contract them, to get them permitted, etc.
and then, once we've done that, we had a low-cost of capital buyer who came in and was willing to buy them and take construction risk. so the value that we've created in terms of that portfolio through doing those activities was really done around bringing that those development assets forward. and so as a result, we include the value that we've created in our ffo, because if we didn't, none of that value we created would ever have impacted our cash flows. and you'll see, if you look back in the prior year, in a similar type quantum, we recognized gains on some of our development assets in our solar developer, x-elio, etc.
so for us, it's really the inclusion in ffo is focused on those development assets. and it's something that we expect to cheaply more do. but it may be lumpy by quarter, but on an annual basis, we do expect to -- when it makes sense to monetize those types of development assets and as a result, recognized them into our ffo.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. and if you sell operating assets, they won't be recognized?
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
no. similar to our normal course, we don't include those in ffo.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks. i'll get back in the queue.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of sean steuart with td securities.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
thanks. good morning. a couple of questions, connor, i wanted to circle back on corporate contract opportunities. and wondering if you can comment on the regions where you're seeing the best opportunities to sign corporate ppas and how that opportunity set aligns with where your uncontracted generation is expected to rise in your existing portfolio over the next few years? can you speak to the alignment between those two things?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
yes, certainly. and sean, it's perhaps a helpful opportunity to talk about a much broader trend that we've seen. it's not that long ago, maybe two or three years ago, that we were really focused on building out our power contracting corporate contracting capabilities around the world. and two or three years ago, we celebrated every ppa that we got because it really seemed that there were a large number of development projects chasing a smaller number of corporate ppas.
and in 18 or 24 months, we've seen a massive shift in the industry. the pace of that shift is different by market. but now we are really seeing a large amount of corporate ppas available. and if you have high-quality ready-to-build assets, those are now the scarce components of that equation.
and therefore, we are seeing a dramatic increase in that corporate contracting, and we think it really all speaks to increasing decarbonization trends, increasing demand for corporates to procure green power as part of their own, call it, esg or decarbonization initiatives. where we are seeing the greatest amount of activity within our portfolio is certainly in the united states, europe and brazil. those are the three markets where we are seeing a tremendous acceleration in the amount of contracting we've done. to give an anecdote over the last 18 months, we've acquired four ready-to-build projects in brazil.
and at this point, three of those projects are fully contracted now, with the only one not fully contracted being the one we acquired just last quarter. so we think this speaks to the increasing demand of corporates, and it's a trend we don't think is going to slow down. and as a result, we are looking to pull forward more of our development pipeline as fast as possible to satisfy this increasing demand, in particular, in north america and europe.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
thanks for that detail. one follow-up question on india, there were press reports a couple of months ago that brookfield was negotiating a potential acquisition of a solar portfolio in india. i think it was about 1.2 gigawatts. any context on that deal specifically? and you touched on the pandemic and how that affects your short-term aspirations in india.
but can you just speak more broadly to how this potentially affects your ability to conduct due diligence on growth initiatives in the country?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
yes, certainly. so we won't speak to any specific transactions individually. but what we would say is we have a domestic team in india, fully integrated, that conducts all our due diligence whenever we pursue acquisitions in that market. and up until the recent ramp-up, the recent escalation of covid in that region, that team was actively doing due diligence and pursuing opportunities in that space.
and we would very much expect them to restart those activities when they can be done on a safe basis. what i would say is, when it comes to us and our capital deployment strategy, we take a long-term view. these are long-term investments. these are long-term assets.
any disruption by covid is not going to change our long-term view of the attractiveness of that market, but rather is only going to change our time lines because our priority in a situation like this one is the safety of our people. but i would say that the current covid situation is not going to change our long-term ambitions in the country.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
thank you for that detail. that's all i have.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of frederic bastien with raymond james.
frederic bastien -- raymond james -- analyst
good morning. evidently, based on the several investments you closed or advanced in the quarter, you have a lot of irons in the fire. assuming you could invest in any technology at exactly the same returns, wondering which ones you would rank highest on your wish list.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
yes, certainly. so all things being equal, we target the ones that are the easiest and simplest to operate. and right now, all things being equal, solar has a lot of benefits. it's modular.
it's easy to fix. it doesn't require working at heights. the pieces can be transported very easily in containers, as opposed to unique trucks and ships. but that being said, we are agnostic across technology, and we'll go wherever we see the best risk-adjusted returns because we are very comfortable owning, operating, developing, acquiring any of the major technologies.
the flexibility of our platform and the ability to invest across technologies has been a differentiating factor, and we think it will continue to be in the future. so we don't generally pick favorites when it comes to technology.
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
yes. and frederic, i would actually add, we are focused on being diversified because, as connor mentioned, as an example, corporate contracting is becoming more abundant. and one of the things that being diversified does is it allows us to tailor solutions to be a preferred partner in those instances. and so the ability to bring a multi-technology, a multi-region solution to those partners is viewed very valuably.
so our focus is actually to remain diversified the way we are.
frederic bastien -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. and just a quick follow-up on solar, how far off do you believe you are from becoming -- so i wouldn't say mature, but at scale? i mean, obviously, in north america, hydro, you're pretty dominant. but wondering how much more runway there is for your solar business?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
tremendous. we would certainly suggest that we are already at scale. on a global basis, our solar portfolio certainly puts us in the top-tier of owners and operators of solar globally. but given the rapid growth in renewables more broadly, but the fastest technology being solar, we see no limitations to the amount of growth that we could pursue in that technology.
we expect to participate in that growth very materially in the coming years.
frederic bastien -- raymond james -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of rupert merer with national bank.
rupert merer -- national bank financials -- analyst
good morning, connor. in the quarter, you agreed to invest $410 million net to bep. i believe that's faster than your target run rate. and this morning, you highlighted the acceleration of the renewable energy market, plans to pull forward developments.
so with that, it sounds like you could increase your target investment rate. so question is, how much do you think you could invest this year? and what run rate of investment do you think you could sustain in the future or maybe you would need to sustain in the future to keep up with the market?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
it's a great question. and maybe if we think more large scale, for the last several years, we've been incrementally increasing our equity growth deployment targets. and it would probably be incorrect for us to look at any one quarter and run rate it as a proxy. some of the large-scale transactions we do are somewhat lumpy in nature, and we were very active in the latter part of 2020, and a number of those closed in q1.
i would say we remain highly committed to our current guidance, which is $800 million to $1 billion of equity deployment net to bep per year. and if the growth rate in the industry continues the way we expect, i think we'll probably continue to incrementally increase that year on year going forward.
rupert merer -- national bank financials -- analyst
ok, great. thanks. and on recycling initiatives, you've announced a couple recently. do you have the capital you need now for the foreseeable future? or are there any other processes under way to recycle capital? and as part of this question, how do you see the relative cost of new capital from recycling versus new equity issuance?
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
yeah, rupert, i'll take that one. so look, we -- as we've been discussing for a number of years now, capital recycling is something that we very routinely do. it is very much value-driven in the sense that as we identify businesses that have been de-risked that are mature, that are going to be valued very highly by a low cost of capital buyer, for us, it makes a lot of sense to monetize that and redeploy that into growth. fundamentally, we have, as connor just mentioned, our outlook for growth is very strong.
and so for every capital that we sell or the proceeds we get from selling an asset, we definitely think that we will be able to deploy that into growth. we also have a number of other funding levers that we spoke about in the past. to the extent we maintain a strong investment-grade rating at the bep level, we can issue either corporate debt or preferred equity. you would have heard me mention in my prepared comments that in april, we issued $350 million of four and five-rights fixed rate perpetual money that's a very attractive source of capital for us.
so to the extent we can issue more than that while maintaining our strong investment grade, we'll do that. and then, incrementally, from a balance sheet perspective, we have a number of assets where we can, as a result of contracting initiatives or other things that are going on, there's plenty of capital that we can raise at an investment-grade basis and redeploy those proceeds into growth. so from a funding perspective, we're feeling like we're in a very good position. and fundamentally, for us, our equity -- our shares, our units, are our most expensive source of capital.
we're going to prudently source the cheapest source of capital we have, and it's going to be those other buckets that i mentioned. and really for us, given that abundance of funding sources, we really think about our equity more to use on a strategic basis, similar to the terraform power transaction we completed in the prior year.
rupert merer -- national bank financials -- analyst
all right. thanks, all.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of anthony crowdell with mizuho.
anthony crowdell -- mizuho securities -- analyst
hey, good morning. connor, just hopefully two quick ones. you talked about how the strategy is maybe looking at a stepping stone, putting your foot in the water or a toe in the water and then building out from there when you spoke about in india. what do you think is the next stepping stone for brookfield?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
yeah. great question. i think our entry into offshore is an example of an entry into a space where we think we can expand going forward. that's not so much a regional entry point, but rather a technological one.
and the other thing that you'll see across our portfolio is we are always preparing ourselves to ensure that we're positioned for whatever the largest and most attractive growth opportunities are in the future. increasingly, we're seeing more opportunities in storage throughout our portfolio. storage still has a little bit of a ways to go before it can be cost-effective on a widespread basis. but as the cost curve is coming down, we're seeing more opportunities to deploy storage within our portfolio at attractive returns.
so we see that becoming a potentially large and attractive investable space in, call it, the short to medium term. and then, perhaps longer out, green hydrogen. and we continue to stay close to that space. right now, through our power contracting initiative as opposed to actually investing in green hydrogen production, but we'll continue to monitor that space such that when it does become commercially viable on a wide-scale basis, we can be a meaningful player in that sector.
anthony crowdell -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. and then, just lastly. and i apologize if i mischaracterize this. when you were talking about india, you spoke about the company is putting capital there, putting it to work, but you're not throwing like a deluge of capital.
you're being very, i guess, constrained with it, given it's a developing country. do you view all the developing countries in one? or you're willing to spread -- you're willing to have more leverage to developing countries as long as you're spread out? i don't know if i'm clear in the way i'm asking that question.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
no, no, it's helpful. and it perhaps gives me an opportunity to clarify my earlier remarks. today, our business and traditionally, our business has been, call it, 75%, 75% plus developed countries, and we very much expect that proportion to remain approximately consistent. so on a relative basis, the vast majority of our existing asset base and the vast majority of our growth capital, we expect to go into developed countries.
now that being said, given the size of our business, that does allow for very meaningful amounts of capital to be deployed into countries like india, and we will pursue those opportunities when we think we are getting attractive returns and strong downside protection. we would very willingly deploy meaningful dollars in india. but i think the comment we were trying to make before is we still see the vast majority of our business and the vast majority of our growth continuing to be in developed countries and developed regions.
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
and anthony, maybe to add to that, as connor mentioned, 25% or less of our business is in the emerging markets. it's historically been in that. and looking forward, it will stay that way. but one of the things we are incrementally doing with that piece of the pie is diversifying it.
so when we were first formed as bep, it was around 25% of our business was emerging markets, but it was entirely brazil. now we're across multiple countries that form emerging markets, and we think that the benefit of further diversification of that piece of the pie is really beneficial.
anthony crowdell -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of naji baydoun with ia capital markets.
naji baydoun -- ia capital markets -- analyst
good morning. i wanted to go back to the comments you made on offshore wind and that scenario of the market, similar to your comments on the next target markets for you for offshore wind. what are some of the opportunities that you're seeing in that technology?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. so offshore wind, the most mature and the deepest market around the world is europe. and that's, obviously, where we've focused for our first investment. now that being said, we made a comment that we've been monitoring offshore wind for several years now.
we have been looking at opportunities all around the world: in europe, in asia pac, more recently in the united states. i would say we use the same approach when assessing those opportunities that we do anywhere else. can we get a contract profile that we like? can we bring something to the transaction that allows us to be differentiated such that we don't need to compete on cost of capital? and if we find those situations in any of our core markets, we'd look to deploy capital into the offshore wind technology. so i would say we don't have a specific region in mind.
i think some of the more recent announcements about decarbonization are going to drive tremendous growth in this space, both in europe and in the united states. and we'll look at those opportunities and see if we can find situations where we think we can execute successfully.
naji baydoun -- ia capital markets -- analyst
ok. so it's the all-of-the-above approach. and just one last question for me, you also talked about accelerated build-out of your development pipeline. and at the same time, it seems like you're filling the top end of that funnel quite rapidly as well.
i'm just wondering if you can provide us more details on the 4.5 gigawatts of new capacity that you added to the development pipeline this quarter, what markets that capacity is in and maybe some time lines related to that development.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
sure. so maybe what i'll do is i'll talk about some of the strategy behind it. and then, wyatt can give you some of the breakdown of the additions we made to the pipeline. we've talked about how we've been enhancing and increasing our development capabilities in all of our target markets around the world.
and there's multiple components of that. there's the ability to take an existing development project and bring it through construction and through to operations, which we have the capability to do in all of our major markets. but the other part of development is actually generating new development pipeline, working on the ground to secure land, to secure permits, to fill that top end of the funnel. and while some of our more recent activities and some of our more recent successes have been in pulling through existing development pipeline through construction and through operations, what you're seeing now is our development capabilities really firing on all cylinders and growing organically their own development pipeline.
on top of this, we are looking to secure development pipeline where we can, given the significant increase in corporate contracting on the other side that we can use to pull those projects through to operations. but maybe i'll hand to wyatt to walk through where the increments came from.
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
yeah. so naji, what i would broadly say is there's probably no business in the world where we're not incrementally adding to that development pipeline. but the largest drivers of the increase would be one in the u.s. win we recently acquired in oregon that came with a 400-megawatt development pipeline.
so that was added in incrementally on the distributed generation business that we closed in q1 that we acquired from exelon. that came with another around 700 megawatts of a development pipeline. additionally, as connor mentioned previously, one area where we see -- we're seeing a lot of opportunity for growth within polenergia. not so much -- well, we do see the value on the offshore.
but incrementally, what was added in the quarter was on some of the onshore stuff, pv solar and onshore wind. and then, finally, on x-elio, our jv solar developer, global solar developer, where, as connor mentioned, we are just incrementally being able to secure projects, a lot of those being in the u.s. that are both doing that development pipeline.
naji baydoun -- ia capital markets -- analyst
ok, thank you. that's great color on the sourcing and the 4.5 gigawatts offering.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of matthew taylor with tudor, pickering, holt. your line is now open.
matthew taylor -- tudor, pickering, holt & co.
yeah, thanks. just one question, if i may. i just wanted to go back to the corporate ppas. so clearly, there's massive interest, which you're talking about potentially accelerating your development pipelines.
but i think there's also two other pieces that are interesting that i wanted you to provide more color on, is the potential cash flow accretion and then terms. what i mean by the cash flow accretion side is it seems like when these assets are reaching the end of their original ppas, the debt is generally paid off. so layering on a corporate ppa could actually be cash flow positive, so if you have any comments on that. and then, can you speak to the term of the contracts you're seeing versus the original government-backed agreements across sectors?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
sure. thanks, matt, so maybe to break that into two pieces. the vast majority of the contracting we are doing, you're absolutely correct, is for new assets, to pull new development, new projects out of the ground. but we are also seeing opportunities to use corporate contracting to extend the contract life of assets that are coming to the end of, call it, their initial contract, which as you rightly pointed out, in many cases, is a government feed-in tariff.
the decision we always make at that point is a risk-return decision. what price can we secure that contract at and the benefit of taking what would become a merchant cash flow and turning it into a contracted cash flow is that cash flow often then becomes readily financeable as well. and as a result, we often do look to contract our assets when they come to the end of that initial contracted life, because of the financing impact it has that can be very accretive to the broader investment return of an individual project or an individual investment. i think the second part of your question was just around the term of some of the contracts we're seeing.
and we often hear almost a concern in some of the questions that government feed-in tariffs were long term, 15 or 20 years, and corporate contracts are short term. we haven't seen that too much in our business. and if anything, over the last few years, government tariffs have actually, in general, been shortening and corporate contracting has been lengthening in terms of contract. the vast majority of the corporate contracting we do is double-digit year tenors.
in fact, i would say, of the contracts we signed in the quarter of the major material ones, i'd expect almost all of them were double-digit years in tenor. and if you look at some of our largest contracting initiatives, for example, the contracting of the ready-to-build assets that we've acquired in brazil over the last 12 to 18 months. the terms on those contracts were 15 to 20 years. so we haven't really seen a shortening of contract tenors as a result of the switch from feed-in tariffs to corporate contracts.
we stay on top of that because, obviously, term is very beneficial, just in terms of giving us visibility on our future cash flows, but also the same financing component we referenced that longer-term allows for more attractive and accretive financing.
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
yeah. and i'll just add two quick points to what connor said on your point, matt, is one, you're exactly right where -- and we've been talking about this for a while, and when we talk about some of the funding sources we have for our growth is that we have, just given as wind and solar projects or even our hydro projects, you come off -- in wind and solar, when they come off contract or in hydros to the extent that they're a merchant and we provide a contract. that creates a lot of potential for up financings because that cash flow becomes that much more financeable. and so in regard to that using that as a funding source, we have a tremendous amount of potential within our business.
incrementally, what i'd say is, one thing we are focused on in every financing we do is we're getting part of the benefit of that post-contract cash flow in our current financings, where five, 10 years ago, when you're financing wind and solar assets, it was effectively fully amortized over the contract life. what we've been -- and we did this with our hydro business starting 15, 20 years ago, but getting a recognition for a value beyond that contract period, that just enhances the financing structure and optimizes the financing structure quite meaningfully. and so increasingly, we're getting 20% to 30% bullets at the back end of our contract life on wind and solar. and we'll continue to try and increase that and just enhance the optimization of our financing structures, which will drive value over the long term.
so we think your point is exactly right, where there is a lot of value, both within our existing business, but as we look forward in having our financing structures reflect the enhanced corporate contracting framework.
matthew taylor -- tudor, pickering, holt & co.
great. thanks for the color. really helpful. i'll leave it there.
operator
thank you. and now i'll turn the call back over to ceo connor teskey, for any closing remarks.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
ok, great. as always, we want to thank everyone for their support. we look forward to updating you at the end of next quarter with our q2 results. have a good day.

2021-Q2,BEP,2021-08-05 11:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
thank you for standing by, and welcome to the bep second-quarter 2021 results conference call and webcast. [operator instructions] it is now my pleasure to introduce ceo of brookfield renewable, connor teskey.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
thank you, operator. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second-quarter 2021 conference call. before we begin, we would like to remind you that a copy of our news release, investor supplement and letter to unitholders can be found on our website. we also want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements on this call.
these statements are subject to known and unknown risks, and our future results may differ materially. for further information, you are encouraged to review our regulatory filings available on sedar, edgar and our website. to kick off today's call, we will provide an outlook on the business, an update on recent growth and an update on recent growth initiatives. after our initial remarks, wyatt will provide an update on brookfield renewable corporation, an overview of our operating results as well as our balance sheet and liquidity.
after which we look forward to taking your questions. the tailwinds for renewables continue to accelerate as stakeholders around the world increasingly focus on the global imperative to decarbonize. this is driving increased demand for green energy and other clean solutions. it should come as no surprise that there is both a growing investment opportunity as well as increasing amounts of capital being allocated toward the sector.
as one of the few businesses with the scale, track record and global capabilities to both partner with governments and businesses and also invest to help them achieve their decarbonization goals, we believe we have a great runway ahead of us. we have continued to earn excellent returns in these market conditions. we have remained focused on opportunities where we can leverage our global reach operating and development expertise and scale access to capital. and as industry tailwinds accelerate, the number of scale, value-add opportunities that favor investors with our skill set is also increasing.
we will now walk through a number of highlights for the quarter. we generated ffo of $268 million or $0.42 per unit, a 23% increase on a normalized per unit basis over the same period in the prior year as our assets continue to perform well with high levels of asset availability, and we benefit from growth from both new acquisitions and the development asset, and a number of our development assets coming online. we signed 28 agreements for approximately 800 gigawatt hours of renewable generation with high-quality corporate off-takers across all major industries. our momentum with corporate contracting continues to grow and demonstrates our leadership in a rapidly growing industry trend.
we progressed approximately 7,500 megawatts of development projects through construction and advanced permitting and added approximately 4,000 megawatts to our global development pipeline, which is now over 30,000 megawatts around the world. year to date, we have invested or agreed to invest approximately $1.9 billion or approximately $500 million net to brookfield renewable of equity across a range of transactions. our balance sheet remains robust with almost $3.3 billion of available liquidity and no meaningful near-term maturities. and finally, we raised approximately $1.3 billion or over $650 million net to brookfield renewable from asset recycling and strategic up-financing activities so far this year.
now turning our attention to some recent growth initiatives. as more capital continues to flow into renewable energy and decarbonization solutions, our approach to growth will continue to favor those opportunities that allow us to utilize our strengths, investing for value and leveraging our operating capabilities to drive cash flow growth. we recently executed several agreements and transactions that highlight this approach. in june, we commenced the repowering of the fully contracted 845-megawatt shepherds flat wind project, which we acquired earlier this year.
shepherds flat, which is located in the united states, is one of the largest repowering projects in the world. we will replace the turbine hardware with longer rotors and more efficient equipment while maintaining the rest of the infrastructure. this is expected to increase production by approximately 25%, generating 400 gigawatt hours of additional clean energy annually, while also meaningfully extending the asset's useful life. furthermore, given that the cost is only a fraction of a comparable greenfield project and the enhanced generation can support a more robust capital structure, the requiring -- the repowering requires no additional equity from us, meaning that the investment will generate attractive mid- to high-teens returns.
this repowering is an example of how we capitalize on our competitive advantages in the current market environment. by the time we complete the repowering by the end of 2022, it is expected that 320 turbines will have been retrofitted with rotors measuring almost 130 meters and other technologically advanced equipment as we continue to deliver power and receive revenues under the current power purchase agreement. doing so requires the combination of both our operating capabilities, as well as our position as one of the leading renewable power platforms in the world. we have leveraged our existing relationships with equipment suppliers, financing partners and power offtakes to largely derisk this project.
with an estimated 200 gigawatts of global wind capacity reaching 15 years of age within the next five years, the global market for repowerings is large. shepherds flat is by no means the only opportunity, and this is only one segment where we continue to grow our business at attractive returns. given our global reach and operating capabilities, we expect to capitalize on scale opportunities to repower other projects, both across our existing portfolio as well as those we acquire to deliver attractive returns for our investors. this quarter, we also signed a strategic collaboration agreement with amazon to develop new renewable projects supported by power purchase agreements and to work together on additional green energy opportunities in the future.
this agreement with the world's largest corporate buyer of renewable power, will leverage our deep operating capabilities and local teams in north america, europe, brazil and asia to support the construction of projects from our 31,000 megawatt development pipeline. we are excited to collaborate with amazon and support them in achieving their climate goals while at the same time helping to transition global electricity grids to greener energy. furthermore, we agreed with trane technologies to jointly pursue and offer decarbonization-as-a-service for commercial, industrial and public sector customers. this will comprise of energy-efficient retrofits and upgrades of building energy infrastructure, along with captive distributed solar, energy storage and other power generation across north america.
the agreement leverages our leading u.s. distributed generation business and trane's leading energy efficiency, engineering and project development experience to jointly develop and implement new customer opportunities. the decarbonization solutions provided will help customers meet sustainability targets while reducing operating costs through upgrading critical energy infrastructure and installing on-site renewable energy. in our polish renewables business, we made significant progress on our development activities.
we secured 25-year contracts to support the build-out of almost 1.5 gigawatts of offshore wind projects at attractive prices, escalating with inflation with no basis or curtailment risk. as we have stated previously, we believe these are some of the most attractive contract structures available in the global offshore wind sector. we are now focused on executing construction activities with the goal of delivering the facilities starting in 2025. in addition, we are on track to deliver our 200-megawatt under construction onshore wind portfolio by next year and are advancing opportunities to grow our onshore wind and solar footprint in the country.
to fund these growth initiatives, shareholders have agreed to capital increases required over the next two years, providing the framework for us to invest an additional eur 150 million or approximately $50 million net to brookfield renewable and increase our stake in the business to almost 40%. in brazil, our construction activities continue to progress on budget and on schedule across our almost 2-gigawatt portfolio of under-construction wind and solar projects. recently, we completed construction activities at our approximately 300-megawatt solar project ahead of schedule and under budget. our global procurement platform and construction capabilities have positioned us well, and we are on track to deliver an additional approximately 900 megawatts of fully contracted projects in 2022.
in china, alongside apple's china renewable energy fund, which was raised by apple and its local suppliers to advance their collective transition to net zero in the country, we agreed to acquire a 55% stake in a 213-megawatt contracted portfolio of wind assets for $60 million or approximately $15 million net to brookfield renewable. this transaction continues to expand and diversify our platform in china, providing a path to continue to prudently grow our capacity in the country. this acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter. and lastly, in india, we agreed to invest $130 million or $35 million net to brookfield renewable across two transactions totaling 900 megawatts of capacity.
the first is with a local solar developer from whom we acquired assets in 2019. we will acquire a 450-megawatt fully contracted ready-to-build solar project. this opportunity is just the first potential transaction of part of a 1.7-gigawatt development pipeline that we are developing in a joint venture with our partners, where they undertake the development activities, and we have the option to acquire the projects once they are fully permitted and ready to begin construction. the second transaction is with a large indian solar developer that was one of the underlying borrowers in a portfolio of loans we acquired in late 2020.
the investment gives us the right to acquire a 450-megawatt fully contracted solar project, one year following commissioning once the project has been substantially derisked. with that, i'll turn the call over to wyatt to discuss our operating results and financial position. 
wyatt hartley -- managing partner and chief financial officer
thank you, connor. before i discuss our operating results and financial position, i want to make a few brief comments on brookfield renewable corporation, or bepc. it has been 12 months since we spun out this corporate entity. in that time, it has achieved many of the goals we set at launch, including welcoming almost 250 new institutional investors and the addition to many indices, including the russell 1000, the msci canada and the s&p global clean energy index.
we were able to offer bepc shares as consideration in the privatization of terraform power, and we expanded the public float since launch by approximately 300%. we are very pleased with the positive market reception. and looking forward, we expect that bepc will continue to offer investors an additional way to access our globally leading portfolio of renewable and decarbonization assets, broadening our investor base and enhancing the liquidity of our securities. turning to operating results.
during the second quarter, we generated ffo of $268 million or $0.42 per unit as our business benefited from recent acquisitions, strong asset availability and margin-enhancing initiatives. on a normalized basis, our per unit results were up 23% year over year. during the quarter, our hydroelectric segment delivered ffo of $154 million. despite generation for the quarter coming in below the long-term average, the portfolio continues to exhibit strong cash flow resiliency given the increasingly diversified asset base and contract profile.
as we have reiterated previously, resource cyclicality is expected, but does not impact how we manage the business. our focus remains on mitigating exposure to any single resource, market or counterparty by continuously diversifying and contracting the business while prudently managing the assets. securing contracts that value the uniqueness of our fleet as a generator of dispatchable clean electricity and ancillary services further bolsters our portfolio against inevitable variability. brazil has been impacted by a dryer-than-normal rainy season this year, particularly in the southeastern region of the country, and reservoirs are well below long-term average.
as a result, spot prices have increased significantly as the grid operator has been forced to dispatch higher-priced thermal generation, and there is modest risk of energy rationing in the country. our portfolio is well positioned in this environment. we have little to no risk of being short of our power delivery obligations for the rest of this year and 2022. and we could potentially realize very strong pricing on contracts we signed for next year.
our wind and solar segments generated a combined $178 million of ffo as we continue to generate stable revenues from these assets and benefit from the diversification of our fleet and highly contracted cash flows with long-duration power purchase agreements. further, to take advantage of the strong pricing environment in brazil, we executed on a regulatory mechanism to uncontract our generation for the year of 2022 from our approximately 300-megawatt solar development project in the country. concurrently, we executed on new contracts for this generation in the free market at double the power purchase agreement price generating an additional brl 135 million or $27 million of revenue from the project. our energy transition segment generated $44 million of ffo during the quarter as our portfolio continues to grow, while we assist commercial and industrial partners achieve their decarbonization goals and provide critical grid-stabilizing ancillary services and backup capacity required to address the increasing intermittency of greener electricity grids.
our financial position continues to be strong. we have approximately $3.3 billion of available liquidity. our investment-grade balance sheet has no meaningful near-term maturities and approximately 90% of our financings are nonrecourse to brookfield renewable. recently, fitch initiated coverage of our business, assigning a bbb+ rating, which is consistent with our existing rating from s&p.
during the quarter, we continued to take advantage of the low interest rate environment and executed on approximately $1.5 billion of investment-grade financings across the business. we also continue to execute on several initiatives to further bolster our liquidity and support growth. recently, we raised over $850 million or approximately $410 million net to brookfield renewable of equity proceeds from capital recycling initiatives. looking forward, we expect to continue to generate meaningful proceeds from strategic up-financing and capital recycling initiatives.
so we are not reliant on capital markets to fund the growth of our business. looking ahead, we continue to focus on growing our business and executing on our key operational priorities, including maintaining a robust balance sheet and access to diverse sources of capital and servicing value through enhanced cash flows from our existing portfolio. we remain committed to helping our customers achieve their decarbonization goals and in the process, earn our investors a strong total return of 12% to 15% over the long term. on behalf of the board and management of brookfield renewable, we thank all our unitholders and shareholders for their ongoing support and look forward to connecting with you at our annual investor day, which is scheduled to take place on the 21st of september.
that concludes our formal remarks for today's call. thank you for joining us this morning. and with that, i'll pass it back to our operator for questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of rob hope with scotiabank.
rob hope -- scotiabank -- analyst
good morning, everyone. i wanted to start on the collaboration agreement with amazon. how does that kind of come into effect? and can you put some goalposts around technologies, geographies, costs that could eventually fall under this agreement as well as the timeline?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly, and thank you. perhaps i will start, but wyatt, please jump in. we're very excited about our collaboration with amazon. put simply, amazon is the largest corporate buyer of green power around the world, and we are one of the largest providers and suppliers of green power around the world.
so we think this is a natural alignment of interest. it's probably not prudent for us to discuss specific size because the actual projects that will initially be included are still being determined. but this is a sizable ambitious collaboration that is global in nature across multiple projects in all of our core geographies around the world. and what makes us most excited about this agreement is given amazon's ambitious targets in terms of green power procurement and our ability to help support them in those initiatives, we think it could grow very materially in the coming years.
rob hope -- scotiabank -- analyst
all right. thanks for that. and then maybe as a follow-up question in terms of kind of global opportunities. the transition fund that just was announced, how do you think it will interact with bep? could we see it take a 25% interest in the majority of capital there?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
great question. thank you. for brookfield renewable, the transition fund will be similar to brookfield's other flagship funds with brookfield renewable funding bam's commitment to the fund, where the investment fits brookfield renewables mandate. given the transition funds mandate around renewable power build-out and the growth in acquisition of decarbonization assets, we expect that most of the transition fund investments will be suitable for brookfield renewable.
it does continue to be the case that we may make certain direct investments through brookfield renewable when it is strategic to do so such as when we privatized terp last year, but we do expect the majority of the investments that we will make to be made through brookfield private funds. and we're excited because the transition fund simply enhances the opportunity for brookfield renewable to target the largest and most attractive renewable power and decarbonization opportunities all over the world.
rob hope -- scotiabank -- analyst
appreciate the call. thank you. 
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of rupert merer with national bank.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
good morning, everyone. now you talked about brazil and the higher power prices there and the potential for recontracting some of your assets in brazil. how much of your capacity in brazil will be up for contract negotiation over the next couple of years? and how much upside do you see with the pricing environment there? 
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
perfect. so rupert, why don't i start and then i might hand to wyatt for some of the specifics. but what we look to do in our brazilian operation is we are obviously targeting a highly contracted profile. but what we do do is we always leave sufficient cushion to account for any resource variability such as the resource variability we've seen thus far this year.
in certain years, we don't use all that cushion. in years of low hydrology like this one, we use more of it, but it positions us well to handle situations such as the drought-like conditions that are currently being experienced. the majority of our power is contracted going forward for a number of years under long-term contracts, but we do continue to hold a small minority of position that we contract on a short-term basis to provide flexibility in these situations. wyatt, can i hand to you for some of the specifics?
wyatt hartley -- managing partner and chief financial officer
yes. so just to put some numbers around that, rupert, as connor mentioned, the way we think about contracting our portfolio is so that in a down resource year like we're seeing this year and then potentially into 2022, that we're not going to be short of our delivery obligations, and we use a lot of historical data to back that up. what that translates to is between 80% and 85% of our normal course or lta generation we can track, and then we leave that remaining 15% to 20% open. and that's where we, one, we achieved the benefit of not being caught short.
and secondly, as we mentioned in our prepared comments that to the extent we generate above that 80% to 85%, we're then monetizing that surplus energy in a very attractive power price market. so there is some upside, but the majority of our portfolio is contracted.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
ok. very good. thanks. and really a follow-up to the last question from rob.
it seems like you're anticipating you could be investing in other sorts of infrastructure in the future. are you going to contemplate investing in hydrogen infrastructure like some of your peers or carbon capture or renewable natural gas? and if so, how much of your investment, do you think that could make up in the coming years?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
thanks, rupert. few different ways to come at that question. increasingly, more and more of our business has been making investments around being a solutions provider, providing energy transition and decarbonization solutions, in particular, for businesses and corporates around the world that increasingly are setting higher and higher decarbonization objectives for themselves. we feel that we are in a very strong position to be that operating partner and that capital provider.
and the reason for that is, the first step in many corporates or many businesses decarbonization plan is to address their scope 2 emissions by supplying their business with green power. we have been a producer and provider, a leading producer and provider of green power to corporates for years. and what this allows us to do is help corporates get the low-hanging fruit in their decarbonization plan. from there, we then engage with those counterparties on other ways that we can be helpful in being a partner in helping them decarbonize their business or reach their own net zero targets.
when it comes to ways other than the provision of green power, we see a tremendous amount of opportunity. and some of the technologies you mentioned, we are absolutely following incredibly closely. we expect green hydrogen to be a very large and attractive investable opportunity for brookfield renewable in the future and one that we feel that we are exceptionally well positioned for when the cost curve for the production of green hydrogen comes down over time. green hydrogen is not cost-effective on a wide scale basis in many markets around the world today.
but what we are doing internally is looking both within our portfolio and in opportunities in the market that will be well positioned when that cost curve for green hydrogen comes down such that we will be on the front foot and ready to take advantage of those investing opportunities in the future when they become available. and i would say green hydrogen is just one type of future opportunity we're looking at other opportunities as well, whether it be carbon capture storage or the build-out of long-term duration energy storage and batteries.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
great. thanks for the color. 
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of sean steuart with td securities. 
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
thanks. good morning. a couple of questions. i want to start with the ongoing capital recycling and financing activity.
and you referenced ongoing ambitions on both of those fronts, and that's not a surprise, i suppose. but connor, i'm wondering if you can give us updated thoughts on -- with respect to capital recycling, the valuation sweet spots, whether it's by technology or geography? and has that evolved over the last three to six months and where you're seeing a more attractive opportunity set?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. thanks, sean. maybe just to say two things. in the quarter, we closed the previously announced sale of our irish and scottish wind assets.
and we've also recently received the approvals and would expect to close our u.s. wind sale pretty shortly here. in terms of dynamics that we're seeing in the market, there's perhaps two things we would highlight. we continue to see a very, very robust bid for de-risked, long-term contracted wind and solar assets.
we spoke in our prepared remarks about how there is more and more capital flowing toward renewable power asset classes and other forms of sustainable or decarbonization assets. that is simply increasing the prices that we are seeing for long-term derisked assets, which creates a robust environment for us to sell into for assets where we've achieved our business plan. the other thing that we're seeing in terms of capital recycling and up-financing is the increasing value and scarcity of our hydro fleet. within our portfolio, we've long stated that we have significant up-financing capacity within our hydro fleet.
and we would say in the current market where there's an increasing build-out of wind and solar and the baseload characteristics and the inherent storage characteristics of hydro are increasingly becoming more valuable that is helpful for -- to us from both a monetization perspective if we ever chose to sell those assets, but it's also increasingly helpful to us from an up-financing perspective because we're seeing tremendous capacity to raise capital in those assets within our portfolio, particularly in north america.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
that's useful. second question, following on your previous comments with respect to decarbonization services. can you give us some more context behind your partnership with trane technologies? and if possible, any context on the scale of that partnership opportunity and your objectives to grow that out over the mid to long term?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. so maybe to take a step back, our distributed generation business in the u.s. is one of our fastest-growing and most dynamic platforms within brookfield renewable. and we see a tremendous growth opportunity for providing on-site renewable power generation for self-consumption by commercial and industrial counterparties.
what we see in this agreement with trane that we're really excited about is we are a leader in providing distributed solar generation on the outside of the building. and to put it simply, trane is a global leader in providing energy-efficient services and decarbonization services on the inside of the building. and therefore, the benefits of the transaction are really obvious in two ways: one, collectively, we can provide an unparallel, excuse me, an unparalleled full suite of products to commercial and industrial customers. but secondly, we can cross-sell our respective products across each other's customer bases because we target the exact same sectors.
so what we would say is this creates an opportunity to grow our dg business even faster than it is already growing but also to invest alongside trane in providing some of these energy efficiency and decarbonization solutions inside the building as well.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
that's all i have.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of nelson ng with rbc capital markets.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks, and good morning, everyone. in the commentary, i think you said brazil hydrology was pretty weak. i noticed that q2 hydrology was actually strong.
and so just going forward, do you expect weak hydrology for the rest of the year in brazil? and i guess the question is, would the additional profit on the uncontracted generation make up for the lower generation?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
so nelson, i'll start. but maybe just to clarify, it was a fairly weak hydrology quarter across three of our four hydro markets. we had below lta hydrology in canada, the united states and brazil. we did have above lta hydrology in colombia.
so i just want to make that clarification. the one thing i would add is, as wyatt mentioned in his opening remarks, we manage the business to the long-term lta. and at this point, we're already partway through q3. and with the exception of brazil in most of our canadian and mid-continent u.s.
assets, we are seeing a reversion toward ltas. so we don't expect hydrology to be as difficult in q3 as it was in q2 based on what we're seeing at this point. in terms of when we look to production in brazil next year, it's certainly tough to forecast exactly what hydrology would be. the recontracting activities we have done are significantly beneficial to our portfolio.
but i think it would be not prudent for us to try and guess what hydrology will be in 2022 in the brazilian market.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. got it. and then can you just provide a bit more color on your ability to essentially pull your contracts from the government and then recontracted in the market? is there a lot of other -- is this for very specific assets? or can you do that for additional assets going forward?
wyatt hartley -- managing partner and chief financial officer
yes. nelson, it's wyatt here. you're exactly right. it's not broadly -- it's broadly available to the market.
but really what happened here was as they generate -- or the distributing company or the distributors in the country of brazil looked at their projections for 2022, they effectively realized that they were overcontracted. and so when that occurs, what the government or the regulator often does is set up a mechanism whereby certain projects can uncontract, thereby reducing that over-contracted position of the distribution companies. and so in this case, what it was is effectively any project that was being delivered new for the year of 2022 was provided the opportunity to uncontract. and so as we mentioned, we're about to deliver our 300-megawatt development project in the country.
and so that was eligible for under this mechanism to uncontract and we then were able to concurrently recontract in the free market at effectively double the rates and earn a very good boost for 2022 revenues.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
so those same assets would be contracted in the following year? it's just for 2022, right?
wyatt hartley -- managing partner and chief financial officer
exactly right. it is not uncontracted long term. it is focused only for 2022 and the contract, the ppa contract that we put in place when we built the asset, continues from 2023 onwards.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. thanks. thanks. and then just one last question before i get back in the queue.
on the repowering side, connor, you mentioned that there are a lot of opportunities out there. you're obviously working on shepherds flat. i think you have a project in new york and california, i believe. is the main focus on repowering in the u.s.
given the available tax credits? or are there other geographies that you're focused on right now?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
yes, certainly. great question. and you're absolutely right. we are seeing the most attractive opportunities right now primarily in the united states.
and there's really two things driving that. as you mentioned, there's very supportive tax credit regimes that repowering qualify for in the united states. and then there's a second nuance about the u.s. that is much simpler, which is to put it very simply, the projects in the u.s.
are a lot bigger. and therefore, you can get economies of scale during the repowering process. while we are seeing the greatest opportunities in the short term in the united states, the broader opportunity that gets us very excited is europe. and the reason for that is europe does have a very large and aging wind installed fleet that we think will be eligible for repowering, as in the future, more support for repowering does come forward from governments and regulatory authorities in that market.
and that's something we're tracking very closely.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for the color. i'll leave it there. 
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of mark strouse with j.p. morgan.
mark strouse -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey. good morning. thanks for taking our questions. i just want to clarify something for me, if you don't mind.
just with the supply constraints that we're seeing globally, understand you're very well diversified across assets and across geographies, but for some of your projects, are you seeing delays in any particular areas with the need to potentially increase pricing as your component inputs increase as well. and to the extent that you are raising ppa prices, what is the customer response to that? are you getting much pushback?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. thanks, mark. and maybe we'll come at this from two different perspectives. we'll talk a little bit about the macro and then we'll go down to our business.
so obviously, there was an increase in equipment costs, notably in solar panels over, call it, the last six or nine months. this was largely driven by increasing demand; and two, a number of, call it, short-term supply shocks in key production markets that we're largely through at this point. and as we look going forward, one, those short-term supply shocks seemed to be increasingly behind us, but there is also growing visibility on new production capacity coming back online. and we very much expect to see any supply concerns largely resolved over the next nine to 12 months.
when it comes to our business, any effect as a result of these supply shocks has been incredibly muted and i would say immaterial. and there's two things i would point to. first and foremost, one thing we do as part of our risk management and approach to development is we procure our equipment at the same time as we lock in a contract. and therefore, we're never taking basis risk in that we lock in a contract and leave ourselves exposed to equipment prices increasing and dramatically eroding our returns.
we would always look to do those things very, very close together, concurrently, if possible, and therefore, we're locked in contractually on both sides and market moves in terms of prices won't affect our underlying projects. i would say that has been our largest mitigant over the last six or nine months and removed any material downside effect that could have affected us from the supply shortage. the second thing we would say is, through our centralized procurement, we've maintained very strong relationships with the tier 1 suppliers. and yes, have we had to work with tier 1 suppliers to maybe adjust shipping schedules or things like that as a result of the supply shocks? absolutely.
but none of it was material. and outside the boundaries of our construction and development schedules, it was all within our plan. and therefore, when we look at our large solar developments around the world at this point, they continue to be on time and on budget.
mark strouse -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. thanks, connor. and then similar kind of question, just regarding government incentives globally. i mean are you seeing any of your prospective customers kind of sitting on their hands near term, waiting on for more -- waiting on clarity around a potential infrastructure bill in the u.s., the fit-for-55 program in europe, anything else?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
not particularly. all these things are going to be incremental tailwinds for our business. but i would say the overarching support is just a massive continued increase in corporate and utility demand for green power. and the growth in that overarching increase in demand far outweighs any individual short-term customers biases to waiting for more visibility.
so i would say it's not having a material impact from what we're seeing. we continue to see demand for green power growing universally across all major markets around the world.
mark strouse -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. very helpful. thank you. 
operator
and our next question comes from the line of pearce hammond with piper sandler.
pearce hammond -- piper sandler -- analyst
good morning and thank you for taking my question. i was just curious. when you look around the international markets that you may not be in right now. are there some markets that look intriguing based upon what they're moving forward with their own decarbonization plans? and are there some markets that might be moving up to the forefront, where you might be able to get some outsized opportunities and apply your expertise that you have built up in the international markets over time?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
thanks, pearce. it's a great question. at this point, we wouldn't suggest that there's any markets around the world that we're looking to enter on an accelerated basis. but i would say there are a number of markets around the world where we have a very small footprint.
and through our operations over the last three or four years, we have small footprints in a number of markets that we could look to expand on dramatically in the coming years. we're going to look to continue to grow in our core markets, north and south america, europe, india, china, but in the last few years, we do have small operations through our underlying portfolio companies in japan, in australia, in chile, in uruguay. and these are all markets where we have operations, we have personnel on the ground. and in addition to our large core markets, we could see ourselves grow increasingly larger platforms going forward.
but we're going to continue to be prudent and cautious and look to do it when we see attractive risk-adjusted returns. the benefit of our platform continues to be a global approach where we can allocate our capital where we see the best opportunities. and the nice thing about the growth we've had in recent years are there are a few more regions where we are looking at opportunities and could deploy capital if we see attractive projects or assets to acquire.
pearce hammond -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you very much. and then my follow-up question. i know the biden infrastructure bill is kind of moving through washington in fits and starts. but when you look at that bill, are there one or two different things that you think could be a big beneficiary or benefit brookfield in that bill?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. one of the most exciting things about biden's infrastructure bill is it is so all-encompassing. there are things in that bill that can be helpful to so many different parts of the market. and we think for investors and operators such as ourselves that can play across the decarbonization spectrum across operating or development assets, there will be a number of opportunities.
the obvious one that -- is when you look at some of the growth in our development pipeline quarter over quarter, we added about 4,000 megawatts of development pipeline. and a large portion of that increase was in the united states, where we increasingly have been growing our development pipeline in-house using our own organic development teams. and with some of the potential tax credit increases that are considered under biden's bill, our development pipeline could see some of those projects developed faster and pulled forward. that's the most obvious one, but there's certainly a lot in the bill that will help decarbonization across the entire spectrum.
pearce hammond -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you very much. 
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of ben pham with bmo.
benjamin pham -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thanks. good morning. what's the overwhelming demand for the energy transition fund and it sounds like, to your comments, that there's great alignment between you guys and the fund. do you think maybe now just with that evidence or with that data you're seeing that you look at the next 10 years, are you -- brookfield renewable, are you perhaps more and more to an energy transition company versus a pure-play, balanced renewable company?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
ben, it's a great question. and we increasingly -- and i'll go back to a comment that we made before, more and more of our investments over the last five or seven years have been about being a solutions provider, decarbonization and energy transition solutions. and what i would say is for decades and decades and decades, we have been a leading owner, operator, developer and acquirer of renewable power generation assets. and we do not see that growth in our business slowing down at all.
the renewable sector continues to grow at an exponential basis on a global scale, and we expect to participate in our portion of that growth, if not more going forward. the decarbonization solutions component to our business is completely incremental and also a very large growth opportunity going forward. so what i would say is we expect to see significant growth in both the traditional renewable power generation business, sorry, i should say, the traditional renewable power generation component of our business, but also tremendous growth in these energy transition type investments. given the sizable renewables base that we already have, it will certainly take a long time before we aren't predominantly a renewable power generation company, but we do view ourselves as a global decarbonization solutions provider.
benjamin pham -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's great. and then maybe a macro question on brazil, maybe to close off some of the questions that has mentioned your disclosures about a shaping generation. is that just in relation to the assured generation you're pulling forward, some generation early and then letting it balance in the second half, you still get your -- pretty much your fixed payment from the government?
wyatt hartley -- managing partner and chief financial officer
yes. that's exactly right, ben. that's just with our energy marketing team on the ground and the way the pooling mechanism, the central pooling mechanism works in brazil allows you to kind of shape your generation and take advantage of pricing in certain periods. and so that's exactly what that's reflective of.
it's something that we do annually just to optimize our generation. and we continue looking forward, we expect to take advantage of that in the coming years as well.
benjamin pham -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
that's great. ok. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of mark jarvi with cibc capital markets.
mark jarvi -- cibc world markets -- analyst
thanks. good morning. i wanted to come back to a couple of topics. first one is that amazon agreement.
i appreciate you don't want to talk too much about it, and it's really early stages, but can you kind of clarify whether or not this is contracting of existing assets, you'll be building new assets to fit their energy needs and if that's more of a dg or utility scale? or is it just kind of all-encompassing on all those attributes?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
mark, thank you for the question. what we expect under this agreement is largely the development of new assets. and amazon's green power needs are largely driven by the incredible growth of their cloud services businesses and the data center usage and the energy load of those data centers. and obviously, data centers are large consumers of energy and can support utility scale renewable power projects.
so we expect this to drive new development projects from both our existing pipeline and new projects that we may either develop organically or acquire, and it will be primarily across wind and solar, but it's a global collaborative initiative.
mark jarvi -- cibc world markets -- analyst
ok. thanks. that's very helpful. and then just going back to the inflation comments.
you brought up the inflation escalator of the projects, the offshore wind projects in poland. is that a project also where you've locked in at least some of the costs at this point? there's a lot of talk, siemens gamesa came out with a sort of profit warning and so they want to pass on some of the higher costs. maybe just talk a little bit about any exposure there on inflation pressures on the offshore wind stuff that you're starting to get into.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
yes. certainly. so maybe just to speak for a moment to the first part of your question. the reason why we enjoy these contracts so much is really four reasons, and they're very much in line with how we spoke for many years about the types of opportunities we want to see in offshore.
we want to see long-term contracts. these are 25-year contracts. they are inflation-linked. these contracts don't require us to take curtailment risk, and their cfds not versus market price but versus captured price.
so we don't take basis risk on them either. and obviously, the polish offshore market needs to be built out, we will be one of the first projects that are brought online. but we think the quality of these contracts is going to shine through very, very readily to the market. and people will understand the robustness of the underlying cash flow streams.
in terms of what we're seeing in capex costs, nothing that isn't in line with our underwriting. we obviously underwrote this investment earlier this year in a recovering global economy. and i would say there's nothing at this point that we're concerned about in terms of capex cost. in terms of building the offshore pipeline out in poland, our business is partnered with equinor.
so we're partnered with one of the leading existing offshore owners and developers, and we see nothing at this point that concerns us from a capex perspective.
mark jarvi -- cibc world markets -- analyst
ok. and then my last question is just on equity deployment. and if i look kind of roughly the numbers, what's been done in china, in india in the last couple of quarters, it's maybe like 10 to a little bit more than that, 10% plus of your equity deployment this year. is that kind of the right level? or i mean we see some of the bloomberg new energy forecast where deployment of capital in asia could be 40%, 50% of capital deployed for the next 20 years.
is that a percentage that we should see just continue to steadily climb higher? and if so, is there sort of a cadence to that growth? or are we at the sort of 10%, 20% pace for a while now?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. so we don't tend to be too prescriptive and look to remain flexible, able to deploy our capital wherever we see the most attractive opportunities. what we have seen in india and china since we entered those markets in 2017 is we've built out our platforms, both operational and investment platforms regionally on the ground in both those markets. and what we're seeing now is the ability on an almost continuous basis to do small attractive bolt-on acquisitions in those regions, and we would expect that to continue going forward.
i think when it comes to geographic focus of our investments, we've long said that 75% plus of our portfolio and our equity is going to be deployed into developed countries, and then 20%, 25% in developing countries. we don't expect that to change going forward. there may be periods of time where we see more opportunity in india or china versus, let's say, north america or europe. but over any extended period, we expect to stay pretty close to that 75% plus in developed countries and 20% to 25% in developing countries.
mark jarvi -- cibc world markets -- analyst
ok. thanks. 
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of andrew kuske with credit suisse.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks. good morning. and i guess the question is for connor. and it really builds upon your solutions provider comments throughout this call.
and i guess just philosophically, how do you think about brookfield renewables business on a longer-term basis? are you effectively incubating other businesses underneath for later monetization potential? clearly, you've been doing that with assets over time, but are now you're expanding the portfolio into a number of business lines, which can be unique and distinct in their own right.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
it's a good question, andrew. and maybe it's easiest to tell you around our philosophy and why we think we're well positioned. there's a few things when we look at being that type of solutions provider. over 70% of carbon emissions around the world can be traced back directly or indirectly to power generation in the energy sector.
and by being a leading player in that space and having knowledge of clean energy technologies that we have through decades of owning and operating wind, solar, hydro, storage, distributed generation, we're very well placed to extrapolate that knowledge to other forms of decarbonization solutions. what i would say in, call it, more direct response to your question is, we're not changing our approach to investing or changing our approach to risk tolerance as we pursue more of these decarbonization solutions. we still are going to focus on owning real assets that are supported by long-term highly visible cash flows. we want to look at solutions where we aren't taking binary risk, either binary technology risk or binary development risk.
that's never been core to our strategy. and we want to focus on those solutions where investing in scale or leveraging our global platform differentiates us. so the one point i would make about the question, which was a great one, is we're not going to look to be on the leading edge taking technology risk as we pursue these decarbonization solutions, but rather looking to be a counterparty to governments and businesses where we can be either a scale capital provider or a scale operating partner in terms of installing, building or operating commercially viable, cost-effective, readily available existing technology solutions.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
that's very helpful color and commentary. and i guess the extension of that, if we look back in time, brookfield was never a leader in the beginning stages of solar or wind. and as the technology became more viable and more economic then you really entered full force? so how do you think about batteries really in that context? what kind of time frame do you think batteries will become much more economic and more viable for your larger scale capital?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
fantastic question. and i would say we are following the battery sector very, very closely. and maybe beyond the battery sector, the broader energy storage sector. and we think the different energy storage solutions that are being considered right now, it isn't going to be necessarily one winner that comes out of them, but a number of them may be complementary to each other, whether it's increasing penetration of lithium-ion batteries or the increasing improvements people are seeing in kind of longer-duration iron-air batteries or the scale energy storage that traditional pumped hydro can provide.
i would say we're following all of these technologies. the one comment i would make, andrew, is we are increasingly installing batteries in select cases within our portfolio today. while batteries are not commercially viable on a widespread basis at this point in select situations within our portfolio, they are commercially viable today, and we are installing batteries, and we see an increasing number of those situations cropping up across our portfolio, particularly in north america. so because we're already seeing that trend, we would see batteries becoming a larger and investable large-scale opportunity, i would say, in the relative short to medium term, definitely in the next few years.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. very helpful. thank you. 
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of frederic bastien with raymond james.
frederic bastien -- raymond james -- analyst
hi. connor, just circling back on the polish renewable business. how far are you and equinor from breaking ground on the offshore wind project?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
yes. so there's still a number of things to be done. our expectation would be to start construction in 2023, and everything is on track to do that at this point.
frederic bastien -- raymond james -- analyst
and would you look to get this development under your belt or at least well underway before investing in other offshore projects? are you indifferent to that and open to potentially investing in newer ones right now?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
absolutely, we would invest in other offshore opportunities today using our same approach, finding those opportunities that play to our strength, where we see attractive risk-adjusted returns. we've been incredibly comfortable with the offshore space for a number of years at this point. the opportunity in poland was one where we were able to transact with a counter-party we liked, an investment profile that we thought provided us appropriate upside with strong downside protection. if we could find similar attractive opportunities, we would invest significantly in offshore readily today.
frederic bastien -- raymond james -- analyst
gotcha. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of naji baydoun with ia capital markets.
naji baydoun -- ia private wealth -- analyst
good morning. just staying on the topic of offshore wind. i'm just curious about your -- the third project in your pipeline. i believe it's baltic one.
is there a view of maybe bidding that project in the polish auction process in 2025, be it subsidy-free or otherwise?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
absolutely. so we have a third project. it's very large. it's about the same size as the other two projects combined.
and because there was less visibility around that project initially, we weren't as prescriptive in our underwriting. but given the increased support that we're seeing and the increased rapid maturation of the polish offshore wind segment that 1.5 gigawatt project, we think, is increasingly valuable. and while no decisions have been made, we will certainly look for opportunities to find ways to build out or monetize that asset in the future. we think there's definitely upside there, and it's a great project, but we're still a number of years before we need to make any significant decisions.
naji baydoun -- ia private wealth -- analyst
ok. but i suppose the decision hasn't been made about either developing it or selling it definitely, just kind of maintaining flexibility there?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
absolutely. no decisions made yet.
naji baydoun -- ia private wealth -- analyst
maybe just a clarification about the increased stake to 40%. what would be the net of that to brookfield -- to bep?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. so we invest through our private fund where we own 25%. so on a look-through basis, we would be just shy of 10%.
naji baydoun -- ia private wealth -- analyst
ok. got it. perfect. just the last question on india.
if you could provide more color on the 1.7-gigawatt development pipeline with the joint venture. how quickly you think that can move forward and be developed and maybe if you think there's opportunities to add more prospects to that pipeline?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. so i might answer the second part of that question first. right now, our jv partnership only applies to that 1.7-gigawatt pipeline. so that's our focus at this point.
we're seeing a number of different opportunities around development or adding new assets in india, but they would be outside of this specific agreement. in terms of the other opportunities within that pipeline, there's two other projects that make up the remainder of those 1.7 gigawatt, those are both being, i would say, developed on plan with our counterparty. they're on a slightly deferred timeline as was always going to be expected. but we would see the opportunity to make a decision on whether or not we want to acquire those projects, we expect within the next couple of years.
that's probably an appropriate timeline. and the one thing i would reiterate is this is an option for us. we do not have to acquire the projects, but it is our option, too, if we think they represent attractive investment opportunities.
naji baydoun -- ia private wealth -- analyst
ok. so great detail. thank you. 
operator
thank you. now i will turn the call back over to ceo connor teskey for any closing remarks.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
ok. thank you, everyone. as always, we want to thank everyone for their continued support. we look forward to updating you at the end of next quarter with our q3 results.

these statements are subject to known and unknown risks, and our future results may differ materially. for more information, you are encouraged to review our regulatory filings available on sedar, edgar, and on our website. to kick off today's call, we will first provide an update on the business and our recent growth initiatives. next, wyatt will provide an overview of our operating results as well as our balance sheet and liquidity.
and following our remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. we continue to advance our goal of establishing brookfield renewable as one of the preeminent clean energy companies in the world. with approximately 56,000 megawatts of operating and development assets on five continents diversified across all major renewable technologies, we are on the ground in every major global market, providing our platform the flexibility to move capital across geographies to the opportunities with the best risk-adjusted returns. our balance sheet has significant access to capital to invest in the largest and most attractive growth opportunities, with over 3 billion of available liquidity plus access to our sovereign and institutional client capital to enable us to grow.
the stability of our business is underpinned by high-quality inflation-linked contracted cash flows that are diversified by both technology and region across a high-quality customer base, with a weighted average remaining contract duration of 14 years. over the last 50 years, there were a handful of global energy super majors that delivered sustained profitable growth. these businesses were defined by a global presence, operating capabilities and the scale to execute on the most attractive opportunities around the world. as decarbonization increasingly becomes an objective of the global economy, and more and more businesses look to power their operations and their products with green electricity, we believe that the next generation of energy super majors will have similar attributes to those of the past but with platforms and capabilities focused on clean energy.
with our global reach, our operating, development, and power marketing capabilities and our scale, we believe, we are uniquely positioned to capture the growing decarbonization opportunity. and we recently increased our annual target for investing equity capital into growth to 1 to 1.2 billion dollars. throughout our platform, we are consistently executing business plans that not only enhance and de-risk our existing assets, but also create future growth and development opportunities. accordingly, while the outlook to deploy capital through m&a remains robust, we also benefit from a number of fully financed organic growth projects that are already under construction and contracted.
we are fortunate to have operating capabilities to enhance the scale of these ongoing growth opportunities to further supplement our expansion through acquisitions. as a result, we are well positioned to continue to deliver strong ffo per unit growth to support our long-term distribution target of 5 to 9% annually. while we expect to continue to deploy increasing amounts of capital through acquisitions, we believe that we can achieve the upper end of our growth targets through organic initiatives alone. this comes from inflation escalation in our contracts, margin expansion through revenue growth and cost reduction initiatives, and the building out of our growing development pipeline, including eight gigawatts of capacity over the next three years at premium returns.
we will now walk you through the highlights for the quarter. we generated record third quarter funds from operations of $210 million or $0.33 per unit, a 32% increase over the same period in the prior year, as our assets continue to perform well with high levels of asset availability and contributions from new acquisitions. we agreed to 19 power purchase agreements for approximately 1,300 gigawatt hours of renewable generation with corporate offtakers across major industries. we progressed approximately 8,000 megawatts of development projects through construction and advanced stage permitting.
we also added approximately 5,000 megawatts to our global development pipeline, which is now approximately 36,000 megawatts. we invested or agreed to invest approximately $2.4 billion, or $600 million net to brookfield renewable, of equity across a range of transactions year to date. and finally, we have maintained a robust balance sheet, with over $3.3 billion of available liquidity and no meaningful near-term maturities. now turning to our growth initiatives.
this quarter, we executed on several growth opportunities that demonstrate the value of our global platform, deploying capital across multiple technologies and jurisdictions, enhancing our position as a leading diversified clean energy business. we continue to grow our leading distributed generation business, both in the united states and globally, positioning us as a partner of choice to companies and other institutions by providing a one-stop solution for on-site and off-site energy generation, storage and efficiency services. in the u.s., we have grown our distributed generation business by almost five times since the beginning of the year to 3,600 megawatts of operating and development assets. we accomplished this through a combination of acquisitions, both larger scale platforms and smaller tuck-ins; and organic growth initiatives such as channel partnerships, joint development agreements, and our recently announced cooperation agreement with trane technologies.
recently, in europe and latin america, we agreed to acquire interest in portfolios of an aggregate 785 megawatts of operating and development assets for a total investment of $250 million, or $60 million net to brookfield renewable. further, in china, our rooftop solar joint venture with a local partner has continued its strong growth momentum and is expected to have 400 megawatts of operating assets by the end of 2021, in addition to a further development pipeline of over one gigawatt in the region. as one of the only globally diversified dg platforms, we believe we are uniquely positioned to leverage our customer relationships and economies of scale on a global basis, to maximize each of our regional businesses and continue our current track record of substantial growth. in addition, we signed an agreement to acquire three late-stage solar development projects in the u.s., which have a total installed capacity of 475 megawatts.
we will be closing on each of these projects once they have been significantly de-risked, which is expected over the next 12 to 24 months. concurrently, we are progressing ppa discussions with a large corporate buyer of renewable power to fully contract the generation. the projects are expected to be commissioned by 2024. and we expect to invest $135 million of equity, or $35 million net to brookfield renewable.
we are also in the early stages of seeing meaningful growth in emerging technologies. one that we are following very closely is green hydrogen. green hydrogen plays to the strengths that have defined our business for decades: knowledge of global power markets, clean energy expertise, large-scale capital, and best-in-class operating and development capabilities. although still in its relative infancy, the potential market for green hydrogen is significant due to its storage capabilities, and the ability to address harder to-abate emissions coming from the heavy-duty and industrial sectors such as long-haul transport and steel production.
and while green hydrogen is not yet economic on a widespread basis, we are increasingly seeing specific opportunities to invest at attractive risk-adjusted returns. we are currently advancing almost one gigawatt of green hydrogen opportunities, positioning us well to be a first mover so that we can invest in scale as the cost curve continues to come down and the technology is adopted more broadly. in addition to our agreement to fully energize a hydrogen company's planned green hydrogen production plant in pennsylvania, one of the first industrial-scale facilities in north america, we are also progressing one of canada's largest green hydrogen projects, providing green hydrogen to a pipeline operator as the offtaker for injection into its natural gas network in quebec, with construction targeted to start next year. with that, i'll turn the call over to wyatt to discuss our operating results and financial position. 
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
thank you, connor. in the third quarter, we generated ffo of $210 million or $0.33 per unit, a 32% year-over-year increase as our business benefited from recent acquisitions and strong asset availability. globally, we are seeing elevated power prices as economies around the world ramp back up. our business is well positioned in this environment.
although our portfolio is almost entirely contracted, we have been able to benefit across our hydroelectric and storage businesses, given the ability of these facilities to provide dispatchable carbon-free baseload generation. for instance, in the u.k where below-average wind resource and elevated natural gas prices drove higher and more volatile power prices, our pumped hydro facility delivered record results during the quarter as we sold critical balancing and stabilizing services to the grid. in brazil where the country continues to deal with historically dry conditions, our production is well matched to our delivery obligations, but we are opportunistically leveraging government power procurement opportunities to recontract our assets to take advantage of the high price environment. and more broadly across our global portfolio, we have taken advantage of the strong pricing environment to both lock in attractive all-in pricing for our hydro facilities that are available for recontracting, as well as to secure attractive long-term ppas for new wind and solar development projects.
during the quarter, our hydroelectric segment delivered ffo of $142 million with favorable generation in the u.s. and colombia, offset by below-average generation in brazil and canada. the portfolio continues to exhibit strong resilient cash flows, given the increasingly diversified asset base and high asset availability. our wind and solar segments generated a combined $130 million of ffo.
we continue to generate stable revenues from these assets and benefit from the growth in the business and highly contracted nature of the cash flows with long duration power purchase agreements. our energy transition segment generated $48 million of ffo during the quarter as our portfolio continues to grow while we assist our commercial and industrial partners achieve their decarbonization goals and become their partner of choice for energy transition solutions. despite widespread challenges to global supply chain, we are making good progress executing on our approximately 7,000-megawatt construction pipeline. in the u.s., our wind repowering projects are progressing well.
at our new york project, over half of the turbines are operating, and we expect to complete the remainder by the end of the year. at our shepherds flat project in oregon, the repowering equipment is on site. and we have begun replacing the turbines, in line with our plan to deliver the project by the end of next year. in brazil, during the quarter we delivered our 360-megawatt alex solar project ahead of schedule, and construction is progressing on our 1,200-megawatt janauba solar project.
we also expect to start construction on our 270-megawatt brazilian wind project in the first half of 2022. finally, in poland, following the award of an inflation-linked 25-year contract for 1,400 megawatts of offshore wind capacity, we are finalizing the environmental permits and have begun to procure turbines. these opportunities represent only a subset of the organic growth initiatives that we expect to execute on the coming years. next, looking at our balance sheet and liquidity.
our financial position continues to be strong. we have approximately $3.3 billion of available liquidity. our investment-grade balance sheet has no meaningful near-term maturities. and approximately 90% of our financings are nonrecourse to brookfield renewable.
during the quarter, we continued to take advantage of low interest rates and executed on almost $2 billion of investment-grade financing and other financing initiatives across the business. we also continued to execute on several initiatives to further bolster our liquidity and support growth. recently, we raised approximately $700 million of proceeds from strategic upfinancings and capital recycling initiatives, including agreeing to the sale of our mexican assets developed by x-elio, our global solar developer, for $400 million, more than doubling our invested capital over our two-year hold period. looking forward, we expect to continue to generate meaningful proceeds from these initiatives as the market for de-risked renewables continues to be strong, and the positive price environment and increasing demand for clean baseload power has created significant contracting and financing capacity within our hydro fleet.
with a robust pipeline of capital deployment opportunities, we remain committed to a growth plan that is not reliant on equity funding. we continue to focus on growing and diversifying our business and executing on our key operational priorities, including maintaining a robust balance sheet, access to diverse sources of capital, and creating value through enhanced cash flows from our existing portfolio. we remain committed to helping our partners achieve their decarbonization goals; and in the process, earning our investors a strong total return of 12 to 15% over the long term. on behalf of the board and management, we thank all of our unitholders and shareholders for their ongoing support.
that concludes our formal remarks for today's call. thank you for joining us this morning. and with that, i'll pass it back to the operator for questions.

[operator instructions]. our first question comes from sean steuart with td securities.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
thank you. good morning. a couple of questions to get through. connor or wyatt, can you give us -- can you quantify the gains you secured in the quarter on wind development project sales and the brazil balancing pool catchup? to what extent did those items support ebitda and ffo this quarter?
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
yes, sean, thanks for the question. it's wyatt here. so in both cases, the gains on the wind sales, the development assets, as well as the brazilian regulatory matter that you referenced, each of those is around 15 to $20 million. so in aggregate, they were around 30 to 35 million of benefit to our results in the quarter.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
ok. and in brazil, that would be the end of those catch-up payments, i suppose?
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
i would expect so, but we have been positively surprised as the benefit has continued to come. so i would expect so, but who knows, there could be further additional benefit.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
ok. thanks for that detail. and you referenced your ability to lock in attractive pricing for recontracting for some hydro facilities. can you give us some context on the scale and terms for those initiatives, and the potential for follow-on success on that front as well?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
sure, sean. it's connor here. thank you for the question. there's probably a couple of points we would make there.
first and foremost, we've always felt that this has been an underappreciated upside lever within our business. particularly in our north american hydro portfolio, we have fantastic exposure to higher power prices that really has not shown through in recent years. and in the current environment, our ability to lock in those attractive prices in today's environment is one of the reasons why we're so confident heading into next year, our ability to hit the high end of our earnings targets on just organic initiatives alone. there's two other points that it's probably helpful to add, which is something we're seeing around power contracting within our hydro portfolio and across wind and solar, which is just a tremendous increase of demand driven by two things: one, more and more corporates and off-takers looking to secure power, a greater number of customers.
and then two, for some of our largest customers around the world, they're now signing very large-scale ppas for very significant amounts of power, often taking 100% of the production from either a solar asset or a large wind farm or a hydro. and we're seeing that across all of our technologies, not just hydro, and that allows us to not only secure but lock in some of these gains for a longer duration. and then the last point perhaps to be made is it's great that we're getting these higher prices, particularly in our north american hydros. but the other thing that's really supporting the performance of our hydros is their ability to provide other -- or their -- our -- their ability, sorry, to generate other forms of revenue streams.
more and more ancillary services, grid balancing services, given their embedded storage capabilities with more and more intermittency going on to global power grids, we're not only seeing our hydros generate more revenue from the power they sell, but also generating more revenues from these additional ancillary revenue streams. and that's a theme we think is going to continue for a number of years to come.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
thanks for that detail, connor. i will get back in queue. thanks very much.
operator
our next question comes from rupert merer with national bank financial.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
good morning, everyone. going back to brazil, can you discuss the outlook for brazil over the next few months with that continued drought? and remind us how does the centralized pooling mechanism work for you going forward in this type of environment?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
good morning, rupert. i'll take the first part of that, and then hand to wyatt for the second half. there's two comments we would make about the current hydrology conditions in brazil and how it affects our business. the first that we would reiterate, and we reiterated it in our letter.
the way we power market in brazil is we always leave cushion in our delivery obligations to ensure that even in periods of low hydrology, we're never overextended and caught short. and this year, that has proven to be very beneficial. and we see ourselves in a great position to match our ongoing supply to those delivery obligations, both for the remainder of this year and into 2022. the other thing that we would highlight, and one month certainly does not create a trend, but october is the beginning of the call it rainy season in brazil.
and the country and ourselves were very fortunate that there was a tremendous amount of rain in october. so there does seem to be some modest relief. we'll see if that continues. but the good news for us, given how our portfolio is structured and how our delivery obligations are structured, is that incremental hydrology is essentially excess power that we can sell into the market, capitalizing on the high prices in the region today.
i'll hand to wyatt about the central pooling.
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
yes, rupert. effectively the central pooling mechanism, it just socializes generation risk across the entire country. so you don't take any specific facility exposure. really, it's how does the overall country, the pooling of generation across the country, how does that generate? and then you get allocated a percentage of that based on the capacity of facilities.
so the long and the short of it is it just socializes any specific risk across a broader portfolio. and so what we would say for the upcoming year is depending on how the rainy season goes over these next two months, but if reservoirs stay at kind of historic lows, we will get -- in line with all generators around the country, we will get allocated below what we would normally expect. but in our case, that is -- we don't expect that to be a meaningful impact to our business. because as connor mentioned on the -- we still expect to get allocated what we've contracted and where we have delivery obligations.
and right now, we still expect to get some additional generation that we can sell into the market. and as connor referenced, that's into a very strong pricing. so i hope that answered your question.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
yes, that's great. yes, thanks for the color. and secondly, you're highlighting one gigawatt of hydrogen pipeline potential with your disclosures. can you give us a little more color on what's the time line on this? maybe what would be your scope of supply? what could the contracts look like? any color you can give there?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
sure, rupert. i'll take that one. so we would reiterate that green hydrogen is still in its very, very early innings. and it is not cost-effective on a widespread basis.
but the cost curve is declining very, very rapidly. and we'll really put our activities in the space in two buckets. there are some, i would say, smaller near-term opportunities where we do see the potential to build electrolyzers of a very modest size, we would highlight that, although a very modest size to support clean fuel obligations or specific industries that get subsidies. and therefore, green hydrogen can be cost-effective today.
there is one project that we highlighted in our opening remarks and our letter that we are well advanced on and we hope to begin construction on next year. and that's in north america. the second component of the opportunities we're looking at is much larger. and we're looking at opportunities both within our own portfolio and third-party opportunities where we can bring our capabilities to bear, our knowledge of power markets, our knowledge of clean energy technologies, our development capabilities, our large-scale capital, such that as the cost curve comes down and as the demand for green hydrogen increases, we will be well placed in the future to invest significant dollars into the space when green hydrogen becomes cost-effective on a widespread basis.
that second bucket is still a number of years away. it is likely an opportunity that develops in larger scale in the middle part of this decade. but what we're doing right now is getting prepared such that we will be in a pole position to invest in scale when that opportunity does materialize.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
thanks for the color. i will leave it there.
operator
our next question comes from nelson ng with rbc capital markets.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everyone. just a quick follow-up on rupert's question on green hydrogen. so you mentioned that the larger projects are still years away.
so big picture, like roughly how much capital will brookfield be deploying over the next call it two to four years? is it not very material, including the project that could start construction next year?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
nelson, i think that's fair. we would classify it as modest. it is something that we view as a large-scale opportunity in the future that we're well positioned to be a leader in. but we would expect the capital deployment in the next few years to be modest, likely in call it the low hundred millions of dollars range.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. got it. and that would be net to bep, or for bep and their institutional investors?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
that's probably in total for bep and institutional investors.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. and then the next question just relates to the three solar developments that you're acquiring, the 475 megawatts in the u.s. can you give some color as to where those projects are located? and will they be paired with batteries?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
yes, certainly. so these projects are located right in the heart of america, right in the midwest. the current plan is not to pair them with batteries, but that is an option that we do have for the future. our intention on these projects, and it is a process that we are relatively well advanced on, is to secure a long-term corporate offtake for 100% of the generation.
that's something we'd hope to do before the end of the year. and the economics of the projects stack up on just the solar in that contract, but we do preserve the optionality to install batteries in the future.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. thanks a lot. and then just one last question before i get back in the queue. in terms of the initial 26% interest acquisition of a 750-megawatt project in spain and mexico, is that wind and solar, or wind or solar? and then i think it mentions the potential to increase your stake to 60%.
can you just give some color on i guess what scenario where you would increase the stake?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly, nelson, and i'll clear up a couple of things there. i believe the opportunity you are speaking about is a distributed generation investment we made this quarter. it's a european-based company that has assets both in iberia and latam. and the structure of the investment is such that we made an initial investment into the company to fund the near-term visible growth pipeline.
the company has a large capex pipeline ahead of it but was in need of capital. so we have committed today to fund that initial growth. we also have the right but not the obligation to invest future dollars into that business at pre-agreed valuations. and based on the business plan for the company, we absolutely expect to do that.
so it's a distributed generation business. it's purely solar. we invest an initial amount today with a plan to -- with the right but not the obligation to invest more in the future. i'll make two more comments here.
the first is despite we starting only with a minority position, we do have co-control of the business. and we are partnering with what we think is an exceptional management team. and then the other comment we would make, and it's something we really wanted to highlight this quarter, is we've long had a leading distributed generation business in north america and a leading distributed generation in asia pac. but through a couple of acquisitions, we now have acquired dg capabilities both in europe and in latam.
and with the very significant growth we see in dg and the increasing tailwinds for the sector, we are quite proud of the global capability we've assembled. and we think that will be a huge differentiator for us when dealing with large global clients as we may be the only, if not one of the only, providers of dg services on a global basis.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks for the color, connor. i'll get back in the queue.
operator
our next question comes from david quezada with raymond james.
david quezada -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everyone. my first question just on your development pipeline. you saw a pretty significant increase on the quarter.
wondering if you could just discuss what drove that with respect to geography and modality? and maybe some commentary around the pace of opportunities you've seen in the last few months as it relates to the development pipeline.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
great, david. i'll maybe highlight the pace of opportunities and some more thematic trends. i'll let wyatt provide the detail of exactly where that additional pipeline comes from. there's really two things going on in our business that is leading to our development pipeline growing consistently on a quarter-to-quarter basis.
and that is a process we started i would say a number of years ago, three to four years ago, that's really hitting its stride in today's market. which is we now, in each of our regional platforms, have personnel focused on generating organic development pipeline. and this allows us to not only grow our pipeline completely in-house, but it also allows us to make small acquisitions -- or large acquisitions, i should say, at any point in the development life cycle in any of our major geographies. and that is why there's just such an expansive growth opportunity set in development that we didn't necessarily have the global capability to capture five years ago.
today, we have that in each of our target markets. and with the growth in renewables, there's certainly a large opportunity for them to capture. secondly, on your comment about where we're seeing the opportunities from a technological perspective, it is across all technologies. we're quite excited that within our portfolio, our construction pipeline, we do have wind.
we do have solar. we do have hydro coming through as well. but make no mistake about it, the vast majority of our growth ongoing today and our near-term pipeline in the future is in solar. that is where we are seeing the greatest amount of growth, both currently and we expect that to continue for a couple of years, at least.
wyatt, i'll hand to you.
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
yes. and just to echo what connor mentioned, our development activities have been growing meaningfully. and as a result, their development pipeline has. the specifics around this quarter, the increase from prior quarter to this quarter, is largely on the back of one distributed generation we just -- through both our trane partnership as well as other initiatives that are ongoing.
we've been increasing that development pipeline. and then secondly from a utility-scale solar perspective, again a lot of that is focused in the u.s. those were the main additions this quarter. but as connor mentioned, that's just a snapshot of this quarter.
but broadly, our development pipeline is diversified across multiple technologies and geographies. and we continue to see additions to that pipeline over the longer term in each of those areas.
david quezada -- raymond james -- analyst
fantastic. that's great color. and then maybe just one other for me, i guess maybe more of a longer-term strategic question. on the topic of carbon credits, i think we've seen pricing for voluntary credits increased quite a bit.
i'm just curious, well, a, if you have any upside across your footprint from the creation of carbon credits? and b, would you consider targeting a new class of investments in that space?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. so on your first point, are we seeing upside? the answer is absolutely yes. and one thing we've been looking to do within our portfolio for a number of years now is the generation we have produces a lot of credits. and we always want to make sure we're maximizing those and maximizing the value of those.
and the growing demand for those credits is showing up in the pricing. and therefore, it has become a more meaningful value driver for our business and something that is driving some of that organic growth that we see. to your point around is it affecting strategy? to the extent that carbon prices, carbon taxes, carbon credits, we -- to the extent they affect electricity prices, we obviously take that into our underwriting. to the extent they affect the economics of any of our underlying investments, we absolutely do take that into our underwriting.
it's just a revenue stream. and we think about it, can we manage that revenue stream? can we optimize that revenue stream? what is the stability of it? is there upside or downside to those revenues? so it absolutely is an increasing revenue stream, i would say, across a number of our asset classes and in a number of our regions. but we don't think about it any differently than we do other revenue lines. and it's something that comes to us very naturally to just bake into our investment decisions and our operating decisions going forward.
david quezada -- raymond james -- analyst
excellent. thanks, connor. i appreciate it. i will get back in the queue.
operator
our next question comes from mark jarvi with cibc.
mark jarvi -- cibc -- analyst
i was wondering if you could just touch on x-elio. it's been a couple of years since you bought in to that business. just curious on kind of your view on how the asset sales have gone, the pace of growth. i think originally maybe you were suggesting you could do about 500 megawatts a year development.
is that still the right amount that you're looking at for that business?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
mark, thank you for the question. we love to talk about x-elio. this has been a -- we're thrilled with the performance of the business and the performance of the team that runs it. the business has always had a focus on developing assets.
building assets and then recycling capital from assets that have been constructed, and reinvesting that back into more accretive development, and really creating this virtuous circle of capital recycling. and i would say that the business is certainly firing on all cylinders, but there's probably two things we would highlight the most. the first is the pace of capital recycling has been very, very strong. it continued this quarter with the signing of the sale of the mexican assets.
and in only approximately two years of owning the business, we've been able to recycle the vast majority of the existing operating assets and redeploy that capital into development. and what that has done is it's given the business tremendous firepower to expand its development pipeline. and while years ago when we -- only two years ago when we invested in the company, there were hopes of 500 of development, 500 of construction, and 500 of asset sales every year, we would expect the business in the current environment to be working toward targets of almost double that. and the management team is doing a tremendous job of growing the business and growing the pipeline toward those objectives.
so we're thrilled with the business, and our ambitions for it have certainly grown since our acquisition two years ago.
mark jarvi -- cibc -- analyst
that's very helpful. and then can you mind us again, connor, do you have the right to buy out your partner? i know you guys bought out some of the investors in that. is there an option to acquire full control of that business?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
there is no buyout right on that business. we have a great supportive partner there. there's no buyout right.
mark jarvi -- cibc -- analyst
ok. and there was talk earlier about some of the real benefits of the hydro assets is the ancillary revenue streams. are you going to quantify that at all? or at least sort of guide in terms of -- i mean we talked about carbon pricing. you had a discussion on that at the investor day around uplift on ffo.
but just what you're seeing in the volatility of the market, in terms of what you think utility revenues can sort of step up over the next couple of years, if some of the stuff we've seen in the last year or two persist?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
good question, mark. we're not going to give a dollar guidance. but if you look at the increase in power prices, and you look at the forward curves that are liquid and we can lock in today, there is a material amount of upside there. and we are working to harvest and crystallize that.
part of the reason why we don't want to give specific guidance is we actually think it would understate the opportunity. the real joy of having those perpetual assets of significant scale, the only source of green baseload power in the world today, is there's a number of knock-on effects. perhaps most importantly, as power prices increase and you can lock in those power prices, you can also do significant upfinancing on those assets, and that gives us capital to very accretively redeploy into growth. and that knock-on impact is very material and absolutely generated by the increase in power prices and the potential to recontract some of those assets over the longer term at more attractive rates.
and we hope to execute on that and bring some real-world examples to life, i would say, in the next six to 12 months.
mark jarvi -- cibc -- analyst
got it. and my last --
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
mark, just to add, the other thing i would just say is we did put -- we've defined out some numbers as part of our investor day presentation. and i would just say the environment around pricing has only gotten better. so the numbers we would have defined out, we would just say we have more confidence in being able to achieve them, and as connor mentioned, even potentially outperform.
mark jarvi -- cibc -- analyst
got it. that makes sense. last question for me is just around the u.s. reconciliation bill and some of the tax credit extension.
there's obviously some domestic content almost tied to getting the sort of premium incentives. is there any challenges of that in terms of transitioning where you're procuring today versus maybe bringing more from the u.s. supply? and does it impact the dg business any differently than the utility-scale business?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. and those bills and a number of what i would call regulatory matters as it pertains to equipment in the renewable power space, a lot of them are being socialized but aren't locked in yet. and what we're doing is we're positioning our business very well to manage and outperform, no matter what environment ends up being crystallized. and this is really a benefit of our centralized procurement.
we have people within our platform whose sole job it is to one, ensure we're getting the cheapest source of equipment across all of our technologies. but two, no different than we almost think about raising capital for our business, ensuring that we have diversified sources. such that as markets change and as regulations change in different regions, we're always flexible and have the ability to capitalize on that. so we're following all those changes very closely, but we would say we expect to be very well positioned to manage them no matter how they come out.
to your question on does it affect dg versus utility scale? we're not seeing too much of a difference there.
mark jarvi -- cibc -- analyst
ok. thanks a lot. appreciate that, connor.

our next question comes from mark strouse with j.p. morgan.
mark strouse -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yes. good morning. thank you very much for taking my questions. just wanted to go back to an earlier question on your development side.
when you look at input prices increasing kind of across your different technologies, can you talk about your ability to pass on those higher input prices in the form of higher ppas? and is that leading to somewhat of a dichotomy between your different technologies and leaning -- making you lean toward a particular technology, at least near term?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
great question, mark. and simply yes to the first part, no to the second part. on the first part, are we seeing the opportunity to pass those higher input costs through to ppas? absolutely. there's no question about that.
wyatt in his remarks highlighted some of the new development projects that we're hoping to pull out of the ground starting next year. and we've seen in almost all our geographies the ability to win looking to simultaneously secure equipment. we're being able to pass through that increased price into the ppa. to your second question, is that leading to big swings or changes into which technologies we're focusing on? not typically.
maybe very briefly around the edges, but it has not been material. the majority of our development continues to be solar, then followed by wind. we're not really seeing huge shifts in that mix as a result of equipment prices.
mark strouse -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. thanks for that. and maybe kind of similar kind of question from a geographical perspective, are there certain regions that have maybe less impact from transportation issues or geopolitics, whatever it might be?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
i would say the supply chain issues are relatively global. the reason why we're pausing in answering the question is it's almost more project level than it is geographic. i don't think we're seeing difficulty in securing wind turbines or solar panels for brazil versus europe. i would say it's pretty consistent.
and the -- maybe a more helpful response to your question is, there is no doubt that the supply chain disruptions have gone on a little longer than expected. but to be clear, they are having a very small, if not minimal, impact on our business. the way that we like to quantify that internally is the impacts of supply chain disruption are not changing any of our investment decisions at this point. and they have not changed any of our construction time lines.
so while it is something that from an operational perspective, we have needed to manage through, and our team has been dedicated to managing and solving any issues that pop up. it really hasn't affected any of our construction time lines or our expected investment returns at this point.
mark strouse -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. very helpful. thanks, connor.
operator
our next question comes from andrew kuske with credit suisse.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you, and good morning. i guess as a big picture question for you, connor, and it's really how you see bep on a longer-term basis. and i guess i ask the question in part -- do you see bep as kind of an umbrella organization for a lot of the efforts you have in renewable power and clean tech? and i ask the question in part because you've also kind of carved out the canadian hydro business on the evolugen kind of unit as it stands now, with a bit of the green hydrogen opportunity embedded in there. just how do you see the longer-term evolution of bep? and is it partly to develop companies internally, and then eventually spin them into the market when appropriate?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
thanks, andrew. i would say our strategy remains the same. and we rebranded our canadian business evolugen, but it really didn't change the way we operated it whatsoever. today, we run our business regionally.
we like to be local in every market that we operate. and within those regions, we have operating and m&a capabilities across all technologies as well all technologies on a regional basis. and when it comes to how we would look to monetize investments in the future, we're always going to be opportunistic. we're always going to look to only recycle capital, when we think the compensation we will receive is greater than what we would earn by holding it.
but at this point, there's really no change in our strategy. and we view ourselves as a long-term owner and operator of assets. we will recycle de-risked assets. but the regions that we operate in are all core to us.
and we expect to be in the in those regions as players in perpetuity, growing our platforms, not looking to exit any of them.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. that's helpful clarity. and then i guess just on the further development of the platform and really the acceleration of equity capital for growth and really starting to solidify some of that pipeline, are you at the point where you have enough confidence in the pipeline and the outlook on the pipeline? and then obviously the value that gets associated with that pipeline to order turbines in advance or order panels in advance, so you've got a very active forward queue. and in some cases in certain jurisdictions, you have to safe harbor them for tax reasons.
i guess where are you in the process? i mean partly, it's an inflation-based question on can you secure pipeline to effectively avoid that or mitigate it to a certain degree?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
absolutely fantastic question. and the most overarching thing that guides our timing and our approach to securing equipment is we like to time the acquisition of equipment and the locking in of an equipment purchase with the time that we lock in the ppa for that project. in that way, we can lock those two things in at the same time. and if equipment prices change or power prices change in the future, it doesn't infect -- it doesn't affect the investment returns of our deployed capital.
so that is absolutely the single largest driving factor in how and when we procure equipment. and what it ensures is we aren't ever in a position where we lock in a ppa price, and then capex goes up, and our investment returns are severely degraded. that is the downside we look to take off the table. in certain situations we will, on the margin, look to buy equipment ahead of time for exactly the reasons you mentioned, things such as safe harbor, only if we are extremely confident.
but i would really focus everyone on the first driving factor, because that dictates the vast majority of when and how we procure equipment across both wind and solar.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
if i may just sneak one more in, and it just really relates given your size, are you finding less supply chain issues versus, say, smaller players in the industry?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
i wouldn't want to comment on what other people are feeling. what i would say is given our size -- and apologies for almost treating it like a buzzword, but our centralized procurement. we do develop these high-quality long-term relationships with tier 1 equipment manufacturers. and we all recognize the current supply chain disruptions are a short-term blip in a long-term growth story, both for us as a business and for them as equipment suppliers.
and what it leads to is very pragmatic problem solving to help us achieve our goals. and i think where that really shows up is are we working through the supply chain disruptions? absolutely, yes, but it hasn't affected any of our construction time lines. and i would say that is a great illustration of our ability to work well with those tier 1 suppliers to adjust things around the edges as needed, but in a way that doesn't hurt our economics. and we're going to come out of this situation even stronger partners than when we went into it.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. very helpful. thank you.

[operator instructions]. our next question comes from anthony crowdell with mizuho.
anthony crowdell -- mizuho securities -- analyst
good morning, wyatt. good morning, connor. hopefully, a quick question, and i -- thanks for all the detail in the slide deck. just it seems that there's a lot of winds or maybe a lot of tailwinds in the eep plan.
it looks like the bottom end of the distribution growth rate is unlikely that you'd hit that 5%. any thoughts on narrowing or raising that low end of the distribution growth rate? and i'll leave it there.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. thank you, anthony, for the question. there is no doubt a very constructive and strong long-term outlook for our business. when we think about our distribution, we are very firmly committed to that 5 to 9% annual growth rate of the distribution.
but the biggest deciding factor for us is are we seeing attractive opportunities to put that capital to work in the business. and given the very strong growth pipeline we have today, both on the organic side, as well as the pipeline of m&a opportunities, that is going to be the single largest decider of where we set that distribution growth rate going forward. and given the tremendous opportunities we do see, i would expect that -- we expect to increase the growth rate similar to how we have in recent years.
anthony crowdell -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. so just to make sure i understand it, the lower end of that range is probably more indicative of just the ability to keep growing, or the ability to get attractive projects, versus that there's a failed execution or something like that to the company that gets you at the low end?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
yes, absolutely. and i would say in this environment, the growth opportunities we see within our business are the best thing that we have going for us. and that's what's going to drive decisions around the distribution.
anthony crowdell -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question.

operator
good day. and thank you for standing by. welcome to the bep fourth quarter 2021 results conference call and webcast. [operator instructions] please be advised, today's conference may be recorded.
[operator instructions] i'd now like to hand the conference over to connor teskey, chief executive officer. please go ahead.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
thank you, operator. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2021 conference call. before we begin, we would like to remind you that a copy of our news release, investor supplement, and letter to unitholders can be found on our website. we also would like to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements on this call.
these statements are subject to known and unknown risks, and our future results may differ materially. for more information, you are encouraged to review our regulatory filings available on sedar, edgar, and on our website. to kick off today's call, we will provide an update on the business and our recent growth initiatives. after those remarks, wyatt will provide an overview of our operating results as well as our balance sheet and liquidity.
following those prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. 2021 was another very strong year for our business. we achieved record ffo per unit, continuing our track record of double-digit annual growth for over a decade. we agreed to deploy capital, in line with our targets growing in every major market we operate, and had a record year for development.
today, we have over 15,000 megawatts of capacity under construction or in late-stage development. and now have an overall global development pipeline of approximately 62,000 megawatts. we also maintained a strong balance sheet and executed over $13 billion of financings, generating $1.5 billion in proceeds from up financings, net to brookfield renewable bolstering our liquidity, enhancing our self-funding business model, and minimizing our exposure to increasing interest rates or near-term maturities. looking ahead, decarbonization is now firmly established as an objective of the global economy.
as one of the preeminent clean energy companies with a global presence, deep operating capabilities, and scale, we are uniquely positioned to execute on the most attractive decarbonization investment opportunities around the world. as we enter 2022, we continue to be one of the largest owners, operators, and builders of clean energy globally with best-in-class growth prospects and inflation-linked cash flows that are supported by double-digit years of weighted average contract life. given our strong financial and operating performance, robust liquidity, and positive outlook for the business, we are pleased to announce a 5% increase to our distribution to $1.28 per share on an annualized basis. this is the 11th consecutive year of at least 5% distribution growth since 2011 when brookfield renewable was spun-out, some of the highlights for the year include we generated ffo of $934 million or $1.45 per unit.
a 10% increase from 2020 or a 17% increase on a normalized basis. this resulted from the stability of our high-quality inflation-linked contracted cash flows, organic growth and commercial initiatives, and contributions from acquisitions. we advanced key commercial priorities, securing contracts to deliver 11,000-gigawatt hours of clean energy annually, including 6,000 hours to corporate off-takers. and we also completed saving initiatives that have delivered $20 million of savings on an annualized basis.
we commissioned approximately 1,000 megawatts of new capacity and have progressed over 15,000 megawatts through construction and advanced stage development. we also agreed to invest approximately $4.3 billion or approximately $1.1 billion net to brookfield renewable of growth capital across various transactions in every major market and technology we operate in. we further diversified our business with our first investment in offshore wind and we expanded both our hydroelectric and battery storage portfolios. and finally, we maintained a robust investment-grade balance sheet and ended the year with over $4 billion of available liquidity and access to significant sovereign and institutional capital that we can invest alongside of which provides enhanced flexibility for future growth.
next, we would like to spend a few minutes providing a spotlight on three important topics. first, the outlook for renewable energy, inflation, and global supply chains. second, our recent acquisition to acquire urban grid, and third, the strong growth in our distributed generation business. first off, we want to reiterate our enthusiasm about the macroeconomic trends we are seeing for global clean energy super majors.
it is projected that up to $5 trillion of annual investment will need to be spent over the next 30 years to support the decarbonization of energy systems. in addition, clean energy and electrification are the first largest, and most impactful steps to achieving net-zero. why? put simply because roughly three quarters of global emissions can be attributed back to power generation and the energy sector. this will lead to an unprecedented build-out of wind, solar, and other clean energy solutions over the next decade.
the growth of which will dramatically outpace what we have seen over the past 10 years. and as mentioned earlier, we believe we are uniquely positioned to execute on not only the most attractive but also the largest decarbonization investment opportunities in this environment. secondly, over the past couple of years, there has been a lot of discussion about global supply chains and inflation. there is no doubt that both have impacted our broader industry.
however, our globally diversified business and strong relationship with tier 1 suppliers mean we can manage supply chain disruptions such that they have not had any material impact on our business. our scale and centralized procurement function help us ensure that we are a priority client for solar panel and wind turbine manufacturers and give us operational flexibility. we have had to adjust the development programs for a small number of select assets, but we have held the commercialization dates of all of our projects, and none of those adjustments have had a material impact on our business or the returns of those investments. we believe many of these supply chain challenges are transitory.
however, we are confident that we are uniquely positioned to manage any challenges going forward to the extent that they persist. now, moving to inflation, whether we are in a period of transitory or sustained inflation, our business performs well in either environment. first, in terms of our operating assets, we foresee inflation as a tailwind to our business. this is due to the fact that a significant portion of our business has inflation indexation.
in fact, today over 70% of our contracts are indexed to inflation. further, we have a largely fixed cost structure with limited exposure to rising labor costs and capital expenditures. this together with the fact that we have effectively no direct exposure to rising interest rates means the compounding effect of inflating revenues should drive operating leverage across our platform. second, in our under-construction assets, we have always focused on avoiding basis risk by locking in major capex components at the same time, we signed ppas for projects.
so we have matched our costs and revenues and locked in at our attractive returns. finally, for our future development pipeline to the extent there is inflation that impacts project costs. for the most part, we have seen a willingness from buyers, a clean energy to share these costs through ppa price, as the benefits that our corporate clients see from decarbonization far outweigh the small cost increase they could start to face. unequivocally, we don't think inflation will meaningfully flow the adoption of clean energy if at all.
next, we will spend a few minutes talking about our recent acquisition of urban grid in north america. urban grid is a leading utility-scale solar developer in the united states with 20,000 megawatts of development pipeline and a leading position in the high-value pjm market. with this transaction, we have grown our global pipeline to approximately 62,000 megawatts. urban grid's pipeline includes 2,000 megawatts of under construction or ready-to-build solar projects.
in addition, there are 4,000 megawatts of de-risked advanced stage buildout opportunities, that we expect to backed with corporate contracts and build out over the next six years. further, there is also significant additional upside based on the depth of its remaining and growing pipeline. the purchase price for the acquisition was $650 million, and we view it as an opportunity to invest hundreds of millions of dollars into further growth in the future. the reasons we are excited about this transaction are numerous, but to highlight a few.
this was a bilaterally sourced opportunity where our ability to transact quickly and leverage our existing commercial relationships enabled us to transact with urban grid at attractive terms. these relationships when combined with the construction-ready and advanced-stage pipeline allow us to increase the scale of service to our largest customers as they look to achieve their own net-zero ambitions through the use of new-build solar. we are also extremely excited to work on alongside the experienced urban grid management team and build out their development pipeline of projects that are in high-value u.s. markets, such as pjm, miso, and tba.
all 13,000 megawatts of solar development in this pipeline have interconnection queue positions, which is specifically valuable in the pjm market, given the high demand for clean energy driven by significant data center load and increasing ambition -- ambitious rps targets and limited supply of sites giving -- given that the market is undergoing significant interconnection queue reform. as such, we are well-positioned to contract these projects, which are significantly de-risk from an interconnection perspective with our deep list of corporate customers. as a result of these dynamics, our target returns on this investment are in excess of our 12% to 15% return target. lastly, we also continue to execute on our growth plans for our distributed generation business in the fourth quarter.
with leading capabilities in north america, south america, europe, and asia, we are uniquely positioned to be a global solutions provider for clean onsite generation and decarbonization solutions. our global dg business is 1,400 megawatts of operating capacity and our global dg development pipeline has now increased to approximately 6,500 megawatts. over the past three years, our distributed generation portfolio grew revenue by approximately 40% annually, bolstered by the acquisitions and strategic partnerships we have signed. in the quarter, we expanded our portfolio by acquiring 780 megawatts of operating and development assets in europe and south america.
and we also signed a strategic agreement with shoals technologies group, a leading provider of balance of system solutions for storage, solar, and emobility, to pursue distributed renewable energy generation and ev charging solutions across the united states. we are uniquely positioned with leading capabilities across four continents and to provide global solution for those looking for clean on-site or behind-the-meter generation. with that, i'll turn the call over to wyatt to discuss our operating results and financial position. 
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
thank you, connor. in 2021, we generated ffo of $934 million or $1.45 per unit, a 10% increase from 2020 or 17% on a normalized basis. as the business benefited from recent acquisitions, strong underlying asset availability, and execution on organic growth initiatives. during the year, our hydroelectric segment delivered ffo of $639 million.
the portfolio continues to exhibit strong cash flow resiliency given the increasingly diversified asset base, strong price environment, and our recent recontracting initiatives delivering strong results even when generation was below long-term average. our wind and solar segments generated a combined $581 million of ffo, representing a 55% increase over the prior year. we benefited from contributions from acquisitions and approximately 770 megawatts of solar and wind projects commissioned during the year. our energy transition segment generated $162 million of ffo.
revenues from our pumped storage assets as well as our distributed generation portfolio continue to demonstrate strong growth as global electricity generation decarbonizes. next, looking at our balance sheet and liquidity. our financial position remains robust, with approximately $4.1 billion of total available liquidity at year-end, and our business model is self-funded. during the year, we executed on key financing and capital raising initiatives aimed at maintaining robust access to capital and a prudent debt maturity ladder, as well as a low-risk, investment-grade balance sheet.
during 2021, we continued to take advantage of the low-interest rate environment. as connor mentioned, we executed on $13 billion of investment-grade financings, including $1.5 billion up financings net to brookfield renewable, securing a weighted average debt maturity of 13 years with no material maturities over the next three years. with these financing activities completed, our business is well protected against the potential of rising interest rates. we have very limited exposure to near-term maturities or floating interest rates across our business.
we also continue to use opportunistic capital recycling as an important lever to drive value and fund growth. during the year, we executed on agreements to sell over 1,600 megawatts generating proceeds of $1.5 billion, including an agreement in the fourth quarter to sell a 625 megawatt solar pv portfolio in mexico at an attractive valuation of $400 million, which is more than double our underwritten value. before we hand it over for the question-and-answer session, i want to spend a few minutes on two topics, our development pipeline, as well as our recent cad1.2 billion asset level of financing in quebec. as connor mentioned, we achieved a record level of development over 2021.
we commissioned approximately 1,000 megawatts of new capacity and finished the year with over 15,000 megawatts of construction and advanced-stage projects. these projects are diversified across distributed and utility-scale solar, wind, storage, hydro, and green hydrogen in 14 different countries. in total, we expect these projects to contribute almost $180 million in annual ffo to our business once completed. we are pleased to have been able to commission nearly 1,000 megawatts of capacity on time and budget during the year, including our 360-megawatt solar project in brazil, which was delivered ahead of schedule and have recently completed 160-megawatt wind repowering in new york state.
this repowering is expected to increase generation of the facilities 25% by increasing rotor diameter to almost 120 meters, and will also extend the life of the project by 30 years. the project which was completed at a 40% discount to new build costs is backed by revenue contracts with high-quality counterparties, with a weighted average duration of 12 years that will increase revenues by approximately $10 million. we also added a 20-year full wrap long-term service agreement with production guarantees to de-risk the project going forward. this repowering was completed on time and on budget, despite the supply chain challenges facing developers around on the world.
we expect earn returns on this project in line with our typical 12% to 15% return target. looking forward it has estimated that 200 gigawatts of global wind capacity will reach 15 years of age within the next five years, creating an attractive opportunity for developers like us who have the right skillset and scale of capital. looking at our own portfolio. we are progressing another 1,600 megawatts of repowering opportunities in the united states and we look forward to updating you on these in the future.
regarding our latest financing initiatives, we strategically fast-tracked our refinancing activities into 2021 due to the potential of rising rates. and as a result, as i mentioned previously, we have no material maturities in the near-term and very limited exposure to interest rates. today, i want to walk you through the lievre financing. this transaction reinforces the opportunity we are seeing to sign attractive contract for large-scale hydros that appropriately valued the dispatchable carbon-free natures of the assets in an increasingly intermittent grid.
we signed a 40 year fixed escalating power purchase agreement for our 265-megawatt lievre facility with hydro-quebec. the ppa is at an attractive premium to the prices the facility has historically achieved generating an additional $20 million of revenue from the project per annum. given the duration of the contract and the quality of the counterparty, we current -- we have raised cad1.2 billion, cad1 billion of which was an up financing of 40 year triple b investment grade debt on the facility at a fixed coupon of 4%. this is our largest project financing to date, and we are highly confident that we will redeploy this capital into growth and when deployed at our target returns, it is expected to generate more than $100 million of annual net ffo for the business.
said differently, through the recontracting and up financing of a single hydro asset we can fund the majority of our targeted 2022 capital deployment at exceptionally attractive rates. with over 5,500 gigawatts hours of generation available for recontracting over the next five years and an increasingly constructive pricing environment for a hydro portfolio, we have significant capacity across our fleet to execute on similar contracts that we expect to contribute additional ffo and generate a highly accretive funding source for our growth. on behalf of the board and management of brookfield renewable, we thank all our unitholders and shareholders for their ongoing support. that concludes our formal remarks for today's call.
thank you for joining us this morning. and with that, i'll pass it back to our operator for questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from robert hope with scotiabank.
robert hope -- scotiabank -- analyst
good morning, everyone. the list of capital deployment since last quarter seems a little bit longer than normal. is this kind of just when the opportunities presented themselves? or is the pipeline that you're seeing out there right now stronger than normal? and if it is stronger than normal, kind of what geographies and kind of asset generation types are most interesting.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
hi, robert. good morning. great question. it's certainly an acceleration of the pipeline.
very simply what we are seeing is a growing opportunity set and we'd probably classify it in three buckets. very simply the industry is getting larger, so there are more and more opportunities to buy large or scale operating portfolios. so that's kind of bucket one that we're seeing grow. secondly, as has been a theme for a number of quarters and approaching in couple years now, we are seeing an increasing number of opportunities to do de-risk development at very attractive risk-adjusted returns, and that's growing within our business.
and then thirdly, increasingly we're seeing opportunities to be a capital provider and an operating partner to corporates that have their own decarbonization goals, but either don't have the capabilities or the money to fund the processes to get them to their objectives. we're in a great period because all three are accelerating right now. and that's candidly what you saw in terms of our growth activity in q4.
robert hope -- scotiabank -- analyst
that's very helpful. and then just diving a little bit deeper into that development point that you put there. if we take a look at 2021, you put roughly 1,000 thousand megawatts into service up from your development pipeline. is this the new run rate? could we see this even increase further just given how much you've kind of increased the overall backlog there? kind of what's the targets amount of capital and megawatts you honestly put into service per year?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. so the way we look at these opportunities is always really from two perspectives. one, are they attractive risk-adjusted returns, and two, what's driving the growth and the increased development into development is simply the demand we're seeing from our customers. our largest customers are providing us with an abundance of corporate ppa demand and therefore some of the transactions you would've seen us complete in q4, both urban grid in north america and cenovus in germany was really about providing project pipelines that can match that corporate demand.
in terms of your question around is one gigawatt, the go forward run rate absolutely not. the go forward run rate is significantly higher than that based on not only our pipeline but the number of projects that we already have under construction or are contracted to be built out in the near term. in fact, if we look over the next three years, our expected buildout is north of nine gigawatts over the next three years.
robert hope -- scotiabank -- analyst
i appreciate the color. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from sean steuart with td securities.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
thanks. good morning. just following on rob's question. i think connor, the context you gave in your of prepared comments was you expect the return potential for the urban grid build-out would be above the high end of the target 12% to 15% return range.
can you qualify that at all? are we at the high end of the range? significantly above the high end of the range any context you can give there?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. and perhaps the easiest thing to do is explain some of the context around that transaction. as many on the call would've seen through 2021, there's been a number of transaction activity related to large development platforms in the united states. and i would say as a business, we looked at all of those opportunities and we couldn't find one that worked for us appropriately from a risk return or a value entry point perspective.
and then we came across urban grid. and the joy of urban grid, both for us and the management team of urban grid is it's an incredibly complimentary transaction. what the management team and what the company of urban grid is best-in-class at is securing land, interconnection, and permits, the early stage component of development, where we would like to think that brookfield renewable in the united states is leading, is in corporate ppa procurement, power marketing, financing, and construction. and by finding that business, that had its greatest strengths in areas that compliment ours, we were able to buy at what we think is very attractive value, because we didn't have to pay for anything that we already had.
from there, when you take those assets that we had acquired through urban grid and you marry them with our existing demand from corporate contractors, particularly in the pga market, we think we will be able to pull many of those projects through faster than perhaps urban grid could on its own. and that's really driving returns. one of the most exciting things is since this transaction's been announced, a number of our customers have actually reached out to us pre-emptively to try and secure some of the future power that might come from these assets. so to put some context around this transaction, we view it certainly as at least a high type return in our initial underwriting.
and there is certainly upside from that level if we choose to pursue capital recycling of the assets in the future.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
that's great detail. and further to that when you talk about nine gigawatts over three years, you guys clearly have a lot of internal horsepower to manage this. based on your current, i guess, human capital resource what limit do you think the company's capable of now in terms of annual development? is there -- what's the upper limit that you would think you feasible for the company?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
i'm not sure there really is an upper limit at this point, or certainly not one that we're worried about. we certainly see certain significant operating leverage existing within our business to push more assets through our existing platform. but perhaps, one piece of context we could provide to that is when we look at an acquisition like urban grid, make no mistake about it. it comes with best-in-class assets, but one of the other things we're also getting as part of that transaction is a best-in-class management team that is going to drive value in the assets that came with the transaction and also across our broader portfolio.
so every time we do a transaction like that, it not only adds to the pipeline but to use your word, it also adds to the horsepower to do more development and more growth activity in the future. but we're certainly not seeing any limit in the near term.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
ok. thanks, connor. i'll get back in the queue.
operator
our next question comes from rupert merer with national bank financial.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
good morning. so you talked about the benefits of your hydro facilities and the benefits of up financing on hydro. how are you thinking about sell downs on hydro? is it fair to say there's still a price at which you might consider a sell-down or really is up financing kind of representative of a way you can recycle some of the capital from hydros in the future?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
rupert, great question. we have done sell downs of hydros in the past, most recently a few years ago. what we would say is, what really has created the opportunity particularly around the lievre up financing is versus even 12 months ago, certainly versus 18 months ago, there is a much, much more constructive pricing environment around hydros, particularly in north america. and for the last couple years due to the pricing environment, we have been very hesitant to do anything that kind of locks in value around this portfolio, whether it be financings or monetizations.
now we do believe our hydro portfolio, it is best-in-class and does truly represent some irreplaceable and strategic assets in key north american markets. so we value them appropriately. that is not to say that we would never sell them. there is a price for everything, but in the robust financing markets and when we can find a very strong counterparty, such as we did with hydro-quebec, we do see more opportunity in the near-term to do things like the very accretive up financing that we completed in q4.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
all right. very good. thank you. looking at the german solar development, 1,700 megawatts.
you highlight you're looking mostly at corporate contracts to build that out. wondering if you can give us some color on what we're seeing in europe right now. we have this really high power price environment. is that accelerating development opportunities and what is it going to do for return potential in that market?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. so we'd make maybe two comments. one thing that shouldn't be over looked about the current high power price environment is for the last five or six years as the corporate ppa market has developed really what we have been doing is we have been selling green power. but in a market such as this one where energy and commodity prices have gone up dramatically, the joy of a corporate ppa on a renewables asset is there are no input costs.
so a long-term corporate ppa is not only clean power it also acts as an insurance policy against future price spikes or shortages in global commodity markets like we're seeing currently. and we're really using that not just in europe, but around the world to enhance and drive an accelerated build-out of our corporate ppa business and our development pipeline. in terms of what we're seeing in europe, there's probably one dynamic that we would highlight particularly around corporate ppas that's really exciting to us, which is increasingly the very large european offshore wind market is going to a subsidy-free model. and why that's really exciting to us as brookfield renewable is historically these have been feed-in tariff type auctions that have turned into cost of capital shootouts.
that's not typically how we like to source business. but increasingly as these very large offshore wind projects need to be built out on a subsidy-free basis, this represents some of the largest corporate contracting and power marketing opportunities we're seeing around the world and really creates an opportunity for us to use our capabilities that have been scaled using onshore wind and solar in north america and europe over the last several years and now apply them to much, much larger offshore wind development opportunities in europe. so we're still doing the same things onshore, but there's also this large growth opportunity for power marketing for subsidy-free offshore wind in europe, too.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
so do you think this environment could accelerate your growth in europe? are you looking to put more resources into europe, given the state of the power market there?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
our growth in europe has been pretty strong over the last few years, i would say, and we don't see it slowing down. so we continue to scale our platforms. our largest businesses are in north america and europe and they continue to grow on, i would say a double-digit basis year after year after year. both markets are very constructive for us right now.
so we'll continue to deploy as much capital as we can as long as we're seeing attractive risk-adjusted returns.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
thanks for the color.

our next question comes from mark jarvi with cibc.
mark jarvi -- cibc
thanks. good morning, everyone. just wanted to come back to the contract and the up financing that they provided, in terms of the premium pricing lift that you got, is there anything in particular special about the seasonality of the power supply, capacity payment requirements by the buyer, the power that drove the uplift. and i'm just trying to think through, i can see a similar magnitude and uplift on some of your other hydro assets.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly, perhaps i'll start, and wyatt, if there's anything you'd like to add, certainly chime in. what really created the opportunity around lievre, which we thought was very exceptional, was one we had a motivated buyer of the power hydro-quebec. but, two hydro-quebec is a best-in-class, high-quality counterparty. and what we have been doing over the last four years is we've been preserving the backend optionality of our hydros.
in order for us to sign a long-term contract, such as this and give up some of that backend optionality. we really need to see two things. we need to see a significant premium, a very attractive price. we got that in lievre.
and secondly, we need to see that from a very high-quality counterparty, because that allows us to do the significant up financing such as the one that we did in december, which unlocks a huge amount of capital today that we can immediately invest in accretive growth. and we will always look at these opportunities on a returns basis and accretion basis if you will. and it's really two components. one, are we getting the attractive price, and two, are we getting a high-quality counterparty that will also facilitate a very attractive financing that will unlock that capital that can fund accretive growth? are there many opportunities like lievre? it's tough to say, but we certainly see more in our portfolio.
maybe not quite of the same scale, lievre was a special asset, but we would expect to do more of this activity in the next few years. certainly, if the constructive pricing environment continues.
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
yeah. and mark, this is wyatt here. the only thing i would add is around your specific point with hydro-quebec. and look, we don't want to talk on their behalf, but from what they've said publicly, one thing that was of value to them was the capacity that this provides them during winter and then they also have the ability to export that power in the summer when their capacity requirements are less.
so there was this seemingly a specific instance here that drove the desire to contract this asset. but as connor mentioned, overall in terms of the environment for our hydros just given the ability to deploy dispatchable carbon-free power that specific reason may not kind of replicate, but the overall environment, we expect there could be other reasons that our hydros become more attractive to contract long-term. and so we -- as we mentioned, we have a meaningful amount of additional capacity coming off contract over the next five years. and we think that that could create very meaningful opportunities like this going forward.
mark jarvi -- cibc
and then a couple years ago, you guys reworked sort of energy marketing contract with brookfield. i think the prices they're supposed to step down over time and given what you're talking about lievre and demand for hydro, is there an opportunity here to rework that or step out of that agreement, if you think you can lock in longer term around some of that hydro facilities?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
so in terms of that contract it's a long-term contract. it remains in place. there's nothing today that would suggest that we're going to adjust that. and really the point we would make is, well, the pricing environment is constructive on almost universal basis across our hydro fleet.
the power price markets that these assets operate in are very different. and in certain places, we do still have attractive contracts and we're going to leave those in place and continue to benefit from those inflation-linked cash flows, but what we're probably most excited about and what wyatt just alluded to, and something we touched upon briefly at investor day several months ago is the contracts that are rolling off in the next few years are actually some of our lower price contracts and are the ones that are best positioned to take advantage of this more robust pricing environment.
mark jarvi -- cibc
got it. and then maybe last thing in terms of -- obviously the development pipeline getting stronger, but as you look out into 2022, you talked about some of the supply chain things, but things like wro or the net metering policy stuff in california, is there any impact of that is going to have either delay on any of the dg or utility-scale solar stuff you're trying to do in the u.s. in 2022?
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
no. if it is -- it's immaterial and it might be a couple projects at most, the growth of that business is driven by, i would say macro dynamics that far exceed, call it near-term regulatory decisions. so no concern from us there based on potential regulatory outcomes.
mark jarvi -- cibc
got it. thanks.
operator
our next question comes from nelson ng with rbc capital markets.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks and good morning, everyone. so, connor, you touched on those three buckets in terms of capital deployment. i know in the past you guys were more focused on acquiring operating assets, and then more recently, there's been a larger focus on acquiring, i guess development assets or platforms.
given your like return expectations on urban grid, should we assume that going forward you'll be acquiring more development platforms and assets rather than operating assets?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
i wouldn't say so. what i would say is, we look at all the opportunities that are available in the market and allocate our capital to where we see the best risk-adjusted returns. and there's two or three dynamics that suggest that there could actually be an increasing environment for operating assets going forward. maybe just to reiterate a point, we have been doing a little bit more development recently, that's because we have the corporate ppa demand to backstop it.
and really turn that into de-risk construction at really attractive returns. we will continue to pursue that activity as long as we have that abundance of corporate contracting demand. the second point i thought, it might be important to highlight is one thing that we were excited about when you look at our growth activity in q4 is in one quarter, we executed m&a in each of our target markets and across each of our target asset classes, we obviously did wind and solar. but we bought operating hydros for the first time, since 2017.
we're very excited to continue to find opportunities in that market. and we also found opportunities in our transition and storage bucket in the u.k. so there's certainly nothing to suggest that we aren't finding opportunities for operating assets as well. and then the last point i would make is it has been a very robust period of growth for the broader industry.
and it's also been an extremely robust period in terms of access to capital. and we are very for that. we have a self-funding business model and therefore can pursue acquisitions kind of, regardless of our access to the capital markets, but certainly given some of the disruptions and downdrafts for stock prices in our sector. we do see opportunities where some businesses with large operating portfolios, but growth ambitions as well may that rely on the capital markets for capital might need solutions to fund that growth.
and that could shake more operating assets loose in the future, or it could represent opportunities for public market transactions, which is something we haven't done as much of, i would say, in the last 18 months. so i would say in terms of what we're seeing across our pipeline today, there's actually probably more operating assets in the pipeline than there were maybe six or 12 months ago.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's a great color. and just one quick follow-up, you mentioned that you're doing more development due to demand from corporate ppas. so with the elevated power prices, are you kind of looking at opportunities to develop on a merchant basis and kind of benefit from near or medium-term power prices before maybe contracting a longer-term to de-risk assets? like, is that a strategy now in terms of let's do merchant for a few years, and then look to contract later on?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
we've operated our portfolio on a highly contracted basis for the last five or six years. we aren't going to materially change that strategy. the good news about the higher pricing environment is that is showing up in ppa pricing as well, but the vast majority of the developed and vast, vast majority, almost all of it is going to be done on a contracted basis. that's really why we've been excited about the opportunities we're seeing is because if you can take a project that's ready to build, match it with the corporate contract, match it with a full wrap epc contract in a long-term o&m agreement.
you can do that at a really attractive return, but it's a very, very de-risk project. you give some of that up, if you play for the merchant price and we've had success doing what we're doing and that's going to be our continued playbook going forward.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's great. thanks, connor.

our next question comes from mark strouse with j.p. morgan.
mark strouse -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. good morning. thanks for taking our questions and thanks for all the colors. very helpful.
i just had one kind of clarifying question connor, when you talked about over 70% of the contracts being indexed to inflation. the other, whatever it is, 30% less is that fixed or are those kind of, they have escalators, but the escalators are fixed. how should we think about that?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
it's largely fixed and really i'd make two comments there. on a regional basis, there's one market around the world that has largely fixed contracts for us, that's india. that's just standard in that market. and then secondly, some corporate ppas certainly not the majority of them, but some of them are fixed price.
so when we get a fixed price corporate ppa, we certainly take that into account in our underwriting. but the comment i would make is when we say 30% are not indexed to inflation. those are largely fixed contracts on a regional basis, notably india, and then some of our corporate contracts just because that's what our customers prefer.
mark strouse -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yes. ok. that's what -- i'm sorry.
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
the only other comment i make mark is that, even though 70% of our contracts are fixed to inflation. and therefore, the remaining three are fixed. when you have a business of high margins that we'd have roughly 70% and then fixed-rate debt, even if you have full cost inflation, the level of margin, the operating leverage you get with those high margins even at 70% of your contracts being indexed, and then even additional leverage down at the ffo level is very meaningful.
mark strouse -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. that makes sense. ok. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from andrew kuske with credit suisse.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks. good morning. there's obviously a fixation on inflation for many, but maybe if you could talk a little bit about potential disinflationary benefits, maybe coming from just technological improvements, whether it's automation and operations, automation and construction, other forms of incrementalism. i just think of some simple examples like some technologies have been around for a long period of time, but with higher prices, the technology makes sense and there is extra sector, extra value, or extra production out of solar panels as one example.
if you could just give some commentary on that, where the consequences you'd see even more expanding margins.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
andrew, thank you and appreciate you highlighting this. we made a comment in our prepared remarks that some of the supply chain disruption that has created a little bit of capex inflation in our sector in the last couple of years. we view it as largely transitory. and there is really been two overarching impacts of that.
one is a shortage of polysilicon supply for solar panels. and then secondly, simply logistical disruptions as the entire global economy tries to restart from being completely shut down during covid. when we look at those two things, the great news is there is very good visibility on incremental polysilicon with capacity coming online throughout 2022. so we expect that supply demand dynamic to dramatically improve over the next 12 months.
and then simply as the world recovers in the global economy recovers from covid, we do expect some of those logistical issues to continue to work themselves out. what should not get lost in those discussions is wind and solar on a global basis are still relatively young industries in the grand scheme of things. they've truly only operated at massive scale for approximately 10 years or you could argue even less. and as more and more wind and solar is built out around the world, supply chains continue to scale up and broader production costs continue to go down.
that's simply economies of scale playing out. and then within wind and solar, we are still seeing technological improvements, maybe not to the pace that we were seeing five or 10 years ago, but in particular around software, we are seeing incremental improvements that are going to continue to drive production costs for wind and solar energy lower, then they were kind of pre-covid and these short-term disruptions. that's on wind and solar that are more mature technologies where we get really excited as a business is really around some of the storage applications. battery costs are coming down at a very rapid rate, quite similar to what we saw in solar five or 10 years ago.
and we are at the point where batteries aren't quite yet cost effective on a live spread basis, but they're increasingly becoming cost effective in select markets. take for example, the u.k. where we've created our storage development partnership in the last quarter. as we see battery costs can continue to come down, adding that storage to wind and solar and creating more of a hybridization effect is going to drop the levelize cost of energy for that entire renewable solution going forward.
and once again, just continue to drive increased penetration of renewables and growth in the sector. so while the short-term supply issues, there's good visibility of cost coming down, we shouldn't lose sight of the long-term trends, which is certainly driving lower long-term production costs for clean energy.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. that's -- connor, that's very helpful. i appreciate the thorough answer and just maybe one sort of follow-up to that. when you think about having batteries in a complimentary fashion or supplementary fashion to parts of your existing portfolio, do you get excited about the potential for broadening out your ability to do 724 contracts and just many more geographies?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
absolutely. that's helpful to us in a couple ways. one, a lot of what we do on the development side and the power contracting side is trying to meet the unique requirements of our customers. and increasingly, we are seeing more and more demand from industrial businesses, tech businesses that absolutely require uninterrupted around-the-clock clean energy.
we've been filling that demand using our hydro and storage and select cases, but the ability to do that on an increased level is very attractive to both us and the clients we supply energy to. and then secondly, it just makes our power more economic and that's going to be helpful for both deploying more capital and driving returns.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. that's great. thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from frederic bastien with raymond james.
frederic bastien -- raymond james -- analyst
good morning, guys. just wondering on the development side, are you seeing opportunities to move forward on hydro projects that might not have been as attractive from a return perspective 18 months ago perhaps even six months back?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
thanks, fred. the comment we would make is we are aware that perhaps more so than the last few years some hydro projects are increasingly popping up as potential development opportunities. we do have a small amount of hydro development within our portfolio, it's largely in brazil, typically small hydros. before we would pursue any large-scale hydro, we would take a very cautious approach to this type of development.
part of the joy around our increased development activity in solar is simply because solar is a -- solar construction is a very de-risked process. it's quick to build, it's modular. it seldom requires working at heights. it can be done on an incrementalist basis with people starting on every part or every side of a solar farm.
large-scale hydro is an incredibly involved process. and therefore, we would only consider those types of developments. one, where we think we could de-risk them materially, and two, where the returns justified it. so there are a few more projects popping up.
we will certainly review them, but we'll certainly take a very cautious approach to large-scale development always comparing it to the risk returns we see in other types of clean energy development.
frederic bastien -- raymond james -- analyst
all right. that's a great color. thank you for that. now, i appreciate you don't manage your business for the next quarter, but was hoping to get a bit more color on how the business perform in q4.
the hydro assets did perform stronger from a year-over-year perspective, but we saw a bit of a some weakness at least on the ffo side on the other platform. so what were the puts and takes there?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly, so we'll highlight a couple points here. it should not go unnoticed that our 10% increase in ffo per unit came in a year where we had i would say a frustrating amount of resource. it was certainly not a great year from a resource perspective. but a couple things did really shine through, particularly in the latter part of the year and hopefully into q1 as well.
one, the diversity of our portfolio. columbia had a great year for hydrology where brazil had a really tough year for hydrology. parts of the u.s. performed quite well in the second half of the year from a hydrology perspective.
other parts a little bit weaker. as we look forward into next year, there's significant upside torque to our performance, if we get a more normalized level of resource, but some comments we would make in columbia, we're entering the year with above the lta level of resource in our hydros. secondly in brazil, through much of 2021, there was historically low hydrology in brazil, creating almost drought-like conditions. the rainy season in brazil really starts in october.
and there has been tremendous amounts of precipitation and hydrology inflows. and if almost shocking, but where we're at today reservoir levels in brazil are actually higher than they were at this point last year, so that situation, although not all the way back to lta is dramatically improved versus where it was four or five months ago. and then lastly, when it comes to the united states and canada, we continue to see the benefits of diversification within our portfolio. some markets have certainly seen a recovery.
there are other markets that are a little slower going into q1. but on math, i would say we're in a nice position this year compared to where we were at this point last year.
frederic bastien -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks. i'll leave it there.

our next question comes from ben pham with bmo capital markets.
ben pham -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. thanks. good morning. the hydro-quebec, 40 years contract, i don't think i've seen any recontracting of that long duration in industry.
so i'm curious, has that caused you to change more to the pause of the duration or offering asset values in your models or term of value assumptions and value for capacity, value for the other assets?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
no. it would be probably the simple answer, really what this was -- is, we saw an opportunity to lock in prices at a material premium to where we were achieving and where we expected to achieve in our forecast. and then secondly, do it with a high-quality counterparty under a long duration contract, where we could get very attractive financing. i would say, our view of underlying assets has not changed.
and if anything, our view of hydros and the benefits they can provide in this market continues to increase and we did this deal taking all of that into account.
ben pham -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. and the main question for wyatt, and on the $1 billion up financing looks like that firms up a lot of that wedge of the funding program that you have. so should we view this as more supporting that funding or is some of those wedges moving around?
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
yes. it's a good question, ben. so look, at investor day, we kind of spelled out our funding plan. so if we -- our target over the next five years is -- and we really do think about it in kind of five-year buckets is anywhere from $5 billion to $6 billion of equity capital put into growth.
and so we kind of have three buckets to fund that one, we had some additional corporate debt or perpetual preferred equity that we routinely issue, but limiting ourselves there on an investment-grade basis that bucket continues to be one we expect to use that would make anywhere from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. the additional piece was -- our another piece was these type of asset up financings and a lot of it on the back of what we spoke about in terms of the ability to contract our hydros long-term and what that means in terms of financing capacity while maintaining strong investment-grade ratings at our assets. and that bucket we had always said was anywhere from kind of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, that factored this in. and so that's really just us executing on kind of that plan and the remainder kind of that bucket, we're hopeful will come from some of the recontracting opportunities that we mentioned earlier in this call.
and then that remaining kind of $2 billion to get to the $6 billion of capital need for growth will come from our normal course asset recycling program. so this is really kind of -- has been factored into that funding plan. we would've laid out on investor day.
ben pham -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
i got it. ok. thank you very much.

our next question comes from matt taylor with tudor, pickering, holt.
matt taylor -- tudor, pickering, holt, and company -- analyst
yes. thanks for taking my question here. first i just wanted to start on with what's going on with your ability to self-fund growth with your hydro financing this year and then in years to come and just how robust your growth backlog is -- has become. how are you thinking about the typical, like, how you typically invested where it's been on a 25% basis with all your partners? do you see any opportunity to make that process a little bit less complex, meaning you're able to take on bigger shares of investment or just any thoughts on the way you're investing if that's changed at all with the fundamentals that you're seeing?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. good question, matt. and i'll maybe come at it from a few different directions. we -- our primary form of investing is still going to be continued -- sorry, is still going to continue to be through our proportionate participation in brookfield's private funds that is going to be our primary source of investing.
now, in order to fund those investments, the nice thing as wyatt said is, we've essentially secured a large amount of capital to fund those essentially at 4%, which is going to be very, very accretive for our growth activity for the next 12 months. the second point we would make is maybe simply around the scale of opportunities we are seeing. and there are some very large opportunities in our pipeline. and as we have in the past, some of those exceed the scale that is appropriate for our private funds and do create co-invest opportunities for brookfield renewable.
and to the extent, those become available to us, because we are pursuing large transactions, we absolutely would expect to co-invest and perhaps increase our proportional activity in those investments, slightly above what we do directly through the fund. so our approach is not going to change, but to the extent, we do see large transactions, there will be opportunities for us to co-invest. and we certainly hope to execute some large transactions over the next 12 to 24 months.
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
and maybe matt, i would add just you mentioned the word complexity in the way we fund our growth, but i think, look, the way we think about it is, we do -- we structured the investment through the private funds, because we believe that it's very additive to our business, because it provides us a scale of capital to be able to look at transactions that are really differentiated. and as connor mentioned before, especially, if we're going into a period where there's disruption in capital markets, where equity is trade down. and so that funding lever isn't available for others. we have a pool of capital that we -- one that's our liquidity, that stand-alone liquidity, but that significant dry powder from sovereign wealth funds and other institutional capital that we invest alongside, and that is available to be deployed very quickly is a huge differentiator.
and so the structure, well, maybe -- could be viewed as more complexity, it really is very additive to our business model and that's why we do it.
matt taylor -- tudor, pickering, holt, and company -- analyst
great. thanks for the comments there from both of you. and then if i could just finish on your ffo to share growth guidance of, it's been in the 6% to 11% range, but you print it at 10% in 2021, and then you expect a 10%-plus cagr over here -- over the next couple of years. so i'm just wondering if that's still the right range, especially because the way you framed it is m&a is additive.
but i mean, the benefits of the urban grid acquisition are clear and you made them clear today. so do you still see that range as the right range given how your backlog on the organic side and then what opportunity you're seeing on the m&a side?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
great question, matt. and we're not going to adjust our guidance here today, but we'll stay very consistent around the message we've given in the past, which is due to a number of things that are happening in the market right now a much more constructive pricing environment than we've seen in the last couple of years inflation in our contract base continued margin enhancement. and then a lot of that organic growth coming through over the next few years, we see a path to high single-digit ffo per unit growth, simply using organic growth initiatives within the business. and then from there, if we do continue to execute on m&a, as we expect we will, that would be additive.
what has changed in our business -- positively changed in our business is the amount of that per unit ffo per share growth that we can deliver simply with organic growth initiative is much higher than it's been in the past. and that's largely because of the dollars we have already invested in the ground in development that is only going to start cod-ing and hitting our ffo either in this past year or next year. so we'll continue with our historic guidance, but the fundamentals of it remain unchanged if not improved since we made that comment a few months ago.
matt taylor -- tudor, pickering, holt, and company -- analyst
great. thanks for the color there, connor. that's it for me.

our next question comes from naji baydoun with ia capital.
naji baydoun -- ia capital markets -- analyst
hi. good morning. just a quick question on some partnerships, i mean last year, you've -- you're going to be working with amazon on utility-scale project globally. you're going to be working with trane on distributed generation in the u.s., and now you announced the shoals agreement.
can you just give us a bit of details on how these partnerships are going? and then secondly, where you see opportunities or gaps to execute on more strategic agreements?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. and we'll probably put those in two different buckets. the first one with amazon is simply a strategic collaboration where we look to build out clean energy projects to support their growth around the world in their increasing clean energy demand. we're also looking at other clean energy solutions for them and collaborating on that as well.
that partnership, that collaboration continues to go very, very well. we're excited about the projects we're working on together and we see the potential for it to scale going forward. the other two partnerships you mentioned shoals and trane, those really our partnerships largely aligned with our distributed generation business. and why we're excited about those and why on the back of trane, we've also done the shoals partnership is in those situations, we're providing onsite clean energy as a solution for a customer.
and there is one way to grow that business, which is providing more clean energy to that customer, but there's also other ways to create revenue within that relationship, which is offering more products. and that might be energy efficiency building equipment like trane offers or that might be things like ev charging solutions such as what shoals offers. and therefore, what we are looking to do with our partners is create a decarbonization as a service product offering that can address any of the decarbonization needs of that customer and enhance that relationship such that we can expand it going forward. because ourselves, shoals, trane, we all cover the same customer set.
this is mutually beneficial for both the three of us and our customers who are getting a better product offering.
naji baydoun -- ia capital markets -- analyst
that's great. thank you for that color. and just the second part of the question, where else do you think there are opportunities for these types of agreements either types of partners or by geographies?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. so -- sorry for missing that. part of the excitement of the amazon strategic collaboration was, we felt that we were one of the few counterparties that could service them on truly a global basis. we're seeing increased demand by the largest procurers of green power for multi-regional or global solutions.
so we expect to see more partnerships or collaborations like that one. and then within our dg business, i would say, we have a very full suite of decarbonization solutions today, but the market is very rapidly evolving. and therefore, if we see new products that are of interest to our customers and we can partner with leaders in the space to once again, improve our product offering and enhance that customer relationship, we may look to do it across other decarbonization solutions as well. where we fit today? i would say, we're much more likely to do more of the broader regional green power solutions.
our product offering on dg is already best in class, nothing there that we feel we're missing in the current environment.
naji baydoun -- ia capital markets -- analyst
ok. got it. that's very helpful. thank you.

2022-Q1,BEP,2022-05-06 09:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
hello, and welcome to the bep first quarter 2022 results conference call and webcast. [operator instructions] it is now my pleasure to introduce ceo, connor teskey.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
thank you, operator. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2022 conference call. before we begin, we would like to remind you that a copy of our news release, investor supplement and letter to unitholders can be found on our website. we would also like to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements on this call.
these statements are subject to known and unknown risks, and our future results may differ materially. for more information, you are encouraged to review our regulatory filings available on fedar, edgar and on our website. to kick off today's call, we will provide an update on the business. after my remarks, natalie adomait, managing partner and chief investment officer of transition investing, will give an update on our growth initiatives.
and then wyatt will provide an overview on our operating results as well as our balance sheet and liquidity. following those prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. our business performed well in the first quarter. we continue to execute on acquiring assets for value, enhancing the cash flows of those assets with our operating capabilities and leveraging our capabilities to drive decarbonization across the business.
clean energy occupies a uniquely complementary position to the global goals of low-cost energy, net zero emissions and energy security. put simply, the wind and the sun do not need to be imported and don't rely on substantial transportation infrastructure. these underappreciated benefits will become increasingly more relevant as energy security becomes a higher priority. this represents yet an additional tailwind to our business.
and together with accelerating decarbonization trends, we'll continue to enhance the position of investors such as ourselves with capital operating capabilities and the development pipeline to accelerate the build-out of renewables at scale. we are seeing this trend actively play out within our own portfolio. an example is our recently acquired german utility scale solar developer. in february, germany's government announced an acceleration of the country's decarbonization targets including increasing its target for solar to 200 gigawatts of capacity.
as a result, we have injected additional capital into growing that business and we are currently accelerating our business plan, including doubling the expected megawatts that will achieve ready-to-build status in the next two years. with a very substantial global development pipeline, which now sits at 69,000 megawatts, we expect to see several other opportunities to pull forward development and accelerate the deployment of capital at accretive returns throughout our portfolio. some recent highlights for our business include we generated funds from operations of $243 million or $0.38 per unit, an 18% increase on a normalized basis over the same period in 2021. we secured contracts to deliver over 1,400 gigawatt hours of clean energy annually, including 500 gigawatt hours to corporate offtakers.
we continued to execute on our 15,000 megawatt under construction and advanced stage development pipeline. we closed or agreed to invest over $1.6 billion of capital across multiple transactions and regions, including our first investment in carbon capture solutions. and finally, we are progressing on approximately $560 million of asset recycling activities, selling noncore and mature assets, all while maintaining our robust financial capacity with almost $4 billion of available liquidity, no near-term maturities, no material near-term maturities and limited floating rate exposure. next, we want to spend a few minutes on our outlook for the business in light of inflation and supply chain trends.
at central bank's tightened monetary policy, markets are increasingly focused on the potential for sustained inflation in the future. we are very fortunate that regardless of whether inflation is either transitory or sustained, we expect our business to perform well. in fact, we see inflation as a tailwind for our operating assets given that approximately 70% of our contracts are indexed to inflation and have largely fixed cost structures. perhaps most notable in this market, the cost of our primary inputs sun, wind and water remains unchanged to where it was a year ago, which is they still cost zero, which compares to an over 50% increase in energy input costs for most alternative electricity generation.
the compounding effect of inflating revenue streams should drive meaningful operating leverage across our business given that we have a relatively fixed cost and almost exclusively fixed-rate debt. our 15,000 megawatts of under construction and advanced stage development assets benefit from our focus on avoiding risk. we virtually always lock in the cost of major components when we sign a revenue contract. as a result, we believe we have matched our costs and revenues and locked in a large share of our target return.
and while global supply chain disruptions continue to impact industry broadly, we remain well positioned as our diversified pipeline means we have no singular exposure to any country or technology. we have also secured inputs for substantially all development projects where we have signed a revenue contract and therefore, have a delivery obligation. most importantly, our scale, centralized procurement function, and strong relationships with both suppliers and customers allows us to manage these issues such that their net impact has not been material to our business. overall, we have no concerns that these supply chain challenges will slow the growth of our business.
in fact, it very likely could create opportunities for us as these challenges have reduced the supply of new projects as some developers will walk away or delay their projects, which, when combined with the continued growth in demand for clean energy has increased the value of high-quality ready-to-build projects that can meet customers near-term needs. we are very fortunate to have many such projects in our pipeline and are seeing significant demand for their future generation in the form of higher ppa prices. in addition, elevated and volatile global energy prices has on reinforced wind and solar position as the cheapest form of bulk electricity production, and two, demonstrated the benefit of generation that is not subject to variable input costs. as such, we are confident that inflation or supply chain pressures will not drive a slowdown in the adoption of clean energy globally.
in fact, we're seeing the opposite. we have seen a strong willingness from buyers of clean energy to accept higher prices as the benefits of decarbonization, energy security and stability far outweigh the small increases in costs we are facing. we see tremendous tailwinds for both our sector as well as our business specifically which should lead to a strong year in 2022 for brookfield renewable. with that, i'll turn the call over to natalie to discuss our growth initiatives. 
natalie adomait -- managing partner and chief investment officer, transition investing
thanks, connor, and good morning, everyone. i'm pleased to be with you here today to talk about some of our recent growth initiatives and some of the exciting opportunities that we see for our business in the near term. decarbonization has been firmly established as a priority of global leaders and climate change. while climate change has been a focused topic for governments for years, the pace at which corporates are making commitments to lower emissions to net zero are now accelerating at a rapid pace.
achieving net zero emissions will require a massive amount of capital. it's estimated that over $150 trillion will need to be invested through 2050 to drive the decarbonization of energy systems. that's approximately $5 trillion every year. and brookfield is rising to meet this capital need and importantly, this exciting investment opportunity with the raising of approximately $15 billion for brookfield's first flagship global transition fund, which is now in the final stages of closing.
brookfield renewable will be the largest investor in that fund. meaning, we will benefit from having scale capital to invest alongside of which in increasingly volatile capital markets becomes ever more valuable. we believe the success of the fund raise demonstrates that in order to be a successful investor in decarbonization it is essential to have both deep operating expertise, particularly in power markets and renewable energy, both of which we have a proven track record in. the reason this expertise is so important is because about three-quarters of global carbon emissions can be traced back directly or indirectly to power generation and the energy sector.
every business uses energy. therefore, if you can help decarbonize the production of energy and electricity, you can also enable the decarbonization of every industry in the world. and if renewables are the first step to decarbonization, we think our platform puts us in a leadership position. we have a track record of evolving our strategy to add new clean energy generation types and other energy transition solutions when we see opportunities to invest in scale at the appropriate risk-adjusted returns.
we are driving decarbonization across a growing opportunity set, and we are currently seeing more opportunities to deploy capital at our target returns. today, i want to highlight just a couple of these themes. the first, of course, is building and acquiring clean energy at scale. this quarter, we made significant progress toward advancing our commercial contracting initiatives and are close to finalizing agreements with numerous multinationals to decarbonize their businesses.
in asia, throughout development and build out of over 3,000 megawatts of wind, solar and storage capacity that will be backed by long-term fixed price contracts. we also announced our plans to submit joint bids with sfe to build to 750 megawatt offshore wind projects in the upcoming dutch tender process. the second large growth opportunity is to use our knowledge of clean energy and our operating capabilities to provide energy transition and decarbonization solutions to businesses around the world, that need help reaching their own decarbonization goals. many industries will require both clean energy to lower their carbon footprint and capital to decarbonize their way of doing business.
the power sector is a great example. utilities require significant capital to enable them to shift from thermal to renewable and we are well positioned to help. finally, we are seeing opportunities for investments in businesses that provide services to support the transition to net zero. this quarter, we entered into a new decarbonization asset class with an investment in a leading north american modular carbon capture solutions provider.
given the trillions of dollars required to decarbonize hard to abate industrial sectors over the coming decades, we see significant potential to grow our carbon capture footprint over time. and we believe we're well positioned to do so given our strong expertise in decarbonization and our experience working as an operating partner and capital provider to our global network of like-minded customers. our investment will provide an attractive entry point into carbon capture solutions with a strong partner, a proven and cost-effective product in a sizable pipeline. we have committed funding of up to 300 million canadian dollars for projects meeting pre-agreed return thresholds and have already begun funding the buildout of our first project.
the structure of the investment provides us with strong downside protection and the securities are convertible into common equity of the company at our option at any time. if 100% of our commitment is invested, which we expect given the escalating carbon price in the proposed investment tax credit for carbon capture in canada, then upon conversion, we will own a majority of the common equity of the business. looking forward, with decarbonization and energy security firmly established as a priority of global leaders, we are focused on the continued build-out of renewables and the increasing demand for other decarbonization solutions, including carbon capture and storage, green hydrogen and other energy service solutions. with that, i'll turn it over to wyatt to discuss our operating results and our financial position.
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
thank you, natalie. we generated ffo of $243 million or $0.38 per unit during the quarter as our operations benefited from strong asset availability, higher power prices and recent acquisitions. on a normalized basis, our per unit results were up 18% year over year. our cash flows are highly resilient given our diversified portfolio, limited concentration risk with counterparties and a long-term contract profile.
and while generation for the quarter was in line with long-term average stronger generation in our lower value markets and weaker performance in our higher-value markets translated to lower-than-expected ffo. this dynamic is already normalizing. and while we expect this variability from time to time, we also expect to benefit from offsetting positive periods in the future. further, we are continuously diversifying the business which increasingly mitigates exposure to any single resource, market or counterparty and our variability becomes less and less every year.
next, looking at our balance sheet and liquidity. our financial position remains strong with almost $4 billion of total available liquidity, providing significant flexibility to fund growth. we have continued to accelerate our financing activities, extending the term of our debt and locking in attractive interest rates. as a result, our balance sheet is in great shape, with an average debt duration across our portfolio of 13 years, no material near-term maturities and minimal exposure to floating rate debt.
we also continue to sell assets to drive value and fund growth. during the quarter, we signed an agreement to sell a small hydro portfolio in brazil, returning three times our capital over our 10-year hold period, and met all conditions to close the sale of a number of assets developed by our global solar developer in mexico. this will generate approximately $240 million which more than doubles our invested capital over our two-year hold period. finally, i want to spend a few minutes on our hydros and the expected benefits we see from power prices.
hydro power continues to enhance its status as the premier renewable technology due to its perpetual nature, grid stabilizing capabilities and dispatchability. growing demand for carbon-free baseload generation in an increasingly constructive pricing environment as more interminent renewables are added to the grid is supporting our ability to contract these assets on a long-term basis at attractive all-in prices with built-in inflation escalation. further, the grid stabilizing the services and storage qualities embedded in large hydros are increasingly valuable in today's market. and while our results this quarter benefited from higher all-in market prices, the impact was limited given we were largely contracted going into the year.
however, throughout this year, we will have increasing amounts of hydro capacity across our fleet which will come available to benefit from these dynamics. further, over the next five years, the ability to recontract almost 5,500 gigawatt hours of generation in north america should meaningfully add to our bottom line. resetting this generation to forward market prices today would contribute approximately $120 million of incremental ffo while creating incremental financing capacity, which will likely represent a highly accretive funding source for our growth. on behalf of the board and management.
we thank all our unitholders and shareholders for the ongoing support. that concludes our formal remarks for today's call. thank you for joining us this morning. and with that, i'll pass it back to our operator for question.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of nelson ng with rbc capital markets.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks, and good morning, everyone. i just had a few questions on your development pipeline. so thanks for providing all the extra granularity on the development pipeline and kind of outlining the commissioning schedule for the next few years.
one thing i noticed is that there's like very little hydro onshore wind being developed in 2023 and 2024. i guess, big picture, is that trend -- is the trend of solar just getting -- becoming a larger part of your pipeline, like will that continue?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
thanks, nelson. great question. we'll perhaps answer that in two different ways. the first regarding hydro, there is less hydro development going on around the world relative to wind and solar.
that is a noticeable trend and one that we expect to continue going forward. well, that does mean we're going to have less hydro development in our pipeline. also one of the reasons why we're so confident in the increasing value of our existing hydros, which are every day, increasingly scarce assets in their ability to provide dispatchable baseload clean energy to grid. when you then look at wind and solar, we see tremendous growth for both, probably a little bit more growth for solar in our pipeline today than wind, but we remain agnostic between the two technologies.
and the current bias toward solar is simply where we've seen better value entry points to build out our own pipeline. we could see a trend back to wind in the future. we remain diversified and happy to pursue either technology.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. and then just on that pipeline, i think there's roughly 9 gigawatts that you're expecting to commission through 2024. you did mention that you're managing through the inflation costs and supply chain issues. so on that 9 gigawatts, is that -- like are you like very comfortable with that number with potential upside? or have you baked in -- like does that include some contingencies due to any supply issues? because i know in the u.s., there's obviously some uncertainty on u.s.
solar panel imports. and then i think people are still waiting for the biden administration to put through some renewable tax credits in terms of ptc. so what's your view on the 9 gigawatts?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. so i'll take your words very confident with upside. maybe two points on that. first of all, the 9 gigawatts that we disclose in our pipeline that's what already exists today and is either under construction or under contract to be built out.
our business is continuing to grow. so as we execute our business plan, continue to do in-house development to continue to acquire new assets, we would expect those numbers to go up over time. the other point we would make just around your comments in the u.s. is we have a very diversified platform, both our ability to pursue operating assets versus development assets our ability to pursue different technologies at different geographies.
so while there are some minimal disruptions in certain markets around the world, we see a clear path to managing through that and don't expect it to change our growth profile whatsoever.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok, great. and then just one last question. in terms of the 235 megawatt wind acquisition in asia, can you give a bit more color on that acquisition? is it in india or another location? and then also, can you give a bit of background on timing on the rest of that 700 megawatt portfolio in asia?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
yes. certainly, in that wind acquisition is in china, but i'll make a comment about what we are seeing in both asia and china, which is the ability to continue to do repeat business with the same counterparties, we have done transactions with in the past. if you look over the last several quarters, we've been pretty consistent and pretty regular in doing small low-risk, very attractive deals in both the india and chinese markets. and increasingly, what those are, are doing repeat business with the same counterparty.
what i would say is we look forward, we're developing increasingly strong relationships with those partners. and as their pipelines grow, they're increasingly coming to us as a buyer of those assets. because we execute quickly, we execute on time, we provide certainty of closing. and we would expect to do more repeat business with those high-quality counterparties.
in terms of the time line of the next 700 megawatts, definitely within the next two years.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok, thanks. thanks for the color, connor. i'll leave it there.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of sean steuart with td securities. pardon me, sean, please check your mute button.
sean steuart
sorry about that. good morning, everyone. wyatt, at the end of your comments, you touched on potential ffo upside from recontracting. and i guess i have a few specific questions on what the length of these corporate ppa contracts looks like, i suppose, specifically for hydro.
can you comment a little bit on how that's evolving as the pricing environment is increasingly in your favor?
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
yeah. look, sean, so what we say is -- what we've always viewed with our hydros and the merchant exposure we have in north america specifically is that we've always focused on securing contracts even to manage that merchant position, and that's done either through short duration contracts or through financial hedges, but really protecting us from spot price movements. but we hadn't contracted on a longer-term duration because we just weren't seeing an appropriate value to give away that long-term option on our hydro. and so what we are seeing now in this environment, the environment that both connor and i described around the challenges that are occurring with the grid given the intermittency of renewables and the baseload dispatchable nature of hydros, is that we're seeing interest for our hydros on a longer-term basis.
now you would have remembered in the last quarter, we did a 40-year contract with hydro-quebec on one of our hydros. that's not to say that all contracts will be 40 years. but definitely with the increased interest. but we would expect that over time that we are contracting that hydro position on a longer-term duration.
it could be 10 years, 15, whatever, but definitely on a longer-term duration. and again, what that does is not only lock in a price that is very attractive for us. but it just enhances the financeability of our hydro assets with that contract. and it generates very attractive proceeds at very low cost that we can then use to fund our growth.
so again, as a reminder, off that contract we signed last quarter, we raised an additional $1 billion canadian while maintaining a bbb positive rating to execute that financing. so that's the dynamic we're seeing where it's definitely an interest for longer duration contracts, and it has the associated financing benefit.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
and sean, it's connor. i might jump in just to supplement what wyatt said there. and maybe it's helpful for us to provide a little bit more granularity on those short-term contracts and why we see the upside. even when we have merchant exposure and really the primary place we have merchant exposure within our portfolio is our u.s.
hydros. even when we have that merchant exposure, we typically lock in these short-term contracts of either six, nine or 12 months, largely just to help with the settlement of the sales of those electricity volumes. so when power prices began to increase dramatically in, call it, the mid- to latter half of 2021, we had already locked in most of the pricing for our hydros for the first quarter of 2022. but as we move throughout 2022, we are now going to get the benefit of those increased power prices in a fashion that's increasingly going to hit our financials throughout the year in a back-end loaded way.
and that's why we -- one of the reasons we see strong tailwinds for our business throughout this year.
sean steuart
that's useful context. thanks for that. a follow-up question for connor or natalie, you gave great detail on the advantage entropy deal as a first step into carbon capture. can you speak to the long-term investment potential for that technology versus other energy transition options like green hydrogen that you're pursuing as well? how do you benchmark the opportunity set for carbon capture versus some of the other options that might be available?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. so steuart, perhaps, i'll -- or sean, sorry, i'll go first. and then natalie, if there's anything you'd like to add, please jump in. from a brookfield renewable standpoint, we're looking at all of them.
green hydrogen, i would say, energy services companies that facilitate decarbonization and carbon capture. carbon capture, we think is one economic and to rapidly growing in many of our core markets, particularly in canada and the united states. so it's absolutely an asset class that while we made our first step into it this past quarter, we do expect to grow and grow very rapidly and be a significant player in that market going forward. while there is tons of room to run in canada, we do also expect to expand our platform in the united states as well.
in terms of do we like carbon capture better or worse than some of the other decarbonization technologies, i would say that we're going to approach those the exact same way we approach wind, solar, hydro. we're going to be agnostic across them. we're going to look across regions, across asset classes to where we see the best risk-adjusted returns and allocate our capital to those. there is no concerted effort to overconcentrate in one technology versus another.
sean steuart
thanks.
natalie adomait -- managing partner and chief investment officer, transition investing
yeah, conor. and maybe just a the benefit of the global platform that we have means that we can actually focus on, let's say, if we're seeing more carbon capture opportunities in the u.s. first because they have established well-known storage reservoirs we have the ability to kind of move by geography where we're seeing those risk-adjusted returns. but yes, i agree, absolutely pursuing both.
sean steuart
thanks for the detail everyone. i'll pass it on.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of rupert merer with national bank.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone. just a quick follow-up on the carbon capture. can you give more color on maybe what brookfield brings to the table to this market.
what would give you a competitive advantage like you might see in investing in renewables?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. and we go back to fundamentals. what needs to be done on the carbon capture side is very similar to what needs to be done on the renewable side: one, capital needs to be provided; two, you need development, construction and operating capabilities; and three, perhaps the one that's most important that we bring to the equation here, is the ability to work with corporate counterparties to structure long-term contracts around these carbon offtakes that are both financeable and economic. the reason why we are so drawn to an asset class like carbon capture is not only is it a great proven decarbonization technology, but the investment profile is very similar.
you build an asset. and once constructed, it is a long-term, highly visible, highly stable stream of cash flow is very similar to our wind and solar plants around the world.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
great. and do you see this as a potential customer for green power as well as you look at uptake contracts for carbon capture facilities?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
absolutely. one of the things that we are trying to do across our portfolio is enhance our relationship with customers. and this goes exactly to what natalie said in her remarks. the first step in almost every corporate decarbonization plan is, let's address our scope 2 emissions.
let's procure green power, one reduces our electricity cost, but two, reduces the emissions within our business from the consumption of electricity. but from there, we want to be able to offer other forms of decarbonization solutions. that could be energy efficiency solutions or for businesses that are hard to abate and those assets are going to produce emissions, we can now often carbon capture as well to help those businesses reach their own decarbonization goals. and while we've always had green power, and we've increasingly added other decarbonization solutions this last quarter, ccs, we do expect to add other different technologies and solutions going forward as well.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
yeah. thanks, connor. and for my second question here, i may get a very similar answer. but you're talking about the dutch offshore wind tender.
you highlighted it's going to be a subsidy-free call. you may not want to give some competitive information here, but what would be your strategy for bidding there? what can make your bid successful?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. first of all, maybe it's helpful just to highlight a dynamic that we're seeing in offshore that we're really excited about. for many years, the largest offshore markets around the world have grown very rapidly due to their use of feed-in tariffs. you bid in auction based on a feed-in tariff price and the person who's essentially willing to bid the lowest return wins that auction.
and that hasn't really served us well at brookfield renewable because we don't like to compete on cost of capital. one thing that we are really excited about is we're seeing more and more of the largest offshore wind markets around the world. pursue subsidy three auctions. this is great because we feel, one, it plays to our strengths, where our corporate contracting and our operating and construction capabilities become a key differentiating factor.
but two, we think it helps support the whole industry because the winners in those auctions are going to be the premier global operators, not necessarily low low cost of capital financial bidders. so when it comes to the specific auction in the netherlands, we're thrilled to be partnered with a best-in-class global offshore wind builder and operator. we think it's -- we bring very complementary skill sets. we're both leading operators of renewables, both operating and development and construction.
they have one of the largest offshore wind pipelines. they bring great knowledge about marine biodiversity how to construct without disrupting the environment, we bring best-in-class corporate contracting. we think those things together make us a very powerful partnership.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
so if the selection isn't going to be done on price, what can you offer that takes your bid to the top?
natalie adomait -- managing partner and chief investment officer, transition investing
we've been -- hi. it's natalie here, rupert. we've been working very closely with sse and expect to be able to reveal a little bit more of this post bid submission when those have gone in, but it goes back to what connor said. we've got the commercial contracts, which are going to be partnering with a lot of locals in particular.
and really working to focus on the innovation that we can bring based on the track record that both brookfield renewable and sse brings to the table on the ecological and the technical system integration front.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
great. thanks for the color. i'll get back in the queue.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of mark jarvi with cibc capital markets.
mark jarvi -- cibc world markets -- analyst
just -- good morning, everyone. just coming back to the hydro recontracting. obviously, you talked about upper movement in power prices. but how do you balance that off against also maybe more volatility, which could allow you to capture higher realized pricing.
so can you structure the contracts to leave yourself some of that upside? or how do you make that trade-off in terms of locking in higher price but maybe sacrificing some of that peak pricing that might be out there?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
thanks, mark. that's exactly the decision we go through. we can leave our assets merchant and play for the upside or we can lock in long-term prices that through long-term contracts that become immediately financeable and allow us to raise significant amounts of capital. and we make those decisions on an asset-by-asset basis on a daily and weekly decision.
and really, what we try and do is not go too far in either direction. we always layer into our hedges and layer into our contracting such that we don't miss too much to the downside and don't miss too much to the upside. we aren't trying to price for perfection. we are looking to do something that provides a very attractive return for our business over the long term without being either too far one way or the other.
mark jarvi -- cibc world markets -- analyst
ok. and obviously, we've seen volume yields move higher. just in terms of the asset sales and the marketing transactions you're seeing out there, whether it's higher hurdle rates on the risk-free rate or back leverage. have you seen anything change in terms of dynamics of asset transactions in the last couple of months?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
no. and perhaps two comments we would make. we would say public markets are quite volatile right now. share prices in the renewables sector are moving up and down.
what we have seen in private markets is a very consistent, continued strong bid for renewables and decarbonization assets. the volatility in the public markets certainly hasn't flowed through to the private markets yet. and that's helpful for us, both in the terms of asset monetizations, but it also helps that there is a stable pipeline of growth opportunities that we can review as well. the other comment that we think it's probably important to make when it comes to interest rates is well underlying interest rates have moved up significantly over the last six months, we have not seen any lack of depth in the financing market.
yes, underlying rates have moved up, so interest rates on mass are slightly higher, but the depth of the financing market hasn't been reduced at all for renewable power and decarbonization assets.
mark jarvi -- cibc world markets -- analyst
would you say that credit spreads have come in a little bit that allows you to not pass through all sort of that movement in base rates?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
yeah. no, mark, i'd say it's a bit of the opposite where because of just uncertainty around rates, especially if you go out the curve, the spreads have widened out a bit. but again, it's all limited, so there's still a meaningful depth there. and even with the incremental increase in base rates and the widening of the spreads, we still are at a level where it's historically low.
it's just we're coming off a period where it was very historically low. so it's still a very attractive market, irrespective of kind of a bit of a widening of the spreads and increasing underlying base rates.
mark jarvi -- cibc world markets -- analyst
ok. last question. there's been lots of commentary from some other companies and market interest things about the pass-through of higher cost into higher ppa prices, particularly in the u.s. market.
how would you say other regions that you guys are operating, you're seeing those pass-through in terms of ppa price increases? are they on par of what we've seen and heard on the u.s. market? or are there other regions where you're seeing bigger increases on offtake prices?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
it's a great question. it certainly is a global trend and not to be redundant, but we'll make the same comment as before. the price increases that we are seeing are very modest relative to the benefits of decarbonization, energy security and having stable power prices in an environment where global energy prices are very, very volatile. directionally, we're seeing slightly higher ppas in all markets.
but what i would say is markets are relatively efficient. they are taking into account the dynamics of that market. so in a market such as the u.s. where perhaps solar panel supply chain disruptions and the recent investigations are creating some uncertainty.
you might see a slightly higher increase in the ppa price versus a market that doesn't have those specific regional dynamics. directionally, it's happening everywhere. but there is some slight variation depending on the dynamics in a given region.
mark jarvi -- cibc world markets -- analyst
got it. thanks for the time everyone.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of mark strouse with j.p. morgan.
mark strouse -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. good morning. thank you very much for taking our questions. most of them have been answered.
i did want to come back to the solar anti cerd case in the u.s. i'm making the impression that you think that you're in there. first of all, is that right? and then second of all, is that because the project, the new projects that you're working on, you already have panels in country? or is that just based on the types of suppliers that you're using?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
let me try and answer that. the phone cut out a little bit there, mark. but i believe the question was about our situation in managing the current investigation and the impact on the u.s. and i would say it's really driven by three things.
the first is the point you made that we typically, at the time we lock into a revenue contract and therefore, create a delivery obligation. at the same time, we lock in procurement of panels. so when we look at our development pipeline in the u.s., we have already secured on land, the vast majority of panels to support that build out over the next few years. the second point i would make is our global procurement capability.
and i recognize we comment on this probably every quarter. but in this environment, that capability is becoming increasingly valuable. not only do we have great relationships with the largest suppliers, we also have relationships with a huge number of suppliers. and therefore, in situations like this where the market is throwing call it, curve balls that makes on suppliers more advantageous or less advantageous, we are able to reallocate our procurement to get panels and meet our customers' needs.
and then the last thing i wouldn't underestimate is the relationship we have with our customers. we are often one of the largest providers of clean energy to our corporate offtakes. these are long-standing relationships. and our customers are very understanding of what's happening in the market.
and we can have a conversation with those counterparties and work together to get them on the green power that they contracted at the price they wanted. and two, they're not trying to put us in a tough position either because we're going to do business together for a long time. and that might mean we bring one project forward and another project back, that might mean we take some puts and takes in different positions within our portfolio. but i would say that our ability to work with our customers that we have very long-term relationships with that's helping a lot in this environment as well.
mark jarvi -- cibc world markets -- analyst
ok, got it. thank you, connor.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of david quezada with raymond james.
david quezada -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everyone. maybe just coming back to the carbon capture opportunity. i'm just curious if the pace or scale of investments there, is it all dependent on certainty on policy or carbon pricing in canada via the contract for different structure they've discussed or something like that?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
thanks, david. part of the reason why we see an opportunity for carbon capture in canada and similarly in the u.s. is there are fairly defined benefit regime. obviously, there is a legislated and increasing carbon price in canada.
that really provides the economic certainty to the investment we made and a nice upside to the entrap deal is we signed that just days or weeks before canada announced an investment tax credit for carbon capture. and that is something we thought might happen, but we hadn't baked in our underwriting. so it's nice that, that investment is off to a great start. and because of that upside, we do think we will likely deploy the remainder of our convert on an accelerated basis and see more economic projects that we can fund through entropy in the future.
in the u.s. you've got a different form of support through 45q tax credits and other support regimes, and that's what gives us confidence in that market as well. what i would say is when we're making these investments, we are looking at the current support regimes that are long term in nature. but we certainly aren't making prospective bets that are predicated on uncertain or uncertain or expected changes to legislation in the future.
we invest based on what is certain today and if there's upside from there, that's great.
david quezada -- raymond james -- analyst
that's great color. thank you. and then maybe just one more for me. just given the -- your leadership position with corporate buyers of renewable power.
i'm just curious if you can comment on how maybe those contract terms might differ now from, say, a year ago? i mean, you said that ppa prices have certainly gone higher. i'm curious if there's any other maybe more beneficial contract terms that you're able to negotiate in the current environment.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
i would maybe highlight three things that we're seeing. one, obviously, ppa prices are a little bit higher because costs are a bit higher and electricity prices are a bit higher. two, a trend that is not dissimilar to previous quarters. there are simply more of them.
the spectrum and scale of corporate procurers of green energy continues to expand on a quarter-by-quarter basis. and three, there continues to be an improvement in an evolution in the knowledge, both on the provider and the procure side of green power that allows for unique contracts that meet both counterparties needs. increasingly, we're not just seeing payers produce vanilla ppas, we're seeing the opportunities to provide more value-add services like 24/7 green power, matching wind and solar with baseload hydro or storage. those are premium products that more and more customers are looking for.
but on the same side, customers that have very significant green power requirements in the near term are also adjusting their approach as well. sometimes putting things like adjustment factors based on panel prices in those ppas. so the market is very efficient and increasingly constructive to meet the objectives of both producers and procurers of green power.
david quezada -- raymond james -- analyst
that's great color. thanks very much. that's it for me.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of andrew kuske with credit suisse.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks. good morning. i think the question is for connor. and if you could just give us maybe a high-level overview on how you think about bep's role with bam's infrastructure fund and now the energy transition fund? and what that means for your business mix over a longer period of time?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
great question. and it's very simple. for years, our primary vehicle for deployment was deploying renewables through the renewable component of brookfield's global infrastructure fund. and today, we also have the new brookfield global transition fund.
the answer, andrew, is we will deploy through both. we will continue to be the key brookfield lp to the renewable component of the brookfield infrastructure fund, deploying capital in the same way and the same asset classes into the same risk profile as that fund has done for decades. that remains completely unchanged. and then now, in addition, we also have bgtf, the brookfield global transition fund, that focuses on the development and build-out of renewable and clean energy generation and the investment in decarbonization asset classes, services and solutions.
so the key is we're still investing in bit the way we have in the past for the last decade. and now incrementally, we are also investing through bgts. and our combined commitments to those funds are perfectly in line with bet-target deployment.
david quezada -- raymond james -- analyst
ok, that's helpful. and then maybe not to get too far ahead of ourselves, but we've seen the other areas of the group that have had perpetual product, longer-term product, super core, core plus kind of product. do you see an opportunity to take some of the pipeline because you've got, i think it's the 69,000 megawatts of pipeline potential right now and maybe accelerating the development of that and having that cater to a longer duration, more yield oriented product that maybe isn't appropriate, completely appropriate for bep, but it presents an opportunity set as a developer of those assets?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
so i would comment not on that specific to bam, but just more generally. we think that our almost 70 gigawatt development pipeline gives us lots of optionality. and we're going to increasingly do different things with that pipeline to monetize it for the highest and best value. that might be building out assets and holding them ourselves that might be building out assets and selling down a minority to another investor.
that might be a build and flip model. that might also be selling some assets at ready to build once we've derisked them from a development perspective. i would say, given the rapid growth of our pipeline and our increased development capabilities across asset classes and across regions, we're going to pursue all those things but it's probably going to be different. but always with the objective of monetizing those 70,000 megawatts in whichever way gets us the greatest value.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok, thank you. that's really helpful.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of naji baydoun with ia capital markets.
naji baydoun -- ia capital markets -- analyst
good morning. just wanted to go back to the sse partnership. i think you noted that the tenders of a focus on innovation. so i understand more details about what that means will come out in due time.
but just wondering if you can talk about the partnership with sse. is it limited just to the upcoming tenders in the netherlands or do you think you can expand it to other markets and other projects?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. so we have a tremendous respect for sse, and i would say we're thrilled with how the collaboration on this partnership has gone. we increasingly throughout our business, work with partners on large-scale projects. and if there are other opportunities to work with sse, we would be thrilled to do so.
right now, our focus is on the dutch auction. we'll get our bid in, in may and see how the results play out later this year, but they're a best-in-class organization. and if there are opportunities to work with them more in the future, we'd be thrilled to do that.
naji baydoun -- ia capital markets -- analyst
ok. and i just had a question about your organic growth here. it seems to be really accelerating. you're already halfway through your full year deployment urges last year and if we look at the commissioning schedule, it seems like you might be able to even achieve 3 gigawatts a year going forward of new capacity additions.
i guess when you think about that and then you're double by 2030 target that you announced today, even when you factor in some asset sales. it seems like you can achieve that target just with organic growth alone. so i guess, a long-winded way of asking, is that really the plan? and then what is m&a fitted to the picture?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. so when we look at our plan to double the size of our business in the next 10 years, there's absolutely upside to that. and maybe one comment i would make just as a parallel to your question. for the last several quarters, maybe even the last couple of years.
we've been very focused on development because that's where we've seen the best risk-adjusted returns. in the current environment, which is the first volatile market we've had in a little while here, we should remind everyone that we absolutely have the flexibility to buy operating assets as well. and the current environment may create an opportunity for us to do that, and we'll simply continue to allocate our capital to where we see the best risk-adjusted returns. we're never going to do entirely operating or entirely development, but we could see our proportion between the two change over time.
but i think maybe in summary, yes, there is absolutely upside to that number of doubling the size of our portfolio.
naji baydoun -- ia capital markets -- analyst
ok, got it. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of william grippin with ubs.
william grippin -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you, and good morning, everybody. just going back to mark's question from earlier on adcbd. you recently significantly expanded your solar development pipeline in the u.s.
with the urban grid acquisition. i'm just curious, i understand that maybe the contracts that you've been working on over time have -- you've hedged out the component sourcing risk. but just curious, specifically on the acquired urban grid projects? are there -- what are you seeing there? any challenges specifically within that portfolio related to adcbd? thank you.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
great question. this is an important dynamic to maybe dive a little bit deeper into. when we bought urban grid, which we acquired in february, one of the unique things about urban grid and why we felt we were able to buy it for such incredible value is urban grid was very good at the early stage components of development, procuring land, permits and grid connection. what we brought to that transaction is power marketing, corporate contracting construction and financing capabilities.
the key about that business is, while it had ready to build assets, the vast majority of them weren't contracted. we were going to contract them once we became owners. to drill down into your question is the time line of that build-out may be slightly delayed due to a slightly slower pace of procuring panels, perhaps potentially, but that is great, greatly, greatly outweighed by the fact that we underwrote that business assuming ppa prices from q3 and q4 last year. and we're seeing ppa prices for the projects that we do have panels for now being secured anywhere between 30%, 40%, 50% higher than underwriting.
so while some of those projects that weren't contracted we might delay a little bit until there's easier access to panels, but that's being far outweighed by the increased ppa price we're seeing on the ready-to-build projects that do have panels because those are very scarce assets in the u.s. market today.
william grippin -- ubs -- analyst
yup. that make sense. and i guess just dovetailing off of that a bit, the -- does this industry disruption that we're seeing maybe create an opportunity for brookfield to step in and potentially acquire additional pipelines at attractive valuations?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
it may. and we are very fortunate with our global procurement, our relationships with customers, our size, our scale, our balance sheet. there may be some other market participants that have been caught off side by some of these disruptions. and if that creates an opportunity for us to invest or partner with those counterparties, we absolutely would consider it.
william grippin -- ubs -- analyst
got it. appreciate the time
connor teskey -- chief executive officer

operator
renewable second quarter 2022 results conference call. at this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. after the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] as a reminder, today's program may be recorded.
and now i'd like to introduce your host for today's program, connor teskey, ceo. please go ahead, sir.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
thank you, operator. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2022 conference call. before we begin, we would like to remind you that a copy of our news release, investor supplement, and letter to unitholders [audio gap] edgar and our website. to kick off today's call, we will provide an update on the business and some of our recent growth initiatives.
after my remarks, ruth kent, our chief operating officer, will give an update on our development activities, and then wyatt will provide an overview of our operating results and balance sheet and liquidity. following our remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. the business performed well this quarter, generating funds from operations of $294 million or $0.46 per unit, a 10% increase over the same period last year. we continue to advance our key operating priorities as well as execute on transactions from our strong pipeline of growth opportunities.
the trends driving the energy transition continue to accelerate, driven by the focus on net zero ambitions, low cost energy and energy security. given the nature of power as an essential service, our business remains well positioned to operate and grow irrespective of the economic situation. we feel the current environment will continue to favor investors like ourselves, who are well-capitalized and globally diversified with significant development capabilities to build out renewables in scale. as always, we remain focused on growing our leading renewable power platform, expanding the spectrum of decarbonization solutions we can provide to our customers, and building global businesses that are critical to the transition to net zero.
the recent growth in our business has been significant. so far this year, we have deployed or agreed to deploy $4.5 billion or $1 billion net to brookfield renewable. this capital spreads across a wide range of investments, including battery storage, carbon capture, distributed generation, and utility scale wind and solar. to date, our investments into new transition opportunities comprise only a small portion of our capital deployment but mark valuable entry points into segments that we feel have the potential to grow significantly over time.
these investments represent new and incremental growth levers for our business beyond our continued expansion in renewables. our approach to investing in these new transition opportunities is similar to how we look at renewables investments. we look for opportunities that are economic without government subsidy, technologically proven, and underpinned by strong macro tailwinds. we focus on situations where our key advantages of access to capital, knowledge of power markets, operating and development capabilities, extensive customer relationships and global reach can differentiate us both as investors and as operators.
over time, as more decarbonization, products and services scale, we expect transition investments to grow within our portfolio. but that being said, investment in clean power generation remains the largest decarbonization opportunity today, and we therefore expect it to represent the majority of our deployment for the foreseeable future. our global distributed generation business continues to be [audio gap] significant area of growth as the trends of decentralized power generation and direct customer interaction accelerate. in the past year, we have grown our u.s.
dg business by three times to 6,500 megawatts through various organic growth initiatives. these include channel partnerships, joint development agreements, and strategic partnerships like our cooperation agreement with trane technologies, which enables us to leverage our respective capabilities to create full suite decarbonization solutions for our customers. we recently agreed to acquire a leading, integrated, distributed generation developer in the u.s. with a proven track record of developing and operating projects.
we intend to invest $700 million or $140 million net to brookfield renewable, representing both our equity purchase price and additional equity deployment to fund future growth. the business has in-house expertise across all stages of the development lifecycle with 500 megawatts of contracted, operating, and under-construction assets located primarily in the u.s. northeast and an 1,800 megawatt identified development pipeline, of which almost 200 megawatts are de-risked with long-term creditworthy counterparties. with this investment, we further enhanced our position as the global leader in distributed generation with over 10,000 megawatts of operating and development assets.
with capabilities and scale across all our core regions, we are well positioned to keep growing and provide our customers customers with innovative decarbonization solutions across multiple markets. this will help our partners meet their sustainability targets while reducing operating costs through onsite renewable energy and other decarbonization services. we also expanded our north american carbon capture and storage platform through a recently announced joint venture to establish a new carbon management business. under an arrangement with california resource corporation, an independent oil and natural gas company committed to the energy transition, we will fund the development and construction of identified ccs projects in california with an initial goal of deploying up to $500 million of capital or $100 million net to brookfield renewable.
we expect that the joint venture, where we will retain the option to fund projects meeting our objectives, will benefit from a first-mover advantage through crc's ownership of prospective co2 storage reservoirs that are a critical asset for carbon capture and storage in california, one of the most desirable jurisdictions globally, given the state's low carbon fuel standards credit system. the joint venture is targeting the injection of 5 million metric tons per annum in 200 million metric tons of total carbon dioxide storage development, which if reached, could result in an additional investment opportunity of approximately $1 billion or $200 million net to brookfield renewable. lastly, as illustrated, the growth of our u.s. business continues to be significant.
however, it is important to emphasize that all of our recent underwritings did not factor in the recently proposed inflation reduction act, and we believe the investments will deliver excellent results regardless. however, not unexpectedly, if the bill is passed in its current form, it will without doubt be a net positive to the growth of these investments and our business. we are fortunate that with the recent acquisitions we have made this year, including urban grid, our u.s.-based utility scale solar and storage developer, along with the recent acquisitions and growth of our dg business, as well as our ccs joint venture, and our green hydrogen development pipeline that we are uniquely positioned to benefit from the bill. our growth prospects in the u.s.
are significant. our in-house organic growth development pipeline in the united states alone covers a broad range of transition products consisting of 35 gigawatts of wind, solar, and storage and 5 million metric tons per annum of ccs. with that, i'll turn the call over to ruth to discuss some of our recent operational activity. 
ruth kent -- chief operating officer
thank you, connor, and good morning, everyone. i'm excited to be speaking with you today about some of our recent operational initiatives. we believe it's our global operating and development expertise, including our commercial capabilities, that differentiates us as a partner of choice in decarbonization. our 3,200 operating professionals around the world mean we can invest and execute across the entire spectrum of renewable power and transition assets.
we are end to end. for example, we can invest during the asset development stage and leverage our capabilities to secure grid connection, permitting, procure equipment, construct the project, contract the power with corporate off-takers, and ultimately, operate the asset. this end-to-end capability is not only a meaningful organic growth lever for our existing asset assets, but it also enables us to source a wide spectrum of opportunities, where we can bring these capabilities to bear and de-risk investments and earn strong returns. we have a very substantial global development pipeline, which now stands at over 75 gigawatts, along with an 8 million metric tons per annum of co2 carbon capture development pipeline.
of that, we have 17 gigawatts of advanced stage and ready to build construction projects, which we are advancing and delivering on. we continue to be well positioned from a supply chain perspective, given our globally diversified pipeline and strong global relationships. our cash flows have now started to meaningfully benefit from the considerable dollars in the grounds that we have invested into our development projects in the past number of years. these investments will translate into higher earnings.
that will only accelerate for the rest of 2022 into 2023 and beyond. our development investment has increased in recent years and that will continue, meaning we have strong visibility into the future growth of our cash flows as more of our development projects come online. so far this year we have commissioned approximately 1,500 megawatts of capacity, which will contribute approximately $20 million of additional run rate ffo. and we are on track to commission an additional 6,400 megawatts of capacity by the end of 2023.
these are expected to contribute an incremental of approximately $100 million of run rate ffo. this includes our 850 megawatt shepherds flat repowering project. further, with our scale pipeline, we expect to see continued opportunities to pull forward development and accelerate the deployment of capital at accretive returns throughout the portfolio. given this ability to execute globally and at scale, we remain a top choice for corporates looking to procure green power.
this is because we can be a flexible partner offering a full suite of decarbonization solutions from our diverse fleet of renewable power and transition assets across the globe. and despite recent pressure on development and financing costs globally, buyers of clean energy are generally accommodating of cost increases in the form of higher ppa prices, given decarbonization imperatives. energy security tailwinds as well as the still very favorable economics that renewable power presents. most recently, we signed several agreements on wind and solar developments with multinational corporations, who are market leaders in their respective industries.
that includes amazon, basf, johnson and johnson and salesforce. each of these agreements has unique characteristics, but with the consistent underlying theme of helping these corporations decarbonize their operations. by way of example, we are finalizing terms on one of the largest national accounts distributed generation portfolios ever awarded globally, and we signed a 25-year fixed price renewable electricity supply agreement with basf, a multinational chemical company. we're going to power one of its largest production services facilities globally that it is currently building.
all of these agreements involve the buildout of significant clean energy and leverage our deep development expertise and centralized procurement platform. and they represent opportunities to continue to enhance our long-term decarbonization relationships with these global corporations. with that, i'll turn over to wyatt to discuss our operating results and financial position.
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
thank you, ruth. as connor mentioned, we had strong results in the quarter as our operations benefited from strong asset availability, higher power prices, and continued growth both through development and acquisitions. in the current power price environment, we are executing on several initiatives to capture value across our business. for example, at our hydro assets in the united states and columbia, where we have a majority of our uncontracted generation over the next five years, we have been executing contracts at very attractive prices.
at our pump storage assets in the u.k., we have locked in value through 2024, where we typically only do this months ahead. our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong. we have approximately $4 billion of available liquidity, allowing us to opportunistically fund our growth pipeline and no material near-term maturities. additionally, with the recent $15 billion closing of brookfield's global transition fund, we have access to scale capital to invest alongside us, which is a meaningfully -- meaningful advantage given increasingly volatile capital markets.
during the first half of 2022, we accelerated many of our financing activities, extending the term of our debt and locking in attractive interest rates before recent rate increases. during the quarter, we executed over $2 billion of non-recourse financings across the business. notably, on the back of a strong outlook for our colombian business. and in anticipation of potential market volatility ahead of the recent presidential elections, we raised $630 million in financing at an average term of over eight years.
as a result, our balance sheet is in excellent shape with an average debt duration across our portfolio of 13 years and very limited floating rate debt, almost all of which is in brazil and colombia, where we have the benefit of full sla inflation escalation in our contracts. lastly, we also continued to advance our capital recycling initiatives, which when close will generate $560 million of proceeds or $90 million net to brookfield renewable. on behalf of the board and management, we thank all our unitholders and shareholders for the ongoing support. that concludes our formal remarks for today's call.
thank you for joining us this morning. and with that, i'll pass it back to our operator for questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] and our first question comes from the line of sean steuart from td securities. your question, please.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everyone. you touched on the developments you've made with corporate off-taker, new contracts, and you touched on the duration for the basf contract. i'm just wondering if you can give us a little bit broader context on the market for corporate ppas, what you're seeing in terms of price and duration? and if there's a sweet spot that you think about in terms of balancing corporate ppas with traditional contracts and at the margin merchants exposure at this point.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
sure. thanks, sean. perhaps i'll start and then i'll hand to ruth for for her to add additional color. maybe breaking that down into different buckets.
no doubt the two most important dynamics we're seeing in the market as it pertains to corporate contracts right now is one, demand for contracting of green power continues to accelerate. year after year, this -- the total quantum of demand that we're seeing from large global corporates is accelerating on an exponential basis. and short-term market conditions really have done nothing to dissuade that trajectory. but perhaps what's even more important is there's no doubt been some capex inflation in our sector as most sectors around the world.
and what is really interesting, and ruth touched upon this in her remarks, is we are seeing the ability to pass along those cost increases into the corporate ppas in the form of higher prices. and we're not really seeing other adjustments as a result. it's not shorter tenor. it's not a lack of inflation linkage.
it's simply we are able to pass that price increase through to customers because renewable still is cheaper than the alternative of thermals, which has gone up in price even more. and decarbonization and energy security trends continue to accelerate. perhaps the last comment i'll make before handing to ruth is across our business, for many years, the vast majority of our growth has been tied to corporate contracting. feed in tariffs do exist and will continue to exist for a while.
they have a long tail, but the vast majority of our new growth is in corporate contracting and we expect that trend to continue and obviously plays to our strengths, given our power marketing capabilities. ruth, i'll hand to you.
ruth kent -- chief operating officer
thanks. and i would reiterate some of what connor had said. we've been doing this a long time. we have never seen such a world of demand.
it's never been stronger for clean renewable power. it's really two things decarbonization as an imperative, but moreover, economics. look, this is going to be the cheapest strip of power that you will buy over the longer periods and the one that you can fix in, whereas others are a lot more volatile, as connor has mentioned. and that's even before we hit this particularly high cycle of fundamental power prices.
and the other thing i would say is, look, we've been doing this for a long time, and we are somewhat agnostic as to the nature of the contract, whether it's a newbuild power ppa or a more traditional contract. we look to the fundamentals and that is what's your credit risk? can we get good tenor and duration on the contract? and overall, it's a risk management proposition for us. and we have a lot of repeat customers that have journeyed from commodity type contracts with us to renewable newbuilds, which has been super. and overall, i would say you mentioned merchant power.
we generally don't look to hold an awful lot of merchant power in our book. we would much rather de-risk all of our positions, lock in our economics, and move on to the next newbuilds that we have. so that tends to be how we look at things. hope that's helpful.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
and sean, we met at one point, which is just your question around term. we're seeing no shortage of term. corporates are looking for 15 or 20 year contracts or potentially even longer. really what this is, is a great insurance policy for them against volatile or higher power prices in the future.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
that's great context. thanks for that second question. with respect to the energy transition investment outside renewable generation, there is a note of focus on technologies that are economic without subsidization. can you give us a sense how you handicap those opportunities outside of traditional renewable generation opportunities? how do you think about the other energy transition options you have with respect to not needing as much subsidization?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. perhaps what we can do is look at some of the things that we've done and then look forward into some of the opportunities we're seeing. if you see the the expansion of the types of opportunities we've looked at from more traditional utility scale wind, solar, and hydro, increasingly our first step was things like battery storage and dg. from there, we're seeing opportunities in carbon capture, where there's very well-defined revenue models that can support the business.
and the other very large energy transition asset class that is very front and center for us today is hydrogen. we remain focused on it, but we do view it as a slightly longer term growth opportunity as the cost curve for that business comes down and ceases to rely on subsidies. the only other point we would add as it pertains to energy transition is we increasingly see -- are seeing opportunities in very high quality service providers to the power sector that really provide critical functions to clean energy around the world. and as we look at that space, we'll only pursue it if we get the right value entry point at the rate risk return objectives.
but we are seeing more and more opportunities in that space that could represent additional growth levers for our business.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
that's great detail. thanks, connor. appreciate it.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of mark jarvi from cibc capital markets. your question, please.
mark jarvi -- cibc world markets -- analyst
thanks. good morning. i'm wondering if you could shed some more light on the investment in power utilities. i know you took a direct stake in them, just maybe walk me through at what point do you want to be? equity investors, direct an entity versus providers of capital.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
mark, great question. and we'll come at this from two perspectives. one, just to highlight two of the investment in general, and then two, our approach to where we want to invest in the capital structure. what this opportunity is, is the opportunity to invest in what we would describe as a a multi-jurisdictional, multi-asset utility focused across a number of jurisdictions that we're very comfortable operating in central and latin america.
the reason why we like this business is it's 100% operated in u.s. dollars and operates on 100% under long-term contracts. but what this business needs is capital to, one, grow and, two, decarbonize. and they reached out to us and we created a structure that that we can help support them both financially as a capital provider, but also as our operating partner in achieving those goals.
and really, the near-term opportunity is facilitating the buildout of a 1.3 gigawatt renewables development pipeline that they have across their portfolio. as mark alluded to, we invested both through a preferred equity structure, as well as taking a minority position in the common equity. when it comes to the exact structure of how we want to invest alongside our partners, it always comes down to two things are we getting the right risk-adjusted returns? and two, do we have the appropriate level of influence and control? and the structure we pursued in this transaction works very well. the preferred equity investment provides very nice downside protection to our returns while the minority equity position ensures that we have the appropriate level of influence and can really bring our operating capabilities to bear to drive the decarbonization plan at the company.
mark jarvi -- cibc world markets -- analyst
thanks, connor. you mentioned that they came to you. i'm wondering also just what the energy transition plan out there now. you've done some stuff on ccs, different deals here you're talking about.
what is sort of the interest coming back in to you as opposed to you guys chasing deals like this? has it changed at all in the last year or so?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
i would say it's been very significant coming back to us. no doubt we continue to have a large team around the world that is pursuing and manufacturing transactions the way it always has in the past. but no doubt the launch and the recent conclusion of the fundraise of bgtf has been very helpful in highlighting how we can be that very helpful provider of capital, as well as operating partner for businesses, one, looking to scale decarbonization solutions but, two, who need a partner and a capital provider to decarbonize their own operations. and no doubt some of that inbound interest is showing up in the level of growth we're seeing in our business today.
mark jarvi -- cibc world markets -- analyst
ok. and then just coming back to the corporate ppa, is there any segment of the market you're missing out, smaller industrial off-takers, smaller commercial entities? or is that just really not the focus for you? and then if power prices do fall back down with severe volatility, do you feel like the pace of the corporate ppa market, i guess, contracting that we've seen you talk about being exponential growth, does that slow?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. so in response to your first question, this is simply a decision we have made to play to our strengths. and our strengths are we can be a scale provider of green power, we can also be a provider of green power across all major technologies, whether it's distributed generation, solar, wind. but most importantly, we can be a provider of green power to global corporates anywhere in the world that they operate.
and that is something that is very, very unique to brookfield renewable, the ability to follow corporates, leading global corporates across all industries around the world to support the decarbonization of their operations. and our decision to do this is simply because it is where we are differentiated and we can do the largest and most attractive opportunities. no doubt we are also doing a number of smaller deals on an ongoing basis, but our ability to differentiate on those large global partnerships is a competitive advantage that we certainly want to continue to pursue. to your second question around, if power prices come down, do we think demand for corporate ppas will be reduced? absolutely not.
and apologies for being redundant here, but the macro drivers of our business are far bigger than short-term power prices or short-term market volatility. the trends around decarbonization that are often set by corporates themselves that are actually outpacing government regulation, the focus on energy security, and lastly, the point around economics, all of those just continue to be solidified and therefore, if prices are higher, prices are low, we don't see demand decelerating at all.
mark jarvi -- cibc world markets -- analyst
ok. thanks for taking my question.
operator
thank you. one moment for our next question. and our next question comes from the line of rupert merer from national bank financial. your question, please.
unknown speaker -- national bank financial -- analyst
good morning, luca here filling for rupert. so i'd like to know if you could give us more color on your edge book in the northeast u.s. for your [inaudible] segment.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. thanks, rupert. so thank you for the question because it's a very important dynamic to highlight. there's really only two places across our portfolio where we hold any scale amount of merchant exposure.
and that is our large hydro portfolio in colombia and secondly, our large hydro portfolio in the united states. and there's two important dynamics here. one is we are absolutely not averse to contracting these portfolios. we simply haven't wanted to do it when we think power prices were low and below, call it, run rate fundamentals.
and that certainly had been the case for a number of years prior to what we've seen in, call it, the last six or 12 months. the second dynamic we would highlight is when we are not long-term contracting these assets, we do tend to enter into short-term rolling hedges just to facilitate settlement of our power sales. so therefore, we refer to it as merchant but they're still under six, nine, or 12-month rolling contracts. why that's an important dynamic is when power prices began to go up in the latter part of 2021.
as you move into 2022, we were already contracted under these short-term contracts well into q1, a bit more into q2 and on a decreasing basis into q3 and q4. and therefore, the benefits of the higher power prices, we are only now beginning to see flow through our results. to put all of that together and come back to your question, given where power prices are today, we are moving quite consciously to lock in these high power prices as far as we can into the future. obviously, only where there is liquidity in the market and, two, only to levels that that are appropriate for our p50 generation.
but at this point, we are locking in our hydro's two to three years in the future in this market.
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
and maybe -- it's wyatt here. maybe the only thing i would just add, just to add context to the numbers, is in the prior quarter, we put out a number of $120 million from the -- over the next five years from the benefit of doing that. and it's really 5,500 terawatt hours that we have coming off contract that's available for the benefit of pricing and locking those in on a forward basis at today's or at the rate that the time would have led to $120 million of benefit per annum. and what we'd say is that number has only been de-risked in the sense that we have been executing.
and since that point, power markets have actually seen some beneficial push upwards as well. and so there's probably a little bit of tailwinds to that as well.
unknown speaker -- national bank financial -- analyst
awesome. thank you very much. and now changing topics a little bit, moving to development pipeline. are you seeing much margin pressure for the projects in the pipeline? and if yes, is there a way for you to offset? you have the ability to renegotiate any contract prices for some markets?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. so, rupert, i'll take this and then i'll hand to ruth, because some of the dynamics we're seeing with our interactions with customers are really constructive. what i would say is it's really this point that we have been able to increase the market price of the ppas that we are executing to take into account the inflation that we're seeing in capex cost, whether it be wind turbines or solar panels. this has led to ppa prices going higher.
but i would say that the step change up in ppa prices has almost fully offset the increase in capex. and essentially another way of saying that is our development returns, we're not seeing significant compression. yes, the capex is higher, but the ppas are going higher to offset that. perhaps.
i'll hand to ruth to highlight some of the really constructive conversations we're having with customers around new features and ppas.
natalie adomait -- managing partner and chief investment officer, transition investing
yeah, it's a great question, by the way. so we are having very constructive conversations, particularly with a lot of our repeat customers that we work with across the globe and coming up with different mechanisms to support delivery of their decarbonization targets in a timely fashion. so things like indices that we are used to seeing, for example, in wind supply contracts, etc., moving those into our ppas and or allowing for and reopening is at different points of their capex cycle. so again, i'd reiterate a number of things we said earlier.
our customers see enormous value in the long-term ppas and the security and pricing that they're getting from us. so any escalation in capex is absorbable at an economic level for them and still presents a lot of value. so they really want to work with us on that rather than a scenario where they have seen a number of smaller developers just hand back contracts. nobody wins in that scenario.
so we're working very constructively. in some cases, we're delaying slightly. in others we're putting some mechanisms into contracts and so that overall we're in a good place with our economics. the other point i would make is this is -- this situation is tending to be concentrated and exacerbated perhaps in the u.s.
we have a global pipeline so we can accelerate in some jurisdictions and pull back in others if the economics aren't coming toward us. so lots of options in the diversity of our book, to be honest.
unknown speaker -- national bank financial -- analyst
awesome. thank you. i'll jump back in the queue.
operator
thank you. one moment for our next question. and our next question comes from the line of ben pham from bmo. your question, please.
ben pham -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. thanks for the morning. i want to check on your development pipeline. over the last, call it, 12 months or 18 months, how much of that increase is mostly due to acquisitions or just simply getting in land and sites?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
thanks, ben. great question. there's -- i want to come back at your question in kind of breaking things into three buckets. unequivocally, you are correct.
we have bought a number of businesses that come with large development pipelines, and that is the largest chunk of the expansion in our pipeline capacity over the last 12 months. we don't have a specific number for you here today, but no doubt i would expect that's probably about two-thirds to 70% of the expansion in that number. but there's two other things that have also driven the remaining, call it, one-third or 30%. one is our operating teams around the world in every jurisdiction that we operate in now, we have a local brookfield renewable boots on the ground development team that is doing their own greenfield development, securing their land, getting permits, securing grid connection.
that is driving that number a little bit higher. and then the last point, which perhaps is the most relevant, is a number of the businesses we have bought over the last, call it, six or 12 or even 24 months. we've bought development platforms that, one, come with an existing development pipeline, but also come with teams that continuously grow those pipelines. we've seen x-elio, we've seen urban grid, we've seen cenovus, we've seen our dg business.
when we bought those businesses, they came with the development pipeline. but under our ownership, they've also organically grown those pipelines higher. so i don't know if you put that third bucket in m&a or organic, it's a bit of a mix of both, but that's a very significant amount of the increase as well.
ben pham -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. great. and just thinking, too, that when -- do you take that for further development projects you're acquiring, you're paying very little value for it in the initial price, but you're basically probably accelerating by years the ability to crystallize value.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly there is no doubt that the development pipelines we've acquired over the last 12 to 24 months are more valuable today than at the time that we bought them as many of those development assets are not only worth more, but there's the opportunity to pull those assets forward and pull them out of the ground. and therefore, on an npv value basis, simply bring those cash flows forward and increase their value that way. the other thing i would highlight is when we buy developers, it is probably flippant to say there's a free auction on the development pipeline. that is probably unfair, but when we do our due diligence and underwriting, what we do is we look at what is operating, what is very advanced, and we look at all the different stages of assets in the development pipeline and typically go site by site to determine the probability of those assets coming through and coming out of the ground in the near term.
and what i would say is you do attribute some value to the optionality of some of the early stage projects. but i would say that the value we attribute to those is very, very low and we've probably seen some significant gains there over the last 12 to 18 months.
ben pham -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yeah. i guess you got to pay for some of those with equity. i'm also wondering, lastly, there was a comment early around, i don't know, about redeploying capital. maybe you can be more flexible of where you want to invest geographically.
are you -- can you talk about just areas where you've maybe pulled back on focus and another side areas where you've spent a bit more time on?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. it's a good question. i would say if we think about our global portfolio right now, most of our regions are really firing on all cylinders. and that's because the global trends are -- sorry.
the trends driving our business are global in nature. no doubt the vast majority of our activity in the last 12 months has been in the united states. there has been a concentration there in the last six months. but i would say our general rule of thumb of, call it, 75% of our business being in developed countries, primarily in north america and europe, that largely holds.
and that's because we don't necessarily do more deals in those geographies, but that certainly tends to be where we do the largest transactions. some of this is highlighted in our shareholder letter, but in just the last quarter, we continue to see growth in our brazil business, our indian business, our asia-pacific business. so there's nowhere that we're really seeing things decelerate in the current environment.
ben pham -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. great.
operator
thank you. thank you. one moment for our next question. our next question comes from the line of david quezada from raymond james.
your question, please.
david quezada -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everyone. my first question here just on the jv and the investment with california resources corporation, i'm just curious what kind of role you'll take there. aside from an investing role, will you help finding offtake counterparties or anything like that? and just any thoughts around whether or not you could see synergies between that carbon capture investment and other ones you're making maybe down the road?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. so maybe just to -- thank you for the question, david. maybe to highlight why we're so attracted to the jv, we obviously made our first investment in carbon capture earlier this year, an investment in a company called entropy in alberta, canada. prior to making that investment, we did a global review in our core geographies of which markets we thought were the most attractive for ccs.
and the markets we came up with were alberta, california, and some markets in europe. so the first thing we really like about the partnership with crc is we think it targets one of the most attractive markets globally for ccs. and then secondly, once we're targeting the most attractive market, we feel we are partnered with the most well-positioned counterparty. crc is one of the largest non-government landowners in the state.
therefore, they have access to both land rights and mineral rights that that gives them access to significant amounts of potential pore space. and they also have some of the most advanced permits for ccs in the united states. so what are we bringing to the partnership? you absolutely nailed it. it's not just capital.
very similar to how we leverage our relationships with corporates around green power, some of the largest potential customers of the crc jv are some of our largest existing power customers, so we see significant overlap in synergies there. and then secondly, and not dissimilar to what we see across our hydro business, our solar business, as we add more platforms and more businesses in the ccs space, there is simply the ability to share best practices, share knowledge, share wins to enhance all of our investments. and we think both entropy and crc will benefit from that, the fact that we're -- we own both those platforms and potentially could own other ccs platforms in the future.
david quezada -- raymond james -- analyst
that's great color. thank you for that. and then maybe just one more for me. there's some commentary in the release about trying to move as fast as possible to build new projects in germany.
just curious if there any goalposts you can provide around the size of that opportunity. and yeah, just any other opportunities that maybe you could see more broadly in europe related to that high power price environment?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. and there's two things that are helping that ability to accelerate projects. one, there's obviously very, very strong demand. what is happening to the energy environment in europe is essentially every major government, yes, they are taking some short term measures to try and reduce energy prices, but the long-term solution is the accelerated buildout of renewables.
so in germany, what i would say is our total investment in our german solar business that we bought right around the turn of this year, we probably accelerated our capital deployment in totality about 40%. so a fairly material step change and that's probably a good proxy of some of the opportunities we're seeing. but the other point that's really helpful is that this is not just driven purely by economics. one shift we are seeing in europe, and it absolutely has room to run, is governments are working to reduce some of the obstacles around permitting and building renewables and working to accelerate the process of bringing projects out of the ground.
and we've seen that across a number of markets in europe, and that's no doubt benefiting our ability to pull some of those projects forward.
david quezada -- raymond james -- analyst
appreciate the color. thanks, connor. i'll turn it over.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of william grippin from ubs. your question, please.
william grippin -- ubs -- analyst
all right. thank you very much. first question here, you've talked in the past and a little in the press release about locking in your component prices when you're signing contracts with customers. just curious if you could speak to any component availability and how that's looking, particularly in the u.s., just given u.s.
lpa enforcement has taken effect, and any impacts you're seeing there? thanks.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. so i'll start and then i'll hand to ruth and. we continue to see the very dramatic benefits of, one, the global scale of our business and, two, our centralized procurement capabilities. and what i would say is as it pertains to some of the supply issues related to equipment procurement across our portfolio, we are not immune to it in that it is taking significant amounts of our team's time and effort, but it is very manageable for us, given the capabilities we have and the relationships we have.
so it is taking a lot of effort and a lot of time, but we are managing through quite well and it's certainly not having any noticeable or material impact on our business. perhaps i'll hand to ruth to provide some more additional color.
ruth kent -- chief operating officer
yeah, sure. connor is right. we're spending an awful lot of time on this topic. look, supply chain continues to be disrupted, particularly as it pertains to the u.s.
that, ironically, is providing some tailwinds elsewhere in terms of being able to procure equipment. so not all bad in our book. and our global supply chain team based out of a pack and also in north america are working their way through this. the counterparts that we were dealing with on the solar side are adjusting traceability with regard to that u.s.
pla is going further than they expected, and i think it will just take time for those supply chains to adjust to that new requirement. as connor mentioned, look, we're not materially affected because of our global diversification. the u.s. challenges are a tailwind to other jurisdictions.
and within the u.s., it's more for us about the timing of our pipeline that's helping. and and we have some flexibility, as we mentioned earlier, with our counterparts who are being very constructive, where we need them to be. so managing our way through it. overall, not material to our business, fortuitously, because we didn't have a a deep concentration of activity in this period in the u.s.
we're global. so that has helped. this has more to go, i think. we'll be talking about it for a while.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and our next question comes from the line of andrew kuske from credit suisse. your question, please.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks. good morning. connor, if you could maybe just give us some perspective on any organizational constraints you see right now in the renewable group. and ask the question in part because capital doesn't seem to be lacking, opportunity doesn't seem to be lacking, given the pipeline that you have.
economics can vary and that can ebb and flow, but you've also got a global platform. supply chain issues were mentioned earlier, but that also varies by region. so maybe just step back and big picture of the organization, what constraints exist for you to really accelerate growth to even another level from where you are now?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly, and appreciate the question, andrew. no doubt a big focus from our side on the operational level is scaling up our team and that has been both enhancing the amount of resource we have on the investment side but, you nailed it, in particular the the operating side as well. and we've been looking to scale up our resources, i would say, in all of our markets over the last two years. and well, it is a competitive market out there for acquiring and retaining talent.
i would say we feel very, very good about our position in the number and quality of people we've brought on board. it's absolutely not going to slow down. our capital, as you mentioned, is growing. the scale of our operations is growing.
so we'll continue to scale our people as well. in terms of limitations on the growth of our business, we're thrilled about this quarter. we're thrilled about how our operations were performing. we're thrilled about the level of growth.
and what excites us is we have very good visibility on this level of activity continuing throughout the remainder of 2022. so while our business is growing and we are requiring a global scale-up of our operations, we're certainly not seeing bottlenecks, at this point, but it's something that that we absolutely need to stay on top of as we take these, call it, step changes in terms of growth.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
appreciate that color. and then maybe just building upon some of your comments, does the dynamic of being inherently local in multiple markets and then the fact that that becomes a global to a certain degree, does that help your competitive offering on attracting and retaining talent?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
it absolutely does. and it also provides a different benefit, which is not all markets accelerate at the same pace. and we often when we see opportunities in a specific region, we will pull resources from another region that have relevant experience or relevant knowledge to help us in either growing a business or doing due diligence on an acquisition. so i think the scale and growth of our platform is attractive to market participants in the space, who are looking for roles.
but the other thing that we shouldn't underestimate, the benefit of in terms of our global platform, is the ability to pull resources from any geography or any expertise or any asset class and deploy those resources into a specific transaction if they can be useful. we've seen this all over the world. if we're entering a new asset class in a specific geography, we don't learn from zero. we pull very high level knowledge from other parts of the the organization to that region, such that we can start ahead of the game and simply accelerate from there.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. thank you. very helpful.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of naji baydoun from ia capital. your question, please.
naji baydoun -- ia capital markets -- analyst
to go back to the topic of m&a, clearly, you have good liquidity and there's not really a rush or need to sell assets to fund growth. i'm just wondering if you can talk about that more. what are you seeing sort of the large scale opportunities? you've been very successful this year with m&a. just wondering about the dynamics between smaller scale versus larger scale deal flow.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. thanks, naji. perhaps the most interesting thing in the current environment is you mentioned that we're quite fortunate to have very significant access to capital. our balance sheet is in a fantastic position.
over the last 12 months, we've pulled forward a lot of our financing activities. we have very little to do over the next 12 months. so we are sitting on significant amounts of liquidity, plus we have our partner capital through the brookfield global transition and brookfield infrastructure funds. we think this could really help in terms of m&a growth as we look forward in the short to medium term.
no doubt capital markets are a little bit more volatile and those market participants that rely on the capital markets in order to execute m&a may be a little bit less competitive or a little bit more active in the short to medium term. we are not burdened with those restrictions and, therefore, we do think m&a will remain quite active at certainly throughout the remainder of this year.
naji baydoun -- ia capital markets -- analyst
would you say then in the current market, you're seeing better returns on m&a versus development assets?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
it's a good question. perhaps what i would say is they're certainly not worse. i'm not sure we're quite at the point where we're seeing distressed sellers. i think that would be a misrepresentation of the current market.
but what we are seeing is when we look at assets, there are simply less market participants due to the current economic environment. so maybe there is some small upside to returns, but perhaps better characterized, that's absolutely not worth.
naji baydoun -- ia capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and maybe just staying on the topic of competition, i think sse renewables provided some very interesting details about their joint bid in the offshore wind market in netherlands. are you seeing more of these types of opportunities of being able to offer maybe more complex structures versus, let's say, a straightforward government subsidy or versus even your competitors in different markets? and what do you think that strategy of having more tools and pullbacks can really create advantage?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
well, the strategy of having more tools in our toolbox, that's been our game plan for years. and the there's two things we focus on is one is exploiting the benefits of having those additional tools but, two, constantly adding new tools to our toolbox. and a great example of that is now we have carbon capture as a decarbonization solution that we can offer to our biggest customers around the world. we didn't have that 12 months ago in terms of what i would say, brookfield renewable, our approach to growth has not changed.
we don't compete on cost of capital. we look for opportunities where we can be differentiated either by our size, our global reach, our operating capabilities, or our ability to craft a unique solution that is mutually beneficial for both us and our counterparty. and in the current environment, there's certainly a lot of opportunities to do that because both counterparties are looking for those unique solutions and there are simply less market participants, who are well positioned to execute.
naji baydoun -- ia capital markets -- analyst
thank you very much for those details.
operator

2022-Q3,BEP,2022-11-04 08:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
hello, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the bep third quarter 2022 results conference call and webcast. [operator instructions] it is now my pleasure to introduce ceo, connor teskey.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
thank you, operator. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2022 conference call. before we begin, we would like to remind you that a copy of our news release, investor supplement, and letter to unitholders can be found on our website. we also want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements on this call.
these statements are subject to known and unknown risks, and future results may differ materially. for more information, you are encouraged to review our regulatory filings available on sedar, edgar, and on our website. on today's call, we will provide an update on the business and some of our recent growth initiatives. esper nemi, our vice president in our investments team in north america, will discuss the growth of our renewables development business in the united states.
i will then provide an overview of our recently announced acquisition of westinghouse and why it will finish off the call discussing our operating results and financial position. following our remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. we had a great quarter, demonstrating both through our strong financial results and the execution of several large-scale growth initiatives. we generated funds from operations of 243 million or $0.38 per unit, a 15% increase from the same period last year, as well as we advanced our key commercial priorities and development activities.
we continue to believe that our business is uniquely positioned, providing investors with one of the most attractive value propositions in the sector. we feel this way for a number of reasons. first, our business is supported by a highly diversified global platform of clean energy assets, providing deep operating knowledge and visibility and the flexibility to deliver decarbonization solutions for our customers around the world. second, our cash flows are contracted long term and inflation-linked, meaning we will remain resilient throughout all economic environments.
third, our robust liquidity, strong balance sheet, and access to deep and varied sources of capital provide us the ability to execute on some of the largest and most attractive decarbonization investment opportunities. and lastly, we have a differentiated growth capability with over 100 dedicated investment professionals around the world looking to deploy capital at attractive risk-adjusted returns while delivering on our 12% to 15% return target. in this regard, we had a record quarter, as we closed our secured investments of up to $6 billion of capital or 1.5 billion net to brookfield renewable across various transactions in regions. this includes the continued growth of our leading u.s.
renewables development business for which we will turn the call over to esper to discuss. 
esper nemi -- vice president, investments
thank you, connor. and good morning, everyone. as conor mentioned, our u.s. business continues to see significant growth.
following the close of our recently announced acquisitions, our development pipeline in the country will send out over 60,000 megawatts and is well diversified across wind, utility scale solar, distributed generation, and energy storage. the significant pipeline alongside existing scale operating business means that we are owners and operators of one of the largest, diversified, clean power businesses in the country. recently, we announced the acquisition of scout clean energy and standard solar, both of which will be highly complementary to our existing business. scout clean energy is one of the largest utility scale fully integrated renewable development platforms in the us.
across wind, solar, and storage. we purchased the business for 1 billion, with the potential to invest an additional 350 million to support the business' development activities. in aggregate, this is 270 million net to brookfield renewable. scout has a sizable existing portfolio of over 800 megawatts of operating wind assets and an attractive pipeline of over 22,000 megawatts of wind, solar, and storage projects across 24 states.
this includes almost 2,500 megawatts of under construction and event stage projects, with high visibility for commercialization and nearly 5,000 additional megawatts to have valuable interconnection key positions. there's a strong management team in place with significant renewable power experience and a proven track record of successfully developing and financing over 20 gigawatts of clean energy assets. this team will be a great compliment to our capabilities and will benefit significantly from being a part of our business, especially our commercial and procurement capabilities. standard solar is a leading integrated distributed generation developer in the u.s.
we announced the signing of this investment last quarter, and we have now closed the acquisition for consideration of 540 million, with the potential to invest an additional 160 million to support the business' growth initiatives, or 140 million in total net to brookfield renewable. standard solar is a market-leading owner and operator of commercial and community distributor solar with end-to-end development capabilities and a strong track record of delivering high-quality assets. the business has approximately 500 megawatts of operating and under-construction contracted assets and an almost 2,000 megawatt identified pipeline. there's an experienced management team in place with a proven ability to execute on significant growth opportunities across several high-value solar markets in the u.s.
that are highly complementary to existing business. finally, it is important to emphasize that when we underwrote these investments, as well as urban grid, our utility scale solar development platform that we acquired in the first quarter, we do not factor in the impacts of the inflation reductions. however, with inflation reduction act firmly enacted, it will provide meaningful upside to our sector and, in particular, these development platforms. these investments will benefit from the extension of tax credits for wind and solar projects, as well as the expansion of tax credits that include storage, which can meaningfully accelerate and increase the buildout of the high-quality development pipelines within these businesses.
thank you for your time today. with that, i'll turn the call back over to connor to discuss our investment in westinghouse.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
thanks, esper. any credible net-zero plan must include a meaningful and growing amount of nuclear power generation. not only that, the same industry tailwinds of decarbonization, electrification, and energy security are a benefit to nuclear power generation, the same way that they are to wind, solar, and hydro. last month, we reached a definitive agreement to acquire westinghouse alongside our strategic partner cameco, one of the largest global suppliers of uranium fuel for nuclear power generation.
westinghouse is a global leader in providing critical products and services to the nuclear power industry. the transaction represents a very attractive risk-adjusted return proposition as the business is underpinned by highly durable cash flows, with approximately 85% of revenues coming from long-term inflation-linked contracted, or highly recurring services, and a business that comes with nearly a 100% customer retention rate. westinghouse acts as a service provider, and, therefore, it does not take on any commodity, construction, or significant fixed-price contract risk, nor does it have any exposure to nuclear liabilities as it operates in countries where those liabilities for nuclear accidents lies with the plant operators. the total equity invested for the transaction will be approximately 4.5 billion or 750 million net to brookfield renewable, where we, along with our institutional partners, will own 51% of the company, and cameco will own the remaining 49%.
our investment in westinghouse is an attractive entry point into nuclear power generation, which we believe, along with hydro, to be one of the key technologies facilitating the rapid buildout of intermittent renewables. wind and solar must be complemented by clean, dispatchable baseload power generation. as the owner of one of the largest hydro businesses globally, we have visibility to the increasing value of clean, reliable, and economic sources of power to the grid. westinghouse is exceedingly well-positioned to benefit from these secular trends.
it is the leading original equipment manufacturer and scale provider of mission-critical technologies, products, and services to half the global nuclear power generation fleet. westinghouse serves as a key enabler of the energy transition around the world, providing products and services essential to both the continued operation and growth of the global nuclear fleet. given the need for clean, dispatchable energy, as well as its compelling economic proposition, we believe that nuclear power is posed for significant growth. and as long as nuclear power exists, westinghouse will perform well.
westinghouse is well-positioned to benefit from the significant volume of plant extensions that have been announced, 50 gigawatts and growing, and the more than 60 gigawatts of new build reactors expected between 2020 and 2040 across more than 20 countries around the world. recently, the polish government announced that it had chosen westinghouse to support a first project of three units with an option for another three using westinghouse's ap1000 nuclear reactor technology. this was a key step toward the country achieving its decarbonization targets and greater energy independence. lastly, there are multidecade growth opportunities in the rollout of next-generation advanced nuclear technology, such as westinghouse's evinci micro-reactor technology, which can play a growing role in an increasingly decentralized and decarbonized energy system.
with that, we will turn the call over to wyatt to discuss our operating results and financial position.
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
thank you, conor. as mentioned in earlier remarks, we had strong results in the quarter as our operations benefited from strong global power prices and continued growth, both through development and acquisitions. our balance sheet is in excellent shape, with our credit rating recently affirmed at bbb+ with a stable outlook. we remain resilient to the rise in interest rates globally with over 90% of our borrowings being project-level, nonrecourse debt with an average remaining term of 12 years, no material near-term maturities, and only 3% exposure to floating rate debt.
in increasingly volatile markets, our access to diverse pools of capital becomes even more differentiated. we have over $3.5 billion of available liquidity, giving us significant financial flexibility during periods of capital scarcity. during the quarter, we secured over $3.7 billion of nonrecourse financings across the business that will close this year, resulting in over $400 million in our financing proceeds to us. as both connor and esper illustrated, we had an impressive quarter for growth and are confident we can maintain this pace of deployment going forward.
importantly, we are very well-positioned to fund this growth. as i mentioned, we have access to deep and varied sources of capital, which is increasingly valuable in the current market. a significant portion of our recent growth is already funded or is structured to have capital deployed over a prolonged period and in almost all cases better option. further, we intend to more actively take advantage of the strong bids we are seeing for a number of our mature assets where we have successfully executed our business plan.
recycling proceeds from mature assets into new growth opportunities remains one of the most value accretive levers within our business. we also have initiated capital recycling activities that in total, when closed, expect to generate approximately $830 million of total proceeds. we have also launched numerous sales processes for some of our mature assets in select markets, which are garnering significant interest at very attractive valuations, providing significant visibility to our capital recycling program for the coming quarters. in closing, we believe the future opportunities for investing in clean power and the energy transition will be even greater than they are today.
and our scale track record and global capabilities position us as a partner of choice in decarbonization. on behalf of the board and management, we thank all our unitholders and shareholders for their ongoing support. that concludes our formal remarks for today's call. thank you for joining us this morning.
and with that, i'll pass it back to our operator for questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] and our first question comes from the line of robert hope with scotiabank.
rob hope -- scotiabank -- analyst
good morning, everyone. just the first question on the development pipeline. you've been quite successful year to date on, you know, expanding that pipeline. however, with 10,000 megawatts potentially entering service here in the next couple of years, you know, that could meaningfully drive down that pipeline.
you know, it does seem like there's a little bit of a gold rush for development companies right now. how do you envision, you know, longer term replacing this development pipeline?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
thanks, rob. maybe a couple of comments there. first and foremost, it's absolutely true that over the past 12 months, we've made a number of acquisitions of businesses that come with large in-place development pipelines. and that has dramatically increased our businesses' total development capacity to approximately 100,000 megawatts.
but what's important to recognize is when we buy those businesses, we're not buying static operations. they come with management teams that have incredible greenfield development capabilities, such that they can continue to organically grow those development pipelines themselves. and i would, perhaps, take a slightly different view. i would expect that, while we do intend to build well north of 10 gigawatts of that pipeline out over the next three years, i would expect, three years from now, when we look to the next three years, we'll be looking to build far more than 10 gigawatts out in that period as well.
so, we expect to see that pipeline continue to be pulled forward and to continue to grow, given the development capabilities we have within our business. and no doubt some of that support for things like -- some of the support that comes from policies, such as the ira, are significantly going to help that dynamic. the other comment i would make is just around our success, particularly in the united states, around acquiring development platforms. if you go back 12 to 18 months, there were a lot of development businesses sold in the united states.
and candidly, we looked at almost all of them. and we put a lot of work into them, and we bid at what we thought were attractive returns. and we weren't very competitive in 2021. and then 2022, we've used the same investment discipline, and we've been successful on bidding on a number of those acquisitions.
and i do think that demonstrates, perhaps, what is happening in the market where less-sophisticated investors that maybe don't have the access to capital that we do in more uncertain markets and maybe investors that aren't as quite well-positioned to manage through things like supply chain disruptions or bring power marketing capabilities to bear, haven't had the ability to acquire for value in 2022 like we have.
rob hope -- scotiabank -- analyst
appreciate that. thank you. and then, maybe the second question is just on your other growth initiatives. so, it does feel like the net is being cast a little bit wider into the transition, you know, arena, that being said, on a, looks like, a disciplined manner.
when you're evaluating these new opportunities, westinghouse look like, you know, will characterize it as long-duration cash flows. but maybe the next phase of growth, the pure play recycling business, what are kind of the key tenants of risk return, contract creation, and asset investment are you looking for?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
rob, great question. and you're absolutely right. part of the reason why we love westinghouse is it's a large-scale operating business directly tied to the clean energy transition that, if you look at the underlying cash flows, they actually have a lot of parallels to the wind and solar and hydro businesses that we've been investing in for decades. but you're also correct that a smaller but growing part of our business is more of the energy transition and sustainable solution initiatives.
and what we look for when we expand into those asset classes are really three things. one, there needs to be a clear decarbonization objective. and the acquisition needs to be motivated by the ability to offer something to our customers that we don't offer them today. secondly.
the approach we've taken when investing in those businesses, so far, is to make very small initial upfront investments that have a strong level of downside protection, but allow us to, one, partner with a leader in the space and, two, put us in the priority position to invest more capital at our discretion if those asset classes in sustainable solutions grow in the future. whether it's the recycling business or some of the carbon capture investments we've made, these are small downside-protected upfront investments where we have the right to deploy more capital if we see opportunities to build out those sustainable solutions when they're backed by long-term contracts, the same way we approach wind and solar. the last point i would make is while we have made a number of investments in this space in recent quarters, it is important to recognize that we do still feel the single largest growth opportunity for our business is in the buildout and acquisition of traditional renewable power asset classes. and that's really been demonstrated by the activity we've seen in the united states over the last 12 months.
rob hope -- scotiabank -- analyst
i do appreciate that.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of sean steuart with td securities.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everyone. i want to follow up on the accelerating capital recycling initiatives of mature assets to bolster the liquidity position and crystallize return. can you give us additional comments on any focus with respect to technology or region, what you're concentrating on, where you see the better relative opportunities right now?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. perhaps, the simplest answer is we see the greatest opportunity largely in the sale of wind and solar assets. we certainly have a very rapidly growing platform. and whether it's through m&a or through organic development, we're constantly adding more of those assets to our platform, which provides us tremendous flexibility to recycle those assets where we've executed our business plan, and they're more mature within our portfolio.
the other characterization we would make is, when we look at some of the assets that were receiving inbounds or interest for that are prime candidates for capital recycling, there is a nice mix right now of mature operating assets. but we're also getting interest in portfolios that includes some of our development pipeline or under-construction assets. and the point that we would reemphasize is, whether we're selling an operating asset or selling a portfolio that still has some development and organic growth runway, we're only going to look to sell assets where we've completed our business plan and the initial operating objectives that we set out to do when we acquired the business. perhaps, a last comment, we do expect to be recycling capital on a global basis.
in the near term, we largely see most of the opportunities within the americas. and we would expect some of our capital recycling to be focused there in the next, call it, six to nine months. but we're also seeing opportunities in other parts of the world.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
ok. thanks for that, connor. and on the m&a opportunity set, you focused more recently on private opportunities. can you give any updated broader thoughts on valuation trends for private opportunities versus public opportunities, given the extent of volatility in the latter group? any particular focus that you're concentrating on?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
definitely. great question. so, no doubt, there -- the opportunity set in the public market space for us around potential m&a is higher today than it was six months ago, or it was 12 months ago. so, we're actively monitoring that space.
but the point you've highlighted also illustrates another dynamic that we're seeing, which is, in recent quarters, we've acquired a number of platforms for value that had a development focus where we thought we could really enhance growth and drive value with our procurement capabilities and our power marketing capabilities. and that's led to a more recent focus on development. i think what we're seeing, given the more uncertain and slightly more volatile public markets and capital markets, is we are seeing more opportunities to buy operating assets in the current environment than, perhaps, we've seen in the last six or nine months. and that's just a very natural ebb and flow of our business.
and it would be great to see more opportunities in that space going forward.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
that's useful context. thanks very much, connor. that's all i have.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of rupert merer with national bank. 
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. on the development activity, you're looking to build out 10 gigawatts over the next three years. can you comment on how the supply chain interconnection queues and offtakes are evolving to support those growth targets?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. so, great question, rupert. and this is something that's been topical for a number of quarters now. and we will remain consistent.
managing through supply chain disruptions, we are not immune to that. it is something that has impacted the entire industry. but the way we would classify it for our business is it is something we have had to dedicate increased resources and increased focus to manage through. but we feel we've managed through it very successfully.
and any disruptions have not had a material impact on our business, either in terms of capex costs or in terms of the timeline on delivering projects. we're quite proud to state that we've not walked away from any projects during this period of supply chain disruptions. however, perhaps, this quarter, there is a more positive spin that we are beginning to see a light at the end of the tunnel around the ability to more easily procure capex in many markets around the world. there is more capacity coming online.
some of the logistical issues around shipping those components around the world do appear to be easing, and, therefore, we feel we've done a great job managing up to this point. but we do expect 2023 to be better than 2022. and that's a nice upside for our business. another, perhaps, short answer to your question, we don't see supply chain disruptions that's a risk to delivery on that, you know, 10,000-plus megawatts that we expect to bring online.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
and with the competitive environment, do you see adequate access to interconnection and a fair price and optics as well?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
it's a great question and we're glad you asked it. interconnection is something that we feel -- an interconnection queue position is something that we feel has been dramatically undervalued within our sector for years. and when we make investments, particularly on the development side, we always take into account where are those development projects in terms of their lifecycle. do they have land secured? do they have permits secured? and do they have interconnection grids secured? and this is something we've taken into account whenever we've made an investment in development platforms.
i'll actually give an example from earlier this year, urban grid. we bought this business, and we cleared the market, and we were thrilled to make that acquisition. and one of the underappreciated benefits of that business is it had a very strong interconnection queue position in the high value market of pjm. and already in our early stages of ownership of that business, we've seen the ability to capitalize on that highly valuable and highly scarce interconnection position.
so, to answer your question, yes, we think interconnection is a very important component of the value of a development project, and it's something that's increasingly coming into focus across our industry today. but we feel quite proud that it's something we've been focused on for a number of years now across all the development acquisitions we've made.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
great. thanks, connor. i'll leave it there.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of david quezada with raymond james.
david quezada -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everyone. my first question, maybe just a kind of a broader question around your renewable deployment strategy in europe. i think it was a couple of quarters ago, you talked about, you know, accelerating investment in places like germany.
just curious what you've seen recently in terms of, you know, advancement of projects there and momentum you're seeing in that market today.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. one dynamic we are seeing in europe, and this will come as a shock to no one, is the increased importance and heightened focus on energy security. and well, right now, the delivery of gas dominates a lot of the headlines as it pertains to european power markets. something that is happening in a very, very large way is european regions and european authorities are working very hard to accelerate the permitting across europe to allow for the more rapid buildout of renewables.
renewables really are the long-term solution to low-cost energy and energy security and net-zero, which is probably the three highest priorities in europe right now. where we're seeing that most actively across three of our european businesses is in cenovus, our solar developer in germany, where we've accelerated the buildout of our development pipeline; within x-elio, which is a large global solar development platform with a significant presence in europe that is seeing an acceleration of its buildout in spain; and also within polenergia, that is pulling forward some of its wind and solar buildout in the country. so, we're seeing it very much within our operating businesses, and we're taking that into account as we review new growth opportunities and m&a opportunities as well.
david quezada -- raymond james -- analyst
excellent. thanks for that color, connor. appreciate it. maybe just one more for me on the westinghouse acquisition.
i'm just curious what kind of timeline and, i guess, a magnitude of opportunity you see with the micro-reactor technology. and do you have any thoughts around, you know, which jurisdictions would initially make sense for that technology?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. so, one of the reasons we love westinghouse is no matter where nuclear grows, westinghouse is poised to benefit. if the growth comes from upgrades or life extensions of existing power generation plants, westinghouse is well-positioned to benefit from that. if the growth comes from new buildout of large-scale nuclear reactors, westinghouse is exceedingly well=positioned to benefit from that as the supplier of engineering and products to those buildouts.
and then, more in the future, as we see more advanced stage nuclear technology focused on smrs and micro reactors, westinghouse has the leading micro-reactor technology. and we view them as being in the pole position to capture that market as costs come down and as demand for that technology grows as well. i would highlight that we view that last bucket as being slightly deferred to the other two, maybe three to five years away. but that doesn't mean we aren't tremendously excited about it and excited about westinghouse's pole position in that space.
one parallel that i would draw is, as westinghouse moves to more smaller-scale reactors and potentially micro reactors to service that growing demand, it really lends itself to a lot of the same capabilities that we have within our renewables business, providing power plants that can be contracted directly to an end customer that needs clean energy in a certain region around the world. it has many of the same decentralizations and customer-focused dynamics that are distributed generation business, which is obviously something where we've seen lots of upside and lots of growth in recent years.
david quezada -- raymond james -- analyst
excellent. thanks for that, connor. i'll turn it over.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of william grippin with ubs.
william grippin -- ubs -- analyst
all right, great. thank you very much. so, just my first question, you touched on this earlier, but i was hoping you could provide maybe a bit more color on the investment in the u.s. recycling business.
you know, what made that an investment there attractive to brookfield? and then, maybe you could discuss the timing of that transaction, just given the recent sharp decline in recycled commodity values that we've seen.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. so, maybe just to take a step back on that investment in particular, why we like it is it has many similar dynamics to development of wind and solar. obviously, there's a clear decarbonization angle. but really, what the opportunity there is not dissimilar to when we buy a renewables developer.
this business has an existing asset base, but a very large development pipeline of modular recycling facilities -- material recycling facility, sorry, that they have the potential to build out. now they will only build out those facilities if they can secure a long-term contract that really derisk the construction and the long-term cash flows of those assets once we build them out. so, once again, a very direct parallel to the investment profile that we're familiar with. and then, secondly, the point that we would reiterate is simply around our ability to increasingly serve our customers' decarbonization needs.
one thing that we are very, very happy with is the value proposition we have in the united states right now that, quite frankly, for our customers, we think it's tough to match. whether it's on green energy, now, we can provide green power across any asset type, wind, solar, hydro, or dg, in any region. if it's a customer that has emissions that are tough to abate that want to look to reduce emissions through the use of carbon capture, we can give them that. if it's a customer that has needs for raw materials, and they want to focus on recycled materials as opposed to virgin materials, we now have an avenue to do that as well.
so, as we think about these new asset classes, it's really about servicing our customers, while executing on the same risk-adjusted return and investment profile that's been very familiar to our business for a number of years.
william grippin -- ubs -- analyst
i appreciate that. and just last one for me. i mean, could you speak, you know, broadly to what you're seeing in terms of asset prices for traditional operating renewable energy projects? and have valuations started to come down just to reflect the higher rate environment that we're in?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
we'll provide a very balanced answer on this. evaluations have yet to come down for private market transactions. but let's be clear. we fully expect that they will at some point.
you know, rates can't continue to rise, and valuations stay, you know, cemented where they've been for the last couple of years. so, we're certainly taking that into account. but to date, you know, there's been a number of very recent high-profile transactions in the renewable space. and i think it would be very tough to make an argument that valuations have come down yet.
the other point that we would highlight is when we think of where we buy or build versus where we think we can sell, that development margin or that operating improvement margin, we haven't seen that shrink. so, even if power or interest rates cause, let's say, the price of long-term contracted operating assets decline a little bit, maybe returns going up a little bit, we are seeing development returns go up a proportionate amount as well. so, we're still capturing the same amount of development margin or improvement margin, which means capital recycling continues to be a very value-accretive way to grow our business.
william grippin -- ubs -- analyst
all right. i appreciate you taking my questions. thanks very much.
operator
thank you. and i'm showing no further questions. so, with that, i'll hand the call back over to ceo, connor teskey, for any closing remarks.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
great. well, thank you, everyone, for dialing in to today's call. we, as always, appreciate your interest and support of brookfield renewable. and we look forward to updating you with our year-end results after the end of q4.
have a great day.

2022-Q4,BEP,2023-02-03 08:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the bep, brookfield renewable fourth quarter conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today connor teskey, chief executive officer. please go ahead.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
thank you, operator. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2022 conference call. before we begin, we would like to remind you that a copy of our news release, investor supplement, and letter to unitholders can be found on our website. we also want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements on this call.
these statements are subject to known and unknown risks, and our future results may differ materially. for more information, you are encouraged to review our regulatory filings available on sedar, edgar, and on our website. on today's call, we will provide a review of our 2022 performance and growth initiatives. then, julian thomas, who heads up strategic initiatives within our group, will discuss how we are harnessing our partnership with institutional capital to accelerate our growth.
and lastly, wyatt will conclude the call by discussing our operating results and financial position. following our remarks, we look forward to taking any of your questions. we have had another successful year, continuing our track record of double-digit average annual ffo growth for over a decade. we generated funds from operations of over $1 billion, or $1.56 per unit, an 8% increase over last year, as a result of the stability of our high-quality cash flows, organic growth in commercial initiatives, and contributions from acquisitions.
we agreed to deploy capital well ahead of our targets growing in every market we operate, while dramatically expanding our renewables operations and making our first transition investments. we also delivered record performance from our development activities with 19,000 megawatts of capacity either under construction or in advanced stages, as well as we increased our global development pipeline to almost 110,000 megawatts. we are now in the early days of more of these high-returning development dollars beginning to flow through our income statement, a trend that we expect to continue as more and more of our projects reach commercialization. as it relates to capital deployment, 2022 has been our strongest year to-date.
we closed or agreed to invest up to $12 billion, or close to $3 billion net to brookfield renewable, which will be deployed over the next five years. this represents almost half of our growth target for that period. the investment environment for renewables remains highly compelling. renewables low-cost energy profile, combined with the themes of corporate clean energy demand, electrification, and energy independence, continue to be key trends accelerating renewable deployment.
our disciplined approach to investing and long history of owning and operating renewables enables us to capture some of the most attractive opportunities going forward. and as wyatt and julian will discuss later, we maintain a best-in-class balance sheet, robust levels of liquidity, and access to diverse and deep pools of capital, including our ability to invest alongside large-scale institutional capital, which enables us to execute on sizable transactions that generate strong risk-adjusted returns. during the year, we agreed to invest up to $4.6 billion, or $1.4 billion net to brookfield renewable of capital, into our renewable development initiatives through both organic growth within our existing business and by acquiring new complementary platforms that enhance our current offering. this includes our investment in three large renewable development businesses in the united states: urban grid, standard solar, and scope clean energy.
these investments enhance our position in whatever our largest market, bringing our total size to 74,000 megawatts of operating in development capacity in the u.s. since acquiring these businesses, we have worked quickly to integrate them into our overall u.s. platform and have begun executing on the business plans we set out. we are already seeing strong performance from these new investments.
they are all benefiting from the inflation reduction act and strong corporate demand, which is enabling us to accelerate the development pipelines and grow these businesses beyond our original underwriting expectations. turning to nuclear power, as many are aware, we formed a strategic partnership with cameco to acquire westinghouse, one of the world's largest nuclear services businesses and a critical player in the energy transition. we are moving forward with obtaining the required approvals for this investment and are on track to close the transaction in the second half of 2023. the business is performing well, and we are already seeing benefits of the investment beyond our underwriting as nuclear is increasingly recognized as a provider of clean, dispatchable baseload power generation.
as an example, the polish government announced that it has selected westinghouse's ap1000 technology for the build-out of the first three of its planned large-scale nuclear reactors. this is the key step toward the country achieving its decarbonization targets and greater energy independence. we are also progressing our transition asset investments, including most recently, our investment in california bioenergy, a leading california based developer, operator, and owner of rng assets, where we have the ability to invest up to $500 million, or $100 million net to brookfield renewable, in downside protected convertible structures that support the development of new agriculture renewable natural gas assets. this investment is another in the continuation of our strategy of entering into high growth transition asset classes that are complementary to our core renewables business.
similar to carbon capture and storage, recycling, and renewable natural gas, we have invested through small upfront capital deployments with experienced partners through investment structures that provide us with downside protection, discretion over future investments, and significant potential upside returns on our capital. as we enter 2023, our business has tremendous momentum. as a leading global clean energy company with deep access to capital, we are uniquely positioned to execute on the most attractive clean energy and decarbonization investment opportunities around the world. given our strong financial and operating performance, robust liquidity, and positive outlook for the business, we are pleased to announce a 5.5% increase to our distributions to $1.35 per unit on an annualized basis.
this is the 12th consecutive year of at least 5% annual distribution growth since 2011, when brookfield renewable was publicly listed. with that, we will now turn it over to julian to discuss the importance of our capital sources in supporting our growth. 
julian thomas -- head of strategic initiatives
thank you, connor, and good morning, everyone. we have said for many years that the strength of our balance sheet and our ability to invest alongside large-scale institutional capital represents a significant competitive advantage. we have always prioritized capitalizing the business with a strong investment grade balance sheet, utilizing long-duration nonrecourse debt, and maintaining high levels of liquidity. this allows us to maintain a low risk financial profile and focus on financial strength and flexibility so we can invest throughout the cycle.
we believe this is critical to our long-term success as it contributes meaningfully to the compounding of our cash flows and the total returns delivered to our unitholders. in addition to this approach is our structure of investing alongside brookfield's private funds, which provides access to scale, long-term institutional capital, enabling us to target sizable deals, where there is often limited competition. at brookfield, we manage capital for more than 2,000 institutional clients that collectively have trillions of dollars of capital under management to invest. this means we have the ability to target multibillion dollar transactions, instead of smaller investments that are, in many cases, far more competitive.
we believe this structure is often underappreciated by the market. however, we think it represents a very meaningful competitive advantage for our business, particularly in this economic environment. combined with our platform capabilities, this means that, on a recurring basis, we can generate strong risk-adjusted returns by executing some of the most attractive, large-scale decarbonization opportunities. investor appetite for energy transition remains very strong.
we have significant institutional demand to invest alongside experienced owners, operators, and investors like us. the success of brookfield's first transition fund demonstrates this. we raised 15 billion, establishing the world's largest private fund dedicated to facilitating the global transition to a net-zero economy. the fund features some of the largest commitments in brookfield's history, with around 30% coming from new clients, illustrating investor desire to allocate meaningful capital toward energy transition.
a key part of brookfield's private fund strategy is developing relationships with large pools of long-term private capital who seek the opportunity to invest alongside us, both by investing in our private funds and also directly in our investments as co-investors. the program both enhances our access to capital and provides another source of liquidity. our westinghouse investment, given its size, is a great example of our co-investment program in practice. we have had strong interest from our lps to co-invest with us in westinghouse, and the process is moving along well.
today, access to capital is limited for some market participants. so, accessing this funding source represents an even more meaningful competitive advantage. institutional capital supports our ability to invest in great businesses and achieve strong results that maximize long-term returns for our investors. the scale of our transition fund and the institutional relationships and capital it brings is another meaningful step change in our funding strategy that we will continue to employ as we grow our business and seek large-scale attractive investment opportunities.
with that, i'll turn it over to wyatt to discuss our operating results and financial position.
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
thank you, julian. as connor mentioned in his earlier remarks, we had strong results in the quarter as our operations benefited from strong global power prices and continued growth, both through development and acquisitions. we generated ffo of over $1 billion, or $1.56 per unit, reflecting solid performance and an increase of 8% versus the same period last year. our business is backed by high-quality cash flows in large part from our perpetual hydro portfolio, which has become an increasingly valuable source of clean baseload power, as more intermittent renewables come online.
with over 5,000 gigawatt hours of generation available for recontracting across our portfolio over the next five years and the positive pricing environment for our hydro portfolio, we have significant capacity across our fleet to execute on accretive contracts that we expect to contribute additional ffo and generate a low-cost funding source for our growth. our financial position remains excellent, and our available liquidity is robust, providing significant flexibility to fund our growth. julian already touched on the importance of our access to capital and maintaining a strong balance sheet. we are resilient to the rising interest rates globally, with over 90% of our borrowings being project-level, fixed-rate, non-recourse debt, with an average remaining term of 12 years, no material near-term maturities, and only 3% exposure to floating rate debt.
despite market volatility, our access to deep and varied pools of capital continues to be differentiated. we have approximately $3.7 billion of available liquidity, giving us significant financial flexibility during periods of capital scarcity. during the year, we secured approximately $10 billion of nonrecourse financings across the business, resulting in approximately $1.2 billion in financing proceeds to brookfield renewable. we are also accelerating our capital recycling activities, which are both in accretive funding lever and a critical part of our full-cycle investment strategy.
we continue to see a very constructive environment for selling de-risked, appropriately sized, mature renewable assets to lower cost of capital buyers. and we are advancing numerous capital recycling opportunities in this regard. we have initiated several processes, where we have successfully completed our business plan and executed on our investment thesis. these assets could generate up to $4 billion in aggregate or approximately $1.5 billion net to brookfield renewable of proceeds when closed and provides significant incremental liquidity in the coming quarters.
in closing, we remain focused on delivering 12% to 15% long-term total returns for our investors. to do this, we will continue to be disciplined allocators of capital by leveraging our deep funding sources and operational capabilities to enhance value and derisk our business. on behalf of the board and management, we thank all our unitholders and shareholders for the ongoing support. we are excited about brookfield renewable's future and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout 2023.
that concludes our formal remarks for today's call. thank you for joining us this morning. and with that, i will pass it back to our operator for questions.

operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of sean steuart with td securities.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
thank you. good morning. couple of questions. with respect to the broader asset recycling plan that you laid out, wyatt, beyond the mexican solar portfolio, can you give us any context on the regional or technology focus for that asset sale program? and further to that, any guidance on returns you expect you will be able to crystallize through those initiatives?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
sure. sean, it's connor. perhaps, i'll take that. we probably don't want to comment on any of the live sales processes that we have going.
but we are certainly happy to provide some incremental color. the background to this is during the second half of 2022, we saw significant inbounds from potential buyers for a number of our businesses. and what we are finding is those inbounds are particularly coming on businesses that we feel we have largely de-risked, and we have largely executed our initial investment thesis and our initial business plan. and that's when we like to sell assets when we have an interested buyer, and we have completed the de-risking and value creation process that we initially set off to do.
what i would say in terms of locations, it's what we would probably say is the vast majority of capital recycling that we see the potential for in the next few quarters. it's largely in the americas, both north and south america for us. and then, in terms of irr, we are very -- we absolutely recognize that underlying rates have gone up, but we have not seen much, if at all, any widening in terms of target investor returns on a total irr basis in the inbound price indications that we have seen. so, we continue to monitor that, but we do still see a very, very constructive bid for de-risked high quality renewables assets.
and those are the types of things that we would look to sell as part of this program.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
thanks, connor. that's useful detail. second question, in your supplemental information, the buildup of your advanced stage development pipeline for 2023, it looks like there is quite a bit added to your asia platform, at least compared to the guidance you gave a quarter ago. can you give us any detail on what's been added to that particular piece of the development platform?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
yeah, certainly. so, i will start, and, wyatt, if i miss anything, please don't hesitate to jump in. there is two things in particular that have been added that jump to mind. one is in india.
in the latter part of last year, we have pursued this strategy of building out renewable energy parks in india. and that is a somewhat unique strategy within india, where you buy large plots of lands that have strong grid connection, and you can build out renewables over multiple phases and sell the power from those projects to multiple off-takes. we have done a number of those transactions in the latter part of the year, and that would certainly be inflating that number. the other thing that i would highlight is our previously announced arrangement with basf, where we are looking to build renewables for them in china that will be directly contracted to a new large chemical production facility that basf is building in the region that they want to be supported by green power.
that is a very sizable arrangement we have with them. we are talking gigawatts. and that is another thing that would support the pipeline in asia. wyatt, i am sure that covers most of it, but anything else you would add there?
wyatt hartley -- chief financial officer
only other thing, connor, i would add is, we had in past highlighted our rooftop solar business in china, where the business -- or the momentum for that business continues to build. and so, we are seeing a little bit more activity of that business, but you highlighted the majority of them, connor.
sean steuart -- td securities -- analyst
ok. that's great. thanks very much, guys.
operator
our next question comes from the line of robert hope with scotiabank. your line is now open.
rob hope -- scotiabank -- analyst
good morning, everyone. maybe hoping you could comment on what your investment pipeline looks moving forward in terms of we will call it asset acquisitions or maybe larger platforms, any geographies or assets that are looking the best? and you mentioned that inbound indications for pricing hasn't changed on your end. but what about assets that would require maybe a little bit more work in the financing or contracting side? thank you.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
thanks, rob. no doubt the pipeline remains strong. and there is probably two key things that we would highlight. clearly, in 2022, and we'll make a comment here that we've made previously, if we go all the way back to 2021, we looked at buying a lot of renewable development platforms in our core markets around the world.
we did a lot of due diligence processes. we analyzed a lot of opportunities. but we found the market was very, very frothy, and we struggled to see things where we were comfortable with the value entry point. as we moved into 2022, there were a number of things in the market, you know, a little bit of macro uncertainty, rising rates, some supply chain pressures that, perhaps, other market participants aren't as well suited to manage through.
we saw tremendous opportunities in 2022 to buy renewables developers, high-quality renewables developers in our core markets at entry points that, quite frankly, we would have fallen out of our chair to execute on in 2021. one big theme as we enter 2023 is we see that dynamic continuing. we do see that dynamic continuing in the early part of the year. and we are seeing the ability, we believe, to acquire renewable development platforms, where we can obviously use our corporate capabilities to enhance those businesses.
we are still seeing attractive value entry points there and hope to execute some of those transactions in the near-term. and that's point one. the other thing that we would highlight is with the rise in rates in some of the market uncertainty and, perhaps, capital scarcity in the market, we do believe that we are going to see more opportunities in 2023 to buy operating assets than, perhaps, we saw in last year or the year before that. so, that continues to be an increasing portion of our pipeline, something we are obviously excited to see begin come back in the strike zone.
rob hope -- scotiabank -- analyst
all right. i appreciate the color. and then, maybe a follow-up there, if we take a look at your development pipeline, you have accelerated some investment into 2023. you know, how are you looking at the supply chain? are most of the issues behind us, as well as inflation? do you have a good handle on that to give you the confidence to further accelerate development into 2023?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
yeah. so, we'll, perhaps, split that into two chunks. the one thing i would say about our 2023 pipeline, and as referenced in the supplemental, we see -- 2022 was our biggest year of development on record. we brought 3.5 gigawatts of new projects online.
as we look to 2023, that number is sitting today. we expect to bring about 5 gigawatts online. the first thing we would highlight is, of these 2023 projects, a large portion about 5 gigawatts in our minds is very largely de-risked at this point. it's -- a lot of it's either under construction, or it's already fully contracted.
and we often make the comment that funding is secured. in a lot of these projects, all the funding is already in the ground. you know, we don't need to contribute any incremental equity to get those projects across the line. so, our confidence on delivery in 2023 is very strong.
when you speak about the supply chain issues for us, we think about that probably beyond 2023 because our 2023 is very well wrapped up. and i think there is probably two dynamics to consider there. one is on a global basis, we are really seeing the costs of solar modules drop significantly. you know, in the past year or so, we have seen them quoted as high as, call it, $0.40.
now, we are largely seeing that prices in the low $0.20. so, not all the way back to where they were in 2019, but the majority of the way back. the one place where there continues to be some uncertainty in management of the supply chain required continues to be the united states. but the good news is there is with the benefits of ira and the things we can do with our central procurement system, you know, putting orders in ahead of time, working with our key suppliers, we definitely see the supply chain in total, getting much easier to manage than where we were six or 12 months ago.
so, it's definitely a good news story from both an execution and an economics perspective.
rob hope -- scotiabank -- analyst
that's great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of rupert merer with national bank financial.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
hi, good morning. just following up on the u.s. solar development question, can you talk a little about how the availability of grid interconnections is evolving? and are you seeing increasing competition for interconnection spots?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
thanks, rupert. it's -- appreciate you asking it because it's one of our favorite questions. the focus on grid connection and interconnection availability is certainly something that has grabbed much more headlines across the industry, i would say, in the last six or 12 months. and as it should.
you know, as part of any development process, you need to secure land, you need to secure grid connection, and you need to secure permitting. from there, you need to get equipment and epc and a contract. but you need those first three. and with the amount of renewables going on to grids around the world, there is probably very few grids around the world that the value of high-quality interconnection hasn't gone up in recent years.
the reason why we really liked this question is, this is something that we have been focused on probably now for four or five years. and when we assess developers in the quality of their pipelines, we have always been taking into account what grid connections they have and where do they fit within the interconnection queue when valuing those pipelines and the likelihood and the economics at which they can be built out. a great example of this is urban grid, which we bought last year. one of the reasons why we felt we saw value in that platform, where maybe, perhaps, didn't, is we feel that urban grid has an incredibly strong portfolio of positions in the pgm interconnection queue that most would recognize pgm as a very high value market for renewables development.
so, this will continue to be a focus, but we feel it's something that we have well in hand, not because of our work in the last six or 12 months, but because of our work over the last four or five years.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
ok. it doesn't sound like it's going to limit your pace of growth.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
not at all, in fact, when we, you know, lay out our expected pipeline in the projects that we want to bring online, that already takes into account our views of when we will get those grid connections.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
thanks. and a follow-up on the asset recycling question, would you consider recycling any of your hydro assets in north america? and if you do, how do you assess the value of those today versus the value of a solar and a wind asset, given some of the storage potential?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
yes, certainly. we will always do what is in the best interest of ourselves and our unitholders in terms of capital recycling, where will we allocate capital, where will we seek to recycle some assets. we do believe that portions of our hydro portfolio around the world are truly irreplaceable assets. and they have a long runway of continued value growth, given their ability to not only provide baseload clean, dispatchable power, but also the ability for them to provide grid stabilizing ancillary services to electricity grids that increasingly are going to have more intermittent renewable wind and solar connected.
so, would we sell those assets at the appropriate price, absolutely, but only at a price that we feel takes into account that extremely robust outlook for those assets that we are seeing, you know, from our vantage point.
rupert merer -- national bank financial -- analyst
all right. i will leave it there. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of ben pham with bmo capital markets.
ben pham -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
all right. thanks. also a question on the u.s. market, and i am wondering, how do you see your u.s.
initiatives shaken out the next couple of years? is that -- i know you mentioned the star rating for some of the projects there, but do you think development backlogs can increase some m&a around the corner? and then, maybe share a little bit -- i know you mentioned a decentralized purchasing competitive advantage, but anything else you could share in terms of how you position yourself in the u.s.?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. so, it's a good question, ben. i think the thing to recognize about our u.s. platform is, there are two things that differentiate us in the u.s.
at a level that is very, very tough for almost any other platform to match. and those two things are, one, the scale of our platform; and two, the fact that we have a very diverse set of renewable technologies at a scale in the u.s. and that's really driving our business in two different ways. one, we are seeing increasing opportunities to provide unique contract solutions in the u.s.
and when i say unique, they could be unique in a multiple of different ways. but i will give the first example. we have over 70,000 megawatts of operating and development capacity there. we can provide green power on a scale in the u.s.
that a very few others can. so, when you are thinking of the largest corporate procures of green energy in that market, we can satisfy not only their existing needs, but their growing needs in the future in a meaningful way. the other thing that we are increasingly seeing, in particular in the u.s., given not only the size, but the breadth of our portfolio, is to use our different asset classes together to provide unique solutions to our customers. that might be pairing one of our hydro assets with wind and solar projects in the regions to provide 24/7 green power solutions to a customer that wants 100% clean energy.
so, the u.s., it's our biggest market today. but it's also the market that we saw the most amount of m&a deployed into last year and the most amount of development progress last year. you know, different years might have been slow, but the u.s. is always going to be one of our most active markets for at least the foreseeable future.
ben pham -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
interesting. and are you still the most bullish on solar in terms of your technologies?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
yeah. so, i think it's important to recognize we see solar as the fastest growing technology in terms of megawatts that will be added to the grid on a global basis because it is the cheapest form of bulk electricity production in most markets. and it is on a relative basis, less operationally intensive to one, build; and two, maintain. so, today, i would say that, as we look at, you know, grids in major markets around the world, we would probably expect solar to be the fastest growing renewable technology.
in terms of where we will invest our capital, we are completely indifferent. we'll go wherever we see the most attractive risk-adjusted returns, and we're seeing things across all technologies in the current environment.
ben pham -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. and maybe one last question on the countries, is there a country that are reaching that you are maybe initially looking right now that you want to be in potentially in five years?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
yeah, sure. so, we have said for many years now that we are in all the regions around the world where we feel the need to be there. obviously, last year, we made our first investments in australia. we set up a team there.
in fact, in this last quarter, we brought our first project online. that's a market that we will continue to look at opportunities in. and i would say, we will continue to expand in europe. we are not a large player in all the european markets, and they do have slightly different electricity grids.
and we are seeing very, very strong moves by many regulatory bodies and governments in europe to enable the faster build out of renewables, as that continent, if you will, tries to establish a greater form of energy security. so, i would say we are not talking any major changes beyond our historic geographical footprint, but probably just deepening our positions in what we already consider to be our core markets.
ben pham -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's very helpful, connor. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from a line of frederic bastien with raymond james.
frederic bastien -- raymond james -- analyst
good morning. brookfield infrastructure said yesterday it's taken some modest still in publicly traded stocks. when you think about adding or acquiring operating assets to your portfolio, is the opportunity more weighted toward corporate carveouts right now? are you also seeing good opportunities to partake private transactions?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
yeah. i would definitely say it's both. you know, in the last, call it, 12 months to 18 months, as demonstrated by the transactions that we have done, we have really focused on a lot of businesses that are what you would call pure play developers. we felt like a lot of those -- the pipelines in those businesses were very far advanced.
there were projects that were either under construction or about to come online. so, a very few of them had operating assets. even when you look at something like scout energy that we did at the end of last year, you could already see the market moving in that direction. when we bought scout, it comes with not only a very large pipeline of future development opportunities, but a large portfolio of operating assets as well.
so, we are seeing opportunities on the private side as well. but no doubt, you know, the current economic environment and some of the down wins throughout q4 across public markets have certainly increased the opportunities we see in the public take private space as well.
frederic bastien -- raymond james -- analyst
and, connor, can you share whether you have taken some to hold positions like your sister lp company?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
so, what i would say is we take to hold positions almost on an ongoing basis throughout the cycle. i wouldn't say our activities in that regard have gone up or down, in particular, over the last couple of quarters. but it's something we do on an ongoing basis and something we will continue to do. it's been a useful way to help us source transactions over, you know, the last five years to 10 years.
frederic bastien -- raymond james -- analyst
ok, cool. that's helpful. last one for me, of the 19 gigawatt of advanced stage and construction ready projects that you highlighted, how much of that will be commissioned this year versus next year and the following years? thank you.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
so, we are targeting about 5 gigawatts this year.
frederic bastien -- raymond james -- analyst
and just maybe for the following year?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
oh, sorry. i jumped. it's about 5 gigawatts for this year. and a little bit more, closer to 5.5 gigawatts the next year.
but i would say 5, probably a pretty healthy run rate of where we are at right now.
frederic bastien -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line naji baydoun with industrial alliance securities.
naji baydoun -- ia capital markets -- analyst
hi. good morning. i just wanted to go back to the funding picture. so, $1.5 billion of targeted asset sales for this year, a large part of, i think, your overall targets for proceeds from asset sales for the next few years, how much of this pulling forward of capital recycling as a function of near-term funding needs versus just the strong valuations on the assets as you previously mentioned?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
yes. so, i will answer that question in two ways. i would say the asset sales that we are planning, i would say those will happen throughout 2023, and some may stretch into 2024. so, we wouldn't want to give anyone the impression that that it's all coming in the next 11 months.
some of these processes are for large businesses and may take time so certainly could extend into next year. to answer your second point, what's driving this, i would say, it's almost the entirely the latter part of your question. it's the robust demand we are seeing for our assets. and the simple fact i would almost say it's coincidental that we are at a point where we are completing the business plans and believe that we have extracted the value add opportunity that we saw in a number of businesses around this time.
you know, the timing of when those business plans and those operations complete is going to ebb and flow over the wide variety of businesses we have, but we have had a number complete throughout 2022. and that just creates the opportunity for a very attractive and accretive capital recycling this year, really bringing together, call it, the full cycle value creation approach we like to deploy.
naji baydoun -- ia capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. thank you. and just one last question on offshore wind -- two-part question.
one, if you can just discuss the latest auction in the netherlands and if you are thinking strange around participating in that market going forward, and then, if you also see the potential to participate in sort of the launch or the beginning of the offshore wind industry in colombia? thank you.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly. so, we weren't successful in our bid in the most recent dutch auction. we continued to believe that it's a very compelling market. i would say we monitor all the major offshore wind markets around the world.
and there are certain attributes about market that that we thought were very interesting to us, in particular, the ability to leverage our power marketing capabilities in an outsized way. and therefore, we will continue to look at opportunities in that market. we would not hesitate to go back there in the future. apologies, a trolley just went by outside the meeting room here.
the second thing i would say is, we do look at offshore in many markets around the world. when you are talking about a market like colombia, we continue to believe that that is a long way in the future. so, we will monitor it, but it's not something on -- high on our radar right now. one thing i would say, however, is our existing offshore pipeline in poland continues to move forward in a really constructive way.
the adjustments the governments has made in the region around inflation indexation and the ability for those contracts to be priced in euros are both very, very helpful to our investment thesis and underwriting for that business.
naji baydoun -- ia capital markets -- analyst
ok. thank you. that's great.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from a line of andrew kuske with credit suisse.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks. good morning. maybe a big picture question, we saw a lot of tech companies have a lot of appetite for effectively renewable ppas. a number of those companies kind of got over their skis with data center buildout, warehouse build out, and now are pulling back a bit.
what are you really seeing from that customer base as far as appetite for ppas on a go-forward basis? was there a little bit of a pause? or is it still, you know, full throttle ahead?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
absolutely, full throttle. well, we say that without hesitation. the demand we continued to see from the tech sector, particularly in our biggest markets, north america, europe, is tremendous. they continued to be many of our largest clients.
and simply, you know, given the size and scale of their business, they are trying to go 100% green over the next four years or 9 years -- i'm sorry, three years or eight years. and that is a huge undertaking, given the size of their businesses today. and that undertaking, it becomes even more monumental when you consider the growth of those businesses going forward, even if that growth trajectory comes off just the shade. so, the amount of demand coming out of that sector continues to be tremendous.
and, you know, we continue to feel that there is very few that can supply on the scale that those types of customers desire.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. that's very helpful. and then maybe just another way to think about brookfield's optionality with providing solutions, you have got, like the infrastructure funds, which you participate in. there is the energy transition fund now.
is there an opportunity to have like a super core renewable fund in the broader brookfield product shelf that you would participate in?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
certainly, we wouldn't rule anything out. you know, we, obviously, have had significant success recently with the launch of the transition fund. and that has seen not only tremendous interest from investors, but it's also seen tremendous opportunities for deployment. and, therefore, you know, if the market continues to be constructive, which we expect it will, we could see that that product, you know, easily back in the market in the next 12 months.
so, not only are we seeing scaling of our existing products, absolutely, as the industry continues to get bigger, and we see more opportunities both across the capital stack and across the risk reward spectrum, we wouldn't rule out different products if that's, one, what our customers were looking for, and two, we saw a significant opportunity to put that capital work at attractive risk adjusted returns. given the way the market is going, absolutely wouldn't rule it out.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. thanks for that. and maybe just one final extension on that is your comments earlier on solar, it would seem that, you know, stabilized solar would marry up really well with like a super core product for some clients. is that kind of how you are conceptually thinking about that?
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
well, the way we probably see it most -- it's a great question, andrew. the way we would probably see it most today is you think about things like stabilized solar, those are the types of assets that that work really well into an asset recycling program right now. and, you know, once we built them out, once we de-risked them, once they are under a long-term ppa with long-term financing and a long-term o&m contract, that is a very, very derisked, attractive inflation-linked cash flow stream. those are the types of opportunities we are seeing for asset recycling.
and given how many dollars we have put in the ground in recent years and how many projects we are bringing online, that's the type of opportunity that lends itself to some of the asset recycling initiatives that we have kicked off.
andrew kuske -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. excellent. thank you very much.
operator
that concludes today's question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the call back to connor teskey for closing remarks.
connor teskey -- chief executive officer
great. well, we very much appreciate everyone dialing in. we always appreciate the support and interest in brookfield renewable, and we look forward to providing an update following the next quarter and throughout 2023. thank you, everyone, and have a good day.
