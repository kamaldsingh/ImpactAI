john j. haley -- chief executive officer
okay, thank you. good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on our first quarter earnings call. joining me here today, mike burwell, our chief financial officer, and rich keefe, head of investor relations.
today, we'll review our results for the first quarter of 2019 and the outlook for the remainder of the year. we are pleased with the results this quarter, we were able to generate strong organic top-line growth of 5% and this marks the third consecutive quarter in which we generated 5% more of organic revenue growth.
moreover, this quarter we faced a challenging comparable of 6% organic revenue growth in the first quarter of 2018, despite that challenge we still managed to generate strong organic revenue growth and more important, we delivered profitable growth, with meaningful margin expansion of 200 basis points and double-digit adjusted eps growth.
as we discussed at our recent analyst day, we have a disciplined strategy focused on generating profitable growth and we feel positive about the strong progress that we've made in this area. i believe this progress is a testament to the immense talent and effort that our colleagues around the world bring to the table on a daily basis.
i'd like to take a moment now to recognize their hard work and dedication. their commitment to client service and living our values are making deep and lasting impacts on our business. i'm very proud of what they have achieved for the company, for our clients and for our shareholders and for bringing our story to life. i thank them for their efforts and for another solid performance this quarter.
we remain committed to our strategy and we are pleased with the progress that has been made, but we're not standing still. this is demonstrated by our recent announcement to acquire tranzact. we extremely excited to bring tranzact into our willis towers watson family. they bring exceptional talent and capabilities to bear, including a leading technology-driven, direct-to-consumer solution platform and we think there will be a great fit within our company.
this pending acquisition is an excellent example of our focus on investing in areas that deliver a sustainable competitive advantage. we continually look to identify investment opportunities that are high margin or have a prospect of getting to relatively high margin. similarly, we like them to be adjacent to our core business and have the potential to disrupt their transforms some existing value chains. we believe tranzact checks the boxes across the board and represents a tremendous growth opportunity in the medicare space.
by leveraging willis towers watson technological infrastructure and scale with tranzact's telesales and digital marketing expertise, we will have exceptional distribution and enrollment capabilities as well as a broadening position in the rapidly growing medicare space. further, we look forward to unlocking the synergies between the two companies and as we execute on our plans.
overall, we are excited about the step and what it means for willis towers watson, for our colleagues and for our shareholders, as the next step of significant value creation. at this time, we are still in the regulatory approval process and we expect to -- we continue to expect closing will occur in the third quarter of 2019.
now let's move on to our quarter one 2019 results. reported revenue for the first quarter was $2.3 billion, up 1% as compared to the prior year first quarter and up 5% on a constant currency and organic basis. the reported revenue included $84 million of negative currency movement. once again this quarter, we experienced growth on an organic basis across all of our segments.
net income was $293 million, up 33% for the first quarter, as compared to the $221 million of net income in the prior year first quarter. adjusted ebitda was $601 million, or 26% of revenues, as compared to the prior year adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of $557 million, or 24.3% of revenues, representing an 8% increase on an adjusted ebitda dollar basis and 170 basis points of margin improvement.
for the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $2.15, an increase of 34% compared to the prior year. adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.98, reflecting an increase of 10% compared to prior year. overall, it was a solid quarter. we grew revenue and earnings per share and had enhanced adjusted ebitda margin performance.
now let's look at each of the segments in more detail. to provide clear comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. segment margins are calculated using segment revenues and exclude unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, certain transaction and integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions, as well as other items, which we consider non-core to our operating results. the segment results do include discretionary compensation.
the human capital and benefits segment revenue was up 3% on an organic and constant currency basis compared to the first quarter of prior year. the health and benefits business delivered strong performance again this quarter with revenue growth of 11% with new business in product revenue continuing to drive revenue expansion in north america, while global benefit management appointments contributed to the growth outside of north america, primarily in western europe and latin america. health and benefits revenue growth was also bolstered by the non-recurrence of downward revenue adjustments, which were made in the prior year in connection with the initial adoption of the new revenue standard.
talent and rewards revenue increased 3% as a result of increased advisory and survey work in north america and western europe. as expected retirement revenue declined 2%, mainly as a result of headwinds from having one less billing days this quarter and the impact of a tough comparable from the prior year, which benefited from the triennial valuation cycle work in both canada and great britain.
technology and administration solutions revenue decreased 2% as new business activity was eclipsed by reduced demand for project work in great britain. hcb's operating margin improved by 150 basis points to 25% compared to the prior year first quarter. this improvement reflects top-line growth alongside disciplined expense management efforts. hcb is our largest segment. we're confident about the future prospects of all the businesses within it, on both the short-term and long-term basis. from employee benefits to executive compensation, hcb sits in a position of strength in the markets it serves, attracting top talent, retaining over 90% of its client base and consistently generating industry leading margins.
now let's look at corporate risk and broking or crb, which had a revenue increase of 3% on a constant currency basis and 4% on an organic basis as compared to the prior year first quarter. north america's revenues grew by 4% in the first quarter, primarily as a result of new business. the international regions revenue was up 6% compared to prior year, as a result of new business wins in china, argentina, venezuela and central america. western europe contributed 5% revenue growth. their growth was led by france's new business wins in large and mid-market accounts. great britain had a nominal decline in revenue.
crb revenues were $728 million with an operating margin of 17.4% as compared to a 16.8% operating margin in the prior year first quarter. the margin expanded due to the top-line performance coupled with continued cost management efforts. as a side note, i'd like to say how pleased i am with the progress the management team and indeed all of our colleagues in crb have made over the last few quarters. to see the steady top-line growth and the continued margin expansion is excellent and our outlook on our crb business remains positive going forward.
turning to investment risk & reinsurance or irr. revenue for the first quarter increased 6% to $589 billion on a constant currency basis and increased 5% on an organic basis as compared to the prior year first quarter. reinsurance with growth of 6% continue to lead the segment's growth through a combination of net new business and favorable renewals.
insurance consulting and technology grew by 6%, mainly from technology sales. investment revenue declined because of one-offs in the comparable period and timing of performance fee bookings in the current year. our wholesale business was up 5% on a constant currency basis. on an organic basis, wholesale revenues decreased by 6%, excluding the alston gayler acquisition. the organic decline in wholesale was primarily attributable to reduced marine placements in the miller unit.
irr had revenues of $589 million and an operating margin of 43%, as compared to 45% for the prior year first quarter. the margin decline was attributable to softer trading in the miller unit and one-off timing related items within the investment business. overall, we continue to feel positive about the momentum of our irr business for 2019.
revenues for the bda segment increased by 10% from the prior year first quarter, primarily as a result of having added about 300,000 lives during the 2019 enrollment period in the mid-market and large market space. project work and out of scope services further enhanced the segment's revenue growth. individual marketplace revenue was down nominally as seasonality for this business is shifting, while the remaining businesses in the segment generated 14% growth, primarily led by benefits outsourcing.
the bda segment had revenues of $135 million with a minus 15% operating margin. now that's up 11% from a minus 26% in the prior year first quarter. top-line growth and greater operating leverage both contributed to the segment's margin expansion. our bda offerings remain fundamental to our business growth engines of our enterprise strategy. we are optimistic about the long-term growth of this business.
so, in summary, i'm very pleased with our progress. we produced strong earnings growth in the first quarter, we had strong revenue growth, we had meaningful margin expansion and significant adjusted eps growth, all were continuing to invest in our future and return capital to shareholders through dividends.
as we look to the remainder of 2019 and beyond, our future is bright. our business is continue to shift toward faster growing areas. we expect to reap benefits from our investments in areas focused on innovation such as digital and technology and we are confident in our ability to complete and successfully integrate tranzact.
now i'll turn the call over to mike.
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
thanks, john. and i'd like to add my congratulations to our colleagues for another good quarter and a thanks to our clients for their continued support and trust in us. first quarter represented a good start to the year with strong organic revenue growth, robust margin expansion and underlying adjusted eps growth.
now turn to the overall detailed financial results. let me first discuss income from operations. income from operations for the first quarter was $359 million, or 15.5% of revenue, up 420 basis points from the prior year first quarter, income from operations of $259 million, or 11.3% of revenue. adjusted operating income for the first quarter was $492 million, or 21.3% of revenue, up 200 basis points from the prior year first quarter adjusted operating income of $443 million, or 19.3% of revenue.
let me turn to our earnings per share or eps. for the first quarter of 2019 and 2018, our diluted eps was $2.20 and $1.61 respectively. for the first quarter of 2019, our adjusted eps was up 10% to $2.98 per share as compared to $2.71 per share in the prior year first quarter. fx was modestly worse than previously anticipated due to a stronger us dollar resulting in a significant net unfavorable impact of approximately $0.12 in the quarter.
likewise, as previously guided, we are adversely impacted by a decrease in non-cash pension income compared to the prior year, which resulted in a year-over-year decline of $0.12 in the quarter. excluding the combined headwinds from currency of $0.12, the reduced pension returns of $0.12 and a little bit higher tax rate of $0.02 versus the prior year adjusted eps growth was approximately 20%.
from effective tax rate perspective, our us gaap tax rate for the first quarter was 18.8% versus 16.3% in the prior year. our adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 20.1%, up slightly from the 19.7% rate in the prior year first quarter. this increase in the effective tax rate for the quarter compared to the prior year was primarily due to additional taxes on global intangible low taxed income or gilti and we continue to evaluate the impact of global tax reform on our effective tax rate, including the effect of new taxes associated with competitions (ph) for changes resulting from update interpretations and assumptions issued by the taxing authorities.
as a result, the effective tax rate is subject to movements and will continue to be updated as more analysis and the information becomes available. the adjusted tax rate for the first quarter is lower than our full year guidance due to one-time or discrete tax benefits related to excess tax benefits, our share-based compensation and valuation allowance releases and certain non-us jurisdictions.
turning to the balance sheet. we continue to have a strong financial position. in the first quarter, we implemented the new lease accounting standard. this result had no material impact to our operating income, but did result an increase in liabilities on our balance sheet, which is largely offset by corresponding increase in assets. the gross step total was approximately $1.5 billion.
for the first quarter of 2019, our free cash flow was negative $104 million versus $47 million in the prior year. q1 is our seasonally lowest quarter from a cash flow standpoint, due to the impact of incentive compensation payments. the year-over-year decline in free cash flow due to higher compensation payments as well as some timing related income taxes and pension contributions.
as we think about cash flow generation for the remainder of the year, we expect free cash flow to build as a result of operating income growth, improved working capital and disciplined capital spending. in terms of capital allocation, we paid approximately $77 million of dividends and did not repurchase any shares in the first quarter of 2019.
thinking about our guidance. for the full year, we are reaffirming our original guidance, we continue to expect organic revenue growth of around 4% and full year adjusted operating income margin to be around 20%. one point of clarification around our guidance. we remind you that our fourth quarter is our seasonally highest quarter primarily as a result of our enrollment activity within our benefits and administration and delivery business.
also concerning the hcb brokering recapture from the adoption of asc 606, we recaptured approximately $11 million in q1 2019 within the hcb segment and expect to recapture remainder by the end of q3, 2019. the adjusted effective tax rate is still expected to be around 22%, excluding any potential discrete items and we still expect free cash flow growth of 15% or better.
foreign exchange credited to a $0.12 headwind to adjusted eps in the first quarter of '19. assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expected an fx headwind of around $0.15 for the full year 2019, despite the additional potential fx headwinds, our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance will remain unchanged and is projected to be in the range of $10.60 to $10.85.
on the next quarter earnings call, we expect to update our guidance to reflect the tranzact acquisition, which is expected to close in q3, 2019. overall, we delivered solid financial performance in the first quarter, while i'm pleased with the results and the continued momentum of our business, there's still a lot of opportunity ahead, we remain focused on driving execution.
and now i'll turn the call back to you, john.
john j. haley -- chief executive officer
thanks very much, mike. and now we'll take your questions.
",":
operator
(operator instructions) and our first question coming from the line of greg peters from raymond james. your line is open.
greg peters -- raymond james -- analyst
good morning. i'll ask a couple of questions. first on organic growth. the first quarter result running ahead of your full-year guidance, if i reflect back on the last couple of years, it seems like the second quarter has always been a struggle. but nevertheless with you running ahead of your guidance is suggesting that maybe some of the quarters, maybe lower going forward than where you were in the first quarter. can you comment?
john j. haley -- chief executive officer
yeah, i mean i think greg, you know we don't reflect our guidance for what we think are relatively smaller changes, we don't. so, mike just got for a sake, even though we have the negative currency effect is bigger than we anticipated, we're not changing our guidance, we have a range there. and similarly, with the revenue even though we're a little bit ahead in the first quarter, we're not changing our guidance right now. so, we don't adjust for every small little thing.
greg peters -- raymond james -- analyst
i got it. i thought we were done with asc 606, but it popped up in mike's comments. and if i'm not mistaken the benefit to 2019 was going to be in total around $40 million and you've only booked a $11 million of that. so, that leaves $29 million to fall through in the second and third quarter, is that correct?
john j. haley -- chief executive officer
yeah, i'll let mike comment on that, but let me just say i had that we were talking about this the other day about 606. i thought we were done with it, too, and i was telling folks that have reminded me from the scene in carrie, where the hand comes up out of the grave to strangle you. we just can't seem to get rid of this, the effects of this standard. so, up, mike?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, greg, the number actually is $59 million in total and the remainder above that above the $11 million that i commented on in my prepared remarks will happen by the end of the third quarter.
greg peters -- raymond james -- analyst
i love the analogy. and so, should i -- should we look at the $59 million as recurring in nature, going forward. so, when i think about 2020 et cetera, or is this one-time, where it gets pulled out of 2020 in comparison to 2019?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
it will be recurring going forward is how we think about it.
greg peters -- raymond james -- analyst
all right. i guess the final question would be around the adjusted operating margin, 20% is your target for the year. and then i look at the segment results and i've always felt like crb had the most opportunity and yet it looked like it was a drag on the consolidated adjusted operating margin at least in terms of improvement in the first quarter. can you give us some updated perspective on how that might progress through the year?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
yeah, greg, so we look at it, i mean that there is no doubt we continue to see opportunity in that business. todd jones and the management team there are very focused on it. and we saw improvement in the first quarter in terms of overall margin improvement. we continue to think of opportunity that we'll see and continue to see that happening. so, as we look at the quarter, we are pleased with the progress, they're making. we still see more is about 50 basis points improvement is what we saw in the first quarter for crb.
greg peters -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, great. thanks for (multiple speakers).
john j. haley -- chief executive officer
and it's hard to compare that to other -- it's hard to compare that to the improvement in other segments because that hcb have some of the 606 changes and other things. so, we feel pretty good about the crb. they're making -- as i said in my remarks, they're making good steady progress at the margin improvement exactly what we're looking for.
greg peters -- raymond james -- analyst
i have other questions, but i'll follow up offline.
john j. haley -- chief executive officer
okay.
operator
and our next question coming from the line of elyse greenspan with wells fargo. your line is open.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi, good morning. thank you. my first question. just trying to get a little sense of the organic revenue outlook for hcb for the balance of the year. so, in the previous question you addressed the fact that we have some rev rec benefit coming back into numbers. but then that was offset this quarter by some timing issues in retirement and then also by the triennial valuation cycle. so, do either of those -- do the impact of either of those two items benefit you in the back three quarters? are these things that we should be thinking about as being a headwind to organic within hcb for the balance of the year?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
yeah elyse, we have -- we really purposely stopped giving segment guidance and really looking at the totality around the 4% overall, but we feel really good about the hcb business and their ability to continue to drive revenue growth. we're not overly concerned from the triennial impacts coming forward, they're very small.
but we feel very confident in the management team and what that business is going to continue to drive and really contribute as we said on an overall basis around that 4%.
john j. haley -- chief executive officer
i would say that the impact of the triennial evaluations tends to be more pronounced in the first half of the year than in the second half.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. and then in terms of irr you guys called out that wholesale organic was down around 6%, i believe due to reduced marine business within miller. could you just provide a little bit more color there. and if that's something we expect to continue. and was that the driver of the margin deterioration within irr in the quarter?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
yes. elyse, i mean, we were just calling out the particular businesses that we had seen and we just not had seen as much continued growth in that particular business. but, -- so that's what we're highlighting.
john j. haley -- chief executive officer
and the margin story is little bit complicated with some of the expenses and everything.
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, you do have -- we also have some expenses that we've included in there as we run off, continue to run off and close out of our securities business. and equally when you look at where the market has been in terms of some of our performance fees. but we view those all is timing and still feel confident back in terms of our overall guidance from an eps standpoint at the $10.60 to $10.85 range.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. and then in terms of the tranzact deal, is and i know you said you guys will update on eps guidance for that next quarter. is the right way to think about it in that you're getting that business right? if the deal closed in the third quarter, the fourth quarter would be their strongest earning quarter that relative to that type of seasonality there that, that would technically be accretive relative that your initial guidance, or am i missing something and thinking about it that way?
john j. haley -- chief executive officer
well, there is something you need to be careful about because we were planning to buyback shares and if we don't buy back shares and we do tranzact instead. those two are offsetting, whether they offset exactly or not that's something we'll address later on.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay, great. thank you very much.
operator
our next question coming from the line of mark marcon with rw baird. your line is open.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
good morning, john and mike. i'm wondering if you can talk a little bit more about tranzact just in terms of what you've seen post the announcement, just in terms of their continued momentum. they've been growing their policies at a rapid rate of 25% to 30%. wondering if that's continuing, if that's from what you're seeing from an update perspective.
and then what are you -- what are you hearing with regards to obviously it's early in the political season, but if medicare ends up being expanded and include say 50 plusers, how is that going to end up impacting their business?
john j. haley -- chief executive officer
yeah. so, i think, first of all, we continue to be pleased with the performance of tranzact. and they're doing very well and in fact we expect to -- we had some sort of performance related elements to the deal. and we expect to be paying off on them. ideally, we'd like to pay off on all of them, they really grow. but tranzact continues to do -- continues to do very well and we're looking forward to getting together with them.
from the viewpoint of a medicare expansion, whether it's even to 62 or down into the 50s, i think one of the things we found particularly attractive about the tranzact deal is that if the medicare space does expand it all that just opens up an enormous market. yes, as i said even in expansion down to 62 would add -- what's that mike? 10 million new lives or something like that. so, all of that would be good for our business we think.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
that's great. and then can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in great britain? you talked about hcb and crb, just wondering how should we think about it? because this has been dragging -- brexit has been dragging on, and i'm just wondering what you're hearing from your people over there and how they're -- how they're dealing with the uncertainty?
john j. haley -- chief executive officer
yeah. so, i would say, i think, it's actually been surprising at least to some of us that how that there is relatively little disruption on our day-to-day work. i mean, when we talked about some of the impacts in gb, when we talked about hcb, you notice what we were talking about was the triennial valuation cycle, not brexit itself. so, we're not necessarily seeing a big impact from there, even crb which i mentioned, it has a nominal decline in great britain.
actually the performance of crb was really pretty good and it was ahead of what we had our internal projections. and the reason is, we had several one-off natural resource projects last year that we knew, we're not going to be recurring. so, then coming in, where they did was actually ahead of where we are. brexit is something that's been weighing on the british people and british business for a couple of years now. but we're not seeing any necessary acceleration of that, i don't think. and so, like everybody else, we're just waiting to see how this plays out.
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
yeah, maybe, john, i would just add one comment and that is that, mark, i mean obviously clients come first for us, and obviously clients and colleagues. and we've been thinking about various scenarios and various alternatives, obviously giving our presence and where it sits in that marketplace for some period of time, and have continued to been working at the detail level, at least in terms of working at the various alternatives. so, just to add to john's comments.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
terrific. thank you.
operator
our next question coming from the line of mark hughes with suntrust. your line is open.
john j. haley -- chief executive officer
hello?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
don't hear anything, operator.
john j. haley -- chief executive officer
we may have lost the operator.
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
olivia?
john j. haley -- chief executive officer
olivia? can you hear something.
operator
i'm so sorry. your line is now open.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey inc. -- analyst
john, can you hear me?
john j. haley -- chief executive officer
oh ok. yeah, we can hear you now.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey inc. -- analyst
okay, very good. in looking at the bda business, last year the margin was relatively stable through the first three quarters. it looks like both in absolute dollars and percentage, would we think that should be the same this year kind of relatively steady in terms of that loss?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
yeah, but less of a loss. i mean obviously, our team there led by gene wickes has been very focused on cost management and continue to do continuous improvement like all of our segments, continued our -- continued focused on it. and so i think that's a fair assumption. but i would say that they're focused on continuous improvement.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey inc. -- analyst
and then in the reinsurance part of irr, i think you talked about the momentum in renewal. any comment on how much of that is market conditions, you're just seeing more activity, renewal rates are possibly improved or market share gains?
john j. haley -- chief executive officer
i think it's a combination of all of those. so, -- and we don't -- we can't actually break that down. but i think -- i wouldn't underestimate the impact of just a change in reinsurance buying behavior among clients too. so, that definitely is an element of it.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey inc. -- analyst
when you say change in behavior?
john j. haley -- chief executive officer
so, in other words buying more of reinsurance.
mark hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey inc. -- analyst
got you. thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question coming from the line of paul newsome with sandler o'neill. your line is open.
paul newsome -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
good morning. thanks for the call. is there any offset to the fx in your thinking about guidance for the year that sort of offsets to get us back to the overall sort of guidance in there that you would highlight?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
i make sure i follow your question or i guess what i heard you asking is saying, look with fx at you're $0.12 overall for the first quarter, we updated our guidance to $0.15 headwind for the year and we did not change our guidance. we kept it at $10.60 to $10.85. so then, therefore that's what we are assuming, we're going to be able to absorb that within that range that we said would be there. and there's really no change to margins. so, that's how we're thinking about it. or help me if that isn't -- i'm not responding to your question.
paul newsome -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
no, that's exactly what i was saying. if there was some sort of -- if you think essentially the strong organic growth offset, or anything that you thought you'd want to point out to?
john j. haley -- chief executive officer
no, we just thought we would still be in that range.
paul newsome -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
okay. i was hoping you could talk about a little bit of the market environment, particularly for the brokerage operations. and two things i would like you to touch on. one, obviously, there seems to be something going on with insurance pricing. and the other is, there are comments about dislocation of lots of folks from the jlt merger and whether or not that's having any impact on your business?
john j. haley -- chief executive officer
yes. so, i mean, i think look, pricing is generally -- each particular area has its own pricing changes. so, auto is different from cyber whatever. but in general across most of them, we're seeing modest price increases. i'd say that's where they -- there's a range everywhere, but they tend to be centered around modest price increases for most of them. i mean cyber is one particular example workers' comp are both probably centered around zero change. no change in rates. but most of them have some slight one. so, that's a headwind for us.
the other question was jlt. and look, we have seen a -- there have been a lot of resumes on the market and i think that's no surprise. this could be an opportunity for us to add some key people, but i think we also want to be careful about just who we bring on and when. so, we're approaching this very carefully.
paul newsome -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
our next question coming from the line of adam klauber with william blair. your line is open.
adam klauber -- william blair & company -- analyst
good morning. thanks. the tranzact deal that gives you obviously great exposure to the growing senior market. you mentioned part of the business is telesales, part of the business is digital, give any sense just as far as that, that senior market, how much of the market is digital today? in other words, how much the market actually initiates or dose the sales online versus more of the traditional channel?
john j. haley -- chief executive officer
i don't want to wing it here. so, we don't have a number on that right now, that's something we'll think about putting in when we do our update on tranzact for next quarter.
adam klauber -- william blair & company -- analyst
okay. but as part of the thesis that digital online piece is going to grow pretty rapidly?
john j. haley -- chief executive officer
that's correct. we do expect that to grow. yes. and it's one of the -- it's one of the things as we said, we like the lot about tranzact.
adam klauber -- william blair & company -- analyst
and then thinking forward, as you look at other potential deals over the longer term, is it -- are you thinking about more like tranzact that have that digital online exposure, are those in the pipeline, i guess what your thoughts on expanding your digital footprint?
john j. haley -- chief executive officer
so, i think something that has that kind of digital capability and that kind of exposure, that's a feature that makes a deal more attractive. it doesn't mean that every deal has to have that there. so, we'll be looking at that. but in general, what i laid out was, we're looking for businesses that are going to be high-margin businesses, either are already there, or have the capability to get there relatively quickly. we're looking for businesses that fit in and that are relatively near adjacencies to our existing business.
and we're looking for that, simply put, because we want to understand the businesses ourselves. we don't want to be acquiring things that we don't understand inside and out. so, that's why we're looking for things that are relatively near adjacencies. but within that if a deals accretive, it's more attractive than if it's dilutive, if it has more digital capabilities, it's more attractive than if it doesn't. so, we'd be looking about that. i mean, having said that, we're really focused on organic growth too.
adam klauber -- william blair & company -- analyst
great. and then as far as your -- the benefits business for large and jumbo clients, some of the other competitors there has been some dislocation as you know, some have been splitting their tech and consulting, some trying to figure out, what to do with their technology, has that been a benefit in with you picking up clients in that large and jumbo market?
john j. haley -- chief executive officer
i don't know that we see that as having a particular -- particularly large impact now.
adam klauber -- william blair & company -- analyst
okay, fair enough. thank you.
operator
our next question coming from the line of yaron kinar with goldman sachs. your line is now open.
yaron kinar -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, good morning, and i apologize in advance, i missed the first part of the call. did you talk about the fx impact on margins, and if not, could you maybe talk about that now?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
yes. yaron, there were really no real meaningful impact on margins from fx. not material.
yaron kinar -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. and then my other question, i guess, i was called offguard by the half year in terms of the triennial valuation cycle. should there be any impact from that for the rest of the year? and are there other maybe one-offs that we should be thinking about for the rest of the year?
john j. haley -- chief executive officer
yes, i mean i think the answer to that is, no. i mean the triennial -- the triennial valuations have an impact, the whole year, i mean it's this year compared to last year. the effect is more pronounced in the first half of the year than it is in the second half of the year. there's nothing else comparable to that. we did call out that the last year that the triennial valuations were reason that we had good growth last year, so it was something we tried to signal then.
yaron kinar -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. i must have missed that. and then finally, so the remaining $48 million of asc 606 catch up in the second, third quarters. should those be roughly evenly split? or do you expect that to be more weighted to one of the two quarters?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
i would think they'd be pretty even, i guess is the best way i would look at it.
paul newsome -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
okay. thank you very much.
operator
our next question coming from the line of sean reitenbach with kbw. your line is open.
sean reitenbach -- keefe , bruyette & woods , inc. -- analyst
hi. it seems like going back to wholesale, it seems like pricing in many wholesale lines is generally positive and modestly accelerating, but revenues declined, what you guys called out to the marine.
are there any concerned about the net new business going forward and whether you'd expect kind of to see some positive movement from on renewals due to rate and that be positively impacted going forward?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, as john said, we see the rate is depends on the line and in terms of modest increase in pricing. obviously that's winning and continue to win more than that new business. so, it's both volume and rate. so, we've had, as we've articulated a little bit of volume change here that's gotten a little soft for us. but let me tell you, the management team is very focused on it and we manage it for the entirety of the year, so we're giving update here at the quarter, but our expectation is to meet what we said in terms of objectives for the year.
sean reitenbach -- keefe , bruyette & woods , inc. -- analyst
okay, thank you. that's all my question i had.
operator
and our next question coming from the line of michael zaremski with credit suisse. your lines open.
john j. haley -- chief executive officer
we're not hearing anything.
operator
okay. i'm showing he just removed himself from the queue. at this time, i'm showing no further questions. i would like to turn the conference over to mr. haley.

john haley -- chief executive officer
thank you, and good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us on our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. joining me today is mike burwell, our chief financial officer.
today, we'll review our results for the fourth quarter and for the full year ended december 31, 2020. our overall performance reflects the durability and resilience of our business model. in the fourth quarter, we continued to navigate through challenging economic conditions, and i'm pleased with our financial performance. while our revenue continues to be impacted by the pandemic, particularly in our discretionary lines of business, and many of our core businesses, we continue to experience new business generation, strong client retention rates and increased operating leverage.
we continue to reduce our controllable spending and improve our liquidity. we believe our resilience positions us well for the proposed combination with aon, and bringing together the best of both organizations, to provide opportunities for clients', for colleagues and for shareholders. as we continued to navigate through the covid-19 pandemic, and the resulting economic conditions, our colleagues stood in solidarity, steadfast in their collaborative spirit across geographies and segments. they managed to achieve another year of solid financial performance.
to all of our 46,000 colleagues around the globe, thank you for all of your hard work. we continue to be grateful for your resilience and your focus. the ongoing dedication of our colleagues reflects the rich history of willis towers watson. i'm extremely proud to have served this organization in various roles for the last 43 years. it's been a privilege to work alongside my esteemed colleagues, and to build what is now willis towers watson. with roots dating back to 1828, the company was formed with the goal of becoming a leading advisory, broking and solutions company.
it's especially gratifying to know that almost 200 years later, the future of our business remains bright. for this company to be more relevant today than it was it its inception is an honor that few organizations experience. remaining relevant over hundreds of years is not some serendipitous event. remaining relevant requires hard work, a genuine desire to find solutions for the industries we serve, and constant innovation. willis towers watson's commitment to constant innovation is evident in part in the technology we developed for the insurance industry.
our solutions help both insureds and insurers make more informed data-driven decisions and make them faster. for example, connected risk intelligence, our cri, is a platform which brings modern finance approaches to the corporate risk management decision process. providing clients' with the ability to optimize risk financing decisions by taking a portfolio approach allows for optimal risk retention and transfer decisions. this platform has been highly impactful for clients' burdened by the hard market in covid recession. cri leverages a broad range of data sources and allows organizations to take advantage of insurance market inefficiencies.
we also have a platform called core analytics, which consist of risk models, tools and rich data sources that enable deep dives into specific risks, and provide insights into risk transfer and mitigation and decision-making. in addition, we have radar live, which is a fast, flexible and agile decision engine, which allows prices, rules, adjustments, scores and other metrics developed in analytical models to be deployed by insurance companies directly to their pricing, underwriting and claims systems in real time.
software innovations like these become a launching pad for reaching underserved industries. many industry sector face unique risks that lack risk financing and/or mitigation solutions. small to medium size enterprises in established as well as emerging markets are particularly underserved. these assets can help underserved industries understand risks that dominate their concerns and quickly form strategies to protect themselves.
when i think about the range of capabilities that willis towers watson brings to the table to help the underserved, and i consider aon's own data analytics and differentiated software, i see a special opportunity to create a combined firm that we believe will make an even greater difference in the global economy. underserved organizations often need greater support in controlling and protecting the organizations from their main risks. as a combined firm, we believe our integrated data and advanced analytical capabilities will enable us to serve these industries and geographies, which we believe will allow these organizations to greatly improve their risk investment decision-making and their negotiating power with insurance market.
in effect, we believe we will become capable of transforming these clients from buyers of risk and threat protection to sellers of risks. by blending the best of both firms we can unlock our potential for the benefit of all our stakeholders.
so now let's move on to our fourth quarter results. reported revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.8 billion, up 3% as compared to the prior year fourth quarter, up 1% on a constant currency basis, and up 2% on an organic basis. and that's all despite having a difficult comparable in the prior year of 6% organic growth over the fourth quarter of 2019.
similar to last year, we experienced solid financial performance in areas where we have a well-established market position, mature relationships and annuity or compliance-driven business. we faced some headwinds in areas where our revenue is more dependent on discretionary project spending and where macroeconomic factors dampen markets.
net income was $483 million, down 12% for the fourth quarter, as compared to $551 million of net income in the prior year fourth quarter. adjusted ebitda was $1 billion or 35% of revenue for the fourth quarter, as compared to $930 million or 34.6% of revenue for the same period last year, representing a 4% increase on an adjusted ebitda dollar basis and 40 basis points of margin improvement.
for the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $3.66, a decrease of 12% as compared to the prior year. adjusted diluted earnings per share were $5.23 for the fourth quarter, reflecting an increase of 7% compared to the prior year. overall, it was a solid quarter. we grew revenue and adjusted earnings per share and had enhanced adjusted ebitda margin performance. reported revenue for the full year of 2020 increased 3% as compared to the prior year, increased 4% on a constant currency basis, and was up 2% on an organic basis. this was against the prior year comparable of 5% organic growth over the full year of 2019.
so now let's look at each of the segments in some more detail. to provide clear comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. segment margins are calculated using segment revenue and exclude unallocated corporate cost, such as amortization of intangibles, certain transaction and integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions, as well as other items, which we consider non-core to our operating results. the segment results include discretionary compensation.
the human capital and benefits, or hcb segment, was down 1% on an organic basis, and down 2% on a constant currency basis, compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year. this result represents sequential revenue improvement compared to our prior quarter. the q4 segment revenue decline was driven primarily in our talent and rewards business.
talent and rewards revenue decreased 5%, as there was the decline in compensation survey sales, and an accelerated delivery of surveys that shifted revenue in to q3 this year compared to q4 in 2019. talent and rewards experienced improving demand for our advisory services as we progressed through 2020. our health and benefits revenue declined nominally for the quarter. we continued to grow revenue from global benefit management and local brokerage appointments outside of north america. however, this growth was offset due to a strong prior year comparable in north america.
retirement revenue was flat compared to the prior year with somewhat reduced derisking activity in north america, being balanced by increased administration work in north america and project consulting work in western europe and great britain. technology and administration solutions revenue increased 8%, primarily due to a non-recurring event in the prior year's comparable. hcb's operating margin increased by 120 basis points compared to the prior year fourth quarter as a result of careful cost management efforts. we are really pleased with hcb's sequential improvement and strong margin growth. we remain confident about the long-term prospects of this segment.
now let's look at corporate risk and broking or crb, which had a revenue decrease of 1% on an organic and constant currency basis, as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. north america's revenue was up by 7% in the fourth quarter, driven by new business and strong renewals across almost all lines. revenue for western europe decreased 4% as the macroeconomic impact of covid-2019 put pressure on certain insurance lines, notably p&c.
great britain and international's revenue declined 6% and 8% respectively for the fourth quarter. the results were negatively impacted by a change in the remuneration model for certain lines of business. this change, which is neutral to operating income, results in lower revenue and an equal reduction to salaries and benefits expense. absent this change, great britain's and international's revenue declined modestly due to headwinds from onetime nonrecurring placements in the prior year in the construction and natural resource insurance lines, coupled with pressure on airline volume-driven commissions as departure volumes remained low and premium returns are common.
crb revenue was $888 million for the quarter, with an operating margin of 32.3%, compared to $877 million of revenue with an operating margin of 30.3% in the prior year fourth quarter. the margin improvement was primarily driven by effective cost containment efforts. we're pleased with crb's performance for the year and we're looking forward to its future growth prospects. the pandemic and the hard insurance market have depleted the financial resilience in many organizations. against this complex economic backdrop, crb's global team of dedicated experts stand ready to partner with clients to help reimagine and rethink their approach to risk management.
turning to investment risk & reinsurance or irr, revenue for the fourth quarter was $292 million, an increase of 1% on an organic basis and a decrease of 9% on a constant currency basis, as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. reinsurance with growth of 22% continued to lead the segment's growth through a combination of net new business and favorable renewals. the growth was partially offset by declines in other businesses with reduced demand for discretionary work having negatively impacted revenues in both the insurance consulting and technology and investments business, which were down 4% and 2% respectively.
the wholesale business was down 17% on an organic basis. although it's reported as organic, about half the decline was because we transferred wholesale special contingency risk business to the crb segment in the fourth quarter. the remainder of the revenue decline was largely caused by covid-19 related pressure on marine and insurance energy lines. as a reminder, we sold the max matthiessen business in september 2020 and its revenue is not reflected in our quarter four results.
irr had an operating margin of 11%, as compared to 9.1% for the prior year fourth quarter, having thoughtfully reduced expenses to increase profitability. during this challenging time and extended period of uncertainty, irr remains committed to helping clients' navigate the changing landscape by focusing on their business priorities; capital, strategy, operations, technology, risk and people.
revenue for the benefits delivery & administration or bda segment increased by 16% on both a constant currency and organic basis from the prior year fourth quarter. the growth in revenue was largely driven by individual marketplace, primarily by tranzact, which contributed $279 million to bda's topline this quarter, with growth in medicare advantage products. the benefits outsourcing business also contributed to the increase in revenue, which was largely driven by its expanded client base.
the bda segment had revenue of $693 million, with a 50.7 operating margin, as compared to 52.4% in the prior year fourth quarter. the margin declined as tranzact's rapid growth outpaced the rest of the segment. we continue to be optimistic about the long-term growth of our bda segment. the pandemic threatened the well-being of people all over the globe. in this time of heightened stress and uncertainty, bda empowers employees and retirees, by providing easy access to the tools they need to understand their benefits options and take control of their healthcare.
overall, i'm very pleased with our results this year. we delivered steady overall financial performance with modest margin expansion and adjusted eps growth despite the lingering economic turmoil. our colleagues showed great resilience in adapting and rising to the challenges 2020 brought and i couldn't be prouder of how we came together to achieve these results.
now i'll turn the call over to mike.
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
thanks, john, and good morning, everyone. thanks to all of you for joining us. i'd also like to echo john sentiments and extend my gratitude to our colleagues for another solid quarter, and also to thank our clients for their continued support and trust in us in this challenging environment. i'm proud of our leadership, our colleagues and the overall resiliency demonstrated by our businesses.
so now let's turn to our financial overview. in the fourth quarter, we continued to face some headwinds from covid-19, but we are reassured by the demand for our services and solutions, and by our ability to reduce discretionary expenses and to manage our cash. we were pleased to see another quarter of solid revenue growth with underlying adjusted eps growth and outstanding free cash flow improvement.
so now i'll turn to the overall detailed financial results. there are a couple of significant charges incurred in the fourth quarter that we consider non-core to our operations. in addition to the $45 million of transaction/integration expenses primarily related to our pending combination with aon, we also recorded a $50 million provision for significant litigation, and $24 million of restructuring cost. the restructuring costs were incurred in connection with our assessment of our ongoing strategy in certain businesses.
we realigned resources across different geographies and service lines, primarily within our talent and rewards business to better prepare for future market demands. all of these non-core charges, the transaction/integration expenses, the provision for significant litigation and the restructuring costs had a negative impact on our gaap profitability measures for the fourth quarter and the full year. however these charges were adjusted from our non-gaap profitability measures for the same periods.
income from operations for the fourth quarter was $587 million or 21.2% of revenue, down 430 basis points from the prior year fourth quarter income from operations of $687 million or 25.5% of revenue. adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $820 million or 29.7% of revenue, down 40 basis points from $809 million or 30.1% of revenue in the prior year fourth quarter. income from operations for the full year 2020 was $1.2 billion or 12.6% of revenue, down 210 basis points over the prior year of $1.3 billion or 14.7% of revenue.
adjusted operating income for the full year of 2020 was $1.9 billion or 20.1% of revenue and down 20 basis points from the prior year of $1.8 billion or 20.3% of revenue. for the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019, our diluted eps was $3.66 and $4.18 respectively. for the fourth quarter of 2020 our adjusted eps was up 7% to $5.23 per share as compared to $4.90 per share in the prior year fourth quarter.
for the full years 2020 and 2019, diluted eps was $7.65 and $8.02 respectively. for the full year 2020 adjusted eps was up 7% to $11.70 per share versus $10.96 per share in the prior year. foreign currency rate changes caused an increase in our consolidated revenue of $42 million or 2% of revenue for the quarter, compared to the prior year fourth quarter, with $0.05 tailwind to adjusted diluted eps this quarter. foreign currency rate changes caused a decrease in our consolidated revenue of $10 million for the full year 2020 compared to the prior year, with a $0.01 headwind to adjusted diluted eps overall for the year.
i'd also like to note that our fourth quarter 2020 unallocated net expenses grew $122 million from $57 million in the prior year fourth quarter. as we mentioned in our second quarter earnings call this cost category relates to corporate functions and other budgeted -- unbudgeted costs that we don't directly allocate to the segments each quarter, including items such as true-ups on benefit and stock compensation expense accruals, incentive accrual adjustments and other items.
in q4 the year-over-year increase mostly relates to incentive accrual adjustments as discretionary compensation increased alongside improved performance. our us gaap tax rate for the fourth quarter was 19.7% versus 18.3% in the prior year. our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 17.8%, down from 19.4% rate in the prior year.
for the full year, the us gaap tax rate was 23.8% for 2020 as compared to 18.8% for the prior year, while the adjusted tax rate was 20.8% compared to 20.3% for the prior year. the current year tax rate was higher as a result of enacted statutory tax rate changes in the uk, requiring us to remeasure our uk deferred tax liabilities and recognize the discrete deferred tax expense of $11 million or $0.08 on an adjusted eps basis in the third quarter of 2020. excluding this non-recurring item, our adjusted tax rate for the full year would have been approximately 20%.
turning to the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with a strong capital and liquidity position, with cash and cash equivalents of $2.1 billion and full capacity in our undrawn $1.25 billion revolving credit facility. willis towers watson remains well-positioned from a liquidity perspective. we aim to continue to maintain a strong and durable balance sheet and continue pushing forward our cost savings and efficiency initiatives. we continue to monitor the ever-evolving impact of the pandemic and are prepared to take appropriate measures as needed to preserve our financial position.
lastly, full year free cash flow almost doubled to $1.6 billion from $835 million in the prior year. this far exceeds the $1 billion we targeted as part of our original pre-covid guidance that we gave during last year's fourth quarter earnings call, despite also having paid approximately $7 million in cash-based transaction/integration costs. the remarkable year-over-year growth in free cash flow is primarily due to improvements in working capital, coupled with our effective cost containment efforts.
the substantial increase in free cash flow is a testament to the hard work of our colleagues, who remain dedicated and focused on improving this performance in this area, despite all the additional demands they were juggling in 2020. in terms of capital allocation for full year of 2020, we paid approximately $346 million in dividends. we do not expect to repurchase any shares in 2021 given certain provisions in the transaction agreement with aon.
pension contributions to our qualified plans totaled $129 million in 2020 and we're currently projecting contributions of $132 million for 2021. we remain committed to deleveraging in the near term. in march, we will use on hand cash to pay the $100 million in senior notes due. we will also use our cash to fund the $210 million of payments related to the settlement of stanford and willis towers watson merger-related litigations.
now as a general matter, the covid-19 pandemic did not have a material adverse impact to our overall financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. however, the pandemic did impact revenue growth, particularly in some discretionary lines at least [phonetic], and we expect that the effects of covid-19 on general economic activity will negatively impact our revenue results in 2021. the duration of the pandemic, the full magnitude of its economic impact and the subsequent speed of recovery remain unknown.
in the meantime, we remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, liquidity and financial flexibility. the covid-19 pandemic has caused considerable economic upheaval. but i'm very proud of the leadership team and the resolve of our colleagues in supporting our clients during these difficult times. these fourth quarter results are a direct reflection of the agility of our global model. overall we delivered solid financial performance in the fourth quarter and i remain confident in our ability to continue driving value for all our stakeholders.
and now i'll turn the call back to you -- back to john.
john haley -- chief executive officer
thanks very much, mike. and now we'll take your questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of mark hughes with truist. your line is open.
mark hughes -- truist securities -- analyst
yeah. thank you. good morning. the cash flow outlook for 2021, i wonder if you could comment on that. you clearly did quite well this year. are they going to be any sort of reversals or adjustments in 2021 that might restrain that free cash?
john haley -- chief executive officer
thank you for the question, mark. we -- the team has worked very hard, obviously in terms of the improvement on a year-over-year basis, and very proud of those actions. obviously, i think we'll have some -- a little higher incentive compensation payments that will get paid out in 2021 from cash. but i think the similar level to where we are in 2020. we're not going to give guidance in terms of 2021. but we're very proud of the performance and would like to believe that we'd like to continue to see that performance into the future.
mark hughes -- truist securities -- analyst
and then maybe just some details on tranzact. i wonder with the election ongoing, did the higher ad rates impact your growth there, and also having to hire agents remotely, did that lead to any operational challenges?
john haley -- chief executive officer
i mean i think the -- i think the ad rates had an impact, although it was an impact that we had expected. in fact we had alerted, i think, analysts to that coming up. i think the -- we certainly had to be flexible and adapt to the new environment with covid, but i thought the team did a fantastic job of that, and that's why we had such great results.
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
and john, maybe i would just add, mark -- just i would add one thing to john's comments there. i mean, just a reminder, right. we acquired tranzact. so we only had 5 months of results in the prior year and we had 12 months of results in the current year and most of the revenue, obviously falls in the open enrollment period in the fourth quarter.
so that has an impact just in terms of the overall cost base that we had, overall in addition to john's comments.
mark hughes -- truist securities -- analyst
understood. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of elyse greenspan with wells fargo. your line is open.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi. thanks, good morning. my first question, i was just wondering from your side of things john, you can just give us an update on the regulatory process, expectations just for the transaction with aon to close in the first half of the year. from where you're sitting does everything seem on pace given where you are in the us as well as with european and overseas regulators, to get this deal closed some point by the end of june.
john haley -- chief executive officer
yeah, thanks very much for the question, elyse. and in march of last year when we first announced this, we had said we expect it to close in the first half of 2021. and that's because this is a complex process and has filings required around the world. we are still on course to close in the first half of 2021. we still expect to meet that deadline.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. then moving on, within crb, pretty strong growth as seen within north america, and then it sounds like some of the international ev decline was due to the change in this remuneration model. i think this is the second quarter you guys pointed that out, correct me if i'm wrong. so should we be thinking about this having like an impact on the revenue within crb in the first half of the year, or am i confusing that on the timing perspective?
and then i guess for the overall crb, i think you give us the international growth ex-that impact, but the crb segment in totality, was down 1%. where would it have been kind of excluding this accounting noise in the quarter?
john haley -- chief executive officer
sure. let me -- i'll let mike go into some of the details on that, but let me just mention, i think you're right, this is the second quarter. we talked about it in -- for 2020 results. of course, we highlighted that in 2019 when we first made the change, and when it had a very positive impact on our -- some of our results there. so we want to -- we've captured it both times. but mike, do you want to give the details on that?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
sure, john. elyse, so if you look at certain operations that we have, particularly in russia, we had, had a consolidated entity that we had included. and we had changed that, our remuneration to more of a independent process itself. and so you don't get the same revenue growth, but you just get the same profitability that's going on there in terms of the change. so it just had an impact on that revenue piece of the equation.
john haley -- chief executive officer
but i think your question, mike was the 2021 impact.
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
oh, 2021. yeah, i will now comment on projections or anything as it relates to 2021. it ought to be consistent with how we recorded it in '20 would be the accounting.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
so with crb segment, it was down 1% in totality, would this segment have been around flat, with the rid of the crb bed [phonetic], if we kind of adjusted for the accounting noise this quarter?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
i guess -- i'm not sure i would look at it that way, elyse. i guess what we looked at was we did see in our international, ngb down. overall the accounting noise is just -- it didn't change the bottom line in terms of where we just saw volumes down there a little bit on a year-over-year basis, just in terms of one-time projects that we saw. but the accounting side of it didn't change the profitability or where we sat.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. and then one last one on free cash flow, you guys obviously pointed out $1.6 billion close to, right, well in excess of the guidance. you guys have been spending many years working to improve the working capital generation of the firm. is it just kind of seeing the fruits of the labor that you guys put in over the last few years? was there anything specific to 2020, or just sounds like you guys, everything you guys have been working on kind of came together, resulting in like big upside versus the initial guidance there. any other color you can provide? thank you.
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
well, thank you for the compliment, elyse, i appreciate that. i think as i mentioned on the prepared remarks, our colleagues have worked extremely hard, and as you pointed out, i mean this has been an effort that's been going on for several years, in terms of improvement around what we could do on working capital and that's been a great team effort in terms of delivering those results.
also, i mean we have obviously focused on cost and cost management and cost containment, and that's had a favorability. to some degree when you're not traveling, etc., has a benefit to that. but overall, i got to say the majority of it has really been driven by our colleagues and what it is that they've done. so thank you for the comment.
john haley -- chief executive officer
and maybe just to put this in a little more context elyse, i think back to 2018 and the results we had then, and where we had been projecting them to 2020, we probably would have been at a projection of getting to around $1.5 billion with the kind of constant improvement we would have expected. and so we came in even above what that was.
but certainly 2019 was a year that was a bit of a downturn for us in terms of free cash flow. but in terms of a longer run journey, as to where we would expect it to be, we're now in the range, we would have expected to be. as mike said, we think, we still have some improvement, but we're really pretty pleased with where we came out and it's consistent with the longer run journey.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
thanks for the color.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of suneet kamat with citi. your line is open.
suneet kamat -- citi -- analyst
thanks, good morning. i was hoping you could just give us a sense of, as we move through 2021, any sense around where you think organic growth could be, and in particular, i'm just curious on some of these discretionary businesses that you talked about facing some pressure? how quickly do you see that rebounding?
john haley -- chief executive officer
i think that is very dependent on the macroeconomic environment and how that -- how that develops. and frankly there is a lot of variation in what we -- what we think could happen, depending on whether there are new variants of covid, that cause new and more substantial lockdowns or whether the vaccines are relatively effective when we get them.
so i think from our standpoint, what we're focused on -- this is one of the reasons why we're not giving guidance for 2021. what we're focused on is making sure we're as flexible and adaptive as we can be, so that whatever happens, we can have a good result in 2021.
suneet kamat -- citi -- analyst
okay. and then secondly i wanted to pivot over to employee retention. one of your peers talked about a pretty significant level of hiring in the fourth quarter. and given the pending merger, i'm just wondering if you can give some color around what you're seeing, where employee retention levels are, maybe relative to history, any big changes there. thanks.
john haley -- chief executive officer
well, i think for -- if i look at for all of 2020, our turnover was lower in 2020 than it was in 2019. so i think it's running at about the kind of levels we have experienced, may be a little bit below for 2020.
i think, as always we are constantly focused on making sure that we have the right kind of employee value proposition, and that includes compensation, and includes career opportunities. it includes exciting work for clients, but we try to make sure that we have a package that's second to none in the industry.
suneet kamat -- citi -- analyst
okay, thanks, john.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of mark marcon with baird. your line is open.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird -- analyst
hey, good morning, and congratulations on the year, considering the environment, particularly on the free cash flow. i'm wondering, just with regards to the merger, i know that you're limited in terms of what you can say. appreciate that you laid out what the organizational table is going to look like, but just wondering, just what are the biggest hurdles that you can talk about, in terms of going forward. and then there's obviously been a little bit of news just in there -- in the industry, with regards to willis re and how we should think about that. any comments that you could make there would be appreciated.
and then, that's based on obviously what's going on with the ec. any changes that we should think about with regards to the new administration in the us and some of the antitrust discussions that they've had there?
john haley -- chief executive officer
so i think the biggest -- thanks for your question, mark. i know that the biggest, so the most immediate issue we have right now toward moving the transaction along, is getting the regulatory approvals throughout the world to do that. and we are, as i said, in response to an earlier question, we had targeted the first half of 2021. we're still on track for that. there is nothing that's happened that has made us think that, that -- we should change that timeframe. so we're expecting to get there.
obviously i can't get into any details about what's going on in the regulatory process, but we knew from the beginning it was -- it was a complex merger and we expected the process to take from march of last year to sometime in the first half this year. and that looks like that's exactly what it will be. i think after we get the approvals date, the key that is really focusing on making sure that the integration happens correctly, and that we hit the ground running, both on day one and then in the time immediately after that.
and so we've had very good teams working on that. the announcement of the top structure and the top positions on the executive committee was an important milestone in doing that, and which need folks to continue to be focused on making sure that we design the company as best we can for success in the future.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird -- analyst
great. and can you just talk a little bit about the reinsurance market, and just how strong it is now? and how people who are focused on this space would think about it over the next 12 to 24 months?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
yeah, mark. i mean, when you look at reinsurance, we are very pleased with the reinsurance results as we touched on, the growth rate of 22% this quarter and we look at it from an annual perspective, and looking at it -- it's been a very strong performer overall. obviously, we've had a pricing tailwind that's been helpful overall.
but our colleagues are really helping our clients and working hard in the marketplace. so we feel very pleased with that business. the leadership and the performance in terms of where it's been delivering, and we're very pleased in terms of how it's measured up versus the marketplace.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird -- analyst
terrific, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of phil stefano with deutsche bank. your line is open.
phil stefano -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yeah, thanks, and good morning. probably quick one or two on numbers questions, and maybe a more philosophical one. in the irr business, you had mentioned that you transferred the wholesale specialty contingency risk business, the crb, can you help us understand how much of an impact that was or what the dollar amount was?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
yeah, phil, glad. it was impactful to the wholesale business overall. but the crb it was immaterial, very small.
phil stefano -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. and for the unallocated business, i appreciate the comments. but we've seen some volatility out of that, and at least for me, is the number that i have struggled with. i mean how can we think about this directionally, or any framework to help us understand kind of what a normalized or ""run rate"" corporate expense item -- allocation could be?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, i obviously -- i think when you look at 2020's been an unusual year. that can help when you think about it. and so what you have going on in that line item, you have a couple of things. so one, as i said in my prepared remarks, i mean for -- you saw some additional compensation, in particular incentive compensation that was included in that line item. also covid-19 you had vacations -- people weren't taking all the vacation. so we had a little bit additional vacation amounts that we had to record in there. and we had some earnout arrangements overall.
so i would look back to prior year as looking at it. but 2020 was an unusual year. so hopefully that gives you some color in terms of what's actually happening in that line item.
phil stefano -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. and then the last one, john, in listening to aon management talk about the combined entities, it feels like there's an expectation of an acceleration of organic growth from your business. and i was hoping you could talk about what do you see in this better together scenario post the merger that could drive organic growth potentially better than you've been able to do on your own?
john haley -- chief executive officer
yeah, thanks for that question. so i think when we think about the rationale for the merger, i would sum it up in one word, and that's innovation. and i think both willis towers watson and aon share the view that innovation is needed in our industry, that our industry is not helping clients' address a large portion of the risks that they face, and that we need -- we need to develop better solutions, and better products to help them address that. and so the whole notion of why we think we will be better together is what we can deliver in innovation.
and it will be in things like how do we address long tail events like pandemic. it will be in things like cyber, it will be in things like climate change. both aon and willis towers watson are addressing each of these individually but combined, we think we'll be able to develop solutions that will have much bigger impact in the global economy.
phil stefano -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it, ok. thank you. thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of meyer shields with kbw. your line is open.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst
great, thanks. so two, i think maybe fairly small questions. first, can you help us think through the impact of a weaker dollar relative to the pound on margins in crb and irr?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
sure. i mean, when we look at it, we have, well, obviously, a fair amount of expenses are denominated in pounds. but i would say we have a fair amount that are in euros as well, meyer. so i think you got to -- you really need to look at our overall view of that. as we look out to the -- as we reflected on our numbers in the current year, you go back and say ok, for the fourth quarter and you look at what the currency fluctuations were, it had $0.05 impact on our eps for the quarter and $42 million in terms of impact on revenue.
so i think you know our q1 and q4 are our largest quarters. so i think that gives you a pretty good framework to think about, from an fx standpoint in terms of -- in terms of its impact to the company.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst
okay. yeah, no, it certainly does directionally. and then, i guess it's been a while, i was just looking for an update on telematics consulting, as we see other companies looking to offer the same sort of services. was hoping you could give us an update on how towers watson's business is doing there.
john haley -- chief executive officer
i -- meyer, could you just repeat your -- i didn't hear the -- i got cut off on what the actual business unit was that you reflected in terms of consulting.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst
i'm sorry, telematics consulting for personal auto insurers.
john haley -- chief executive officer
yeah, i mean i think we are -- to my knowledge, we are not really doing that in a lot of detail these days. we really got out of that business to be fair. so i guess my answer would be nothing.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst
okay. my ignorance there. thank you.
john haley -- chief executive officer
no problem.
operator
thank you. in the interest of time, i would now like to turn the call back over to mr. john haley for closing remarks.

john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
thank you, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our first quarter 2021 earnings call. joining me today is mike burwell, our chief financial officer. today, we'll review our results for the first quarter of 2021. i'm pleased with our first quarter financial results and the continued momentum in our business. we generated organic revenue growth of 4% and 110 basis point adjusted operating margin improvement. each of our operating segments contributed to the margin expansion this quarter, driven by new business generation, strong retention rates and increased operating leverage across our core businesses. through the first quarter of 2021, our colleagues continued their tremendous efforts to serve our clients through these challenging times and delivered a strong financial performance.
i'd like to extend my heartfelt thanks to all our colleagues for their dedication, professionalism and support of one another. thank you for continuing to bring your very best on the table every day. your solidarity and resilience are truly inspiring. our accomplishments in quarter one are reflective of our purpose and action. the impact of our work extends to the people and our client organizations to each other and to our communities. for many of us, this greater impact is our why. it's the purpose behind the work we do. creating clarity and confidence today for a more sustainable tomorrow. grounded in this sense of purpose, we've continued to partner with our clients to help strengthen their resilience and progress toward long-term success. the events of the past year have sharpened our focus. our clients, our colleagues and our other stakeholders expect us to conduct our business with integrity and in an environmentally and socially responsible manner with high ethical standards.
we take these expectations seriously and have embraced principles that are aligned with our business priorities are consistent with our commitment to ethical and sustainable practices and demonstrate our respect for the communities in which we operate around the globe. for this reason, willis towers watson has partnered with companies worldwide to increase racial justice by joining the world economic forums racial justice and business initiative. the purpose of this initiative is to build more equitable and just workplaces for professionals with underrepresented racial and ethnic identities. willis towers watson is among 44 founding members, representing 5.2 million employees and 13 industries. as part of this ongoing global conversation with leading organizations worldwide, we can both learn from them to increase racial diversity and inclusion inside the company and contribute our own ideas to address the issue more broadly.
in working toward the goal of improving the communities which we serve, i'm proud to say we recently announced our commitment to delivering net zero greenhouse gas emissions in alignment with the science-based targets initiative by 2015 at the latest, with at least 50% reduction by 2030. through improvements to energy efficiency in our operations, leveraging virtual meeting tools, promoting recycling and encouraging our colleagues to adapt environmentally responsible habits, the company aims to minimize its carbon emissions and any other related harmful environmental impacts. turning now to our proposed combination with aon. we continue to be excited about the potential of the combined firm and are committed to its completion. upon close, we will serve a common purpose, to serve clients and improve communities, blending the best of both of our firms. we'll innovate on behalf of our clients and co-create solutions to address unmet client needs. we will build inclusive and diverse teams, engage colleagues and enable them to deliver their full potential. during the first quarter, we continued to build momentum toward closing the transaction with aon and made significant progress in our integration planning efforts.
we anticipate closing in the first half of 2021, subject, of course, to regulatory approvals. now let's move on to our first quarter results. reported revenue for the first quarter was $2.6 billion. that's up 5% as compared to the prior year first quarter, up 1% on a constant currency basis and up 4% on an organic basis. in quarter 1, we continued to face some headwinds due to macroeconomic factors such as covid-19. in the prior year, we only started to see the impacts near the end of the first quarter.
we started to experience some improvement in areas where revenue is tied to discretionary project spending. similar to last quarter, we experienced solid financial performance in areas where we have a well-established market position, mature relationships and annuity or compliance-driven business. net income was $736 million, up 135% for the first quarter as compared to $313 million of net income in the prior year first quarter. it should be noted, we disposed off our miller wholesale business on march 1, 2020, for $696 million in proceeds and a gain of $356 million on a tax-free basis or $2.73 per share. adjusted ebitda was $730 million or 28.2% of revenue for the first quarter as compared to $680 million or 27.6% of revenue for the same period last year, representing a 7% increase on an adjusted ebitda dollar basis and 60 basis of margin improvement. for the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $5.63, an increase of 140% as compared to the prior year. this included a net $350 million gain on disposal of operations, mostly resulting from the sale of our miller wholesale business. adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.64 for the first quarter, reflecting an increase of 9% compared to the prior year. overall, it was a solid quarter. we grew revenue, we enhanced margin performance and we increased earnings per share.
now let's take a look at each of the segments in more detail. to provide clear comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. segment margins are calculated using segment revenue, and they exclude unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, certain transaction and integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions as well as other items which we consider noncore to our operating results. the segment results do include discretionary compensation. the health capital & benefits, hcb, segment revenue was flat on an organic basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior -- the first quarter of the prior year and generated this similar level of revenue with one less billing day this year. this result represents sequential revenue improvement compared to our prior quarter, which was driven by increased demand for advisory services across various lines of business. talent and rewards revenue decreased nominally, with the uptick in executive compensation and rewards strategy work offset by declines in our traditional survey sales and communications and change management offerings.
our health and benefits revenue was flat for the quarter. we continue to grow revenue from advisory work in north america and global benefit management and local brokerage appointments outside of north america. however, this growth was offset by lower commission-based revenue, which was tied to prior year book sales. retirement revenue was also flat compared to the prior year, with funding and guaranteed minimum pension equalization work in great britain, offset by declines in north america resulting from one less billing day and less derisking activity. technology and administration solutions revenue grew moderately, primarily due to increased project work and new business activity in great britain. hcb's operating margin increased by 20 basis points compared to the prior year first quarter as a result of continued expense reduction efforts. we're pleased with hcb's sequential improvement and margin growth. our long-term outlook on hcb remains positive.
the pandemic has changed the needs and demands of workers and workplaces. hcb stands ready to help clients navigate the transition. now let's look at corporate risk & broking, or crb, which had a revenue increase of 5% on an organic and constant currency basis as compared to the prior year first quarter. great britain and international's revenue increased 8% and 15%, respectively, for the first quarter. the revenue increases were primarily driven by new business wins, most notably in natural resource and finex insurance lines. north america's revenue was up by 6% in the first quarter, driven by strong renewals across all regions, but also particularly in the finex lines. revenue for western europe decreased 2% due to both the timing of some revenue moving to later quarters and the departure of some senior staff, which pressured business in certain geographies. crb revenue was $810 million for the quarter, with an operating margin of 20% compared to $739 million of revenue with an operating margin of 17.2% in the prior year first quarter. the 200 basis -- 280 basis point margin improvement reflects the continuation of effective cost containment. to see the strong top line growth and improved profitability in the first quarter is encouraging, and we remain optimistic about both crb's short-term and long-term growth prospects.
in a world marked by uncertainty, crb goes beyond the traditional boundaries of insurance products and risk management to deliver services that help organizations prepare for what may lie ahead. turning to investment, risk and reinsurance, or irr. revenue for the first quarter was $605 million, an increase of 4% on an organic basis and a decrease of 5% on a constant currency basis as compared to the prior year first quarter. reinsurance with growth of 4% continued to lead the segment's growth through a combination of net new business and favorable renewal factors.
the insurance consulting and technology and investment businesses also contributed to the segment's revenue growth. both lines of business were up 8% compared to the first quarter of the prior year, having benefited from increased demand for advisory work. insurance consulting and technology revenue growth was aided further by increased software sales. the wholesale business was down 14% on an organic basis. although that's reported as organic, about half of the decline was because we transferred wholesale special contingency risks business to the crb segment in the fourth quarter of 2020. the remainder of the revenue decline was largely caused by ongoing pressure on various insurance lines from covid-19. as a reminder, we sold the wholesale business on march 1, 2021. irr had an operating margin of 47.9%, up 280 basis points as compared to 45.1% for the first -- prior year first quarter. the strong margin expansion was a result of careful cost containment efforts, coupled with solid top line growth.
irr helps businesses and communities to sustainably navigate the risks and opportunities ahead. irr's powerful combination of advisory services, technology solutions and analytical capabilities continues to create value for companies as they reevaluate risk and reinforce resilience post pandemic. revenue for the benefits delivery & administration or bda segment increased by 23% on an organic basis and 24% on a constant currency basis from the prior year first quarter. the growth in revenue was largely driven by individual marketplace, primarily by tranzact, which contributed $148 million to bda's top line this quarter with growth in medicare advantage products. the benefits outsourcing business also contributed to the increase in revenue, which was largely driven by its expanded client base.
the bda segment had revenue of $287 million with a 2.5% operating margin as compared to revenue of $231 million and a negative operating margin of minus 4.7% in the prior year fourth quarter -- first quarter, excuse me. we continue to feel positive about the momentum of our bda business for 2021. for many people, the pandemic has highlighted the importance of securing health and wellness plans that meet their individual needs. bda provides education, communication and decision support tools that empower employers, employees and retirees to navigate the changing world of benefits. overall, i'm very pleased with our results this quarter. we delivered strong overall financial performance with top line growth, margin expansion and eps growth all while continuing to make progress against strategic initiatives and our proposed combination with aon.
now i'll turn the call over to mike.
michael j. burwell -- cfo
thanks, john, and good morning to everyone. thanks to all of you for joining us. first, i'd like to extend my appreciation to all our colleagues. we have asked a lot of our teams and our colleagues continue to pull together and deliver. i'm proud of all the work they have done to continue supporting our clients each other and the communities in which we work and live. we're off to a solid start this year. while we continue to face some headwinds from covid-19 pandemic, we are reassured by the improved demand for our discretionary services and solutions and by our ability to generate profitable growth. we're pleased to see another quarter of solid revenue growth with underlying adjusted eps growth, while free cash flow decreased and improved when normalized for certain significant litigation and compensation payments made this quarter. now i'll turn to the overall detailed financial results.
income from operations for the first quarter was $452 million or 17.5% of revenue, up 290 basis points from the prior year first quarter income from operations of $360 million or 14.6% of revenue. adjusted operating income for the first quarter was $579 million or 22.4% of revenue, up 110 basis points from $525 million or 21.3% of revenue in the prior year first quarter. for the first quarters of 2021 and 2020, our diluted eps were $5.63 and $2.34, respectively, which included the $359 million gain on disposals. for the first quarter of 2021, our adjusted eps was up 9% to $3.64 per share as compared to $3.34 per share in the prior year first quarter. foreign currency rate changes caused an increase in our consolidated revenue of $86 million or 4% of revenue for the quarter compared to the prior year first quarter with $0.12 tailwind to adjusted diluted eps per share this quarter. our u.s. gaap tax rate for the first quarter was 11.5% versus 20% in the prior year. the current quarter tax rate was lower primarily due to the tax-exempt disposal of our miller business. our adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 20.5%, up nominally from 20.4% in the prior year.
turning to the balance sheet. we ended the first quarter with a strong capital and liquidity position with cash and cash equivalents of $2 billion and full capacity in our undrawn $1.25 billion revolving credit facility. we also successfully reduced our leverage profile by repaying $500 million of bonds outstanding during the quarter. willis towers watson remains well positioned from a liquidity perspective. we aim to continue to maintain a strong and durable balance sheet and continue pushing forward on our cost savings and efficiency initiatives. as the economic recovery unfolds, we will continue to monitor the ever-evolving impact of the pandemic and are prepared to take appropriate measures as needed to preserve our financial position. free cash flow was a negative $165 million compared to negative $43 million in the prior year.
the decrease in the year-over-year free cash flow was due to the net legal settlement payments of approximately $185 million in respect to the previously announced stanford and willis towers watson merger settlement and higher incentive compensation and benefit-related items of approximately $180 million. absent these one-off items, free cash flow would have increased, more accurately reflecting our run rate improvements in working capital and cost containment efforts. we've made tremendous progress to improve our free cash flow in 2020, and we remain dedicated and focused on maintaining our progress in this area in 2021. in terms of capital allocation, in the first quarter of 2021, we paid approximately $92 million in dividends. we do not expect to repurchase any shares for the remainder of 2021, given certain prohibitions in the transaction agreement with aon in connection with our pending business combination. pension contribution to our qualified plans totaled $86 million in the first quarter, and we are currently projecting contributions of $126 million for 2021.
as a general matter, covid-19 pandemic did not have a material or adverse impact on our overall financial results in 2020 or in the first quarter of 2021. however, the pandemic did continue to impact revenue growth, particularly in some discretionary lines, and we expect the effects of covid-19 on general economic activity may continue to negatively impact our revenue and results for the remainder of 2021. the duration of the pandemic, the full magnitude of its economic impact and the subsequent speed of recovery remain unknown. in the meantime, we remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, liquidity and financial flexibility. we are very pleased with these first quarter results.
they are a direct reflection of our resilience and our continued focus on strategic priorities. our first quarter results were very encouraging. we have momentum, solid financial results and a strong balance sheet and an excellent team, which gives me confidence in our ability to continue driving value for all our stakeholders.
and now i'll turn the call back to john.
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
thanks very much, mike. and now we'll take your questions.

operator
[operator instructions] your first question will come from greg peters with raymond james. please proceed with your question.
charles gregory peters -- raymond james & associates, inc. -- analyst
good morning. john, mike and team. so i'll just ask three questions. and first, i realize you're bound by irish takeover law, but i guess it might be professional malpractice if i don't ask you a merger question. two parts of the merger question. you said in your comments, you're still expecting -- still expect to close in the first half of '21, pending regulatory approval. i'm wondering if i'm not mistaken, the phase two extension from the ec goes into july, so that would imply a second half potential regulatory approval. and the second piece on the merger is, i know you haven't commented on it, but the disclosures in the press suggest that you're going to exceed the revenue divestiture cap in the purchase document. so i was just wondering if you could give us some color on those two items.
michael j. burwell -- cfo
yes. thanks very much, greg. so on the -- first of all, on the ec, i think their extension goes into july. that doesn't mean it has to run that long. it's still possible to close june 30 and be consistent with that extension. so no particular conflict there. and i'm sorry, what was the second question?
charles gregory peters -- raymond james & associates, inc. -- analyst
the second piece is on the divestitures. the leaks to the press given what we're hearing suggests that you might exceed the $1.8 billion revenue divestiture cap that's in the purchase document. and just trying to reconcile that if -- and your perspectives on that, to the extent you can comment on it?
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
yes. actually, as -- and you won't be surprised to hear that we're really not in a position to speculate on any potential divestitures.
charles gregory peters -- raymond james & associates, inc. -- analyst
yes. i've figured. okay. well, let's pivot to the producer retention comment that you made regarding crb. and let's expand it. can you just give us an update? i know from time to time, you have comment on an employee retention in the past. can you give us a sense of how the retention has stacked up through the first quarter? we have seen reports in the press of certain teams leaving. just curious how the willis franchise exist today versus where it was a year ago?
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
yes. so a couple of things. let me say, first of all, i think our -- when we look at our turnover, say rolling 12 months today compared to where it was a year ago, and i look at it segment by segment, it's pretty much about the same, maybe slightly improved, in general. the one segment that is up is bda. and that's just a function of some of the expansion, i think, of tranzact, and we have a lot of turnover, a lot of turnover there.
but overall, our -- if i look at it segment by segment, our turnover is slightly improved. now at the same time, every time a transaction like a big merger or acquisition gets announced, there are some people that decide they don't want to be part of the new organization. and certainly, we've seen that in some instances. but when we look at it in terms of the overall impact, it's not necessarily showing up as a big overall impact. but we can certainly point to isolated instances where that's happened. those are the kind of things we've seen happen before in this business, and we think we're prepared to deal with them, but it is something we continue to look at.
charles gregory peters -- raymond james & associates, inc. -- analyst
got it. i guess the final question would be on free cash flow. i know you called out the stanford cash payment settlement in the first quarter. if we exclude that and think about the full year, how are you feeling about free cash flow for 2021 after what was a phenomenal result in 2020?
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
well, i'll maybe just give you a quick reaction from me, which is that i couldn't be happier with our cash performance in the first quarter. i thought we had a tremendous first quarter last year, and i think we did significantly better this year. so i was really pleased to see what really happened. as mike mentioned, we did have a couple of things that affected us this year compared to last year. but i see continued progress being made.
but mike, maybe you want to comment on that.
michael j. burwell -- cfo
yes. thanks, john. and thanks for the question, greg. yes, i mean, we have put a lot of effort and a lot of focus to have repeatable processes and our colleagues and i'm working very hard and continuing to deliver, as john said, in terms of delivering that free cash flow. so although as you know, greg, we are not giving any guidance. but nonetheless, we're very pleased with what's happened here for the first quarter. and as i say, i'm very, very proud and pleased with what the team continues to deliver.
charles gregory peters -- raymond james & associates, inc. -- analyst
got it. and thank you for the answers.

your next question will come from elyse greenspan with wells fargo. pleas proceed with your question.
elyse beth greenspan -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
hi, thanks. good morning. my first question was going back to, you had mentioned some senior staff departures, right, within crb, within western europe. and i guess tying that together with your response to greg's question in the far cry that you said with mergers, right, there's always some type of kind of individuals that will choose to leave. is that the only area, i guess, of your business where you noticed a more significant impact from some employees that might have left the organization?
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
i would have to say, elyse, i think we've seen -- you might see half a dozen people leave here or half a dozen people leave there. and so you see some isolated ones. i think the western europe one was probably the most significant one we saw.
elyse beth greenspan -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
okay. and then as we think about -- you guys mentioned the impact of the economy due to covid still having an impact on your business, right? but if we look on an overall basis for willis towers watson, right, you guys were created on 4% organic revenue growth, which was an improvement from what we saw in the back three quarters of 2020. so would you expect just based over of the fact that vaccines are being rolled out, it looks like the economy will improve. should we view the q1 as kind of below bar for the year? and it sounds like there should be some tailwinds to your organic revenue that the other three quarters of 2021 should be better than what we saw in the first quarter?
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
yes. i would say -- so first of all, we haven't given guidance. and the reason we haven't given guidance is because this is such a volatile environment, and it's hard to predict exactly what's going to happen. but i would say this, we feel better about the rest of the year today than we did when we entered 2021. and we also feel very good about our ability to grow with the market and to compete. so we're somewhat optimistic.
elyse beth greenspan -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then some -- you were talking through expenses and margins. and it sounds like there was just kind of growth driving margin improvement as well as expense management throughout the different segments. it doesn't sound like there was anything one-off within your margins that we perhaps should think about not continuing, but was there anything covid related? or is it just kind of a good expense management quarter and we could think about that continuing from here?
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
yes. i think the theme that mike had touched upon was our colleagues throughout the organization embracing what we needed to do during covid and responding. and we've seen them do that, and we do -- in general, we think these are things that are going to be ongoing.
elyse beth greenspan -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
okay. thanks for the call.

your next question will come from phil stefano with deutsche bank. please proceed with your question.
philip michael stefano -- deutsche bank ag, research division -- analyst
yes, thanks and good morning. so the growth in transactions continues to be fantastic. it's outpacing our expectations. and if i'm not mistaken, this is the first segment operating margin that was positive for bda outside of a fourth quarter maybe ever. can you talk about the extent to which transact is helping to drive that? and the extent to which growth can continue to lap the strong growth we saw last year?
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
mike, do you want to?
michael j. burwell -- cfo
yes. yes. we've really been very pleased with tranzact. if you go back when we announced tranzact, we were very excited about what they brought to the table in terms of their ability to serve the market. we saw it as a market that was very, very strong, and we had put out there in terms of organic revenue growth and as a pretty formidable view over the next several years in terms of what the cagr growth rate was going to be and tranzact has exceeded it. so as you said and rightly pointed out in terms of where the margin is in terms of improvement and positive for the first time, other than the fourth quarter happening, tranzact has been a big, big contributor of it. so i got to tell you, we see it as doing very well. we really like the transaction -- tranzact team. and what they continue to deliver, and we couldn't be happier with their performance.
philip michael stefano -- deutsche bank ag, research division -- analyst
okay. thanks. and so switching gears a bit and just going back to the potential merger with aon, i understood that you don't want to comment on any potential divestitures, but maybe i'll comment this from a different angle. if i wanted to take a negative lens to view this at, i could argue that the divestitures in a regulatory approval scenario might be at a forced sale price that would be less than you would get and the market otherwise. and if i layer on top of that incentive comp retention awards, how do you think about these dynamics to get the deal done versus the fiduciary duty to maximize value for shareholders?
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
i mean, i think we always have in mind fiduciary duty to maximize value for shareholders. and when we're considering anything, whether it's acquiring a company, divesting a company or just running our business, so we -- that's one of our paramount consideration.
philip michael stefano -- deutsche bank ag, research division -- analyst
and so maybe to press on this just a bit, and then i'll let it go. but is there a level of revenues and price that you could get for potential divestitures, at which this starts to feel like the deal doesn't make sense anymore for the willis tower shareholders?
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
well, i mean, again, i don't want to speculate on things, but let me just address something as a theoretical matter. if you were told you had to give away businesses and couldn't get anything for them, of course, that would seem like that would not be a good thing for shareholders. so clearly, there's some price at which it occurs.
philip michael stefano -- deutsche bank ag, research division -- analyst
okay thanks.

your next question will come from suneet kamath with citi. please proceed with your questions.
suneet laxman l. kamath -- citigroup inc. exchange research -- analyst
thanks. i wanted to ask another one on the pending merger. can you talk about the client reaction to the deal? and obviously, it's been announced -- it's been out there for a year. are you seeing any concerns around sort of concentration risk with the combined company from your clients?
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
quite the contrary. our clients are very excited about the possibilities that the new firm can bring to addressing unmet needs. and you may remember when greg case and i first announced this merger, what we talked about was the possibility for innovation, the possibility of the new firm being in a better position to address unmet client needs. clients have responded quite enthusiastically about this. and i would say, the fact of the matter is, the businesses we're in across the whole spectrum are all highly competitive businesses, and we don't see any concentration risk.
suneet laxman l. kamath -- citigroup inc. exchange research -- analyst
got it. and then on the $400 million retention payment that was part of the deal, is any of that being paid now, which could be impacting your level of attrition?
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
no.
suneet laxman l. kamath -- citigroup inc. exchange research -- analyst
so that's all once the deal closes?
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
any retention payments are at the time the deal closes or after.
suneet laxman l. kamath -- citigroup inc. exchange research -- analyst
got it. and just last one on that. is there an element here where the retention payments are effectively being communicated to employees, but not being paid?
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
oh, yes, of course. yes. i mean it wouldn't have any retention effect if they didn't really know what they were getting.
suneet laxman l. kamath -- citigroup inc. exchange research -- analyst
yup. okay. got it. thanks.

your next question will come from mark marcon with baird. please proceed with your question.
mark steven marcon -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
good morning john and michael. john, i just want to start off by saying, we don't know if we're going to have a second quarter call, just given that this is going to end up closing prior. so first of all, congratulations going all the way back to the watson wyatt days for all the shareholder value that you've created over multiple decades. it's just been an incredible run. so i just wanted to start with that. can you just talk a little bit about if there's -- if the client reaction has all been positive, who -- what are -- what would be the the driver behind some of the objections that are out there, just broadly, theoretically?
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
yes. so first of all, mark, thank you very much for those kind words. it's been a pleasure to work with you over the years. and i am actually hopeful that this ends up being my last earnings call and that we closed june 30 as anticipated. so i think when regulators look at markets, they go and they talk to clients, they talk to other market participants, they talk to competitors, and they get a wide variety of comments from them. sometimes they -- you could hear from a small minority of market participants and the regulators still put some emphasis on that. so there's lots of different ways that you could look at it and at least have the potential to ask some questions about it. but our experience -- and of course, we're probably going to hear from the clients that are the most enthusiastic about it, i get that. but our experience has been that clients are quite excited about the prospects of the combination.
mark steven marcon -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
great. and then can you just talk about -- so [indecipherable] how big is that now just from a revenue perspective, roughly speaking?
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
mike, you have the figure on that, don't you? mike, are you on mute?
michael j. burwell -- cfo
sorry, john. yes. so it's about -- think about it. i don't know, it's in the $400 million range, something in that range.
mark steven marcon -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
okay. and then willis re in the u.s., how do -- you wouldn't happen to have that? would you, mike?
michael j. burwell -- cfo
i don't think we've really disclosed that, mark, and that kind of breakout, sorry.
mark steven marcon -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
would you have an estimation or...
michael j. burwell -- cfo
no, no. we just really have -- sorry, mark, we really haven't disclosed that.
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
yes. i think, mark, it's not that mike doesn't know. it's that we just haven't disclosed that.
mark steven marcon -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
yes. i understand, this is a public forum. and obviously, it's -- i mean it's fairly obvious what i'm trying to get at, just because it does seem like we -- there are some press reports that we're going to be above the merger cap, and there's some that are -- that would suggest that maybe we're going to be below. and so i was just trying to triangulate on some of the pieces. is there any comment that you can make just with regards to what seems realistic? or what the next step? we're -- you've obviously got a long-term track record of success. you think about all of the possibilities. you didn't just -- you're obviously supersophisticated and all of your advisors are as well. so just -- it's hard to imagine that you haven't conceived of some of the possibilities that could come up or -- and some of the next steps to address those. so just trying to think through like -- i mean, even if we're slightly above the merger cap, i mean, there would be a relatively easy reconciliation on that, wouldn't there?
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
yes. i mean, i think, mark -- so first of all, i think you're right, as we think about any of these things with our partners at aon about whether we might -- whether there might be some remedies that we offer to regulatory authorities. as i said to an earlier question, we always have the best interest of the shareholders in mind and doing something that makes sense. but we've -- we really we're not in a position right now where we can just comment about any potential and certainly not about press reports, which are out there. and sometimes have some elements of truth, but a lot of times are wildly inaccurate.
mark steven marcon -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
got it. and just -- i mean, from a purely regulatory strategy perspective, does it make sense to think, ok, the ec was the first priority. next up is the doj. and then after that, we go to some of the smaller countries. and if the doj and the ec are both on board, it's going to be hard to imagine that some of the smaller countries would end up proving to be decisive. is that a reasonable way of think about it?
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
so -- yes. i would say that, certainly, the vast bulk of our business is in the ec, including the u.k. and the u.s. on the other hand, we have been meeting with and addressing regulators in jurisdictions throughout the world. and we're committed to working with all of them. we're committed to making sure they understand the transaction and why this is good for the competitive -- competition in the industry. and we're not emphasizing necessarily one over the other, but it is true that the bulk of our business is in those two jurisdictions.
mark steven marcon -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
okay. and then, i mean, i imagine that tranzact is going better than anybody anticipated, say, 9, 12 months ago. when we take a look at the growth that we're seeing here and the possibilities going forward, i mean, what inning do you think we're in with regards to tranzact? and how powerful that could end up being?
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
yes. so i think we had -- and gene wickes and mike burwell and i, when we were first looking at this. and gene and mike are the ones who really led the charge on tranzact, had lost the expectations and tranzact has performed way above our lofty expectations. so we couldn't be more pleased with how that has worked out. this is a very dynamic market. there's lots of, i think, growth opportunities. there's lots of potential changes, which could read down to the benefit of organizations like tranzact. so we think we're in the early innings, second, third. i mean, this is -- there's a lot left to play out here yet, i think, mark.
mark steven marcon -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
great. congratulations to you, john. and also to gene if he's listening and mike and everybody else on the team. so congrats. thanks.
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
thanks very much, mark.

your final question in queue will come from meyer shields with kbw. please proceed with your question.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- analyst
thanks. two really brief questions, i think. one, john, can you quantify the impact on crb and its organic growth from that transfer of wholesale business?
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
mike, you have that number, don't you?
michael j. burwell -- cfo
it's really immaterial, meyer. very small.
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
yes. i think we talked about that on the last quarter. we said it was material for the wholesale business, but immaterial for crb.
michael j. burwell -- cfo
immaterial for crb.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- analyst
yes. no, i just want to see whether that held up in the first quarter. second question...
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
yes. it does.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- analyst
okay. perfect. can you sort of lay out the time line for when the western european staff left and when the associated revenues kind of disappeared with that at the same time? is there a lag?
john j. haley -- ceo & executive director
it was the middle of last year sometime, i think, middle to late middle that folks left. but the revenue impact tends to be noticed a little more in the first quarter when you have a lot of the renewals.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- analyst
okay. now, thats perfect. thank you very much

good morning. welcome to the willis towers watson second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. please refer to willistowerswatson.com for the press release and supplemental information that was issued earlier today. today's call is being recorded and will be available for the next three months on willis towers watson's website. some of the comments in today's call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities reform act of 1995.
these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results may differ materially from those discussed today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update these statements unless required by law. for a more detailed discussion of these and other risk factors, investors should review the forward-looking statements section on the earnings press release issued this morning as well as other disclosures in the most recent form 10-k and in other willis towers watson's sec filings. during the call, certain non-gaap financial measures may be discussed. for reconciliations of the non-gaap measures as well as other information regarding these measures, please refer to the most recent earnings release and other materials in the investor relations section of the company's website.
i'll now turn the call over to john haley, willis towers watson's chief executive officer. please go ahead, sir.
john haley -- chief executive officer and a director
thank you. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2021 earnings call. joining me today is mike burwell, our chief financial officer. today, we'll review our results for the second quarter of 2021. let me start by thanking our 45,000-plus colleagues for their resilience, their commitment and their focus on serving clients with excellence. at willis towers watson, our colleagues have persisted through an unprecedented global pandemic while simultaneously preparing for a proposed integration and for potential divestitures. what our teams have accomplished is nothing short of extraordinary. we're now moving forward with clarity.
today, i'm going to share some observations on the termination of our proposed combination -- business combination agreement with aon. but i really want to focus on our strong second quarter results and excellent return to shareholders. in q2, our team delivered outstanding results, with organic revenue increasing by 8% compared to the second quarter of 2020. all our business segments contributed meaningfully to this result. our adjusted operating margin improved by 390 basis points. this translates into 48% adjusted eps growth rate in q2 and 30% free cash flow improvement when normalized for onetime items. our 6% organic revenue growth for the first half reflects mid-single-digit or greater organic growth in three of our four segments.
turning now to the termination of our proposed business combination with aon. we recently announced our mutual agreement to move forward independently. on behalf of willis towers watson, i'd like to thank our counterparts at aon for their professionalism over the past 16-plus months since we announced the transaction. i again would also like to thank our willis towers watson colleagues for all of their efforts as well as our clients for their continued support throughout this process. the proposed combination had significant regulatory momentum. a notable exception was the united states, where the parties reached an impasse with the department of justice.
in the end, working closely with aon, we decided to terminate our agreement. we're confident this is the right decision for willis towers watson, for our colleagues, for our clients and for all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders. aon has already paid the $1 billion termination fee. we now move forward with confidence and from a position of strength. as we look to the future, we will build on our successes, which have been significant, as evidenced by our performance over the last several quarters. we will also leverage our formidable resources, including our durable client relationships, our talented colleagues and our healthy financial position.
it's worth noting that our client retention rates have remained at the same level as prior years. regarding colleagues, while we're disappointed that we've lost some valued colleagues in what has become a hot talent market, our top leadership ranks remain intact, and our ability to compete continues unabated. we were pleased to announce last week that we would be reinstating our share buyback program, which had been suspended to comply with the terms of the agreement with aon.
our announcement noted that we would be increasing the share repurchase program by $1 billion. this will include $500 million in accelerated share repurchases and $500 million in our normal program. subject to market conditions and other factors, we believe we should be able to execute a majority, if not all, of the repurchases by the end of 2021. our board of directors has authorized a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend payment given our continued improvement in free cash flow. we've been paying down debt, and we expect to have retired almost $1 billion in total by the end of the year. this, together with the significant capacity we've generated, provides us with plenty of capacity to invest in both organic and inorganic growth going forward.
we intend to use this capacity to make investments in our businesses so that we're well positioned to address evolving client needs. we're excited about the significant opportunities across our whole portfolio of businesses, both brokerage and consulting. as a result, we've asked each of our business segment leaders to look at potential areas of growth for investment. we look forward to providing you with more details about this as well as an update on the overall company at our upcoming investor day on september 9, 2021. i'd also like to announce today that we're conducting a review of strategic alternatives for willis re, our reinsurance operations.
the board has authorized us and our advisors to initiate such a process. while we highly value the willis re platform and our colleagues who contribute to its success, we believe now is an appropriate time to explore strategic alternatives for this business. there can be no assurance the strategic alternatives review process will result in a sale of willis re or other strategic change or outcome. one other question that has been raised about how we will move forward independently is what is my transition plan. as part of our ongoing planning process, the board of directors has been working with me on ceo succession.
i still intend to retire, and i will continue to work with the board to ensure a smooth transition of the ceo role. this will require an announcement of my replacement in an adequate time frame to ensure this is accomplished. now let's move on to our second quarter results. reported revenue for the second quarter was $2.3 billion, up 8% as compared to the prior year second quarter, up 4% on a constant currency basis and up 8% on an organic basis.
in q2, we experienced clear improvement in areas where revenue is tied to discretionary project spending as the economy continued to recover. net income was $186 million. that's up 82% for the second quarter as compared to $102 million of net income in the prior year second quarter. adjusted ebitda was $557 million or 24.4% of revenue for the second quarter as compared to $441 million or 20.9% of revenue for the same period last year. that represents a 26% increase on an adjusted ebitda dollar basis and 350 basis points of margin improvement. for the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $1.41, an increase of 96% as compared to the prior year.
adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.66 for the second quarter, reflecting an increase of 48% compared to the prior year. overall, it was a very strong quarter. we grew revenue, we enhanced margin performance, and we increased earnings per share. so now we'll look at each of the segments in more detail. to provide clear comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding the results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. segment margins are calculated using segment revenue and exclude unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, certain transaction and integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions as well as other items which we consider noncore to our operating results.
the segment results do include discretionary compensation. the human capital & benefits, or hcb, segment revenue was up 5% on an organic basis and 4% on a constant currency basis compared to the second quarter of the prior year. this result represents a strong return to revenue growth, which was driven by increased demand for advisory services across various lines of business. talent and rewards revenue increased 22%, with a major uptick in executive compensation and reward strategy work.
we anticipate continued strong demand for broad-based rewards and transaction projects in the second half of the year, with demand evident across all geographies. we are also experiencing strong participation rates across various data survey products in the midst of the tight labor markets and companies looking to attract and retain talent, which should fuel growth in the second half of the year. our health and benefits revenue increased 1% for the quarter on top of similar growth in the second quarter of 2021.
we continue to grow revenue from our advisory work in north america and global benefits management and local brokerage appointments outside of north america. however, this growth was partially offset by lower commission-based revenue, which was tied to prior year book sales. in this business, we anticipate a stronger second half performance driven by u.s. legislative changes alongside pent-up demand for strategic benefits reviews. retirement revenue was up 3% compared to the prior year driven primarily by funding and guaranteed minimum pension equalization, or gmp, work in great britain.
we expect high demand for gmp work to continue through the remainder of 2021 and into 2022 and 2023. technology and administration solutions revenue grew 2% primarily due to increased project work and new business activity in great britain. we're optimistic about growth opportunities for this business as clients are engaging with us to deliver more high-touch solutions with higher-end service levels to support their employee base. hcb's operating margin increased by 210 basis points compared to the prior year second quarter as a result of continued expense reduction efforts.
we're very pleased with hcb's sequential improvement and margin growth. our long-term outlook on hcb remains positive. now let's look at corporate risk & broking, or crb, which had a revenue increase of 8% on an organic and constant currency basis as compared to the prior year second quarter. north america's revenue was up 13% in the second quarter, driven by gains on book of business sales alongside new business across all regions, particularly in the finex and marine lines. revenue for western europe increased 3% due to new business and renewal expansion, particularly in retail and finex. great britain and international's revenue increased 2% and 9%, respectively, for the second quarter.
the revenue increases were primarily driven by new business wins across multiple lines, including finex, aerospace, construction, marine and retail insurance lines. crb revenue was $788 million for the quarter with an operating margin of 22.9% compared to $701 million of revenue with an operating margin of 19.2% in the prior year second quarter. that's up 15% from 2019. the 370 basis point margin improvement contributes to a 2-year increase of 770 basis points and reflects the continuation of effective cost containment. consistent with last quarter, crb once again delivered strong top line growth and improved profitability. crb's second quarter performance is encouraging as we look toward the future.
as the economic outlook improves, we believe our corporate risk & broking segment will see the demand for mitigating asset exposures and other insurance and risk mitigation strategies increase, set against the backdrop of a firm market. we expect to see investment in large-scale infrastructure projects building volumes in transportation and increasing deal volume in m&a. our crb segment is focused on delivering industry and product expertise and has a mature strategy in place across all its global lines of business.
we believe that the depth of our talent in these global communities, coupled with our connected broking and risk and analytics strategies, continue to enable us to deliver innovative solutions to both existing and prospective clients. turning to investment, risk & reinsurance, or irr. revenue for the second quarter was $400 million, an increase of 15% on an organic basis and a decrease of 7% on a constant currency basis as compared to the prior year second quarter.
this organic growth is on top of 3% revenue growth in the 2020 second quarter. the constant currency change reflects the divestitures of our wholesale subsidiary, miller, and our max matthiessen business. the investment business, with revenue growth of 44%, led the segment's growth with new business and higher fees. investment's growth was aided further by increased performance fees. insurance consulting and technology revenue was up 13% compared to the second quarter of the prior year when revenue growth was modest. this business benefited from increased demand for advisory work.
reinsurance revenue grew 4% through a combination of net new business and favorable renewal factors. revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in investment income due to lower interest rates. irr had an operating margin of 33.3%, up 460 basis points as compared to 28.7% for the prior year second quarter. the strong margin expansion was a result of careful cost containment efforts, coupled with solid top line growth. our investment risk & reinsurance segment is seeing strong demand from insurers for technology, advice and analytics, driving new business across our insurance consulting and technology and reinsurance businesses.

revenue for the benefits delivery & administration, or bda, segment increased by 14% on an organic basis and 16% on a constant currency basis from the prior year second quarter. the growth in revenue was largely driven by individual marketplace, primarily by tranzact, which contributed $160 million to bda's top line this quarter, with its growth in medicare advantage products. the benefit outsourcing business also contributed to the increase of revenue, which was largely driven by its expanded client base.
the bda segment had revenue of $242 million with a negative 4.3% operating margin as compared to revenue of $209 million and a negative operating margin of 4.2% in the prior year second quarter. this nominal margin decline was largely due to our increasing sales capacity ahead of the 2022 annual enrollment period, which will usher in expansion opportunities for both our individual marketplace and our benefits outsourcing lines of business. we continue to feel positive about the momentum of our bda segment for the remainder of 2021. so overall, i'm very pleased with our results this quarter. thanks to our colleagues' outstanding efforts and our clients' commitment, we delivered strong broad-based overall financial performance across all of our business segments. we saw good top line growth, we saw meaningful margin expansion, and we saw eps growth on top of a solid second quarter in 2020.
now i'll turn the call over to mike.
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
thanks, john, and good morning to everyone. thanks to all of you for joining us. first, i'd like to extend my appreciation to all our colleagues. we've asked a lot of our teams and our colleagues over the past 16 months, and they have continued to deliver. they remain committed to our vision and upheld our values. they went above and beyond to support our company, our clients and one another. i'm extremely grateful for their patience, commitment and resilience. we delivered continued progress for both the quarter and year-to-date period, including 8% revenue growth in q2. through the first half of the year, we translated strong organic revenue growth into excellent operating income growth and almost doubled earnings per share, demonstrating the resilience of the willis towers watson business model.
we continue to expect mid-single-digit revenue growth for the full year 2021. i would note that our reported revenue included the favorable impact from changes in fx rates driven by a weaker u.s. dollar versus most currencies. our strong revenue growth and ongoing operational discipline as well as sound cost management contributed to an adjusted operating income margin growth of 390 basis points in q2 and 240 basis points through the first half of the year. it should be noted the growth in our margins was driven by the speed of revenue growth, which outpaced our expense growth. while we made investments in people, operations and technology to enable long-term growth over the first hsecond half of talf, we expect to increase these investments during the second half of the year.
we also anticipate some resumption of t&e cost over the second half of the year as well, though we anticipate continued leverage of technology to conduct much of our business remotely, enabling us to sustain our improved efficiency and reduce carbon footprint. looking forward, we expect to deliver margin expansion for the full year 2021 and over the long term. moving back to the results for the second quarter. we've translated strong operating income into adjusted eps growth of 48% in q2 and 23% year-to-date. foreign currency changes had a favorable impact to revenue of $87 million or 4% in q2 versus the prior year and no impact to diluted earnings per share.
if currency was to remain stable at today's rates, we'd expect a modest tailwind to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year. as john mentioned, aon and wtw mutually agreed to terminate our business combination agreement and move forward independently. in accordance with the business combination agreement, aon has paid the $1 billion termination fee. free cash flow increased 30% year-to-date when adjusted for the $185 million for the previously announced stanford and willis towers watson merger settlements and higher incentive comp and benefit related items of $249 million.
we expect -- or we continue to expect to drive free cash flow growth over the long term, building on our efforts over the past couple of years. we expect our capex expenditures to increase in the second half of the year as we invest in technology to grow our business. given our outlook for the long-term free cash flow growth, we see share repurchases as the highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. as john noted, we plan to implement an accelerated share repurchase strategy of $500 million in addition to our normal share repurchase plans.
we look to execute as much as practical in fiscal year 2021, and we also raised our dividend by 13%. now turning to our balance sheet and debt capacity. we had $2.2 billion of cash on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. we plan to pay off $450 million of debt outstanding in august 2021. we have no borrowings outstanding under our $1.25 billion credit facility. we remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. and considering our june 30 balance sheet, we have plenty of additional debt capacity for discretionary use in the second half of the year.
over the long term, we expect to return to our past practice of growing debt as ebitda grows. it should be noted that free cash flow generation in the second half of the year is seasonally strong, stronger than in the first half of the year, and we will look to allocate cash for our best use based on return on capital. in summary, we ended the second quarter in a very strong position as we delivered strong top line and bottom line results. while the termination of our aon -- or combination with aon was not the outcome we originally intended, the opportunity for wtw as a stand-alone business is strong and exciting.
we believe our disciplined approach to return on capital, combined with our continued improved cash flow delivery and increased debt capacity, provides flexibility to improve shareholder value creation over the long term. it should be noted, our u.s. gaap tax rate for the second quarter was 33.8% versus 42.2% in the prior year. our adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 19.3% versus 22.2% rate in the prior year. the current year quarter effective tax rate includes a $40 million deferred tax expense related to the enacted u.k. statutory tax rate change, while the prior year effective tax rate was higher due to additional expense recognized in connection with the temporary provisions of the cares act.
we anticipate our annual effective adjusted tax rate will be between 20% and 21% for the full year. we're very pleased with the second quarter results, and they are a direct reflection of our incredibly talented colleagues and unwavering commitment to client service. our second quarter results were very encouraging. we have momentum, we have solid financial results, a strong balance sheet and an excellent team, which gives me confidence in our ability to continue driving value for all our stakeholders.
i'll now turn the call back to you, john.
john haley -- chief executive officer and a director
thanks very much, mike. and now we'll take your questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and your first question is from greg peters of raymond james.
greg peters -- raymond james -- analyst
good morning. the first question will focus on retention. and john, i know you said that your client retention remained strong through the second quarter. but you also did highlight that there were some departures on the employee side. and i was wondering if you could give us some more color behind that.
in the past, you've talked about retention as a percentage of the total employee base. obviously, i think most of your investors are concerned about these departures and its impact on future organic revenue results. so any color you can add here will be helpful.
john haley -- chief executive officer and a director
yes. so thanks very much for that question, greg. i think we -- when we look at our overall attrition over the last 16 months or so, that attrition is within the normal historical balance we have. now we've seen our attrition go up a little bit more in the second quarter than we did before then. but that's actually something that i think has been seen by companies across the board there.
and -- but the biggest issue we've had is not so much the attrition, although we have lost some valuable colleagues, let me be clear about that. but the issue is we -- while we were in the process of the merger, it was harder to hire new people, to bring them on because of the uncertainty of exactly how they would fit into the new organization. and i think what we're going to be doing now is going out aggressively recruiting and looking to replace some of the talent we've lost.
greg peters -- raymond james -- analyst
can you -- just as a follow-up to that, john, can you give us a sense within hcb -- if you lost some healthcare brokers? can you give us a sense within crb, where the losses have been, whether it's western europe or north america, irr? just some additional color there so we can sort of use it to help build out our projections going forward.
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
hey greg, it's mike. i would just comment. so one is, as you might imagine, when you think about a merger, we've lost -- one of the biggest places we've lost, frankly, has been our corporate and some of our corporate areas overall in the business with the anticipation of the business combination. as john mentioned, we had lost some teams. but when you compare -- when you look at hcb or crb or irr, we've lost some teams.
when we compare it, our turnover isn't different than what we saw back in 2019. so we have had a reinsurance team that's been lost, let's say, in australia or things. but those -- we're highlighting it because it's in the window of looking at an m&a deal. but that's a normal process that has been happening and maybe slightly accelerated here recently, as john mentioned. but when i look at the numbers, and just in terms of pure overall turnover numbers, they're not that different from where we were in 2019.
john haley -- chief executive officer and a director
i mean to give you -- the turnover is generally in the 10%, maybe 11% range. i think bda, because of the nature of that business, is the one outlier where we have relatively high turnover rates.
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
but -- we hire the people up for the seasonal fourth quarter and then they go away.
greg peters -- raymond james -- analyst
yes. makes sense. and then the other related area, your retention bonuses. i think aon came out on their call, and they expressed their intent to pay the retention bonuses to their employees. what's your view on retention bonuses for your producers going forward?
john haley -- chief executive officer and a director
so our view is that employee retention is something that we are managing constantly, not just during deals. and so we have various incentives that are embedded within our employees' compensation structure. the retention awards for the business combination, they were communicated in connection with the proposed combination to address specific risks and contingencies that could arise from that transaction.
and since the transaction is no longer pending, we don't think those incentives are necessarily the ones we should have in place. that doesn't mean we won't put other ones in place and we won't make sure we manage retention on an ongoing basis. we will.
greg peters -- raymond james -- analyst
yes. i would expect that. i guess my last question, i'm sorry, but i had to hammer the retention thing, would just be, mike, i think in your comments, you called out the benefit of t&e and certainly, in your response, reduced corporate expenses. when i think about just the overall expense structure going forward, is it fair to say that you're going to be making investments in this business, so the expense side of the house may start to increase relative to what we saw in the second quarter?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
yes. i think that's a fair statement, greg. but i would also point to the comment that i made, which is that we're focused on continued annual improvement, and we anticipate margin improvement for the year. so we'll look at those in terms of what the run rate of the company is. if we're making specific investments, we'll call them out. but our intent is to drive -- continue to drive margin improvement and margin expansion.
john haley -- chief executive officer and a director
and maybe just as a quick addition to that, greg. i think as i referenced, and i think as mike referenced in his comments, we're very excited about the growth prospects. and so we will be making investments in the business, but those are investments that we expect to be generating revenue, too. and so we're looking at both organic and inorganic. we have a lot of enthusiasm around some of the prospects we see.
greg peters -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. thanks for the answers. good luck in the future.
operator
thank you. your next question is from elyse greenspan of wells fargo.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi. thanks. good morning. my first question, john, in your prepared remarks, you addressed that you're planning to retire, which we know was kind of planned in conjunction with the aon merger as well. i understand that your contract runs through the end of this year. so is the desire to put someone in place in advance of the time frame? is there the potential to extend your contract? and can you just tell us, will both internal and external candidates be considered for your role.
john haley -- chief executive officer and a director
yes. i think that -- thanks very much, elyse. yes, my contract runs through the end of the year, and i think the intention would be not to extend that but to identify a successor and have that successor named before that time. and i'll be working with the board on that. the board has a very thorough process and considers everything. of course, we -- this is not new. we've been doing this for a lot of years, and so we're not just starting at square one here.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. great. and then on the leverage side, your leverage is now below two times ebitda, and you have some debt that's coming due shortly. so i guess i'm trying to get a sense -- you guys mentioned that you would look to add to your debt capacity over the long term, if you could just define that. and i'm assuming you'd be willing to go up to 2.5 times ebitda, i think that's historically where you have gone. and if you do add to debt, could additional share repurchases be considered for that additional capital in addition to looking to pursue growth?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
so elyse, thanks for the question. so when we think about leverage, at times, we have gone up that high in leverage, but with always a commitment to get it down more in that kind of 2.2, 2.3 range, is kind of where we have been. so that gives us plenty of capacity to think about investments that we can make, both organically and inorganically in the business, which we're very excited about. and we have lots of opportunities, it's just making sure we deploy that in the best return thought process. but as we think about that, obviously, we will look -- continue to look at share repurchases.
that's an important element, to look at that return, as we look at all three components in terms of thinking about allocation of capital. we talked about the dividend increase that we had this quarter. we'll continue to look at dividends. we will look at share repurchases. and obviously, we're looking at inorganic and organic growth and thinking about all three of those in a balanced way, going forward.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. great. and then on the revenue guidance, i think you said for the full year, you guys would be at mid-single digits. was that total revenue or organic? or was that meant to be both?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
it's meant to be organic, full year.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
and then so, i guess, you guys were at 8% for the q2, 6% for the half year under certain businesses. i mean i know you guys addressed some of the retention and employee attrition issues in previous questions. but is -- are you expecting a slowdown in the second half given some of the retention stuff? or is it more to conservatism given just economic uncertainty as you think about going from 8% to, i guess, kind of what seems to be maybe 6% in the back half of the year?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean, as you know, you know the quarters, the q1 and q4 tend to be our largest quarters in particular, q4 being the largest quarter, q3 being less of a quarter. i think you may have used the word conservative in there. we don't know if it's conservative, it's our best estimate in terms of where we are right now, and we thought that guidance would be helpful.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. thanks for the color.
operator
thank you. your next question is from paul newsome of piper sandler.
paul newsome -- piper sandler -- analyst
good morning. i'm curious if there's a lot of difference between the organic growth that you saw by account size as opposed to segment, basically across the broking as well as the healthcare businesses. was there more improvement in the larger account stuff or middle market or about the same?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
it was about the same. we really saw it's about the same. yes.
paul newsome -- piper sandler -- analyst
and perhaps you could talk a little bit about the pricing environment and what sort of windfall that helped you within the broking side a little bit more.
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean we publish twice a year our marketplace realities, which we publish in april and october as a general rule. and we include in there what our view of the marketplace is in terms of pricing. it continues to be a hard market. we continue to see a pricing tailwind. we've seen continued increases, and most recently, cyber being up almost 50%. and -- but obviously, those are what you're seeing in terms of quoted prices.
our role is to do the best thing that we can for our clients. and obviously, we look to manage those risks, help them understand those risks and price those risks appropriately. and so we think about that, we look at properties still being up, general liability has been up, casualty has been up. and we've seen some moderation on workers' comp and d&o. but again, in aggregate, across the board, we're seeing pricing tailwinds overall. so yes, we are seeing that reflected in the business.
paul newsome -- piper sandler -- analyst
were there any notable geographic concentrations with -- for the organic growth?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
it was pretty balanced across the board when you look at our geographies. i mean we didn't see any particular one that i would call out. otherwise, we would have and specifically said that. we really saw it across all four of our segments in comparison to where they should be in the prior year. and equally, we saw it across all our geographies. frankly, the business is running very strong. we're very proud of the second quarter results.
john haley -- chief executive officer and a director
and i think where there were some differences across the geographies, i did call them out when i went through the segment review.
paul newsome -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. appreciate it. thank you. congrats in the quarter.
operator
thank you. your next question is from shlomo rosenbaum of stifel.
shlomo rosenbaum -- stifel -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my question. john, so just to ask you a little bit about -- when you have a merger like this that you're anticipating, a lot of times, a company will go ahead and delay certain initiatives with the anticipation of a certain joint strategy post the deal close.
and with the willis towers watson going out on their own more, what items might have been placed on ice before that will now be revisited? or what are some strategies that you're going to be pursuing that you might not have been pursuing beforehand now that the company is in on its own? and i don't know if there are specific areas you can talk about, more -- an acceleration of investments into specific areas or specific verticals? any color you could provide there would be helpful.
john haley -- chief executive officer and a director
yes. so thanks very much for that question, shlomo. we clearly had some initiatives that we were delaying in anticipation of the combination. and our leaders are going through and doing a review of those right now, but they're in all of our businesses. we see that in crb. we see it in irr, we see it in hcb. so all of these -- all the different businesses. we're looking at them.
we're prioritizing them. and at investor day, we're going to be presenting you a comprehensive plan about how we're attacking them and taking them forward. so i think there clearly were ones. there are some other initiatives that we've continued to pursue even during these 16 months. for example, our leadership on climate change, which we think is important from just the perspective of the good work we're doing there, but also we think that will be a very nice business for us going forward.
shlomo rosenbaum -- stifel -- analyst
okay. and then just the company posted very strong growth, 8%, clearly off of a weaker 2q comp. if we're going ahead and just looking at what the momentum, underlying momentum in the business feels like, would you say it feels more like mid-single digits like what you guided to for the year? or maybe just some kind of color around what it would be if you're looking at this on more of a normalized year-over-year number?
john haley -- chief executive officer and a director
yes. i mean i think we've been talking for a couple of years now about the overall market growing at about mid-single digits and us growing with at least as fast as the overall market. i would say if we look at it today, we feel slightly more bullish than that. so it would be at least mid-single digits is what we see for the longer run.
shlomo rosenbaum -- stifel -- analyst
okay. great. thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and your next question is from suneet kamath of citi.
suneet kamath -- citi -- analyst
great. thanks. so just back on retention, just a quick one. are there any agreements in place between you and aon regarding recruiting and hiring each other's talent?
john haley -- chief executive officer and a director
there are not. i mean i think there are limitations on the use of confidential information that we've exchanged, but that's basically it.
suneet kamath -- citi -- analyst
okay. and then in the crb business, i think in the press release, you talked about growth tied to settlements and book of business sales. so i just was hoping you could give us a sense of how much did that contribute to the growth in the quarter. and are these normal course things? or should be -- we be viewing this as -- some of this as onetime in nature? thanks.
john haley -- chief executive officer and a director
yes. i mean i think we -- as we referenced, like we've had booked business sales, that's an ongoing feature of the business that we're in. and so we had some last year, we had some this year. we probably had a little more this year than in prior years, but it's not something that we really break out.
suneet kamath -- citi -- analyst
okay. alright. that is fine. thanks.
operator
thank you. your next question is from mark hughes of truist.
mark hughes -- truist -- analyst
yes. thank you. good morning. mike, what would be a good way to approach other income? it was $74 million this quarter. what's a good proxy in the future quarters?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean i think this quarter is probably a reasonable representation of what we -- what you should expect or think about. i mean there obviously are going to be some slight ups and downs, but i think it's a reasonable proxy to think about.
mark hughes -- truist -- analyst
okay. and then john, the willis re decision at this time, could you expand a little bit more on what your thinking is about maybe divesting that, and why? and anything else that might fall into that category?
john haley -- chief executive officer and a director
no. as i said in the call, we have great appreciation for the willis re business, for our colleagues and the work they've been doing. we just thought that coming off the termination of the deal with aon was an appropriate time to consider strategic alternatives. that's the only business we're looking at thus far.
mark hughes -- truist -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question is from ryan tunis of autonomous research.
ryan tunis -- autonomous research -- analyst
hey. thanks. quick one for mike. on free cash flow, what are you thinking you'll be able to do for the full year of 2021 after we got through the second quarter?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
yes. ryan, i mean we have not given guidance, and we're not intending to do it. i mean just given the marketplaces of covid variants, etc, in terms of giving specific free cash flow guidance, i believe that we will continue to improve from what we've delivered previously. as you've seen, we're up on -- 30%, 31% year-to-date on an -- if you look at it on a run rate basis for the first half, which i think is consistent with where we've been over -- now over the last couple of years.
and i think that's accentuated in terms of our increased dividend that we -- that our board and we announced here as of today. i think we continue to work on free cash flow. i mean there's continued view inside the organization on how important that is for us to have that cash so we can reinvest in the business and buy back shares and do a variety of different things that we can do with that cash. and so i can just tell you that there's a lot of focus on it. we're very proud of what we continue to do there, and we'll look to continue to improve it.
ryan tunis -- autonomous research -- analyst
thanks. and then it seems like there's a little bit of a mixed message on investing versus buyback. you're saying that you want to invest organically and inorganically. but -- and yet you're divesting willis re. on the other hand, the buyback could clearly be bigger than it is. so i guess thinking about the decision to sell willis re, what are you thinking about in terms of revenue replacement type options? or is there any opportunity we could just see a larger share repurchase program?
john haley -- chief executive officer and a director
i think we -- we have that investor day coming up september 9, and we intend to talk in somewhat more specifics about our growth plans. but as we said in our remarks, we see a lot of growth opportunities in all of our businesses, whether it's broking or consulting or our bda businesses.
and we're going to be going through and thinking about them and prioritizing what we're looking at. but we think that's probably -- there are opportunities there that are going to be the best use of capital. to the extent we don't find ones that are as attractive as we like, we will probably do more share repurchase. but we're going to be guided by what's best for shareholders there in terms of financing growth.
ryan tunis -- autonomous research -- analyst
thanks for the answers.
operator
thanks. our next question is from mark marcon of baird.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
good morning and thanks for taking my questions. just wondering, with regards to this kind of the margin outlook for the second half of the year, how should we think about that vis-a-vis some replacement hiring? and related to replacement hiring, generally speaking, when we take a look at the top leadership team within willis towers watson and then perhaps the layer or two below, how should we think about the retention on a go-forward basis?
obviously, there were some agreements that were put in place to basically hold things together through the merger, and some of those obviously are no longer relevant. so how should we think about that as we look through until the successor is named?
john haley -- chief executive officer and a director
yes. so i think we -- one of the things we learned, we've had really incredible performance during the 16 months that we've been in this combination period where we were looking forward to that. and the reason we've had that is because of the performance of our colleagues overall, but especially because of the performance of our leaders.
and the broad leadership group within willis towers watson has been nothing short of outstanding. and we have incredibly deep talent in this organization. and i think we recognize that. we're going to make sure we do the appropriate things to retain them and to motivate them. but we're moving forward with a lot of confidence there, mark.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
great. and what -- will you highlight that to a greater extent on september 9? and again, what's -- how should we think about the margin outlook over the over the next six months, to any extent that you can illuminate that?
john haley -- chief executive officer and a director
yes. i think we will highlight some of that in -- on september 9. i think for the margins, we have two things that we say. we were -- we're proud of the margin expansion we've seen over the last couple of years here. we think we can continue that. we're recognizing that there are some features, like some travel and entertainment expenses are probably artificially low.
however, as we continue to do more of that, we're going to be looking to make sure that we increase t&e to the extent it drives revenue, and that's what we're going to be trying to make sure we do. so we feel pretty good about continuing to drive margin expansion over the longer time frame.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from meyer shields of kbw.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst
thanks. i guess first question, probably for john. can you talk about how you came up with $1 billion as the share repurchase? and i'm asking that because of how much cash there is on the balance sheet.
john haley -- chief executive officer and a director
well, if you think about -- the share repurchases we've had in the past have bounced around somewhat from year-to-year. but if you look at what we would have been expected to have done during the 16 months, that's about $1 billion.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst
okay. no, that's fair. that's the point we catch up. second question, and i know we've been talking about retention a lot, but it really does seem to be top of mind for investors. is there any way of guiding or ballparking the impact on revenue growth either in the second quarter or maybe over the next 12 months from the people that you lost?
john haley -- chief executive officer and a director
no. i mean i think probably if you look at the -- what mike said about we're expecting a mid-single-digit growth, i mean, i think that gives you the net of everything. so we don't -- we haven't broken things down any finer than that.
meyer shields -- kbw -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question is from brian meredith of ubs.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
yes. thanks. two questions here. first one, mike, i think i recall a couple of years ago, you're talking about the need to integrate systems to really drive meaningful margin improvement in the crb business. where are you in that process? and did the aon merger agreement kind of put a halt on some of that integration?
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
no. i mean the teams continue to invest in systems and technology as appropriate. and we've continued to do that. we're obviously -- we're mindful of thinking about what that could mean. but we've continued to -- most of crb is just -- it's supported really by two systems, and that's really the way we've continued to invest in those systems. they're core to our brokering capabilities and operations. and so adam and the team are very focused on it and continue to drive efficiency and effectiveness. and i see you're seeing that being reflected in their results.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks. and my second question, i'm just curious, john, the sale of max matthiessen and the sale of miller, was that all driven by this merger? and are there certain things that maybe happened that you may not have done as a result of the merger agreement that maybe you want to kind of rebuild in that area?
john haley -- chief executive officer and a director
no. actually, both miller and max matthiessen were started before we announced the merger.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
were there anything that you probably did during the course of the merger that maybe you're doing in anticipation of it that you'd want to do some reinvestment in that area?
john haley -- chief executive officer and a director
i don't think there's anything specific like that. as we did say, we expected that we would -- there are some things that we were going slower on, and we'll address them on september 9, that we're going to reinvigorate some initiatives we had. but nothing major like business -- whole businesses or anything like that.
brian meredith -- ubs -- analyst
great. good to hear. thank you
operator
your next question is from phil stefano of deutsche bank.
phil stefano -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yes. thanks. good morning. on the margin conversation, it feels like, at least for most of the investors we talked to, there's a focus on the adjusted ebitda margin. i think when you most recently gave guidance, it was on the adjusted operating margin. maybe you could talk about which of these is more important, if there is one, and where you want us to be focused on our margin thoughts looking forward.
mike burwell -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean i think we tend to focus on operating margin overall in the business. and so i think that, that's an appropriate spot for you to focus on as well. i mean that -- i mean, you have depreciation and amortization that are in there as well. but i think that's really the focal point.
phil stefano -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. and so my follow-up, so i -- there's always strategic actions that could be happening and announced over the next couple of months. there's the potential for share repurchases, do or don't we lever up the debt, the strategic review for willis re.
how should we think about the time line for all these things with the understanding that we don't have a new ceo in place? and presumably, this will be part of the job appeal to someone externally to be -- have this strategic footprint and flexibility around them. so maybe you could talk about the time line for these strategic decisions with the idea that we don't have a ceo, looking forward.
john haley -- chief executive officer and a director
yes. i mean i think we're working, as i said, on a review of what opportunities we have across all the businesses, both ones we have deferred, both new ones we've identified during the last 16 months and what we should be doing. it's an effort that is a broad-based effort across our leadership. and so it will have the buy-in of the whole leadership of the company. and we think it will be something that will be in the works, oven-ready for the new ceo to execute on.
operator
thank you. we have no further questions at this time. i will hand the call back over for any additional or closing remarks.

john j. haley -- chief executive officer and executive director
thanks very much. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2021 earnings call. joining me today are andrew krasner, our chief financial officer; and carl hess, our president and our future chief executive officer. today's call will be my last earnings call as ceo of this great company. willis towers watson looks remarkably different than it did 22 years ago when i first started as ceo of watson wyatt and even more so than when i started at the wyatt company 44 years ago. it's been an amazing journey, and it underscores the resilience of this extraordinary organization. the combination of our exceptional people and strong value has enabled this company to reinvent itself and to continually evolve.
our history has been defined by constant innovation and change. together, we forged the legacy of quality service and solutions with strong client relationships and have built a willis towers watson culture of resilience, inclusion and client focus. i'm proud of what we have achieved, and i feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to take the company this far with all of you. at the end of this year, i'll officially pass the baton to carl hess. now is a time of reinvigoration for willis towers watson. carl is a great leader, focused on driving results and accountability by engaging colleagues. he has a wealth of knowledge and experience, and he has the skills to best lead the company during this transformative time.
i have every confidence that carl will be successfully creating a new way forward and leading willis towers watson and our top talent to an even brighter future. as we bring our new leadership team into place, we're also building one willis towers watson. one wtw is about working across businesses, geographies and functions to achieve more and to be better. we're starting from a position of strength and recognize our potential. we're executing on our plan. we're focused on a bold new vision to be the best company in the business. we plan to drive change through new priorities to grow, simplify and transform.
we'll grow by investing in talent, by capturing market share, by innovating, by expediting capabilities in evolving markets and by bringing curated solutions to clients. we'll simplify by delivering more efficiently through technology and through standardization. for example, we've already begun by developing a plan to streamline to two business segments and three geographies at the beginning of 2022 and appointing a new global leadership team. we'll transform colleague and client experiences by streamlining our infrastructure, by fortifying our operations and by evaluating our real estate needs. while there's no doubt work ahead of us, we have confidence in our plan, one wtw, and most importantly, in our colleagues.
as we continue to look ahead, i'm especially excited about the industry-leading work we've done and will continue to do in addressing climate risk. we recently launched climate transition pathways, an accreditation framework that provides insurance companies and financial institutions with a consistent approach to identifying which organizations have robust transition plans, transition plans that are aligned to the paris agreement. and it supports the role as stewards and transition to a low-carbon economy.
we also partnered with contigo to launch an innovative family of climate transition indices, driven by a next-generation methodology that directly quantifies the impact of the paris-aligned climate transition on equity valuations. we intend to continue this momentum. next week, we'll probably participate in the 26th united nations climate change conference of the parties, or cop26. cop26 will bring together world leaders, government representatives, businesses and citizens to collaborate on how to tackle the many facets of climate change and plan for action.
now let's move to our third quarter results. please note that all metrics referenced are on a continuing operations basis, except where specifically stated otherwise. reported revenue for the third quarter was $2 billion, up 4% as compared to the prior year third quarter, up 3% on a constant currency basis and up 7% on an organic basis. net income, which includes discontinued operations, was $919 million, up 672% for the third quarter as compared to $119 million of net income in the prior year third quarter. it should be noted that gaap profitability measures include the $1 billion in proceeds received in connection with the termination of the proposed business combination with aon.
adjusted ebitda was $427 million or 21.6% of revenue for the third quarter as compared to $372 million or 19.6% of revenue for the same period last year, representing a 15% increase on an adjusted ebitda dollar basis and 200 basis points of margin improvement. for the quarter, diluted earnings per share, which include discontinued operations, were $6.99, an increase of 140% as compared to the prior year. adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.73 for the third quarter, reflecting an increase of 32% compared to $1.31 in the prior year.
overall, it was a strong quarter. we grew revenue. we enhanced margin, and we increased earnings per share. now let's look at each of the segments in some more detail. to provide clear comparability with prior periods, all commentary regarding results of our segments will be on an organic basis, unless specifically stated otherwise. segment margins are calculated using segment revenue and exclude unallocated corporate costs, such as amortization of intangibles, certain transaction and integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions as well as other items, which we consider noncore to our operating results.
the segment results do include discretionary compensation. the human capital & benefits or hcb segment revenue was up 6% on an organic basis and 5% on a constant currency basis compared to the third quarter of the prior year. this result represented sequential revenue improvement compared to our prior quarter, which was driven by continued increased demand for advisory services. talent and rewards revenue increased 22%, driven by strong market demand for broad-based rewards advisory work, coupled with talent and compensation products inclusive of compensation surveys, hiring assessments and employee listing and engagement offerings.
our health and benefits revenue increased 5% for the quarter. we continue to grow revenue from advisory work in north america, driven by u.s. legislative changes and strategic benefit reviews. revenue also grew outside of north america as a result of global benefit management and local brokerage appointments. retirement revenue was flat compared to the prior year, with funding and guaranteed minimum pension equalization work in great britain, offset by declines in north america as less favorable market conditions for derisking work drove lower demand for bulk lump sum work. technology and administration solutions revenue grew 9%, primarily due to increased project work and new business activity in great britain.
hcb's operating margin increased by 210 basis points compared to the prior year third quarter as a result of continued sustainable expense reduction efforts. we're pleased with hcb's sequential improvement and with their margin growth. historically, hcb has had industry-leading margins, and we believe that trend will continue. hcb's talent base remains stable, and overall market tailwinds should continue to drive organic growth momentum for hcb. both our near-term and long-term outlook on hcb remain positive. now let's look at corporate risk & broking, or crb, which had a revenue increase of 6% on an organic and constant currency basis as compared to the prior year third quarter.
north america's revenue was up by 12% in the third quarter, driven by new business, particularly in m&a, finex, construction and aerospace lines. international and great britain's revenues increased 4% and 2%, respectively, for the third quarter. the revenue increases were primarily driven by growth in the retail and finex insurance lines. revenue for western europe was up nominally due to growth in poland and sweden being largely offset by the departure of senior staff, which pressured business in certain geographies. crb's revenue was $697 million for the quarter, with an operating margin of 16.3% compared to $647 million of revenue with an operating margin of 12.5% in the prior year third quarter.
the 380 basis point margin improvement mainly reflects the continuation of effective cost containment and, to a lesser degree, the benefit of gains from book of business sales and settlements. from time to time, colleagues who manage client relationships leave the company. when we lose colleagues such as those, it may result in them joining competitors. the impact of this on revenue may be delayed. this dynamic, which was most pronounced in our corporate risk & broking segment in the second and third quarters of 2021, has caused crb's organic growth to trail industry expected averages so far in 2021, and we expect the gap to narrow by the end of the first half of 2022.
during the third quarter, we focused on stemming attrition and hiring health. on a net basis, core crb headcount is down about 100 colleagues or just under 1% as compared to the third quarter of last year. we have executed on our incentive plans, which provide both short-term and long-term retention benefits, and we believe attrition rates have already peaked for crb. so while we may have some transitory headwinds ahead of us, we expect that the worst of the business disruption is behind us, and our longer-term outlook for crb remains positive. now turning to investment, risk & reinsurance, or irr. revenue for the third quarter was $172 million, an increase of 10% on an organic basis and a decrease of 24% on a constant currency basis as compared to the prior year third quarter.
irr revenue excludes the reinsurance line of business, which has been reported as discontinued operations. it also excludes revenue from max matthiessen, which was sold in september of 2020; and miller, irr's wholesale broking subsidiary, which was sold in march of 2021. the insurance consulting and technology business, with revenue growth of 18%, led the segment's growth, with increased demand for advisory work alongside technology sales. the investment business grew by 6% from performance-based new business and growth in delegated assets under management. irr had an operating margin of 12.9%, up 360 basis points as compared to 9.3% for the prior year third quarter.
the strong margin expansion was a result of careful cost containment efforts, coupled with solid top line growth. revenue for the benefits delivery & administration, or bda, segment, increased by 7% on an organic basis and constant currency basis from the prior year third quarter. the growth in revenue was largely driven by individual marketplace, primarily by tranzact, which contributed $111 million to bda's top line this quarter, with growth in medicare advantage and life products. the benefits outsourcing business also contributed to the increase in revenue, which was largely driven by its expanded client base.
the bda segment had revenue of $242 million, with a minus 7.9% operating margin as compared to revenue of $226 million and an operating margin of minus 5.3% in the prior year third quarter. the margin decline was largely due to our increase in sales capacity ahead of the 2022 annual enrollment period, which will usher in expansion opportunities for both our individual marketplace and benefits outsourcing lines of business. we continue to feel positive about the momentum of our bda business going into the fourth quarter, which is our seasonally strongest quarter. so in conclusion, overall, i'm very pleased with our results this quarter.
we delivered strong overall financial performance with top line growth, margin expansion and eps growth, all while undergoing a massive shift in our go-forward strategy. in closing, i'd like to express my deepest gratitude to our colleagues, our clients and our shareholders for their trust in willis towers watson and for the opportunity to be ceo of this extraordinary organization. i believe the company is well positioned to meet the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead, and it's been a privilege to serve you. now i'll turn the call over to andrew.
andrew jay krasner -- chief financial officer
thanks, john. we all wish you the best in your retirement at the end of the year. good morning, everyone. thanks to all of you for joining us. first, i'd like to extend my appreciation to all of our colleagues. we have asked a lot of our teams, and our colleagues continue to pull together and deliver. i'm proud of all the work they have done to continue supporting our clients, each other and the communities in which we work and live. as john noted, we continue to make progress in the third quarter, highlighted by another quarter of strong organic revenue growth, continued operational improvement and effective capital management. we are reassured by the continued improved demand for our discretionary services and solutions and by our ability to generate profitable growth.
moreover, we feel we are well positioned to execute on the long-term goals we announced during the investor day meeting that we hosted last month. we are excited about the early progress we are making with our transformation efforts. the investments we're making to transform our operations will create better scalability, more flexibility and enhanced colleague and client experience. through streamlining global platforms, right-shoring operations, rationalizing real estate and modernizing it, we expect to deliver $300 million in expected cost reductions and contribute 300 basis points of margin improvement toward our fiscal year 2024 adjusted operating margin target of 24% to 25%.
now i'll turn to the overall detailed financial results. as a reminder, you can see the detailed quarterly continuing operations results for 2020 and 2021 year-to-date on page nine of the supplemental materials. income from continuing operations for the third quarter, which included the $1 billion termination fee, was $1.1 billion or 57.3% of revenue, up from the prior year third quarter income from operations of $66 million or 3.5% of revenue. adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $264 million or 13.4% of revenue, up 120 basis points from $231 million or 12.2% of revenue in the prior year third quarter. for the third quarters of 2021 and 2020, our diluted eps from continuing operations were $7.8 and $0.91 respectively, and that 2021 figure includes the $1 billion termination fee.
for the third quarter of 2021, our adjusted eps was up 32% to $1.73 per share as compared to $1.31 per share in the prior year third quarter. further, discontinued operations represented a $0.09 loss on a diluted eps basis for the third quarter of 2021 and $0.02 of diluted eps basis for the third quarter of 2020. total diluted eps, including both continued and discontinued operations, increased to $6.99 for the third quarter of 2021 compared to the prior year third quarter of $0.93.
foreign currency rate changes caused an increase in our consolidated revenue of $27 million or 1% of revenue for the quarter compared to the prior year third quarter, with negative $0.01 headwind to adjusted diluted earnings per share this quarter. our u.s. gaap tax rate for the third quarter was 22.5% versus 26.6% in the prior year. our adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 23.3%, down from 29.3% in the prior year, which was elevated due to the unfavorable impact of nonrecurring discrete items. turning to the balance sheet.
we ended the third quarter with a strong capital and liquidity position, with cash and cash equivalents of $2.2 billion and full capacity on our undrawn $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. we also successfully reduced our leverage profile by repaying $450 million of bonds outstanding during the quarter. willis towers watson remains well positioned from a liquidity perspective. we aim to continue to maintain a strong and durable balance sheet and believe we have significant financial flexibility. free cash flow, which includes discontinued operations, was $1.7 billion in the first nine months of 2021 compared to $1 billion in the same period of the prior year.
the increase in year-over-year free cash flow was due to the receipt of the termination fee, net of increased transaction and integration fees of $942 million. this was partially offset by net legal settlement payments of approximately $185 million for the previously announced stanford and willis towers watson merger settlements and higher incentive compensation of approximately $189 million. absent these items, free cash flow would have been $1.2 billion or up 17.3% versus the prior year. in terms of capital allocation, we paid $275 million in dividends for the nine months ended september 30 and repurchased 4.5 million shares for $1 billion.
at our recent investor day, we communicated that we expect to generate $10 billion to $11 billion of cash through 2024. we remain committed to deploying net capital into share repurchases to capitalize on short-term price weakness. at current price levels, willis towers watson stock continues to be our highest return opportunity, and we have significant resources to capitalize upon that. as part of our investor day discussion, we communicated approximately $4 billion of near-term share repurchase activity. with the first $1 billion completed, we will commence repurchases with the remaining component of that in 2021 and expect to conclude that during 2022.
looking ahead to the fourth quarter and full year, we recognize that the company's recent strategic shifts, alongside unique macroeconomic factors, have created complexity in setting expectations for our performance for the year. this year, our core performance metrics have been clouded by discontinued operations reporting a onetime $1 billion termination fee, divestitures and a still evolving economic recovery. so we would like to clarify and say that for the full year 2021, we expect to produce around 6% organic revenue growth and an adjusted operating margin of 19.5%, 20% on a continuing operations basis.
we expect this to be the new baseline to begin the path to our fiscal year-end 2024 goal of 24% to 25% adjusted operating margin. please note that the 2021 margin guide includes the negative impact of stranded costs from the sale of willis re, which we intend to rightsize during the period in which we received cost relief under a transition services agreement. going forward, we prefer to keep the focus on long-term value drivers of the business and will not continue providing quarterly or annual guidance. we are very pleased with these third quarter results, and they are a direct reflection of our resilience and our focus on strategic priorities.
we have strong momentum, solid financial results, a robust balance sheet and an excellent team, which gives me confidence in our ability to continue driving value for all our stakeholders. as i think about our future, i'm excited to continue to work with carl and the rest of the leadership team to drive the company forward and explore the opportunities ahead. i have confidence in our leadership team, willis towers watson's talented colleagues and in our strong culture. and now i'll turn the call back to john.
john j. haley -- chief executive officer and executive director
thanks very much, andrew. and as i mentioned at the beginning of the call, we have carl hess on the line with us also. we anticipate that most of your questions are going to be about what our results need for the future. and so while i may chime in from time to time, carl and andrew are going to be answering the vast bulk of the questions. so let's turn to your questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] the first question from elyse greenspan with wells fargo.
elyse beth greenspan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hi. thanks. good morning. my first question is just on the organic guide and also the view for crb. so you guys put out a 2021 guide of 6% organic, which would imply 6% in the fourth quarter, given the year-to-date was 6%. so i just want to make sure that, that thinking is correct. and then the second question, within crb, you alluded to an impact from departures having peaked, but you did say that growth there could be compressed through the first half of next year. so should we think that crb could, as a segment, remain kind of within that 6% organic for the next three quarters?
andrew jay krasner -- chief financial officer
yes. sure. thanks, elyse. this is andrew. so i'll take the first part of your question around organic growth for the rest of the year. i think you're thinking about that properly in terms of where we would expect fourth quarter to align relative to our stated guidance of 6% for the full year.
carl a. hess -- president
and this is carl, elyse. good morning. with respect to sort of the outlook for crb on the revenue side, we have seen a mitigation of the departures we talked about at analyst day, and we're getting back on the front foot with respect to hiring. there have been some encouraging trends in the business as we look toward new hires, less terminations where we've actually in third quarter now seen hiring exceeding terminations for the organization. as we know that hiring precedes revenue when it comes to people, but that will help us going into 2022 and forward.
new business results for crb have remained strong and are up on last year, thanks to a strong client and sales management discipline and i think a validation of our global light of business model. while we have seen some revenue gains that are through book sales that have impacted the business, those are a continuation of last year. it's on a new phenomenon. and in general, it leads us to thinking that our crb is going to continue to grow, but probably be at the lower end of the industry averages through the first half of 2022.
elyse beth greenspan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
and then john had said that you guys are down 100 colleagues within crb this third quarter versus last third quarter. what was the peak, i guess, if you were going to look at the peak over the past couple of quarters, what would that number have been when it was kind of the worst of the departures just so we can get a sense of like the hiring back that you guys have done?
andrew jay krasner -- chief financial officer
so i think it's hard to pin down, but what we've seen is third quarter departures are lower than second quarter departures. so we think we're past the peak on that. and the other side of that, hiring was very low during the period of the business combination, what was out there. that has resumed with a vengeance, not just hire we've already made but the hire we continue to plan to do. so our open recs are well increased from where they were a year ago at this time.
elyse beth greenspan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
and one last one. there was good margin improvement in the quarter and in the guide for the full year as well. are margins been inflated by the level of departures and the lab with hiring, meaning is that a headwind to next year's margin? or do you think once the revenue growth gets back on track with the industry that, that will kind of offset any expense impact from hiring?
andrew jay krasner -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean i think what we're willing to say about the margin is that we're very happy with the margin improvement that we've seen through the first three quarters. we remain positive about our margin outlook. we do expect to deliver margin improvement in fourth quarter. but we do expect sort of, as business activity continues to ramp up, that there will be some slowing of the rate of margin improvement.
elyse beth greenspan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
okay. thanks for the color.
operator
next question, we have mark marcon.
mark steven marcon -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
good morning, thanks for taking my question. first, john, congratulations on a stellar career. it's been a pleasure working with you over the decades. wondering if you can talk a little bit about the -- just kind of the pace of the margin expansion as you progress from this year to your longer-term 2024 targets. how should investors just kind of think about that sort of pacing? how much of it is going to be back-end loaded just in terms of framing appropriate expectations as we start focusing on next year and the following year?
carl a. hess -- president
yes. mark, it's carl. good morning. i think two parts to that, right? there's the margin improvement we get -- expect to get through operating leverage in the business, which i think we would say should be relatively constant through the period, maybe some short-term headwinds looking into the first half of 2022 as we've already identified, but no reason that shouldn't be relatively steady phenomenon throughout that period. then there's the effect of the transformation program that we started to lay out at analyst day. and we do think, like many transformation programs, right, the costs tend to be front loaded and the rewards a bit backloaded.
mark steven marcon -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
got it. and so it would be reasonable to assume that first half of next year, probably margins are going to be a little bit on the tepid side. and as we go out and for the full year, probably not a lot of improvement. and then the bulk of the improvement really more in the 2023, 2024, back half of 2023 and going into 2024. is that fair?
andrew jay krasner -- chief financial officer
i think what we'd say about margins in the future is that we'd refer to the investor day materials and that we're targeting the 24% to 25% by the end of fiscal 2024.
mark steven marcon -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
okay. great. and then with regards to crb, just in terms of the departures that have already occurred, how would you characterize the revenue impact that is going to occur in the future with regards to that group?
carl a. hess -- president
i think i'd point out that sort of book sales, right, which impact the cost side, i think, obviously, revenue multiples on book sales vary, but with a pretty well-known range, right? i mean book sales make up less than 1% of the revenue we're talking about. so you can take your multiples on that, but i don't think the answer in a macro level isn't significant for the enterprise.
mark steven marcon -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
great. and then which part of the business are you the most excited about within hcb at this point in terms of future growth?
carl a. hess -- president
well, so for the current hcb, right, we identified at investor day that we think our health and benefits business is one where we see significant opportunity, both from a scope perspective and a scale perspective in terms of what we can do for the enterprise. that being said, we think all our hcb businesses are valuable contributors to the portfolio. we've got a market-leading retirement business. our talent and reward business has had a phenomenal rebound last year, and there's great demand for its services and we think has a lot of prominence in what we do and helps us with all our buyer hubs with respect to human capital benefits. and we've got a very, very strong technology administration services business that continues to gain market share. so there's a lot to like across that entire portfolio.
mark steven marcon -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
next question, we have mike zaremski with wolfe research.
michael david zaremski -- wolfe research, llc -- analyst
hi, good morning. follow-up on the margin guidance, and thanks for all the good color. specifically, if i understand correctly, you're saying that the near-term margin guidance includes a negative impact from the stranded costs. so are we going to be able to kind of quantify those stranded costs and kind of know how to back them out? or i'm assuming they were contemplated in the long-term margin kind of guidance that you guys have laid out. i just want to understand how material that is and if it's something that we should be thinking about as we think through our numbers.
andrew jay krasner -- chief financial officer
sure. that's not something we're going to quantify right now, but as you alluded to, is absolutely contemplated in the longer-term guidance of 24% to 25%.
michael david zaremski -- wolfe research, llc -- analyst
okay. got it. and maybe sticking with some of the $750 million of cost. i know in the distant past, rating agencies have looked at -- have not kind of excluded some of those charges. i'm curious if those charges will be included in the kind of the rating agency governors on how they calculate leverage when we think about buybacks potential. and then also as related to the cost program, it looks like you'll be shedding a lot of your leases if you look at the 10-k. so i just want to be clear. it seems like willis is directionally moving toward more of a remote work flexibility environment versus peers. i just wanted to see if that's the right way to think about things. thanks.
andrew jay krasner -- chief financial officer
yes. on the first part of your question, we don't expect there to be any impact from the restructuring efforts on our ability to repurchase shares. as to the specific rating agency calculations, that may be a question for them about how they're going to treat that. but again, we don't expect that to be a headwind for any of our share repurchase activities or capital allocation plans. i'll ask carl to chime in on the real estate point.
carl a. hess -- president
i think we've had 45,000 colleagues that have adapted marvelously to the new ways of working that we were afforded voluntarily or not as a result of covid. we have come through, not just ably but in a stellar fashion with respect to how we're able to team up with each other and serve our clients. and the lessons we've learned with respect to how we can employ technology to continue to collaborate and have excellent client service, we're taking those lessons, and we will be implementing those in our real estate portfolio, as you correctly identified. we're going to turn our real estate footprint into collaboration space rather than come to the office space.
michael david zaremski -- wolfe research, llc -- analyst
thank you.
operator
next, we have mark hughes with truist.
mark douglas hughes -- truist securities, inc. -- analyst
thank you, good morning. congratulations, john. in the hcb space, the great resignation here, how long do you think this momentum could last? you talked about a sharp recovery turnaround. do clients expect these tight labor market conditions to persist? how do you see it playing out?
john j. haley -- chief executive officer and executive director
could you clarify? i'm not sure you're talking about our workforce or our clients' workforce and the demand for our services.
mark douglas hughes -- truist securities, inc. -- analyst
yes. talking about your clients' workforce and their demand for your services. just what are you hearing from your clients about how long they think this will persist. and then obviously, that impacts your revenue opportunity, so just some perspective on the durability of this upswing.
john j. haley -- chief executive officer and executive director
yes. so i mean there's no question that our demand for talent and rewards has been driven by strong demand for work that includes tightening labor markets, and that affects our compensation survey business, hiring assessments, employee engagement work. all of these have seen strong demand because of that. we anticipate that to continue, given labor markets continue to be quite tight. and we are making sure that we're adequately resourced to be able to meet that demand across the organization. we don't think that some -- there's a combination of both short-term and near-term economic effects that are going to affect this.
you tell us when vaccination rates globally are to a point where supply chains are undisrupted, and we'll give you some insight into what that means for some of the global talent markets. but certainly, we think this is a good tailwind for our business, and we're doing our best to maximize the value we can bring across the portfolio to us.
mark douglas hughes -- truist securities, inc. -- analyst
fair enough. and then in crb, what was the north american organic? what were those regional numbers you gave, i think, north american, international and great britain?
andrew jay krasner -- chief financial officer
we're getting that. just a second. yes, so north america revenue was up 12%.
john j. haley -- chief executive officer and executive director
international, 4%; great britain, 2%; western europe, basically flat, up nominally.
mark douglas hughes -- truist securities, inc. -- analyst
great. and then one final question. i think you had talked last quarter about the equalization work, the pension equalization work in great britain that there was visibility for that to be strong in next year, perhaps. is that still the case?
john j. haley -- chief executive officer and executive director
yes. we do think that we'll be seeing higher levels of work related to equalization and expect additional work from schemes that are better funded. and of course, the markets have been kind to pension schemes globally this year. that's remained to be true, as we said it after analyst day.
mark douglas hughes -- truist securities, inc. -- analyst
thank you very much.

next, we have paul newsome with piper sandler.
paul newsome -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
just a little bit of a follow-up on the wage inflation question. are you seeing in your business globally some of these concerns that it's just getting more costly to hire people or keep people broadly? and i guess, just leading with that, is that something that you need to manage through or seeing it any place?
john j. haley -- chief executive officer and executive director
so we're on the market for new talent across the organization. so we're definitely noticing that there are areas of our business that are definite hot markets for talent. and i think you probably heard that from a number of people in our industry over the last week or so. we are a global business. we are able to source talent globally, and that does assist us in that. we can drop a wide range of talent pools as we manage the organization, and it gives us great resources across the organization to be able to staff engagements to make sure we're meeting client demand. we do factor this into our planning as a business. and the management team has been through a few market cycles with respect to talent and i think is very well prepared to deal with it.
paul newsome -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
is there any reason why the issues in staffing has been focused on the crb business versus the commercial insurance business versus other lines of business? is there anything sort of you think is sort of unique or different about your businesses that may have kept them a little bit more isolated than the commercial businesses?
john j. haley -- chief executive officer and executive director
i think there are a number of our businesses that are extremely team oriented in the way they're constructed and served. so if you -- as an extreme example, our technology administrative services business, right, where each of our relationships with our clients are long-term contracts, typically five to seven years, and very much not dependent on any individual team member being with the firm, right? they're extremely institutional. at the other end of the scale, you might have mid-market crb, where it's a very relationship-centric business and maybe a single face to the client. so just fundamentally different sort of dynamics in terms of where the economics the relationship lie.
paul newsome -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
thanks for the color. congratulations to john.
john j. haley -- chief executive officer and executive director
thank you. thank you.
operator
next, we have greg peters with raymond james.
marcos costa holanda -- raymond james & associates, inc. -- analyst
marcos calling in on behalf of greg peters. good morning. you mentioned crb growth maybe lower the industry over the next couple of quarters. as you hire, is it right to expect that growth may accelerate as you go toward 2024 toward your $10 billion target?
john j. haley -- chief executive officer and executive director
yes.
marcos costa holanda -- raymond james & associates, inc. -- analyst
okay. and then while i understand the nature of the reinsurance business and how it's more of a stand-alone business, it is margin accretive. can you clarify the benefits of divesting the reinsurance business and the ongoing progress there?
john j. haley -- chief executive officer and executive director
so the reinsurance business has been historically more profitable than the average. as you pointed out, it is a bit of a stand-alone. it's got a different buyer hub than most of the rest of the company. we talked earlier about sort of cost pressures, right? in fact, the major cost in our reinsurance business is the people. and this is an area where compensation costs have been increasing much faster than the rest of the industry. it's very possible look to a future where those margins are significantly eroded due to higher compensation costs, and that's a problem that will no longer be ours. in addition, at this point in time, right, $1 of every $6 or $7 in the reinsurance market is provided by the capital markets, not traditional reinsurance. our margins and everybody else's margins for providing services through the capital markets are much lower than they are through traditional reinsurance brokerage.
and so that's an additional headwind for that business that we won't have to face. with respect to the divestiture, that is progressing as we thought it would. the timing that we've talked about is unchanged and the deal is subject to required regulatory approvals and clearances as well as other customary closing conditions, and we expect it to be cleared no later than the end of the first quarter of 2022.
marcos costa holanda -- raymond james & associates, inc. -- analyst
okay. i appreciate that. and maybe just a point of clarification. in the press release, you mentioned gains connected to settlements in crb. can you clarify if that was part of organic growth or just a part of segment income?
andrew jay krasner -- chief financial officer
yes. that is in the revenue figures for the segment.
marcos costa holanda -- raymond james & associates, inc. -- analyst
okay. thanks very much for taking the questions.
operator
next, we have ryan tunis with autonomous research.
ryan james tunis -- autonomous research llp -- analyst
thanks, good morning. question for carl. appreciate that it sounds like some of the hiring trends are headed in the right direction. but i'm more interested in kind of understanding how that headwind is working its way into organic. would you say that this quarter's organic growth trend kind of reflects the fully loaded impact of some of the attrition issues you've had earlier this year? or do you expect that headwind to grow a bit more as we get into the first half of 2022?
carl a. hess -- president
yes. i think as john had alluded to in his prepared remarks, in terms of that dynamic, we expect to be toward the lower end of industry average growth rates through the first half of next year and do expect that gap to narrow as we progress throughout the year.
ryan james tunis -- autonomous research llp -- analyst
got it. and then on bda, i'm far from an expert in this business. in fact, i barely know how to model it, so i was hoping you could maybe help me in terms of how to think about fourth quarter organic. i mean the comp looks difficult at plus 16%. but the year before, it was plus 3%. i'm just trying to get a feel for what are the type of range of outcomes that we can expect given that difficult comparison a year ago?
carl a. hess -- president
so a couple of things maybe as color, right? one is we have begun staffing a bit earlier this year in our tranzact business to make sure we're fully staffed for the ramp-up for the 2022 annual enrollment period to capitalize on market demand. we also acquired omni direct, which is a full-service direct response media agency focusing on the hispanic market in july of last year, and that's driven higher growth revenue growth opportunities in tranzact, although it's somewhat lower margin. fourth quarter is the seasonally highest quarter for our revenue there, right? revenue is close to 50% for the year. and our revenue growth is tied to the lead acquisition cost, so that operating income dollars will grow commensurate to the revenue dollars growth.
but overall, operating margin should remain about constant. if you sort of look back, right, our year-to-date growth was materially impacted by our strong medicare advantage open enrollment period in the first quarter. that was highly correlated to the 2021 a year ago, right, fourth quarter 2020 annual enrollment period. we had significantly higher medicare advantage revenue growth in the annual enrollment period last year, plus 57%, and that led to strong revenue growth in the open enrollment period in the fourth quarter, plus 65%. we anticipate continued strong double-digit growth in q4, but note that we have a strong comparable from last year with a higher base of revenues we're building off. and the annual enrollment period in fourth quarter this year is not correlated to the first quarter open enrollment period.
operator
next, we have meyer shields with kbw.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- analyst
thanks. longer-term question, i guess, for adam. there's obviously a lot of focus on crb margins. and i think most of it has been focused on expenses. and i was wondering, is there a revenue component that also contributes to maybe the margin differential between willis and other leading brokers?
andrew jay krasner -- chief financial officer
sorry, it's andrew. can you clarify what you mean by revenue component?
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- analyst
yes. i guess to put it as bluntly as possible, is there any element of willis' insurance brokers charging less than some other competitors?
john j. haley -- chief executive officer and executive director
no.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- analyst
okay. that's certainly helpful. and then second, small...
john j. haley -- chief executive officer and executive director
and hopefully quite clear.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- analyst
i'm sorry?
john j. haley -- chief executive officer and executive director
i said and hopefully quite clear. sorry.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- analyst
yes. it seems pretty unequivocal here. is there maybe a ballpark in the impact of the settlements within crb and the impact on the margins?
andrew jay krasner -- chief financial officer
yes. sure. so the impact on margins is -- crb produced about a 380 basis point of margin improvement during the quarter. the book sales, which we alluded to earlier, contributed about 170 basis points. so without that component, there still would have been a 210 basis point of margin improvement in that segment.
meyer shields -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- analyst
okay. thanks.
operator
next, we have shlomo rosenbaum with stifel.
shlomo h. rosenbaum -- stifel, nicolaus & company, inc. -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. most of my questions have been answered. i just want to ask one question. just in terms of tranzact growth, and how should we expect that to continue going into 2022? you talked a little bit about some of your expectations in the fourth quarter. so it's been a very strong business but it's getting to become a bigger business. and i was just wondering how well we should think about that in the context of the runway ahead of you.
john j. haley -- chief executive officer and executive director
i think we had some comments during analyst day that we still think remain very germane. first of all, as i said a couple of minutes ago, right, on the very short term, there tends to be a strong correlation between the first quarter activity to the prior fourth quarter. that is the open enrollment period will definitely influence the annual enrollment period. looking forward, right, we see this as a tremendous large addressable market, and we think we have a great position in it. we, to a certain extent, can control our destiny in terms of how big we want this to be. and as gene wickes said during analyst day, it is about making sure that we sort of make sure what the picture we have for growth makes financial sense for the enterprise. and we work with gene to make sure that we maximize the potential of that.
carl a. hess -- president
thank you. great, you can join us. and with that, before i pass it back to john to wrap up, at least i think andrew and i here would like to say thank you, john. 84 calls, and these are very big shoes of yours we're going to try and fill going forward. you have done tremendous things for this organization, and we are all very grateful for what you have done to lead us all this time.
john j. haley -- chief executive officer and executive director
well, thanks very much. i appreciate that, and thanks to all the analysts for joining us on this call. i would like to say it's been a pleasure to work with you over the years. from day one, i've been impressed with the quality of our analysts and the work they've done. i haven't always necessarily agreed with your conclusions, but i have always admired the intelligence and the dedication that you bring to your craft. so thanks very much, and good luck going forward. and then carl and andrew will be updating you on our next call. so long.
