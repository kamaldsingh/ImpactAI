marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
appreciate you calling in today. the entire slg team is here at 420 lexington avenue, where we are doing our final earnings call from our board room in the landmark graybar building as our next call will be done from our new offices at one vanderbilt avenue.
for almost 22 years, graybar has been our headquarters and base of operation for all that we've accomplished. but now, 2021 heralds a change for sl green as we move across the street into our extraordinary, newly completed building that we will soon call home and we could not be more excited about it.
for us, the move begins a new chapter for the company that coincides with a period of reconstruction in new york city, marked by the rollout of the covid vaccine, the easing of covid-related restrictions, the promise of federal stimulus for cities and states, and a gradual return of the workforce to offices and other places of business. and there are many more reasons for optimism as we begin the return to normalcy this year.
the financial and tech sectors in new york city, which account for over half of the office space demand, are doing extremely well and they added 5,000 office using jobs in december alone. the city is forecasting a significant amount of new office jobs in 2021, such that we would return to pre-pandemic office employment levels by the fourth quarter of this year, recouping all of the 165,000 office jobs lost at the outset of the pandemic.
the credit markets remain quite strong with commercial mortgage interest rate levels in and around the 2.5% level and new construction activity has substantially declined, which combined with job growth will enable supply to come back into balance with tenant demand.
and on the topic of demand, sl green had a very productive seven weeks since our investor conference on december 7, where we held a live in-person event at one vanderbilt. during that seven-week period, we signed 200,000 square feet of manhattan office leases while adding 240,000 square feet of new pipeline, thus increasing our current pipeline as we sit here today to 700,000 square feet, higher than on december 7.
with the leases we expect to sign over the next 60 days, we anticipate being on schedule for our total projected volume for the year of 1.3 million square feet; one of the 18 or so goals and objectives we laid out for everybody in the investor conference.
of particular note are the lease transactions we announced yesterday, starting with the beam suntory deal for 100,000 square feet at 11 madison avenue, filling the space which had been vacant since april of 2019. suntory is relocating its headquarters from chicago to new york city to better align its global brand building efforts with all that new york offers. the suntory deal and the 92,000 square foot freshly deal at 63 madison avenue, also recently announced, affirms the development strategy that is the underpinning of our one madison avenue development project, which is now fully financed and bound with the gmp construction contract from tishman construction.
with building permit now in hand, structural demolition has commenced, and we will be delivering the finished project in 2023. leasing velocity at one vanderbilt has been strong since the third quarter and that velocity is carried into 2021 with the signing of two notable leases.
our pipeline at one vanderbilt includes three more leases in negotiation and four term sheets that are in advanced stages of discussion. so, we are currently 73% leases as we sit now. and at this pace, we are on a trajectory to meet or exceed our year-end estimate of 85%.
furthermore, our net effective rents that we're achieving on these deals during the pandemic for all signed and pending leases remain within our underwriting assumptions. there is no other building in manhattan enjoying this kind of success and it's very, very gratifying to see businesses respond in such a positive way to what we've constructed.
in keeping with our custom for abbreviated opening remarks on the january earnings call that follows the deep dive we take in our december investor meetings, we will open up the line now for questions. thanks.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of michael lewis with truist securities.
michael lewis -- truist securities -- analyst
great. thank you. marc, hearing you talk about the leasing activity, the pipeline, even the net effective rents at one vanderbilt, it feels different than a few months ago, right? so, you have this good leasing activity for the quarter, you had two or three press releases out separately about leasing. is there a change in psychology, you think, maybe as we get closer to bringing people back to the city? i guess in other words, this call feels different to me just in your brief remarks. does it feel lot different than a few months ago? are things really changing quickly on the ground or am i reading too much into this?
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
i think it's yes and no. as it relates to the leases, what we're closing out now are leases that we've been working on, i'd say, steve, maybe for three to six months.
steven m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
yes.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
so, while we are announcing them now and reviewing them now, this is, i would say, really since mid-summer. when the pandemic hit -- march, april, may -- everything just stopped. i think that's across everything. and then when we got to june, july, august, at least within our portfolio, we felt things start to pick up. and i think if you go back to maybe the october call, i think you would hear some of that occur in our call as it relates to the reemergence of people who had hit the pause button coming back because people are planning for 10-15 years out, not to next six to 12 months. and the initial activity was a lot of shorter dated renewal activity, that changed to longer-dated renewal activity. something i didn't mentioned in my remarks that is just occurring to me now is we also signed three significant deals over at 245 park as agent for hna owner. and the total of that square foot is probably also over 200,000 feet.
steven m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
220,000.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
220,000 feet. so, we did that as well. for us, it's like any other deal. we had to negotiate and get those across the finish line, which, well, we just did.
so, it's -- so in one sense, that leasing production you see has been developed and pent-up, i'd say, for the last six months. but in terms of psychology, you mentioned psychology and the feel of the market. yes, things -- i don't want to say feel better, but it feels like more than ever there is an exit strategy and a path to what the governor calls reconstruction; having -- in his words -- been through a war, which i guess it sort of feels like.
so, the psychology and i think the market vibe is much better. it's no longer talking to people who say, i'll be -- we'll be back next year. now, we're hearing and seeing schedules of move in dates that have already begun and will gradually ramp up through the summer to the point where there is an expectation that everybody will be fully vaccinated, restrictions will have been largely lifted and then there is some people who feel like there'll be a gradual rise from there, and there's others who feel like there'll be an explosive come back due to the lock-up of what was going on almost one year that when the all-clear signal is sounded that the resurgent won't be gradual, it'll be quite immediate.
so, yes, i'd say you probably hear a little hitch in our step. and also, as i said, we're really excited to be moving into one vanderbilt. so, that's sort of plays into everything, not just for what it signifies, but it really, i think, is at this stage in our cycle where everything we're focused on, on the investment side, pretty much revolves around new development.
it's very energizing and we want to be in the right space in order to kind of enhance that creativity even further than graybar and certainly anything more than you get sitting at home.
michael lewis -- truist securities -- analyst
great. thanks. you answered a couple of my questions there. i'm going to ask one that's maybe more of a housekeeping question then for matt. maybe i was hoping you could just break down that other income line item for me. what's in that $26 million that you recorded in 4q? how much was lease termination income and anything else material? i know in 3q, there was a legal settlement gain in there. but that number still was a little bit higher than maybe i was expecting.
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
yes, no problem. happy to do housekeeping. the balance at the end of the year, the $26 million recorded consistent with what we expected only over by about a $1 million. so, half of that number are the fees we alluded to, and then we're able to recognize in the fourth quarter related to the sale of the jv interest in one madison and the outright sale of 410 tenth.
so, we had fees that we had to wait till those deals closed to recognize. that was about half. we had no lease termination income in the quarter. and the bulk of the remainder of that balance was the somewhere between $6 million and $8 million a quarter that we recognize of third-party management fees, leasing fees, management fees, construction management fees, those types of things.
michael lewis -- truist securities -- analyst
okay, got it. thanks a lot.
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
yes.

our next question comes from rick skidmore with goldman sachs.
rick skidmore -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, marc. good afternoon. just following up on the return to office comments that you just made. what are the tenants that you have saying about their timing of the return to office? and then just a follow-up on the new leases that you've signed; how are the space configurations changing or not with those tenants regarding densification and desk hoteling, number of employees per square foot, etc.? thanks.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
well, as it relates to schedule, it's sort of all over the place. i'd say, consistently, the refrain is by middle to late summer back and back. unclear if that needs a 100% or certainly greater than 50%, but it's -- in their eyes it's end of work-from-home or the beginning of end of work-from-home at that point. and there are firms already moved into one vanderbilt and we have several hundred people a day that are occupying that building.
we see some occupancy increases after the new year in other parts of our buildings that got quite low in december. and it's -- i think it's hard to pinpoint anything more than to say, between now and mid-summer or late summer. i know that sounds like, well that's a long way away, but it's a blink of an eye, right? before you know, it will be in summer. and therefore, there will be a vibe. i'm confident that there will be a significant return by mid end of summer; and hopefully by end of summer, we are completely back, completely vaccinated and everybody will be celebrating the opening of our great new observation deck at the summit at one vanderbilt on october 21.
as it relates to configuration, steve, you want address that?
steven m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
well, i think you're hard pressed to really get good examples of people that have changed the design of their space for the long term. most of the people you talk to, the answer to the question is -- well, we're changing our furniture configuration for the next, for immediate reentry. what that generally means is taking the workspaces, spreading it more apart but ultimately planning to return to a densified environment, but not as dense as we were pre-covid. and you've heard us say that before that the trend of densification had already started to shift back to dedensification pre-covid. covid accelerated that trend. and the tenants who speak to architects, it's clear to me at least that long term we're still going to be in a densified world. it's just going to be not as much as it was before.
the other trend i will say is, there is a growing belief that tenants will want a greater amount of landlord-provided amenities. and we've certainly experienced that firsthand with the lease-up at one vanderbilt, because we have probably the single best amenity floor in the city right now, and that has been a huge bonus to our leasing effort in the building.
and i think you -- we've started to develop some of those concepts through our portfolio. i think you'll see us continue to do so in the years going forward, particularly as we rollout the development plan for one madison.
rick skidmore -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from manny korchman with citi.
manny korchman -- citi -- analyst
hey. good afternoon, everyone. marc, when you talk to the new york city retail environment, how long do you think we have to wait to see some green shoots there? is it a matter of getting everyone in and then those tenants that can reopen and make some money and also new tenants looking to expand start coming in? or do you think we might be able to see a little bit of that during sort of the early phases of reopening, as you laid out?
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
well, i mean, retail is a much tougher topic than i guess what we were just discussing to-date. it's going to, i think, lag substantially because a lot of the retail green shoots as you put it are going to be dependent on a return of leisure, hospitality and tourism; not all, but certainly a big part of it.
and right now, that is completely shut down. in fact, while there were 5,000 jobs added, office jobs added in december, there were 19,000 private sector jobs eliminated. and almost all of those jobs came out of the leisure and hospitality and restaurant industries, unfortunately, sort of, tragically.
so, that's going to take longer to come back. while the city is forecasting a return to pre-pandemic levels for office jobs, end of '21; they're not projecting a return of total private sector jobs until sometime in '23. so, you can see that's a pretty significant left, not insubstantial. so, i think that restaurants and retail will just lag. and i would say that while we've had some good success, so i wouldn't sort of buck the trend a little bit, but we did sign a good lease at one vanderbilt with one medical in the fourth quarter, i guess that was previously announced. and we have another deal pending, which hopefully will be a first quarter event.
the demand is still tepid and the environment isn't really quite right yet with all the restrictions, where i would say we're seeing any kind of forward momentum there.
manny korchman -- citi -- analyst
great, thanks. and i think in your opening remarks, you talked about stimulus for cities as sort of an important factor you're thinking about. if that stimulus doesn't come through, if there are delays in the stimulus or just it doesn't shape out, are you worried about sort of the longer-term health of cities like new york?
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
no, i mean, am i worried? it's something we focus on, so we're vigilant about it. but the city has balanced its budget for 2021 and 2022 fiscal year with the assumption of zero stimulus. so, the stimulus comes on top of what's already a balanced budget. the budget was balanced for 2021. obviously, in june of this year, you go to the new budget, '21 and '22. and through various means the city has managed to budget in a tough operating environment. i can't imagine that next years operating by will be as tough as the one we just went through.
they have attrition rules now. i think three attrition for every one new hire. they've made other cuts. fortunately, the personal income tax side of the equation is reportedly better than projected, so that is offsetting some of the property tax collection losses or reductions that the city is experiencing. and net-net, they have a plan to get it done at least through the middle of '22. that doesn't rely on any stimulus. so, you want to add to that?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
i would all say there's a lot of different forms of stimulus and infrastructure in new york city has more shovel-ready projects than anywhere else in the united states, and they're lobbying hard for the gateway tunnel and expansion of transportation and a bunch of other projects. so, that's another way stimulus could make its way to new york, not just through direct bailout funds if you will and changes in the tax code where there is a potential rework of the salt credit, state and local tax credit, which could also benefit residents of new york.
so, there are other ways you can see stimulus coming to the area and not just through the direct federal subsidies.
manny korchman -- citi -- analyst
thank you, both.
operator
our next question comes from alexander goldfarb with piper sandler.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. so, marc, just along those lines on the office restoration, i mean there are a bunch of things in there, right? it's not just getting the offices to reopening and employers telling the people to come back. there is what you guys have highlighted, which are the incentives. so, i don't know how many of your tenants are offering incentives to help their tenants or help the workers, ask them to come back. but there's also the city life, i mean you go into midtown and like half the restaurants, bars, everything that supports the office workers are scarce, are closed or heavily shut down. so, it's sort of a twofold -- plus you the mayor role. basically, the november mayor election is in june, because whoever wins that decides to follow-up the mayor. so, there is a lot of sort of unknowns and a lot of hindrances to getting the city fully back. so, beyond just the office, what's your view on the city doing its part to -- because midtown is empty from all the city life amenities that are on the street and beyond the landlord's control. so, how do you view that as opposed to optimistic comments that everyone is fully back in sort of q4?
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
well, again back in q3, q4, but it's still going to be low occupancy levels in q1 and probably even q2. some of the things, one program that the state has initiated -- it was part of the state of the state address if you heard. it's something called the safe offices pledge, where we and a number of other large owners took a -- made a commitment to set aside space within our buildings and in our portfolio to fully identify a range for a testing provider to operate out of that space and the tenants make arrangements in that space with that testing provider to have all their employees tested on as much as a weekly basis, if that's what they choose. and with the concept being that that's a first step to building the confidence level to get people back ahead of the time when everyone is fully vaccinated.
so, we support that. we endorse it. we've done something similar with our own employee base for months now. and we think that's the kind of thing that will help.
now, we've contacted every tenant -- at least every major tenant in the portfolio and mid-sized tenant portfolio -- and gave them the suite of incentives that we provide to our employees and tried to demonstrate to them how easy it is to implement these incentives and how well received they are, etc. and we're hopeful that companies will enact those incentives as a means of bringing people back.
but i will say, obviously, as we sit here between 10% and 15% total building occupancy, that has not yet taken hold and it may not until the third quarter. that just -- it just may be the case and we're hopeful that's not the case. and every time another firm comes back, it puts competitive pressure on the ones that haven't to get back also. and i do see more of that. but it's gradual, it's only january.
so, we think this is a trend that will take some time, but there are efforts -- and the reopening of restaurants, right? so, as of last night with heavy and vocal pressure being applied by the restaurant industry, and more importantly numbers that have improved in new york state since that spike as a result of the holidays, it looks like 25% into a dining either is or may be coming back or highly likely coming back next week, or at least that's what we're hearing yesterday and this morning, and hopefully that is the case.
and again, that's the start hopefully toward 50%. and i think all restaurant toward agree at 50% with outdoor, they can make a go of it. so, they're one step closer and everything will just have to build off itself.
i look at the reconstruction process as a nine to 12-month process, not something that's going to be the next month or two.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and then steve, at the investor day you made the comment in the q&a portion that, sort of, the easy part of your leasing job is done because the tenants who want to renew have renewed; the tough part is coming, which is backfilling the tenants who are leaving. and your comments were definitely striking.
so, just sort of curious, now that you're a few months further in, the vaccines are rolling out, do you still see the replacement of tenants who are vacating as sort of as challenging as you characterized at the investor day? is it the same, is it getting better, hopefully it's not getting worse?
steven m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
well, i think it's getting better, and maybe the statistics i'm going to give you proves that. of the 260,000 square feet of leases that we have, are either out for signature or in document negotiation. a 120,000 square feet of that are new tenants.
so, new tenants migrating into the portfolio, so almost 50-50 split between renewal and new tenants. which as we've -- as i also said or marc said at the investor conference, all we need is velocity in the marketplace, and we have a good enough portfolio and we have a good enough leasing team, and we are here every day working very hard. we're going to get more than our fair share of the deals that are in the market. so, as soon as tenants are out there, we'll feel the portfolio. we'll keep it full the way we have every year in the past.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay, thanks.

our next question comes from jamie feldman with bank of america.
jamie feldman -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you. with your view of things getting better, i'm curious what your thoughts are on the value-add acquisition market? where you think pricing is and will we start to see more capital step in? it seems like so many of the transactions have been high quality credit tenant, long-term leases. just curious where you think that market is right now?
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
well, i think the financing market is generally tightening up. cmbs spreads are in and there's more banks looking to lend. and i think that will drive that value-add market. the issue has been assets like for 410 tenth, which is fully leased, are getting the best bids because of in place income. but as lenders are willing to underwrite lease up again, i think you'll start to see that market get more liquid and start to have some pickup in activity.
jamie feldman -- bank of america -- analyst
i mean, would you -- did you pay cap rates at this point or what irrs are, or what people are looking for and how much capital is out there? is there a meaningful change in appetite people circling?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
i mean, cap rates on value add, you're saying as leased, so stabilized cap rate or --. going in cap rates are not a meaningful metric because there's large vacancy. i think people are underwriting to 10% to 12% irrs on value-add type opportunities, and i think that means they're probably leasing the assets to, my guess, is far between 5% and 5.5% cash on cost if they are taking lease-up risk going in; where, if they're buying in place income, it's more in that 4.5% to 5% range on average.
jamie feldman -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and then for steve -- thank you, by the way. and then for steve, you had mentioned financial and tech are about half of office demand in the city right now. how much of that would you say is expansion space? and i mean, are there large tech leases in the pipeline?
steven m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
well, our pipeline are you asking, or are you talking about just generally in the marketplace?
jamie feldman -- bank of america -- analyst
generally.
steven m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
well, i couldn't tell you how much in the overall market pipeline, how much of it is expansion or we're just replacing con. within our pipeline, i would say we're very heavily weighted toward financial services right now, and maybe a new growing trend that i'm starting to hear from sort of the early parts of searches is you're starting to see some of the law firms come back in the market as well, where they were very quiet last year.
what's -- the only market that's very slow right now is the advertising media portion of the market, but that's made up obviously by the tech side. so, this gives me the opportunity to sort of stress the point that i think is worth noting for everybody, which is, new york city's rebound will be driven by the fact that we have a very diversified tenant base as opposed to the west coast, which is sort of a one-trick pony. new york city has got because of what we've seen over the past couple of decades, technology, education, healthcare finance, media, and that diversification is going to be the strength of our rebound.
jamie feldman -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. thanks for your thoughts.
operator
our next question comes from john kim with bmo capital markets.
john kim -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you. marc, question on co-working. one of your peers took a stance yesterday with the writedown. today, the journal is reporting that wework is looking to go public, potentially get back. can you just remind us what your views of wework and co-working tenants are as a going concerned tenant?
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
i think we have -- what is it matt, less than 2% remaining?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
yes.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
less than 2% co-working, that was a strategic decision by us. i think the asset class is here to stay and there'll always be demand in the market for co-working type opportunities. we certainly love to see wework go public and is back or otherwise. i think it's a force that will always be around. we have our own fractional office space division, which has been around for 20 years or so. so, we're in the business ourselves. we just don't see it as a very large part of our portfolio.
john kim -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
as a follow-up, are they -- is wework current on rents? and how did rent deferrals and abatement trend this quarter versus last quarter and is that number excluded from your rent collection number?
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
well, as it tracks to gross rent collections, we're about between 95%, 96%?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
yes, on office we're actually at 97% and we calculated on gross contractual rents. so, we don't net out any deferral or abatement from that number. if they owed us $100 and we agreed that they only have to pay us $50 and they paid us $50, that's not 100%, that's 50%, that's how we calculate it. that's how we think everybody should calculate it.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
if we -- i think there's a lot of different ways that people seem to be doing this. if we express collections based on current contractual obligations, we'd probably be at like 98% to 99%.
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
that's correct.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
but we're not. we're -- to try and give people a look into collections today versus what the rent schedule was back in, let's call, jan, feb of last year, which i think is really the only meaningful metric; that's where that 97% office and overall 95%, 96% when you factor in retail, which is probably down around 80%
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
yes, correct.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
or thereabout?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
yes.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
that's the way we look at it. so, for somebody like wework, they are 100% current as far as i know on their current contractual. but that represents a modification that was done last year where we lowered the rent, gave a little bit of abatement in return for an enhanced security package to what was already a pretty robust security package.
now, it's in our eyes very well secured. we thought that was a good trade. we don't even look at that and there's always a concession. we think we upped the credit, which offset whatever those economic concessions were in their current -- all the economic concessions. so, that's one tenant in particular, but we've managed almost 900 tenants, many of them one by one if there are small business or retailers predominantly, but the vast majority of the portfolio are good credit rent paying tenants.
john kim -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
and as mentioned that the deferrals and abatements would trend down this year, is that still correct?
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes, they did. the bulk of the deals that were cut were done in second and third quarter. they've -- just a handful done since that time in the fourth quarter, and i'm not even aware of into '21.
steven m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
we've got some very small ones that were providing some additional deferral too, but nothing that really moves the needle. and we haven't done any abatement deals, certainly in the past six months, where we didn't get something on the trade, whether it was a part of a restructured lease, where we got a longer-term or enhanced security deposits or the tenants surrendered some capital contributions that we were required to make. so, even though the vast majority of any of the deals that we did were deferral deals, not abatement deals. on the few abatement deals that we did do, we got something for it.
john kim -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from steve sakwa with evercore isi.
steve sakwa -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks. i guess going back to the comment, marc, i think you talked about the pipeline being 700,000, which was up a little bit from december. i was just curious if you could give us kind of a broad break down of what was new in that? and what are renewals in -- are those renewals mostly 2021, or is any of that pulling forward in terms of '22 activity?
steven m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
well, boy, it's hard to really give you a specific answer to that, steve, only because the pipeline is very fluid from the week-to-week or month-to-month, so some of them as a result of deals that were signed, so it came out of the pipeline. others, deals just didn't make, but it was backfilled with nude shows that are in there.
i think the easiest way for me to answer is the way i answered it before. if you zero in just on the portion of the pipeline that is the leases that are out, which is 260,000 square feet of the 700,000 foot pipeline, half of that or almost half of that are new transactions and the other half are renewal deals. there are no significant deal -- there is one significant deal that's roughly 90,000 square feet in the deals pending portion of the pipeline. that is a new deal and that's a renewal deal. and that's a -- it would be an early renewal. other than that, it's kind of business as usual, attending to the '21 and the '22 expirations as we do every year at the beginning of the year.
steve sakwa -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay. and just as a quick follow-up, are you seeing any maybe non-economic lease terms changing, maybe tenants looking for maybe early exit right or termination rights? is there anything changing kind of maybe below the economics of the deal that we should be aware of?
steven m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
well, i mean, yes, it's no surprise as we've seen every time there is a major disruption in the marketplace when tenants go on the defensive, they value flexibility. so, whether that's shorter-term deals or an ability to expand in the near-term or expand mid-term or shed space mid-term or right of cancellation at some point, that becomes part of the conversation. and i'd say on the deals that are large enough to warrant that kind of flexibility, then we're meeting the market to do it. it's certainly not the vast majority of our deals.
so, if you're a tenant that's 5,000 or 10,000 square feet, you don't get that kind of flexibility. if you're a big tenant, you're taking multiple floors and you want to write to -- if i'm doing a 15-year deal with you, you want a write to shed some of the space 10 years out, we have that conversation with the tenant base for that rights. but -- by the way, as soon as the economy tightens up, those concessions will get running out of those discussions very quickly.
steve sakwa -- evercore isi -- analyst
right. that makes sense. okay, and maybe just second question on sublease space kind of in the more --
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
i don't know, we may call fallow on that one, steve. go ahead.
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
what do you got?

steve sakwa -- evercore isi -- analyst
while, just sublease space in general, just kind of in the new york city market and then maybe sublease within your portfolio, anything that's kind of come up lately that concern you in the market or things within your own portfolio?
steven m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
well, as you've read in the papers, there is a lot of space has been added to the availability in the sublease from subleases. but what is most interesting in that statistic is the amount of sublease available today is still below the amount of sublease space that was as part of the availability after 9/11, and as part of the availability during the financial crisis.
so today, 27% of the overall availability is sublease space, compared to that is 47% of the availability with sublease space during the dot com bust and 31% during the financial crisis. and what we see a lot of times is that tenants come, they double lot of space on the market, but then they rapidly pull it off the market as well when things start to improve.
so, you see a lot of tenants that will test the waters, and maybe they've got a big portfolio, and we are seeing this right now with a tenant in grand central that's putting 500,000 square feet on the market, but they've said also publicly they only intend to lease 200,000 to 250,000 square feet of it. so, it skews the statistics and creates the perception that may not be i think as bad as what you otherwise may think.
another point to make on that is that of the sublease spaces on the market, 40% of it has a term of four years or less, which does not make it competitive to direct space. so, i think it's important for people to understand that just because there's sublease space in the market that doesn't necessarily have the corresponding impact to the where rents are headed or where lease up velocity will trade on a direct basis.
steve sakwa -- evercore isi -- analyst

[operator instructions] our next question comes from blaine heck with wells fargo.
blaine heck -- wells fargo -- analyst
great. thanks, good afternoon. steve, can you talk a little bit about tis and free rent trends out there, especially since you guys were able to get some large long-term leases signed during the quarter, which it seems to be a rarity these days. so, any commentary on the concessions associated with those leases would definitely be helpful?
steven m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
i think it's sort of leveled off from -- in line with where we spoke about it during investor conference. i think free rent is up kind of 12 months pre-covid, now it's somewhere in the 14 to 15. and there are examples of extreme amounts of free rent beyond that. but by and large, it's up three or four months more than where it was pre-covid. and i think tis, if they were at 100 to 110 pre-covid, they're kind of in that 130 to 135. and if you're are very high price point building, then they are above that as well, above that number only because it's sort of proportionate to the rent you're paying. but i haven't sense that they've been increasing over the past month or two. they've sort of -- they spiked up in the fourth quarter. i think they've sort of held and i see no reason why they won't continue to sort of stay this way at least for the next quarter or two.
when you talk about net effective rents, which is interesting. we've said this on the last earnings call, we said at investor conference was face rents are not down that much. they're kind of down 5% to 7%, where the real trade has been on the concession side. and as you'd expect, during a time of disruption tenants play defense and they'll pay rent over the next 10 years, but they want their concessions upfront. they want to have their capital, and they want the landlord to pay the concession, so they don't have to come out of pocket.
blaine heck -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay, great. that's helpful. and then marc or maybe even steve can chime in on this one too. but marc, you talked a little bit about the timing on the reopening. but can you give us some commentary around how you expect the leasing decision process and timetable to play out for large tenants? i guess i'm wondering once tenants are physically back into the office, to whatever extent they will be, how long do you think it will take the business leaders to determine how work-from-home and hoteling or dedensification, all of those trends, how they're going to impact what their ultimate space requirements are going to be? and obviously, they typically can act on that until their expiration. but i'm more interested in that first assessments and planning and decision process and how long that could take?
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes, it's a hard question to answer, because there are some tenants and particularly the ones we're in dialog with now about opportunities in the next 12 to 18 months, we seem to have a pretty definite view on what they want to do. and most of those that have that point of view are the ones who are probably going to be completely or mostly work from office. so, there'll be issues around physical layouts and whether they want to increase workstations by foot or two, and whether they want to put up some kind of glass partitioning at workstations and other choices they will get in order to enhance air filtration and things of that sort. but by and large, i'd say there is a school of tenants that feel like they're going to be most are all back to work.
i don't labor under the illusion that work-from-home is a good thing. so, it's hard for me to answer this question. i think when i look at it, but i'm biased, i think everyone is going to be back to work, because those that work from home really solely to accommodate commutation issues or at least predominantly commutation issues, i think those firms will suffer competitively. it's not a question of spiritually is it better or not. i think it's a question of are firms more efficient, productive, capable and competitive if they are -- not just work from office, work from office is sort of just the tip of it. it's being on the road, developing relationships. business is just not conducted out of a home. and i don't see it happening that way. i know we could not have accomplished half of what we accomplished in the past 10 months if the entire workforce were home. it just would have been impossible given what we do in a given day, and we are not even a good example because there are other firms that really make their living off of customers where they have to be in the customer, entertaining the customer, meeting the relationship.
so, i just don't really see it for the bulk of the firms that we deal with. there is a reason why we have 900 tenants who have substantial square footage. there might be more flexibility, maybe it will be a four-day week and one day at home. may be some firms will, i guess, permanently go to homes. i know some of the tech firms have originally said they would, and now they're reconsidering it and we're hearing that they're not going to go 100% work-from-home.
so, i can't really tell you what that decision matrix is, only that the firms we're in dialog with tend to think there'll be predominantly work from office and want to be. for those that don't or aren't, we're probably not in dialog with those tenants is my guess. and whether businesses will work those things out over the next 12 to 18 months? i think they will. but as circumstances change, their decisions may change. and as they feel the need to be more competitive and to do what they want to do in order to be most efficient, i think they may come back to the center, which is why this market has 400 million square feet of office space.
work from home is not birth new out of the pandemic. i mean, it's something that's been around for years and years and has been tested and the technology this year was the same with last year and the year prior. it's just -- it's suboptimal, and i think most people would agree and those that don't will work-from-home.
blaine heck -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. appreciate the thoughts.

our next question comes from craig mailman with keybanc capital markets.
craig mailman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi, guys. we've just been hearing from a couple of private owners in the city that their tax assessments are coming in probably lighter than they expected. i'm just kind of curious if that is the experience that you guys are having this year and whether you think if you are that sustainable just given kind of the fiscal situation of the city?
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
well, i think the assessments have come out lower. the city hasn't set the mill rate yet. so, the question is, there is two components of the taxes, the assessment and then there is the mill rate. so, i would say we're reserving until we see where the mill rate shakes out.
craig mailman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thanks. and then just one house cleaning for matt. just the leases that you did at 245, is that going to lead to any outsized other income from just leasing fees in the first quarter?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
sure. lot of housekeeping. people must know what i do at home. it's, the 245 leasing we get paid commissions on, we do budget for that stuff coming into the year, so it will result in commissions that we recognize in other income, but nothing outside of what we had projected.
craig mailman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
so, if we had to kind of do a run rate quarter-over-quarter, should we assume a decent step down in that as the fees from the credit actions closing last quarter kind of go away?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
yes, good looking quarter-to-quarter. yes, i mean those fees recognized in the fourth quarter would not be replicated in the first. but as to the 245 park commissions or any other that's in that kind of $6 million to $8 million every quarter of fees we generate from our jv partners for managing and leasing.
craig mailman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
all right. thanks.
operator
our next question comes from vikram malhotra with morgan stanley.
vikram malhotra -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. matt, i'm not going to call it housekeeping or cleaning, i'll just call it model question, because you're the expert there. can you remind us what percent of bad debt reserve stake in the fourth quarter on the portfolio? and then, how should we anticipate potential additional reserves in '21 and potentially any reversals?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
yes, so in the fourth quarter -- i appreciate not going to housekeeping -- the reserves we took in the fourth quarter were about $6.6 million, between $6.6 million, $6.7million on ar, so actual receivable reserves, that's across the portfolio consolidated joint venture. we took no incremental reserves on straight line. so overall, reserves are down in total and roughly flat on the actual reserve -- around the actual ar.
trend this year, we leave some conservatism in our numbers historically and even more so in this environment for potential reserves. we can't project those forward, otherwise we'd have to take them now. so, i'll just say we put conservatism into our numbers for '21.
vikram malhotra -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, fair enough. and then just maybe another question just on the dpe book. i think the -- two parts to it. i think one, you took some losses, i believe, on retained positions. and i don't know if that was sort of just part of your quarterly cecl review. but also just your view of recovery in the market overall, can you talk about how you think dpe opportunities may trend for you in the balance of the year?
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
yes, i'll take the first part of that. that is part of the cecl review we do every quarter. we sold one position during the quarter, but that was at par, so we didn't have to take much remark there. the reserves on retained were part of cecl and they were on retained retail investments, and then i'll leave the opportunities question to either andrew or david.
andrew mathias -- president
well, we did -- on the goals and objectives -- talk about finding some interesting deployment opportunities in dpe to the tune of $100 million or so. and yes, i think we're starting to see that market materialize, where there are some interesting capital opportunities and we're definitely -- the shingle is still out and we're still evaluating opportunities and conveying that to everybody in the market, and i think we will see some very interesting opportunities hopefully in the early part of this year.
vikram malhotra -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from anthony paolone with jpmorgan.
anthony paolone -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thanks. i guess first question is for steve on one madison. can you talk about just activity there, put brackets around maybe what types of requirements you're seeing in the market back to line up with that asset?
steven m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
yes, i mean, we've got a couple of tenants that we are in early conversation with. but let's remind everybody that the process for marketing a large development like that is we start with educating the brokerage community, then we go after the tenants, then we ultimately see the deals.
i think we're ahead of schedule as far as the level of tenant inquiries about the building, and we're feeling really strong about the feedback that we're getting from both the brokers and the tenants that we presented the building to with regards to the product that we're offering, the development plan that we've got and the timing of delivering the building at the end of '23, which i think is going to be sort of like write-offs. spot on is the perfect time to deliver or be blocked off the best space in midtown town.
anthony paolone -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. and then i guess just one question for matt. is there a way to think about, you mentioned in the last, i think, question around the reserves and stuff in there. i think you had 95% of collections roughly in the quarter. is there a way to think about what was recognized like in your noi for ffo purposes, like is it some number in between what you collected and what it was actually scheduled or --?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
there's no easy way to correlate it. so, the answer to question is no. the numbers that run through your income statement reflect straight line. they smooth out deals that you've done. so, collections are definitely correlated to cash noi and our cash flow, but you're not as likely to find a good correlation in the earnings side to collections.
anthony paolone -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay, fair enough. thanks.
operator
our next question comes from nick yulico with scotiabank.
nick yulico -- scotiabank -- analyst
thanks. first question is just going back to the expirations this year. if you had just a sense for kind of how many of those you feel confident about getting renewed at this point? and then also just kind of relating it back to -- i know you had the 93% same-store occupancy goal for this year. and how that factors into that as well?
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
well, i think the answer is the same to both questions, which is there are no surprises with regards to lease expirations this year. no new surprises beyond what we already have in our budget. everybody that has a lease expiration for this year and next year, we're in deep dialog with. we have, i think, very good clarity as to who is likely to stay and who is likely to go, and there has been no change in our expectation since the investor day when we rolled out our renewal goal and objective for the year.
nick yulico -- scotiabank -- analyst
and i guess just in terms of just relating it back to again kind of holding occupancy somewhat flat for the year, does that mean that you just assume a very high retention rate? is there anything in terms of vacancy being filled up in the portfolio we should think about?
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
it's a combination of both of those things. so, when we looked out over our leasing of 1.3 million square feet, there is a good portion of that that is renewal. what is not could be leased up later this year or into next. but offsetting that additional vacancy is the lease up of vacancy that we recognized this year. so, we had some vacancy at 45 lexington, as example, or 1185 that came in 2020 and early '21, that's getting leased up later in '21 such that at the end of the year you remain roughly flat.
nick yulico -- scotiabank -- analyst
okay, thanks. that's helpful. i guess just the last question is on marc going back to the idea about -- you seem positive about the work environment saying people now on -- businesses not wanting to work-from-home. i guess i'm wondering, are you actually actively spending time sort of surveying a broad piece of the corporate america on this topic? or is a lot of that based on sort of what you said where you're talking to people and that's what they're telling you, but maybe missing some of the other conversation? just trying to understand how kind of what's backing this confidence level that you have?
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
well, i mean, in terms of surveying, the partnership i think has done one or two surveys of all the businesses in new york. but that was last year and that was more to get a sense of timeline for return as opposed to what go-forward new program would be.
so, my data points, my survey are discussions with tenants in our portfolio, period. i mean, that's -- we have, like i said, 900 tenants. we uniquely cover the gamut from small tenants to the largest, most affordable rents to the highest premium rents and everything in between.
so, i feel like, man if we don't have a good handle on a cross-section of new york city business and tenants, then shame on us. but -- because that's a pretty good pool of -- a sample pool, if you will, to get a sense of what businesses thinking about new york city.
and there is very few conversations i have where companies are saying to me, we're going to go work entirely from home or predominantly from home or even half from home. so, to your point and maybe people will tell me what they -- i think they want to hear. i mean, i can't -- it's not a scientific survey, it's more anecdotal, but it's many months of many conversations. and all i can say is that the preponderance of those conversations go anything like this -- we can't wait to get back, we're dying to get back; this work-from-home sucks. i mean, i can go on and on.
i'm trying to think of people who say, ""boy, we're just never going to return to the office. we're going to keep a large --."" i don't-we don't have it. i don't see it. so, is that the case in california or silicon valley? i can't tell you. is that the case for tenants not in our portfolio? can't tell you.
but with the large and small and medium sized financial institutions, small business that really needs to have a presence here or they become irrelevant, which is the majority of our portfolio at least by number of tenants, right? the dynamic system and the action i think happens within the city, i don't think it happens at home. so, i'm also going a bit on my own gut instinct 30 years in the business, and i have a point of view and i think that's hopefully an educated point of view that by and large when the all-clear signal is, people will return.
now, might there be 5% or 10% that either going to work from home or works on some kind of a hoteling basis? yes, possible. but might not space requirements on a space per employee basis go up by 5% or 10% to kind of de-densify, which we have dedensified, right? so, we're not that unique. so, if we took our footprint that was designed pre covid, went back dedensified it by about 5% or 10%, i don't see why everyone is not going to do that. and everyone who asks us for advice on it, we give them our program, which is a 5% or 10% densification, whether they follow it or not.
so, i guess i'm thinking that those two things will largely offset and we'll be in good shape once we get past this period of time. but it's not a survey. it's certainly not national and it's quite possible that i'm missing the voices of people not in the portfolio.
nick yulico -- scotiabank -- analyst
all right, thanks. appreciate the color, marc.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
thank you. all right. so, i think with that, we are at the end, just right after 3:00 on the nose. so, thank you for whoever still made it to the end and listening, and let's hope for better times ahead and looking forward already to having some good results to put up on the board in april.

marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. after a year defined by lockdown, closures and restrictions, new york city is now undergoing a vast reawakening. businesses, restaurants, and hotels are reopening and restrictions are being eased. the leisure in hospitality industry is starting to bounce back as domestic tourism is increasing in manhattan. 100,000 jobs have been regained over just the last three consecutive months, during the first quarter of this year. leasing volumes for the period january through march were higher than any quarter since the outset of the pandemic, these are just some of the signs indicating a robust and perhaps, unprecedented recovery is under way.
the cycle of a sharp downturn, followed by large monetary stimulus, followed by increased business activity and profitability and ultimately followed by increased demand for office space is a familiar one, and one we believe will once again be played out during this recovery. just about every company we've spoken within our portfolio is making firm plans to have their workforces return to the office sometime between june and september of this year. big new york city employers like google, bloomberg, amazon, and jp morgan have reversed course and have set hard dates for return to work this summer or even sooner upon workers being vaccinated in certain cases.
leading the way, mayor de blasio has called back 80,000 new york city government workers to city offices on may 3rd, it's right around the corner. with the goal of 5 million people vaccinated by june, employers will have every expectation of seeing their employees back in action and working together. while some employers will undoubtedly experiment with a hybrid workplace model, giving employees the option of working one or possibly two days away from home, i believe this will be at first limited in practice and over time will become even less and less prevalent. i think we have a bright future for new york city office properties because we have the most important thing and that's a growing successful business space in a diversified economy.
last year, wall street firms made $51 billion, that's the second-highest profit ever recorded since the date it was first kept over 30 years ago. the first quarter big five bank profits were up 163% year-over-year and the technology sector in new york is absolutely booming. this rising momentum resulted in our leasing 178,000 square feet during the first three weeks in april, bringing our year-to-date leasing results to 530,000 square feet putting us well on track to meet or exceed our 1.3 million square foot goal for the year and one vanderbilt is front and center in these results.
i couldn't be more pleased with the way one vanderbilt turned out, it exceeded all expectations and it's just simply a wonderful addition to the east midtown and to the new york city skyline. a very special building that is resonating with tenants and establishing a blueprint for the future of sustainable development in new york city. east midtown needed this development and it is sparking a wave of new development projects all throughout east midtown, the number one business submarket in new york city.
earlier this morning on squawk box i announced 35,000 square foot lease at one vanderbilt that was signed last night at 10:30 p.m. to be exact, and moments after i went off air, we signed another 17,000 square feet this morning, bringing total building occupancy at one vanderbilt to 77%.
as we are trading paper on another six deals that ova, we expect to achieve 90% lease status by the end of the year, which is much faster than originally projected and higher than our goal for the year of 85%. the success we are having with one vanderbilt is an enormous endorsement for our development at one madison, which we are now well under way with. the one madison project will be the only project in midtown, midtown south delivering in 2023 to offer the desirable combination of well-designed, parked front, new construction on an amenity package to arrive at one vanderbilt and direct subway access. project completion is scheduled for more than 30 months from now, but we nonetheless have good activity from tenants in the market who have shown significant interest in this new development.
we are about to experience the confluence of low-interest rates, approximately $100 billion of federal stimulus, making its way to new york over the next 12 to 18 months. surging financial sector, significant business activity upward swinging, hiring trends, and a gradual lifting of covid era restrictions. that's a recipe for what could be a truly explosive recovery in new york city. and sl green is well-positioned to meet the growing tenant demand and develop the future of new york city.
so with that, we'd like to open it up for questions on the quarterly release that we sent out last night.

[operator instructions] your first question today comes from the line of alexander goldfarb with piper sandler. please proceed with your question.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. i guess, marc first because you mentioned stimulus coming to the city. one of the big issues has been, obviously, in excess of folks for lower tax climates more regulatory friendly. so maybe you could just offer some of your own thoughts on how we should think about the $4 billion in tax increases is albany [phonetic] past. the fact that we're peeling the salt would be sort of a tough hurdle because it's really a tax give away for the 1% and then obviously there is potential that a reimposition of the amt would sort of mitigate that to the middle class. so how do you think about what's going on the political scene versus your comments about employers trying to bring people back and how that plays as far as new york going forward?
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, a much more optimistic on the sold cap repeal. it has bipartisan support senator schumer and send majority with the schumer has i think made a very big point about needing to and wanting to repeal the sold cap, not just for new york, but for all the states that were affected by what essentially is a double taxation. tom suozzi has the build out there with a lot of support is on both sides of the aisle. and whether or not amt is a part of that, that's a separate question, but the sold cap affected much more than 1%. this is not a 1 percentage. this is a much wider swath of individuals in predominantly blue states that are now subject to double taxation. and i think in accordance with what could be coming out of washington, with some potential increases for taxes, i do think a sold cap repeal is on the table. and i think would go a long way toward mitigating some of the tax increase that was just passed.
so nobody wants a tax increase, i mean, that's for sure, but i do think that notwithstanding that tax increase, new york will have to just step up even more in providing reasons for people to be in what's consider i think still one of the most dynamic and diversified places to live and work. and regardless of my particular feelings on the matter, condo sales in march were at very, very high levels. we see occupancy gains in multifamily, we see commercial leasing gains, as i mentioned earlier and we just see a general come back in new york.
so the tax increases are unfortunate, because they were aggressive not progressive. but i think there hopefully is effort under way in washington to bring some level of equity and fairness to those that are now subject to double taxation, which is like i said, a lot more than 1% of the populous, and that's what we're all hoping for.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and then second question and i don't know if you want this or durels wants this, but this morning on squawk you mentioned the rent spreads and that the premium buildings are holding up, and obviously there has the degradation on the older stock. just sort of curious what that spread is, and if your view is and maybe steve toward prospective tenants, that we're going to see a bigger shift in the rent levels between the newer modern buildings that are more efficient versus the older ones and how that may play out well?
steve m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
well, what marc said this morning i think holds true, which is that our commodity product you've seen face rents dropped somewhere between 5% to 10%, but in the better quality buildings, the highly redeveloped or new construction buildings, face rents have held. as -- and if you use one vanderbilt as a barometer of that, as we are rapidly leasing up, we are actually pushing rents in this building.
there is clearly been a large shift in tenant demand toward the better quality product, and that doesn't necessarily just new construction, it means better quality product at all price points, and we see it throughout the portfolio. so whether it's one vanderbilt avenue, because if it's a particularly unique asset that checks all the boxes for what people aspire to in a modern workplace, or in our better-quality buildings, like a 100 park avenue, or 461 fifth or 10 east 53rd street, we've got good leasing traction in those buildings.
and more of the commodity buildings that for those owners that haven't invested in their buildings, which are really not -- you couldn't say that about anything in our portfolio, but for those owners in the marketplace that haven't invested and haven't been of forward thinking, they are ones that are going to suffer.

your next question comes from the line of michael lewis with truist securities. please proceed with your question.
michael lewis -- truist securities, inc. -- analyst
great, thank you. you talked about reasons for optimism on the demand side. i wanted to ask a question about supply and this -- new york had always been a barrier to entry market. you've got a great chart in your investor presentation, showing how the net new supply in new york city hasn't grown for many years, but now we kind of entered the age of hudson yards. you built one vanderbilt, and now it seems like there's this new wave of -- to meet that high-end demand you're talking about, now we'll be talking about the penn district, we'll be talking about towers on 11th avenue. i saw the grand hyatt now has a plan for a potential super-tall skyscraper. how do you kind of think about that high-end demand that you just talked about versus the supply that seems to be coming to meet it?
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, the -- first i think what you're seeing is a number of projects now being announced in east midtown area, where the pendulum sort of swing back to midtown, where there was a lot of leasing velocity in the first quarter, relative to almost every other commercial sub-market, and i think that's very healthy. i mean, you talk about a project like the grand hyatt, that project, i think is sort of a best case delivers in seven years and possibly more. so the optimism i expressed in my opening commentary really is reflective of my outlook over the next 12 months, 12 to 18 months for the most part, in which i don't think there is any new construction being delivered in midtown east, but i'm just looking around the room here, is there any.
so i would say, at least through '22, nothing. in '23, you'll have one madison, which is the point i was trying to make in the opening commentary, is that will be one of the only new construction projects in 2023 for delivery in midtown, midtown south of any scale. and projects like grand hyatt, like some of the other more recently announced projects on the west side, i think you're looking at six, seven years plus. so i don't want to diminish the importance of that because inventory is inventory, but you've heard me say before, i'm not against growth. i mean, i think growth and regeneration of the commercial stock is a good thing because it gives tenants options, those that want to pay more for state-of-the-art office, and those that want to be in the value part of the spectrum, but there -- these are all market rate deals. there is no government subsidy like you had with hudson yards.
so that again, all we ever escort it is that it'd be a fair competition for tenants, because subsidy is what distorts that and on a fair playing field we feel that one vanderbilt, one madison, and some of the other developments we have currently under way are both timely, because they're near-term, because we went forward in 2019 and 2020, very difficult time, but we went forward to make sure that we'll be able to deliver this product at a time when we think we'll have good demand, and not a lot of competition. so that's how -- that's sort of the basis for our near-term outlook.
michael lewis -- truist securities, inc. -- analyst
thanks.
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
you also have to always balance supply against private sector job growth. office using growth which pre-pandemic there was office using growth to absorb all the new supply i mentioned. and we expect as that growth returns, there'll be a need for more office inventory.
michael lewis -- truist securities, inc. -- analyst
great, thanks. and then my second question is about, i guess, net effective rents and what it takes to get deals done in the current environment. i think, the deals you signed this quarter seven months free, $60 in capital is about -- is roughly a year of rent and that's on deals with an average term a little less than six years. how should we look at that and signing deals now versus -- in the apartment sector i think we've seen some people try to take inventory off the market, and try to weight this out a little bit. what are your thoughts on kind of the deals that are getting done now and the pricing, and how that might look six months or nine months from now?
steve m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
well, i think as we sit here today, i'm a strong believer -- we are strong believers that the market has stabilized as far as where net effectives are. the concessions, we're not seeing is increasing. they are brutal right now, they are historic high as far as the amount of concessions go, but i think over the past 90 days they've clearly stabilized. we're not doing more ti or more free rents for new tenants coming into the market, as opposed to what then we were doing at the depth of pandemic.
so, i think, we've seen the worst of the of the rents erosion. and i think at this point we're bumping along the bottom and waiting for a turn back up. with regards to holding space off the market that's never been our philosophy in the 20 something years that we've been a public company. we're a strong believers. we have a large portfolio. we keep the portfolio full. we meet the market as necessary. and if that gives up a little bit of opportunity in the short-term, we'll catch it on the next wave, because we've got plenty of well-staged expirations. we don't suffer any one year where all of our space comes back to us on exploration. we are very careful stewards about how we manage our lease expiration so that in every single year we try to make it as even as possible or as level as possible so that if there is an uptick in rents we'll ride that wave when it gets here.

your next question comes from the line of john kim with bmo capital markets. please proceed with your question.
john kim -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon. i had a question on the permanent financing at one vanderbilt, which is reportedly imminent. and i know you mentioned it's a little bit in your press release yesterday, but can you comment on the use of proceeds of the capital being returned back to sl green? and also how does the bank lenders view the loan to value of the financing?
andrew w. mathias -- president
the second part, we're targeting around a 60% loan to value loan. the final structure and proceeds of the loan are not set. the real deal article this morning was inaccurate in many respects. and in terms of use of...
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
use of proceeds, it's not that will be for other debt repayment. so we will -- we had bonds maturing over the summer. we had revolver balance, we'll take out existing debt with the proceeds from the new debt on one vanderbilt. and we hope to have that closed in the -- we're targeting the second quarter.
john kim -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
on that revolver balance, matt, you drew down $520 million on it this quarter which didn't seem like it was necessary given the cash balance you already had. can you just provide some color on that?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
yeah, the biggest component of that is we unencumbered 885 third avenue, it's about a $300 million mortgage.

your next question comes from the line of steve sakwa with evercore isi. please proceed with your question.
steve sakwa -- evercore isi -- analyst
yeah, thanks, and good afternoon. maybe, steve, could you touch on the leasing pipeline and how it's kind of changed over the last couple of months and maybe the composition of tenants and what you're seeing in terms of expansions, any contractions stand the same space configuration?
steve m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
sure. right now, it's a pretty diversified group of tenants that we're dealing with, i'd say, if it's heavy in one sector, it's financial services. seems to be particularly active, but more activity than we've seen in prior couple of quarters from law, insurance. we've got a couple of sizable deals with tech tenants. so kind of a broad swath of tenants, but not so dissimilar if we've had this conversation three to six months ago where we don't see a lot of activity is media type business, advertising firms and media businesses they're still kind of on the sidelines. but i think most of the other businesses that we historically have dealt with they're back in the market and some of them are clearly expanding the financial service guys, the hedge funds, the private equity guys clearly expanding. the law firms that we're dealing with, some are expanding, some are consolidating locations. and there is a good chunk of tenants that are relocations, new tenants coming into the portfolio.
and i think how they're going to use their space, it's a great question to everybody ask. is covid really changed the way people are using the space. and the short answer is, not so much they're programing more square footage per employee, they're programing more amenity, more meeting space, greater diversity on size of meeting rooms, the spaces are flexible, but i don't see those as earth-shattering changes.
so, i think, ultimately, if you talk to these people about what they're planning in the long-term, ultimately, everybody will still be in a fairly dense world, although, not nearly as dense packed as we were pre-covid. and we'll still be in an open plan work environment and i think that's here to stay.
steve sakwa -- evercore isi -- analyst
and sorry, do you just have a size of the pipeline today versus maybe three months ago just to help kind of frame it out?
steve m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
yeah, we're at 760,000 square feet of pipeline, comprised of 217,000 square feet or 220,000 square feet of leases outs in some form of negotiation. and another 525,000 square feet of term sheets that we think have a good chance of converting over to lease.
steve sakwa -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. and then maybe, marc, just on kind of dispositions. i know you've talked about $1 billion goal and likely may be exceeding that. can you just talk about your plans for dispositions the rest of the year and the share buyback program?
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, we have a -- i'd say, we have a pretty ambitious program ahead of us that i think was pretty well documented back in december. and as we sit here in april having done some exploration, investigation, pre-marketing, we think we're going to get a lot of stuff done. we just announced those two residential deals. we just closed tower 46. obviously, at the end of december, we had that big sale of 410 tenth. and there is a couple of sizable joint venture situations we're looking at. so not everything is going to be in the form of an asset disposition. we have certain assets that we feel have long-term upside and warrant more of a jv execution in there are some that you'll see we'll bring to market for harvesting. so we are still -- we're good with the number, we'll probably feed that number for sure. and matt can respond to the share repurchase question.
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
yeah, i would say on the heels of what marc said about testing the market and getting a feel for the market and putting some assets out maybe more than we originally anticipated. we're now looking at a targeting debt repayment for some of the proceeds from those asset sales along with the share repurchase program. we did $100 million of share repurchases in the first quarter. a lot of these sales that we have teed up will close in the latter half of the year, so you'd see the volume of buybacks coincide with that. but we're balancing any additions to the pipeline of dispositions allocating those proceeds, debt repayment as well.
steve sakwa -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it, thanks.

your next question comes from the line of manny korchman with citi. please proceed with your question.
manny korchman -- citigroup -- analyst
hi, everyone. you talked about the split between the higher class assets and maybe some of the older less high-class stuff, what do you think happens with the class c or class b product? is that conversions like we've seen in the past? is it that those owners do step it up and put in a capital and make it look more like an a or somewhere in between?
andrew w. mathias -- president
i think it's primarily affordable rent product. i mean, you do have a lot of businesses in new york that can't afford high-end class a products. so it becomes affordable rent or it may get repurposed and converted other uses. but, i think, for the most part, it's going to stay as affordable rent product.
steve m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
those owners will -- they'll suffer on execution they just won't get the same rents by comparison to the better located, better capitalized landlords that have repositioned their product.
michael bilerman -- citigroup -- analyst
it's michael bilerman, marc, or andrew, or matt, just in terms of ova with the refinancing, what is the potential for your partner to perhaps use those excess proceeds to buy more of the project from an equity perspective. so lowering your stake from 70 down to 50 or something below. and then can you also just remind us of the math rounding marc and andrew sort of profit participation 2.5% to 3% and whether that gets triggered at all now that you're going to do the permanent financing closer to stabilization and do you have to start recording that liability on sl green's balance sheet?
andrew w. mathias -- president
well, we'll let matty take the second question.
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
i'll work in reverse order. there is nothing that would trigger putting anything on the balance sheet related to marc and andrew's investment triggered by the refinancing.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. recall we paid for those interests.
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
yeah.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
we own our interest in when the project starts to cash flow and the capital has been returned we have our sort of pro rata interest alongside the rate in those, but -- just as a reminder of how that works. the other question....
andrew w. mathias -- president
so the part of a buying on recap or purchasing a portion of our interest, it's too early. i mean, we're not marketing any of our 71% at this time. it's on goals and objectives for the year to evaluate in the future, but the goal is to close the most efficient and most secure in terms of tenure, put away financing as possible in the next 45 days or so.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, in terms of a strategy for selling down interest in the future if we want to, i think it would be -- i mean, sure the existing partner in concept could do it, might have an appetite for it, but i also think it would be one of the most liquid assets of any asset in new york city. so i think the source of the money in the identity investors is secondary to a strategic decision by us, whether to hold the existing position or sell down further.
andrew w. mathias -- president
also recall, our partner on one vanderbilt did become our partner on one madison as well.
michael bilerman -- citigroup -- analyst
one madison, that's right, yeah.
andrew w. mathias -- president
they might have anticipated getting proceeds. they were obviously pleased with how this deal went, pleased enough to be a significant part of the next deal. so...
michael bilerman -- citigroup -- analyst
okay. and then, andrew, can you just clarify just in terms of the new financing on ova? obviously, it's a substantial part of your initial construction costs, and you just talked about a 60% ltv, which i guess at a 235 [phonetic] would put in about $4 billion. i know you've been talking about a value of ova of like $4.4 billion to almost $5 billion at the most recent investor day based on that 2025 noi stream and applied cap rates. so i know there's lender values, there are your own values, but i'm just trying to get a perspective of the underwriting of this loan to the noi streams and leverage levels?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
michael it's matt. so we'll talk more about the financing, when we get it done in the next 45 days. i will say andrew made the point earlier, there is press out there that is inaccurate. just to be clear as to where we stand. we did forward starting swaps totaling $2.25 billion in anticipation of financing that is in excess of that. we haven't said what the proceeds level will be. there are various rumors out there about what it is, it will be 60% financing whatever the number is and when that's finalized and announced, we'll discuss it in more detail.
michael bilerman -- citigroup -- analyst
okay. thanks, matt.

craig mailman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey, guys. could you just give a little bit of color on what tenant was behind the lease term fees this quarter?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
it was retail location, at&t location at 590 fifth avenue, property we just acquired recently.
craig mailman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
and then just an update on -- you guys gave when most tenants are coming back, but just has the utilization in your buildings picked up at all as people have been getting vaccinated or where does that stand currently?
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think the -- the return to office, i don't think is going to be random or in a haphazard format. the companies we're speaking to which really drive the bigger companies that drive the population within our portfolio, are very forward looking in terms of what their protocols are going to be for return to office. really the earliest we're hearing from anybody at the moment is may, june and with what i would say vast majority by september.
so i think that the relevant time period to look at those stats are going to be between june and september, as you'll see it start ramping up, and it's april, i don't think we've had some uptick, but not material. and it wasn't planned. i mean, we've -- assuming we are in dialog with every tenant we surveyed our tenants, we have schedules of what tenants are telling us when they're moving in, and i think they are on track with their plans. but most of those plans are not for an april return.

your next question comes from the line of jamie feldman with bank of america. please proceed with your question.
jamie feldman -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great, thank you, and good afternoon. so i wanted to focus on the debt and preferred equity book and just any kind of distressed opportunities you guys might be seeing in the market today. so could you talk about maybe the health of the book or do you expect to see -- to get any health back anytime soon? and then how are you thinking about distressed buying here?
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
question with health of the existing book. dave why don't you...
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, i think we haven't taken any credit marks recently against and i think we're very comfortable with the assets we have. where they're marked there may be an opportunity to, i would say, accretively take in one or two of the assets, but there is nothing that we're seeing out there that's real distress in our own book. i think likewise there are a few opportunities out there. i think a lot of distress out there is mostly in the hotel sector. i think office has held up, you've seen with our portfolio rents have been paid and collected. retails obviously had a little bit of distress, but a lot of the guys who've made made it through kind of the toughest part are now being positive and seeing kind of the upswing and a lot of the lenders have worked with them.
so new york is a very strong institutional market with good sponsorship and there aren't usually tons of distress. i think we've done well finding there's one or two assets out there, which we continue to look for.
jamie feldman -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
all right, thank you. and then, we have a mayor election coming up. i'm just curious to get your thoughts on kind of what you think are the most important initiatives for the next candidate or the next mayor to kind of get right for new york city?
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, the most is probably 10 most important initiatives. but i think you'd have universal agreement among many that addressing homelessness, and vagrancy and quality of life issues which degraded somewhat during the pandemic, in part -- in large part because the streets weren't full and the mass transit nodes weren't full. and i think a lot of that will be self-correcting when people are back and everything is back up to 100% utilization and there is life on the street, not just on weekends or not during the day, but at all hours of the day. i think that has a tendency to be -- to deal with that issue along with tremendous amount of effort now the city is starting to put behind. more ambitious efforts to get things cleaned up and get things put on the right track, so that the city at large can feel safe and good about being out at day-night and work and commuting.
so i think for an incoming mayor candidate, i think that's the number one issue on my mind because that's what everybody wants, whether you're a business owner, tenant, landlord, a resident, commuter, i mean, everybody wants to feel safe at all times.
i think it's imminently achievable. i think the nypd is still considered the best security for us in the country and for any municipality, for any police force. and i think that they've gone through a lot of changes and reformation, and we have to get back to a point where there is a balance between keeping everyone safe, secure and also making sure that people aren't unduly infringed on the other side. so hopefully the next mayor will have a solution to working with the police force to make that happen.
jamie feldman -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
all right, thank you.

your next question comes from the line of derek johnston with deutsche bank. please proceed with your question.
derek johnston -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi, everybody. thank you. do you expect lease termination income for the rest of the year to dry up? given that first quarter's $10.5 million surpassed full-year '21 guidance of $7.4 million. and i guess secondly, like what change that drove the ramp in first quarter versus the december expectation guidance.
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
so when we come out with guidance every year, we basically just look at historical trends in lease termination income and put a number in there. the historical trend has been $7 million to $8 million a year. we have no visibility into that for the year. sometimes we exceeded and oftentimes, we've come in below it. we had -- we did not have visibility into this termination that happened in the first quarter when we put out guidance in december. it does exceed our full-year number by $3 million, but there is no way to tell what the remaining nine months looks like.
as of now, we don't have anything in the pipeline, so it could be zero. but there could be somebody comes in next week and wants to pay us to get out of somewhere else. so it doesn't cause us to rethink guidance levels or anything like that, it's only $3 million and we'll have to see how the rest of year plays out.
derek johnston -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay, i know. thank you. that's fair. and as i look at on space 350,000 square feet of leasing looks pretty strong, especially emerging from the pandemic. i'm actually going to say it is strong but -- and someone else on the call mentioned starting rents of just $57.16 so i kind of went back and looked at it, i mean this is the weakest since 4q '13 and then the tis and the free rent incentive packages, these are the highest they've been since we've been keeping track. so, i guess, do you guys expect these levels of concessions and low rent to kind of remain in order to achieve the lease volume guidance you gave in december?
steve m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
well, let's -- there's one other thing you left off of that observation which is, first quarter was strong. the start of the second quarter has been blistering, 178,000 square feet signed in the first three weeks, i think, is one of our strongest quarters in quite a while. and then when you look at the rents in the concessions, you really need to break it apart because, on our renewal product, we've done a bunch of deals that have been net effective deals. so the rents were kept low or they were netted down by concessions.
but then on the other hand, if you look at deals in our higher price point buildings one vanderbilt, in particular, where the rents range between -- anywhere between $135 to $220 plus a square foot, you would expect the concessions to be disproportionately high relative to -- given the high level of rents that we're achieving in the building.
so i think we have to -- to properly answer the question, we'd really have to slice and dice the portfolio for you to say, what are we doing on renewals, what are we doing on commodity buildings, what are we doing on the high price point in ours -- where a lot of our recent leasing has been done particularly at one vanderbilt with big rents and appropriate concession packages that can skew the numbers that you've seen in any particular quarter.
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
and i'm just going to add to what steve said. so $57 is not on the full 350,000 that was done, that's just on the mark-to-market leasing, which is only 180,000 of the 350,000. on the full, 350,000, 330,000 of that is at a $65 rent. and the remainder is at one vanderbilt, which is excluded from the number and it's in the range that steve was talking about, well into...
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
so i just want to repeat that, that's an important. forget about -- mark-to-market is its own world of sub-category of the leasing. but if we're talking about 300,000 it include one vanderbilt. if we're talking about 350,000 square feet of leasing, which was the question, what was the blended rent on the 350,000?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
well, you're going rent around 70 bucks a feet.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
70 bucks. so i think, what you have there is just a little bit of a mixing and matching apples and oranges. that's what i was looking for, apples and oranges, where you're looking at the rent on a subset of 350,000 not the entire 350,000. and, boy, you stood me up because i was saying, wow, how this was that lower either, so i had matt, pull it. it looks like actually the blend on that 350,000 with 70 bucks and that's -- i'm not saying that that's -- your question remains, what's that trend and where our rents head and everything, but i don't want to leave the call with the impression that our average rent for the quarter was $57.
derek johnston -- deutsche bank -- analyst
right. thank you. it's very, very helpful.

your next question comes from the line of vikram malhotra with morgan stanley. please proceed with your question.
vikram malhotra -- morgan stanley -- analyst
afternoon. thanks for taking the questions. matt, maybe just first one, you talked a lot about, obviously, the one vanderbilt leasing has gone well 90% target. can you remind us what the gaap ffo contribution is for this year and how should we -- what we should anticipate for the next? i think was about $30 million this year, if i'm not wrong, but if you can give us more color on that, that'd be really helpful, given your 90% target.
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
yeah, just bear me one second. i know the gaap noi, our share for one vanderbilt was about $7 million for the first quarter and i think your recollection is about right, about $30 million, thereabouts for the full year, on a gaap basis. obviously, on a cash basis, it's going to be significantly lower. it was negative for the first quarter because a lot of the tenants are in free rent periods when they move in and the leases we're executing now won't even be an occupancy until into 2022.
vikram malhotra -- morgan stanley -- analyst
so then, given your comment on '22, does the gaap contribution kind of more than double?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
i'm going to stay away from '22 numbers until sometime in december, as is typical, but it is a substantial increase. yes.
vikram malhotra -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. and then just -- i know somewhere on the call, it was referenced that there are few distressed opportunities maybe that pertain to the dpe book. but given your bullish commentary over the next call it 18 months and longer-term, i'm kind of wondering how you think about opportunities -- acquisition opportunities for the more call it value add or troubled asset, given there are few but isn't there a just a short window before fundamentals really turn according to you. and so, i'm just sort of wondering is there an opportunity for you to deploy more capital, get more aggressive given where we are in the cycle?
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, there is a couple of ways to answer that. first, we did acquire, i guess, within the past six months, the lipstick building. at -- that was something that came through our dpe book. the prior ownership and lenders to that ownership, unfortunately, there was hundreds and hundreds of millions of subordinated equity don't remember how much?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
off the top of my head, $200 million.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
a few hundred million dollars of subordinate equity that we were senior to and have now taken possession of that asset, which i think is one of the more notable and attractive assets were at a basis we're comfortable with. we're executing a significant redid -- upgrade and repositioning of that asset, which i don't think has been undertaken since it was built in the 80s. and where i look at that as an addition to the portfolio coming out of this period of time for sure that's one. two, i'd say one of the biggest opportunities, which we invest heavily in is our own stock. that generally tends to be more attractive than almost anything that we come across, not always, but just usually, and we did i think $1.5 million?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
yes, which is about $100 million worth.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
$100 million worth in the first quarter. you might see those -- our projections were that for the full year closer to...
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
our goal for the year. yeah, $400 million.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
so that obviously leaves quite a bit more to do assuming we stick with that plan, which for the moment we are on that plan and that's how we're going to deploy a lot of the net proceeds, which we spoke about earlier. and there are new opportunities on top of that, the most compelling of which we think is new development. i think given my commentary earlier about the rent premiums, if you will, for the best assets in the best locations at this moment, and frankly, for the past two years, we view development as a better approach than buying and repositioning existing generally it's -- like just a world-class asset, like a lipstick. and that is something we still believe deeply. and so new development, our own stock and kind of rifle shot opportunities like lipstick are ways in which we are taking advantage of this market.
vikram malhotra -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, thanks so much. just one more, if i could quickly clarify you did a big street retail lease at soho, it's one of probably the larger leases i have seen in a while. how did that deal come about and maybe you could clarify roughly at grade what was the per foot rent?
andrew w. mathias -- president
it's 5,000 feet grade. there were actually two tenants competing for the space. the space is all currently occupied by a furniture store and another retailer, and this was leased in advance of their expirations. 110 green is on the best block in soho, both really for retail and for office and there was -- the space is still very desirable. so i think it was a very successful execution. we got very good security package, and it's a great luxury tenant for the block. so we were pleased to get it done.
vikram malhotra -- morgan stanley -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of peter abramowitz with jefferies. please proceed with your question.
peter abramowitz -- jefferies group llc -- analyst
yes, thank you. i just want to ask you about lease negotiations, heard some anecdotal evidence about just needing to be more flexible in working with tenants. so what are tenants looking for i guess in terms of lease flexibility, whether it's options to decide how much space they take partway through the lease or possible termination options midway through the lease? any color you can give on that would be helpful.
steve m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
sure. i don't think it's a -- what we're seeing is what we always see when there is a big disruption in the market and where tenants feel that they've got some added leverage in a competitive environment, which is they want as much flexibility as they can get and that generally, i would say from our -- from what we're experiencing right now is mostly about growth, where tenants are coming in and saying they want right of first offer positions, or they want fixed date expansion options.
in some cases slightly shorter terms, but i don't want to be misleading on that that's, i'd say, in some cases we're writing plenty of deals right now that are 15 and 20 years in duration, but flexibility is mostly what they talk about and in the world of flexibility i'd say it's more oriented toward growth as opposed to termination options. not to say that they don't look for rights to shed part of their space, mid-term or cancel, but three out of four tenants are -- fight very hard to make sure they have a clear path for future expansion.
peter abramowitz -- jefferies group llc -- analyst
okay. thanks, steve. and then one more, just kind of a macro question, i guess, in the last cycle and kind of the lead up before the pandemic, a lot of office using job growth in the city, and a lot of the net absorption as well is kind of driven by the tech sector, even though it's still compared to some other markets, not a huge part of the market. just curious what's kind of your outlook for office using job growth? anything about the pandemic on the other side of it that kind of changes those dynamics over the next few years?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
it's matt. so mark said in his opening comments, we said it back in january, and it's been reiterated, office using job growth is expected -- in the city is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels meaning all the jobs that were lost are regained by the end of 2021. the job growth has accelerated from january into february, into march. technology is part of that private sector job growth is 100,000 jobs, and office using jobs has accelerated from the 20s, the mid-20s. so that is why we feel confident about the return of demand for office spaces, because we are seeing. it's not a projection, but we are seeing the return of office using jobs.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
there were about 156,000 office jobs lost, about 30% of those have been regained through march. i expect april will continue that trend. the city believes and we have no reason to doubt that all of those jobs will be returned by year-end. if not, it seems like it would be early 2022 in any case. so the bottom line is, we should be back hopefully to what prior pandemic levels were, about 1.5 million office using jobs, and i would think sometime end of '21 or in '22 we'll be back to those levels. and then hopefully growing from there. i mean, the idea isn't just to get back, the idea is to get back and exceed like we have in prior downturns, and we think that the environment is right for that to happen for all the reasons we laid out early on.
peter abramowitz -- jefferies group llc -- analyst
got it, thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of nick yulico with scotiabank. please proceed with your question.
nicholas yulico -- scotiabank -- analyst
thanks. i just want to go back to this topic of work-from-home and the hybrid workforce, and marc you said that you thought employers will experiment with hybrid probably be limit and practice it first and then less prevalent. but, i mean, you clearly have a view that even before talking about office using jobs coming back, but somehow those jobs are still going to be taking up the same amount of office space in the city, and i guess i'm wondering why you think that's the case, because even pre-covid there were firms that were already talking about changing their workplace in terms of making it more flexible, reducing the real estate footprints. and even during the pandemic, we've seen some examples of firms who were starting to move to unassigned seating, because they're of the view that employees are not going to be back in the office, five days a week. so you may have more space per desk, but you're not going to have more space per employee because the employees may share desk.
so i guess i'm wondering with those factors being in play here maybe it's not every company who is going to do that, what is your insight here about that not being a problem? because implicitly you're saying it's not going to be a problem, i guess.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, i don't think it is. hoteling or hot seats, whatever you want to call it, this is not a new concept. this is a concept that's been around i mean for years and years and years. there is like nothing i know -- people look at this and say, oh my god, covid. i mean it's got a new name hybrid. i mean, who cares about the new name, it's called whatever it's called, it's called you have a ratio of more than one employee per seat.
some firms manage to 1.1, some 2.2, bigger firms tend to utilize what i call hot seating, but you call it anything you want. more than others. so my comments about the future is incremental to what existed pre-pandemic, because i look at that as kind of the established baseline and the question in my mind is, do i think covid is going to greatly increase that ratio? and i don't think it will be, because most of the firms that i've spoken with they are talking about the kind of flexibility that might allow for up to one or two days of work-from-home and that's at most for most of the big firms.
when you're only doing that kind of rotation once or twice a week, you really can't downsize the desk count, the seat count that efficiently. in order to really downsize you got to go to a four or five-day a week work-from-home, and then you can obviously get tremendous efficiency. but the moment somebody is in the office four days a week and they are home one day a week, that's their desk. they are not hot seating that desk because the math doesn't work if you have five people coming four days a week, and they're taking random one day a week off, you can't plan for that one day. it becomes a very complicated set to manage.
so part of it is, i don't think it's as easy as it sounds to make that work, because when people are there 80% of the time they're being in the office, they need whatever it is a desk, a cubicle, a workspace or an office. and so on the leasing that we've done since covid, and i guess we've done since covid almost 2 million feet, right. we did 1.3 million feet last year and 500,000 this year, so 1.8 million square feet. we have not seen the kind of reductions that i read about. and a lot of these leases we're signing right now are 10, 15-year leases.
so people are thinking about it and i think people will do it, not so much from a management of real estate, but more from a in consideration of the workforce as something that contribute toward in their eyes some form of live-work balance. the only problem is, as i see and this is my own personal opinion, is that live-work balance comes at a cost of productivity and efficiency. i mean, god knows we could not have done anything close to what we've accomplished over the last 18 months, if we were work-from-home, there's just no way. i mean, maybe some firms can, we couldn't, it's impossible, knowing just how much we get done as a group.
and i think that when i speak to the business leaders, they all sort of acknowledge year we're at our best when we're together. so it's not an optimal situation, it's more of a concession, i would say where businesses are considering working, let's call it, hybrid workforce into place. but i just don't see it yet as a trend that's resulting in significant downsizing of space. and as you mentioned, there is the offsetting concern that the packing together of workers as there is a de-densification that is definitely working into floor plans. it's very arithmetic, a five-foot work station is now six-foot. a six-foot is seven and seven is eight and those are big changes. when you go from just adding a foot or two to a workstation, that dramatically changes the density of a floor, especially in open-plan floor. and we are -- that i'm seeing a lot of de-densification. we're also seeing a lot of more amenitization of space, which works its way into the total square footage per worker when you're working more amenity into space.
so i don't want to dismiss the concept that, no, there -- because of covid, there will be firms that will experiment with work-from-home, but that's a different statement than what i think that's going to do in the real estate footprint.
nicholas yulico -- scotiabank -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. thank you, marc. i guess, just a follow up on that is, i mean, as you look at -- i mean, in many cases, it feels like firms are just kind of waiting until they have to make a decision on this. and that's when a lease renewal is coming off, or they're planning to move or that you plan to expand, right. and then we just think about your portfolio on the lease expirations that are coming up this year, next couple of quarters is that when you're starting to learn about this impact? meaning that in many cases, we don't really know how tenants are going to behave. you're just kind of learning about this impact as the renewals are coming up and how is that? are you gaining any new insights as this process is going along?
steve m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
well, i don't think we have to wait around for future expirations to understand what tenants are doing. we've done a lot of leasing over the past period through the pandemic period and certainly into the first four months of this year. so we have a very good sense as to what they are and are not doing. and i think we've said it a couple of times on this call, which is tenants are providing a little more space, they're providing more amenities, they're providing a little more flexibility to their employees.
but the headline examples that i think you may be focusing on when you talk about gigantic firms that incorporates a more flexible or hybrid work environment into their world is not necessarily the rule of thumb for everybody. if you look around manhattan and you see businesses that are 1,000 square feet or 25,000 square feet, those tenants probably aren't thinking anything in terms of hot desking or anything that impacts their real estate decision.
in those people's mindset, hybrid simply means, i work some of the time mobile, i work some of the time in my office, and at the end of the day, i just work a whole lot more, because i have the flexibility to do so whether that's at home or in the office or at the starbucks cafe. and i think from a manager's perspective allowing their employees that latitude, that's really the core shift of what we're seeing employers talk about, where they don't get all bent out of shape because their employee is a day from home as opposed to five days in the office, and i think you got to sort of bifurcate between guys that really do true hot desking in the majority of the world that really don't just provide a little more flexibility. andrew, you want to add to that?
andrew w. mathias -- president
well said, steve.
nicholas yulico -- scotiabank -- analyst
all right. thank you, everyone. appreciate it.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
okay. well, thank you, everyone, for calling in and the great thing is we're back in three months so we'll be able to share with you results, which obviously we have a fair degree of confidence in. and we think we're going to have a good second quarter, off to a great start and we hope to carry the momentum through june into july and look forward to speaking with you then.

before turning the call over to marc holliday, chairman and chief executive officer of sl green realty corp., i ask that those of you participating in the q&a portion of the call to please limit yourselves to two questions per person.
thank you. i will now turn the call over to marc holliday. please go ahead, marc.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. we appreciate you joining the call today and giving us an opportunity to review the second quarter earnings with you. i have some items that i'll open up with and obviously, will then turn it over for some questions-and-answers to whatever is on everyone's mind today. but starting with the quarter, we accomplished quite a bit in these three months. since our last call with you, we successfully completed several asset sales, a significant joint venture that we closed this morning, an important fee acquisition over 0.5 million square feet of office leasing, over 2 million shares of stock buybacks, and maybe most notably, a record-setting $3 billion sasb financing of one vanderbilt.
our first half accomplishments have exceeded much of our earlier goals and objectives and we are now very well situated to benefit from what we believe will be an even better market environment in the second half of this year. at the beginning of and throughout the year, i shared my optimism with you for a sharply rebounding new york, and when i survey where we are mid-year, i think that optimism was well founded. with the year-to-date total return exceeding 30% through yesterday's close, our stock has performed very well as the market is resetting its views of the new york economy after covid-related restrictions were lifted on may 19th.
average physical occupancy in slg's portfolio is approaching 25% as tenants are reopening new doors and more and more workers return to the office. business leaders are now more than ever voicing their strong support, preference and adherence to continued work from home model -- i'm sorry, continued work from office model. i see a lot of raised eyebrows here. continued work from office model in the collaborative, communicative and physically present matter. the majority of our tenants are planning for their workers to return after labor day and more importantly, we do not see any material trends in hot desking or shrinking footprints. to the contrary, we see a trend of businesses availing themselves at this moment in time in the market to lock in space and make investments in improved work environments, technology and amenities as a way of competing for talent and making a compelling case to their employees for work from office.
the space plans we are reviewing today that are submitted by tenants as they begin their build outs have decidedly more common space, amenities, food and beverage offerings, collaborative meeting spaces, specialty areas, de-densified workstations, breakout rooms for privacy and generally more thoughtful and efficient and healthy use of space. within our portfolio, this has led to almost 1 million square feet of new and renewal office leasing at rents that are generally flat with expiring escalated rents and ti packages that are marginally higher than pre-covid levels. we are currently tracking about 0.5 percentage point higher in occupancy than originally projected at the beginning of the year. and with over 600,000 square feet of additional leasing in pipeline, we hope to maintain our performance through year-end.
foot traffic at our properties has increased considerably in response to a strong underlying new york city business economy, calls for return to office and a slow but steady jobs' recovery. there are about 6,000 to 7,000 new office jobs being created monthly, which trend is expected to continue and result in reattaining pre-covid office employment levels by mid 2022. interestingly, the job creators to-date are being led by information and technology and professional business services, while the greatest amount of leasing demand seems to be coming from the finance sector.
wall street profits, which ended 2020 with a near record $51 billion in profits has already posted $18 billion in profits in just the first quarter. and the big five banks reported 150% increase in second quarter earnings year-over-year, and last year was a good year for the banks. there is now essentially a war for talent among large companies and high-growth businesses, a competition that new york city will win, given its diverse, educated and highly skilled workforce and deep talent pool. it should come as no surprise that new york city personal and corporate income tax collections are at all time record levels of $15 billion and $5 billion respectively. it is in this economic backdrop with record low interest rates and substantial investment capital for deployment that we believe, new york city is situated to outperform other major markets on a near and long-term basis.
looking forward into the coming quarter, we've got many milestones and achievements that we are busy to be able to report positive. moving on, the next time we speak such as making ready for workers returning to the office after labor day, completion of demo and all the column reinforcement for the commencement of vertical construction next month at 1 madison, the commencement of marketing, all of the residential units at 185 broadway will begin next week, the commencement of full demolition of 760 madison avenue, now that we just received our dob permit to make way for the new giorgio armani retail boutique in condominiums.
we have planned additional asset sales that we expect to achieve in the third and fourth quarters of the year with much of the proceeds going toward additional stock buybacks, consistent with the original plan. and certainly, and maybe most excitedly, the grand opening of summit one vanderbilt on october 21st. it's something that we've been working on for three years and we fully expect and hope it will become one of the top performing and most visited experiential attractions in new york city once it opens. and that now is well within our sites and looking forward to the opening of summit. so with that, i would say the third quarter financial results were all in line -- second quarter financial results were all in line with our expectations and we're happy to open it up now to take questions on any of the specifics.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of caitlin burrows from goldman sachs. your line is now open.
caitlin burrows -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. you commented on the first quarter call that lease concessions had stabilized and it appears from the final leasing data you provided that this was indeed the case in the second quarter. so just wondering, if you could go through what you're seeing on the concession side, have they stabilized and are they perhaps even improving yet?
steven m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
yeah. i don't -- i, certainly, don't think they've improved but they're stabilized. we saw a stabilization starting in the fourth quarter of last year and that's carried forward through today. and it's very important that when you look at the numbers quarter-over-quarter, you really need to dig into it and understand the complexion of the deals that are signed in any one particular quarter, whether heavily weighted toward raw space or space that's been retrofitted, renewal deals versus new deals. but on balance, what we've seen is tis for raw space long-term deals, generally in that 110 to 130 range, that's been consistent for the past six to nine months.
and free rent's anywhere from 12 to 14 months typically for new deals, inclusive of construction time. and then, obviously, depending on whether it's a renewal deal or shorter term durations, then those concessions can be dramatically less than raw space.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah, i would -- caitlin, i just want to add to that because i see a lot of commentary about tis and what the brokers are saying about tis. i would caution it in a couple of ways. one, brokers talking up the book for their client tenants saying tis are going up and up is -- i think you have to be very discerning when you look at that data versus what we disclose on a quarterly basis. matt can take you through the actual ti disclosures for the quarter, but on a 0.5 million -- on over 0.5 million square feet of leasing, our tis were i think relatively efficient.
and as i said in my commentary, at or marginally above pre-covid levels for both new and renewal deals. and we don't buy up rents, so you have to -- tis have to be talked about in connection with the rents. our rents, which i also said in the commentary, are marginally flat with previous escalated rents. those rents could be higher if we bought the rents up with more ti, and that is a strategy that some of our competition will do, it's not good or bad, it's just -- it's not what we do. we meet the market on rents and we try and keep the tis as efficient as possible. and you have to look at the two in tandem. so for the commentary out there to be on these vastly escalating tis, i think you have to compare it to what we actually have done for the quarter in the year.
matt, can you sort of review again what those numbers are?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, we reported last night that for the second quarter, this is all excluding the one vanderbilt leasing since the numbers are dramatically different in one vanderbilt. on the rest of the portfolio, tis were $17 a foot and that compared to a significantly higher number last quarter, but to steve's point on never look at quarter-to-quarter, because it depends on the buildings and the spaces and also the blend between new and renewal. we had a significant portion of our leasing this quarter. renewal leasing and the ti there was almost zero. on one lease, it was zero, 100,000 foot lease. on the new leases, it's $59 a foot. so it's a blend every quarter. for the year, our tis on the comparable space is $40 a foot, and that is pretty close to the historical average, may be marginally higher and all dependent on the blend between new and renewal and what building's releasing it.
caitlin burrows -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. okay, thanks for that. and then, maybe just a question on one vanderbilt. you guys have clearly made a lot of progress there on leasing up. so just wondering if you could give some comments on the rents there and how the rents and concessions are trending relative to your underwriting and versus recent quarters.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
well, it's -- the trending is -- it's basically, we're almost stabilized, we're at about 90% leased. we have a couple of leases in pipeline that we hope to get done in the next one to three or -- one to three weeks or so, it brings us over 90%. at that point, obviously, we're going to work hard to get to full occupancy, but we'll be very selective about how we finish off essentially the top of the building, there's two or three or four floors at the top, which are higher rent floors and very special floors. and we're so far ahead in terms of velocity, whether -- that may be a '22 event, we'll see, i mean, hopefully, sooner, but certainly, we haven't planned for sooner.
and the noi and the rental levels are right on top of underwriting, maybe certainly slightly ahead on velocity, probably right on top on economics. and we've gone through every december what those underlying assumptions are, what those noi goalposts are, we're trending toward the high end of those goalposts with an expected noi at stabilization, i think, of close to $250 million -- or is that $220?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
yeah, between $200 million and 250 million. yeah.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
between $200 million and $250 million depending on which year you pick. but that's in the next two years or so. so the valuation of that stream of flow supported a $5 billion plus appraisal and a $3 billion financing execution. and where it closes out the chapter pretty much on what was just a transformational project for the company.
caitlin burrows -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of alex goldfarb from piper sandler. your line is now open.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. hey, good afternoon. so two questions. steve, maybe i'll start with you. with everything that's going on, we're reading articles about delta variant and companies like apple delaying return to office, you guys obviously are pretty active on the leasing front, but the gap of the lease rate versus occupancy has widened. in your view, in totality, when do you think the market will have -- will stop the negative absorption? do you think that's at the end of this year, do you think that's '22 or do you think it's going to take longer than that?
steven m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
boy. i mean, that's speculative, alex. i don't think i'm going to venture a guess as to like exactly when we return. i will say this, i think the trend line, i think the general consensus from our position and is supported by the brokerage community is that the first quarter of this year, the market hit its bottom. and the trend line is that with increasing velocity and a strong economy and an expectation of tenants and employees reoccupying the spaces after labor day, that's -- it's sort of all green lights at this point as far as the market repairing itself. how long that process takes? i'm not -- that's a crystal ball i don't have. but from our position as we sit with the portfolio that's well leased and well positioned in the marketplace, i think that we'll outperform the market in total. and certainly, our experience with one vanderbilt and what we're seeing in the rest of the portfolio will support that expectation.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and then, on the asset sale front, can you guys just give an update on the kenneth cole site? i think you guys had potentially looked at that maybe for a life science conversion, whether you guys do that or sell it, we had heard from just conversations that perhaps the site would be -- could be conceived as a last mile warehouse site. so can you give just sort of your sense on that because it seems like that could be a potential source of some meaningful dollars?
steven m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
well, it is in a life sciences corridor for the city and we are in the process of applying for a ulurp on the site, which would be a significant increase to the potential square footage of that asset. and at the same time, we had a sale process that was ongoing and continues and we're evaluating offers for the asset through that sale process. so it's a small asset for us, but one that is getting a lot of focus just because it's in an area of the city that's very hard and we're working on a couple of different options to try to maximize value there.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
but again, do you think that's a second half resolution or that spills into next year?
steven m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
well, the ulurp would be an 18-month process. so i'm not sure if it will be a resolution in the second half, a sale or joint venture or if we decide to hold it and take it down the ulurp and be a longer-term redevelopment asset.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of michael lewis from truist securities. your line is now open.
michael lewis -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you. my first question, i guess following up on something that alex asked about. as i talked to investors today, i heard a lot about apple pushing back their return to office and a lot about the delta variant, maybe help us set the goalpost -- i heard this concern that post labor day, maybe it becomes a bust if everybody starts pushing back. i mean, maybe help us what's the expectation for physical occupancy post labor day, where you would say things are trending in the right direction versus what that number might be that could cause some concern. kind of an expectation post labor day, what the office physical occupancy would look like.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
i -- look, i don't think we're in a position, and i think that's what steve said in the last to alex as well. we survey our tenants, we've also seen larger surveys like there was a goldman research survey that surveyed a much broader swathe of tenants, and i think we can only speak to what the current expectations are, but i don't know that we can modify those expectations, like what a delta variant may or may not portend in the fall. there is the consensus in the reports, which is echoed by our tenant base is very decisive, whereas 80% of workers expect to be essentially back to a full work week by no later than early '22 starting in earnest after labor day. and that's kind of what we've been saying for six months now. the work week was never five days a week, the work week was kind of four and a quarter days a week, four and a half maybe, and that may shrink to a in-office work week to like four zero or four one.
there is no narrative within our portfolio, where we speak to people going to five, four or three days a week at home. it really -- and this is what we said in the last call is more in the nature of might there be floating work from home days and flexibility built into a schedule, but it doesn't reduce desks and it doesn't, more importantly, reduce the recognition by the business leaders you see notwithstanding. apple may want to push back their return by a month, but if they push it back by a month, they push it back by a month. the commentary you're hearing from us is commentary you should think about over a period of years to come, not september versus october, because that really has no bearing on our performance or portfolio. if -- we'll be prepared for return for workers more robust than we have today come right after labor day, because that's what our tenants are telling us. whether the delta variant is going to cause that to be delayed by a month or so, i don't know, but even if we did know, it really wouldn't change anything we're doing here in our business, and i don't think it would change anything that tenants are doing for their five and 10-year long-term planning, because that really is evidenced by the ink on the leases, which was 1 million square foot of leases done in the first half, 600,000 pending. everybody's fully familiar with the delta variant, i mean not just -- i don't think it's a secret, everyone knows us out there and we're going to take precautions against it.
the incidence of covid in our portfolio as workers have returned is almost, i would say, none to negligible. so, i continue to maintain the safest place to be is in healthy offices, which have policies and protocols in place and where the spread maybe taking place, it's not within the sl green portfolio that i can tell you and i don't think it's going to cause people not to return to offices. new york city is about 60% vaccinated, hopefully that number goes up. i think the office population is more highly vaccinated. if you take our office as a barometer of that, it's much higher than 60%, it's higher than 80%. so we're just not in a position to comment on delta variant, but that we are in a position to say that everything we see in here leads us to believe that businesses are awaiting the opportunity to get everybody in and that the plans are to commence in september.
steven m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
michael, i would just add, we're signing leases -- many leases with companies that are not back in the office yet. so are the people you're talking to saying those people are signing leases and never coming back to the office?
michael lewis -- truist securities -- analyst
no, i don't think that's the case.
steven m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
okay. so we're looking at lease velocity.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. so look if there -- the tenants, i think business leaders have spoken, there is no illusion that this -- that fortune 500 companies are going five days a week work from home. and for those that do, i think they'll competitively suffer. but that's my opinion.
michael lewis -- truist securities -- analyst
okay. that all makes sense and actually answered a couple of my questions. maybe i'll ask, i think we're about one year out from the reset on the ground lease on 625 madison, i know you've been asked about this from time to time. i don't know if there's any update or indication of what that rent increase would be, but also maybe the timing of when we'll know what that will be.
andrew w. mathias -- president
no update and status there. the rent reset is the middle of next year and the rent will be known before then. but there is no update and status there.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
i would say we're actively engaged in -- with our team on the process surrounding the rent revaluation. so the process is underway. the team is hard at work on it and it is about a one-year process, it's just the way it works.
michael lewis -- truist securities -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of blaine heck from wells fargo. your line is now open.
blaine heck -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great, thanks. good afternoon. probably for marc or steve, i wanted to follow up on some of the nuances in the return to office, if possible. are you guys seeing any major difference in the pace of the increase in utilization or physical occupancy between newer, higher quality buildings that had better overall office environments versus more commodity buildings that maybe weren't really updated much during the pandemic, and they have less of an energetic feel for lack of a better way of phrasing it?
steven m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
yeah, i mean there is no doubt that tenants and their employees are gravitating toward better quality buildings with better, healthier work environments, which is why you've seen in our portfolio certainly at one vanderbilt, where we are starting to see the tenants on board as they finish their construction. but throughout the rest of the portfolio, where we put so much effort into upgrading air filtration with merv 14, 15 and 16 level of filtration such that it produces the healthiest work environment possible and enhanced cleaning and other protocols that we've implemented. but as it's -- as the months have gone by, essentially we've seen almost a 1% increase in physical occupancy as each week goes by. last week we were at 22% occupied throughout the portfolio and two to three months ago, we were as low as 11%. so it's -- there is a wave of tenants that are coming back and their employees are coming back. but clearly, they favor the healthy -- the healthier buildings and their employees want to see it and feel it.
blaine heck -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. that's helpful, steve. and maybe one more quick one for you. i know it's still somewhat early in your process, but can you give us any color on the interest from prospective tenants at 1 madison?
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
i would say that for where we stand in the deal -- in the development, which is three plus years ahead of completion, relative to that same point in time on one vanderbilt, the interest level -- the early interest level is far higher. large tenants are the ones that are moving fairly decisively within just a small selective band, i think, of competitive properties that can meet their needs for end of 2023, beginning of 2024 move in. obviously, we have 1.4 million square feet to offer, but the beauty of 1 madison is we've got sort of building within a building, we've got 93,000 square foot podium floors that are relatively more affordably priced and then we've got state of the art, even more efficient tower floors at 35,000 feet that appeal toward a different segment of the market.
so we are seeing activity on both right now. we're seeing activity, i would say, in a volume ahead of what we would have expected from large tenants over three years out from completion. i would say that some of the interest is not -- is fairly serious interest in terms of people taking hard looks and even some paper being passed back and forth. so with that said, we have no anticipation of signing a lease in '21 that was not in our guidance. we really -- i think on the numbers we had put out there in december had talked about mid second half of '22. so i would say that where we sit today, i still feel very good about that guidance. we'll obviously try and exceed it.
and based -- the most importantly, based on the early feedback, i think we have the right product. the right product in the right area with the right amenity mix that i believe strongly is going to be leased and is going to be least consistent with our projections. so the early feedback is good and i'd say, we're marginally ahead of where we expect to be, but i wouldn't think that's going to translate into anything announceable in '21 nor did we expect it to.
blaine heck -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. thanks, marc.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of manny korchman from citi. your line is now open.
emmanuel korchman -- citi -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, everyone. i don't know if this was for maybe marc, but on the sale of 220 east 42nd, did anything change in the market that made you want to jv that rather than sell it outright as you plan to a few months ago?
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
andrew, why don't you -- i mean, that was entirely -- i was resolved to own it long term. so andrew, why don't you -- sort of the evolution of how we got to, where we got to, which was again an above expected execution?
andrew w. mathias -- president
yeah, i think the -- we were able to achieve a price that was equivalent to the pre-covid price if you adjust for the deposit that we retained on the sale. and we're pretty optimistic about the prospects for the building, because it has a great base, a very long-term lease space and some low rent rolling space that -- i would say, our view for that -- the prospects for that space has gotten more positive over the last couple of years. so whereas it was a price we're willing to sell, we're quite happy to hold 50% of the building, we got great financing done last april-may on the asset and we just decided there was upside in the rent roll that we wanted to continue mining.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
i think it's another great data point about the global appetite for well positioned midtown real estate. it's a sizable deal. i think, it's reflective of this disconnect between a private market, that really is looking for yield, looking for high credit yield, which obviously the news building affords. it's -- as andrew said, very well financed. and in this market, there seems to be no shortage of capital that wants to deploy into deals like that. so good data point for the market, good data point for our portfolio. and i wouldn't take it in isolation, i would combine that with the success we achieved at 1,200 a foot on 635-641 sixth and the deal we did at the end of last year at 410 tenth, which was nearly $1 billion for a newly completed asset, and a plethora of other deals that we've started and finished in a post-covid world.
emmanuel korchman -- citi -- analyst
all right. thanks for that additional color, marc. just to dig into your point on capital out there for a second, do you think that there is as big an appetite for taking out whether it be a larger single asset or a larger portfolio of assets or do you really think that the capital sources today are focused on sort of more swallowable single asset deals that don't take that -- the larger commitment of capital.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
well, i -- just to put some meat on the bones, larger, smaller, it's -- i think the largest investments for single assets, maybe small portfolios is in that check range of $500 million, i think is a sweet spot for large deals. i think if it approaches $1 billion, you start to thin out very rapidly as to who can write that check. and it's not commentary, i don't think on the attractiveness of the opportunity or maybe even the desire, it's just that $1 billion plus checks are rarer to come by and anything between $500 million and $1 billion will normally take care of even the largest of new york city assets on an outright purchase or jv. and to aggregate up buildings to make a portfolio deal, you can do it. and for people who can write that check, i think it's an enormous opportunity, there's just less people and less groups that can handle it at those levels.
emmanuel korchman -- citi -- analyst
thanks for that.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of frank lee from bmo. your line is now open.
frank lee -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi, good afternoon, everyone. first question is for steve, can you provide any additional color on the 600,000 leasing pipeline, what's the breakdown between new versus renewal? what type of tenants are in pipeline and the variable to provide the average lease term?
steven m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
so we have 355,000 square feet of either leases in execution or in negotiation and another 264,000 square feet of term sheets, which we think have a high degree of probability of conversion over to a lease. and of the leases that are out, there is roughly 300,000 square feet of new tenants and about 30,000 square feet of -- 35,000 square feet of renewal tenants. and then, on the term sheets, it's roughly 200,000 square feet of new and 68,000 square feet of renewal tenants.
and then, as far as the complexion of the tenants with the leases that are either out or out for signature, 39% of the square footage is our legal tenants, legal law firms, 29% are financial service tenants and 17% are tech tenants, which by and large mirrors what we've seen in leasing velocity year-to-date. little flip flop on the legal versus financial services whereas financial services has clearly led the market to-date. but in our pipeline, we've got one larger law firm yield that skews that down a little bit.
but just to broaden the answer a little bit, i'd say, where we're seeing most activity in the marketplace is financial services throughout the portfolio. we have a disproportionate number of leases, maybe that totals per footage but disproportionate number of leases that are out with financial service tenants.
frank lee -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay, thanks. so it sounds like the majority of the leasing pipeline is coming from new leases. do you have a sense of what's driving this? are these tenants looking to upgrade space or just simply looking to relocate?
steven m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
yeah, i think you've seen -- across the market, you've seen a pivot by tenants that have sort of moved away from the short-term renewals, not to say that there aren't short-term renewals, but there was a lot more activity with tenants that are making long-term new lease commitments as they get back to business as usual, looking to create new work environments, restart -- change the densification of how they operate their companies and tenants are going more on the offense of where there is -- they're not just hibernating in place scared of the world, but now that they're getting past covid, they're getting back to business as usual and that philosophy is picking up and that's why we're seeing more relocations.
frank lee -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay, great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of steve sakwa from evercore isi. your line is now open.
steve sakwa -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks. marc, i was just wondering if you could comment -- i know leasing spreads bounce around quarter-to-quarter and same-store noi is choppy and can have some unusual comparisons, but your leasing spreads year-to-date are only down maybe 1% or 2%. i know your expectation was down 5% to 10% at the investor day, and same-store noi growth is a little weaker than you had projected. so do you just have any comments about the back half on either of those trends and anything that may be playing out as expected or better than you thought?
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
well, i mean -- again, we don't -- i look at everything over the course of the year. i mean, we budget based on the course of the year, we do our reforecast, which we just finished up based on the balance of the year. and on that basis, we feel like most of our goals and objectives, we are either on track or maybe hope to exceed. i mean, there is 18 of them, so i'm just -- in general, there may -- there are obviously going to be ones that we stretch, we may or may not hit or we miss by a little, but i'd say, by and large, we are on track or ahead.
i wouldn't -- whether we're a couple of points above or below in july, we have our numbers run out through the end of the year. i think, mark to market, we are pretty much on track with that or maybe slightly ahead of our projections. as with velocity, matt can address the same-store.
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
yeah. same store, like the other metrics, we are on a full year basis on our expectations or maybe slightly ahead. you got to remember, the first half of this year is comping to mostly a pre-covid comp in the first six months of last year, whereas the last six months will comp to post-covid last six months of last year. so the comps will be better and that will trend us what looks to be off from our expectations in the first half of the year that will put us back on our expectations for the back half of the year.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
the other thing i would say, and i alluded to earlier, you can't really just look at the rent because you got to take that capital into play. i think, we're probably ahead on net effective relative to budget, because our capital in q2 was down. so yeah, we sit here talking about well, is ti up 30%, 20%, 10%? our tis were down in the second quarter, now they may be up again in the third and fourth and we feel like for the full year, we are on or ahead of schedule, relative to what our ti capital budget was meaning within our ti capital budget. little hard to do quarter-to-quarter, but we certainly are not experiencing the trauma on concessions that i read about in all the tenant broker reports. and i just think you have taken a little bit of grain of salt.
steve sakwa -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay, thanks. second question, you alluded to bringing more assets to market second half of the year, can you just maybe help frame out sort of the potential size or bucket of asset sales? and then, the corollary to that is obviously share buybacks, i think, were much stronger in q2 than certainly we thought, and we thought it'd be a little more back-end loaded, but how do we think about asset sales back half of the year and share buybacks back half of the year?
andrew w. mathias -- president
well -- and i would say we're reviewing our business plan based on the success that we've had with the assets we've rolled out to-date and the fact that the appetite out there is voracious for new york city assets on a relatively quick closing basis. so it's -- we're reexamining the art of the possible for the second half and we definitely will be back active in the capital markets. just can't mention exactly how large at this time. share buybacks, matt can speak to but...
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
yeah. consistent with what you've seen us do in the first half of the year, the bias is to use proceeds from asset sales for share repurchases. we only do share buybacks with the proceeds from asset sales, but we have taken the opportunity to pay down debt to keep the leverage levels in line with some of the asset sales too. so to andrew's point on dimensioning it depending on what the dimension is and what that does to the balance sheet. again, our bias is to buy back stock with the proceeds, unless we need to pay down debt to manage that leverage level.
steve sakwa -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's it. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of jamie feldman from bank of america. your line is now open.
jamie feldman -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you. steve, i was hoping to get a little bit more granular on the leasing pipeline or at least kind of the segments of demand. i mean, i think everything we've seen is that the most active kenneth in the market and certainly you guys have had success at one vanderbilt. it has been that kind of higher-end boutique type financial services law firm. as people are thinking about getting back to the office, how should we think about that next group kind of maybe larger tenants but not quite as high-end, what are they looking for? is it still a focus around grand central, do you think that they're going to look at other parts of the market? i'm just curious what -- like kind of what stage two is going to look like in terms of new york leasing picking up after the pandemic?
steven m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
well, maybe a couple other soundbites that round off the color commentary on leasing, other than the very specific percentage as i gave on the last answer. i think we're seeing certainly more focus on transit-centric located buildings. certainly more focus on buildings that are amenitized and a focus on buildings that have a healthier workplace environment. the good news in all of that is by comparison to the first half of the year, we're starting to see more tours, proposals and leases in negotiation on the kind of the smaller tenants in the market. what we saw in the first half of the year were a lot of activity on the premier buildings, the class a product. but now we're starting to see life for the smaller guys and the more commodity buildings.
so in our portfolio of use graybar is a good example of that. we've got a lot more leasing activity in that building than we have in the first half of the year, which i think -- one that's in prior market disruptions, it was always the small guys that stayed busy, the big guys put out of the market. this is the first time in my career, where i remember that the big guys were the ones driving the market and the smaller guys were on the sidelines. but i think as we're getting past covid, those smaller commodity guys are now starting to awaken and come back into the market and we're certainly seeing it in our grand central portfolio in some of the more commodity type of product like at graybar or 711 third avenue.
jamie feldman -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, thank you. and then, i mean now that we know the one -- the primary for mayor, any thoughts on what eric adams would mean for new york real estate, some of the concerns around crime, maybe cost -- operating cost for landlords? any early read?
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
well, there's still a general election to go in november. so eric looks very well positioned to become next mayor, but i think when you speak to him, he still has work to do before that's mission accomplished. and i think that in a more broad context, looking at increased voter turnout, there was like an extra 150,000 voters than usual in the city that doesn't have high voter turnout to begin with, i think, demonstrated the positive results of activism within the resident and business community to get people to get out to vote to make sure that all voices were heard and not just a segment of the voices heard.
and the top two leading candidates were both considered moderate candidates, candidates who believed in safety and affordable housing but in working with businesses to create an environment that is -- that will be favorable for the next four years. and i think that was a major and positive step forward, and i think eric's going to do a great job if he -- when -- if and when he becomes mayor. and i think he -- we've seen him in the past work through difficult land use issues and other issues in his borough and brooklyn, and we have respect for what he brings to the table in a total package of being able to work with the policing and security community, the business community, the minority community, the homeless and people who are in the -- need the affordable rent segment of the market. and we're looking forward to continuing to have good relations with city hall and do our part more than anything else. we want to do our part to help improve transportation, infrastructure, the built environment, contribute toward affordable housing like we did with sky and 185 broadway. and we'll do everything possible to support him and his administration just like we have with mayor de blasio and his administration.
jamie feldman -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of craig mailman from keybanc capital markets. your line is now open.
craig mailman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey, everyone. i know lease terms have been kind of elongating from the contraction you saw earlier in the pandemic, but are any tenants looking for more flexibility in terms of early outs in some of the longer leases they're taking? is that something that's taking hold or not a conversation?
andrew w. mathias -- president
whenever you've got a market where the tenants feel that they've got more leverage than they had previously, then one of the things they go for as part of their overall negotiations is greater flexibility. i don't think that's driven by covid, post-covid, state of the economy, different perspective on the real estate market. it's just that tenants come to the table asking for a lot of different components on their transactions. so yeah, we're seeing requests for more flexibility, whether it's to shed space mid-term or cancel early. but having said that, the number of times that we actually react to it and give that kind of flexibility is still very, very rare, it's not a foregone conclusion that just because you asked for it, you're going to get it.
craig mailman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. then just on the one vande financing. after you guys repaid the $1.750 billion that you had out, what -- can you just talk about the excess proceeds, how much of that needs to be kind of retained within the jv for anything laid out in the cmbs stocks versus -- and how much, if any, is kind of being returned to partners as excess proceeds or return to capital?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
sure. it's matt. so the -- at closing, we had about $1.55 billion out on the construction financing, we repaid that. and then, after reserves, first costs and then, predominantly reserves for executed leasing tis, free rent, that type of thing. $650 million was repatriated back to sl green, which then went to all pay down debt.
craig mailman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay, great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of anthony paolone from j.p. morgan. your line is now open.
anthony paolone -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thanks. so i guess for maybe marc or andrew with the valuation you got ova, where do you think that puts land values and what does that do for your appetite to pursue other potential large scale projects or even teardowns for that matter?
andrew w. mathias -- president
well, there are some other sites trading around grand central or in the market at least. and i would say, that's indicating strong land values in the grand central area. just specific to grand central, we're seeing -- i think the biggest impact on us is really 1 madison, where we're very confident with the decision we made with that asset and i think we have a chance to replicate or exceed the success we've had on one vanderbilt with 1 madison. so that's where it sort of impacts us the most, i think, more so than taking on another large scale development in this immediate area because we sort of have one ongoing at 1 madison.
anthony paolone -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
okay. and then, just my second one is maybe for matt. can you give us any guide posts or any additional color as we think about ffo from 2q to 3q with the, i think, the latham & watkins, i don't know if they're moving out or not or if they're holding over. and just how to think about that as we roll the numbers?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
sure. yeah. latham & watkins left in june, end of june was the expiration of their lease. so they're out. that asset will move into redevelopment phase now for the balance of the year. ffo is somewhat a function, not just of noi, but of the other things that we have in the business plan. so depending on the timing of things, third quarter could be equal to or slightly below the second quarter, and then fourth quarter pops up or the inverse of that. we have some things in the pipe that are timing dependent and whether or not they happen in third or fourth were different to -- as we said earlier, we're giving annual guidance, we don't look at stuff on a quarterly basis as long as it's within our annual guidance and we are squarely within our range as we said now.
steven m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
just to add to that, latham & watkins, when we took control of the building, we knew that they were -- they had already signed the lease to move out of the building, so it was no surprise to us. so when we bought the building, we bought it with the intention to do a redevelopment plan and that plan has now been fully designed and is in the early stages of beginning to execute.
anthony paolone -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
okay, thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of vikram malhotra from morgan stanley. your line is now open.
vikram malhotra -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks so much. matt, maybe just sticking with you on, not necessarily ffo but from one vanderbilt, can you just clarify or give us the sort of gaap contribution you've baked in for each quarter, the third and fourth quarter? and then, what's your expectation for the summit in the fourth quarter?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
so in sticking with the commentary so far, i won't give quarterly guidance, but i will stick with my annual number of low-30s gaap noi contribution from one vanderbilt for 2021. our summit numbers were opened in october 21st, we have modeled in very conservative ramp. so the contribution for the back half of the year is very late.
vikram malhotra -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then, just on -- in the street retail portfolio, can you just clarify or give us more color on 85th fifth avenue? i think it showed 100% occupied the prior quarter, but not this quarter, can you just clarify what went on there?
andrew w. mathias -- president
do you say 100% occupied or 100% vacant?
vikram malhotra -- morgan stanley -- analyst
no, it was vacant this quarter, so last quarter was fully occupied.
andrew w. mathias -- president
we signed the lease yesterday for the space, all of it, a long-term lease. so next quarter, it will reflect occupied again. yeah, anthropology lease expired... who is it? they left and we signed the lease.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
vikram, you're taking wind out of the sales for third quarter forcing us to go. we just signed a full-building lease on that deal yesterday.
vikram malhotra -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
you got to leave something on the bones for q3, my friend.
vikram malhotra -- morgan stanley -- analyst
so the street retail is fully leased back back up and...
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
with lease, leased again. no worries.
vikram malhotra -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. any comments or any color on the economics relative to where it was prior?
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
we'll talk about it more and you're using your third question of two.
vikram malhotra -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
we'll talk about it more when we reveal the deal.
vikram malhotra -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. sounds good. so i just have -- so i get that color offline. just one sort of clarification, you talked a lot about capital obviously buybacks in terms of your capital deployment, the -- all the developments that you're doing. but just in tying with your commentary about new york coming back near term, long-term, one of your peers formed a big jv to focus on their markets, but also look at more value add type development or type acquisitions. i'm just wondering your appetite from here on, on focusing on something like that or value add buildings in terms of acquisitions, but also just given the debt markets growing the dpe book from here.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
well, we are very actively pursuing desires of not just value add, full on ground up development opportunities. we have value-add opportunities we've acted on recently like 885 third, which is i think a great example of that and now well underway. 750 third is a redevel within the portfolio. we have other deals like that in pipeline. we closed a dpe deal in q2, we just are...
andrew w. mathias -- president
yeah.
steven m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
yeah.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
closing and we have other pipeline for q3 we expect to close and be able to discuss on the next call. so i mean, we're very much in business, we've got like seven active development deals and redevelopment deals going on right now, we have fairly active pipeline of opportunity but disproportionately, just given the extreme divergence of value and stock price, we've decided to allocate most free cash flow toward the stock buyback and we'll continue to do so.
vikram malhotra -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, fair enough. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of nick yulico from scotiabank. your line is now open.
nicholas yulico -- scotiabank -- analyst
thanks. hi, everyone. page 38 on the lease expirations, i just had a question there. if you look last quarter, it was talking about there being 450,000 square feet of expirations in the second quarter, it's still listed over 400,000 in this quarter. and so, i'm just trying to understand what -- it looks like you have now additional month-to-month tenants in the portfolio and maybe provide some clarity on that and how much of this is office versus retail?
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
well, you're in the weeds on that one, nick. but -- so i will say there is hold over tenants from quarter-to-quarter, so that will probably contribute to it as the complexion of it. i don't know that one off the top of my head, so i can research it further and get back to you offline.
nicholas yulico -- scotiabank -- analyst
okay. appreciate that. thanks. i guess my other question is just as we think about the leasing activity that's in the pipeline that steve was talking about earlier. and then, we relate that back to page 29 in the sup, where you do give the occupied number for same-store versus the lease number, and that spread can merge closer, meaning that you used to -- you tend to have a higher lease number then an occupied number you still view, but it's not as big of a spread. i mean, are lease -- i'm just trying to think about that leasing that's in the pipeline, what that means in terms of your leased number in the same-store portfolio? is that -- could you with this to that?
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
i think we addressed that earlier in saying, we are still comfortable with the goals and objectives we put out there, including occupancy and would hope to exceed our goal, which was 93% by the end of the year.
nicholas yulico -- scotiabank -- analyst
okay. thanks, everyone.
operator
thank you. at this time, i'm showing no further questions, i would like to turn the call back over to marc holliday for closing remarks.
marc holliday -- chairman & chief executive officer
okay. well, appreciate the opportunity for those still on to discuss all that we accomplished in q2. it was great three months, we'll be working hard these next three and look forward to speaking to you again.

marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
okay. thank you, and good afternoon. thank you all for joining us today. we have just come from the historic opening of what i consider new york's most thrilling and unique destination, summit one vanderbilt, opened to the public earlier today. at 11 a.m., we cut the ribbon in the transcendence room, high above one vanderbilt with the most incredible and amplified views of new york city. the room is aptly named because everything we've done with this building has been about transcending limits and pushing boundaries. we're doing it again today, but this time, we're taking it to a much higher level literally. at the ribbon-cutting ceremony, i spoke about how one vanderbilt is representative of what the true 21st century office tower can be. it redefines what it means to integrate excellence in design, efficiency, sustainability, amenity, health, wellness and commutability. by putting it all together, we've established a new category of building, a new icon on the skyline and a new model for the workplace.
as a result, we are now more than 90% leased despite covid, and despite every dire prediction of the city's demise. several months after we opened this building, we introduced daniel boulud's le pavillon to the midtown restaurant scene, and that too was an important milestone for new york, marking the reopening of indoor dining. every available table has been booked every single night since its opening in may, and there were a lot of questions when we opened that restaurant about whether the new york had enough of a population here in midtown to support this restaurant. and the restaurant has hundreds and hundreds on waiting list every evening. so now today, at 1:00 p.m., we welcomed our first paid visitors to see and experience this new and exciting cultural destination we call summit. this time, we've done more than push the boundary, we've completely shattered it.
we spent years in design, taking the best elements of observation decks, cultural institutions, experiential art and immersive technology, and combined it all into summit. the result is an experience that has the potential to not only become one of the most sought-after destinations in new york city, but a true global phenomenon. the energy in new york has been palpable this past month. and now with international borders reopening, hotel is preparing to welcome back millions of guests, live audiences returning to sporting venues and broadway reopening. new york is back. on certain days of the week, we are reaching nearly 40% physical occupancy in our portfolio, a substantial increase that's been building up over the past few weeks. as a sense of normalcy returns to the city, ambitious projects, like one vanderbilt, ensure that new york remains a top global destination.
people from around the world come here to shop, to be entertained, to enjoy great food, to see great architecture and visit world-class museums. summit now becomes an important addition to that lineup. the primary drivers of this market, finance, technology, business services, media and healthcare, are all doing unbelievably well, and beginning to make space commitments that evidence net demand in our market that will stabilize the occupancy rate and hopefully turn into meaningful positive absorption toward the end of this year and 2022. with over 450,000 square feet leased in the third quarter in our portfolio and nearly 1.4 million square feet leased in sl green portfolio to date, we are tracking well ahead of our leasing goals for the year. and we're doing that at rental levels that are ahead of expectations and almost flat with expiring escalated rents.
we carry this momentum into the fourth quarter with the announcement of the seismic chelsea piers lease. it's a 56,000 square foot lease to one of the best operators of fitness, wellness and health in new york city. it's only their second manhattan location. we've been negotiating with chelsea for quite a while, and they've selected one madison to be their east side home where they'll be making substantial investment to make a fitness destination that i think is going to be second to none. it's going to be awesome. and that really bodes well for one madison, which otherwise is already about six to seven weeks ahead of schedule on construction and significantly under budget, even beyond the numbers that we discussed back in december of last year, the buyouts, which now stand at close to 92% of the total project, have resulted in over $12 million of additional contingency savings.
and that's above and beyond the savings we had already factored in to that deal through smart bidding, smart project management, and just given the overall state of the construction market right now, we're experiencing savings while the city and i think the nation at large is experiencing cost increase as a result of supply chain issues that are driving up price. so we're managing that to the best we can, staying well within our budget, and one madison with that new lease now done and more conversations underway, we feel very, very good about that development. during the quarter, we also completed a couple of dispositions previously announced, but we closed them. most significantly, the consummation of the sale of about a 50% interest to institutional -- overseas institutional investor in the news building. and we have more transactions teed up that we think we'll be able to complete in the fourth quarter.
so we continue to have great success in monetizing our assets, our gains, and we see that continuing to q4. that, of course, enabled us to repurchase about an additional $80 million of stock in the fourth quarter, which brings us close, but not completely rounded out -- i'm sorry, in the third quarter, my mistake. $80 million of stock in the third quarter. and that brings us close, but not completely rounded out to our repurchase objectives for the year. so as we sit here, end of october with a rigorous two month sprint to the finish line to get done, all we need to do to close out this year and then embark on what we feel is going to be a solid 2022 for this company, and more importantly, this city. we're excited. i think it's great to have the call on this day. that is really a historic event for the company to open this wonderful experience. and i hope everybody on this call will see it and see it often, experience it. it's truly -- it's fun, it's exhilarating, it's thrilling, and it's everything we set out for it to be.
with that, i think we'll open up to questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of caitlin burrows with goldman sachs. your line is now open.
caitlin burrows -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi good afternoon everyone. i was wondering if you could just maybe talk about leasing volumes. it looked like they were pretty strong in the third quarter. could you give more detail on what types of your properties are the most interest and ultimately signings versus which has less? and i guess, also, have you seen this activity continue into 4q?
andrew w. mathias -- president
well, we signed over 455,000 square feet, which as we said earlier, we've now exceeded what was our full year projection set out at the beginning of the year, and we're on track to beat that significantly by the end of the year. our pipeline has grown to over 856,000 square feet, the largest that it's been at any point during 2021. and as i think we've seen earlier in the year, a lot of leasing is being driven by either financial service businesses, in particular, and -- who leased 40% of -- it was 40% of our current pipeline and tami, which is about 28% of our current pipeline. and a lot of the activity seems to be focused on the better quality buildings.
thankfully, in our portfolio, the majority of our buildings have enjoyed significant capital investment over the years as we've continued to develop them as healthy workplace environments, and that's paying off for us in helping us increase our leasing velocity. we've got a couple of projects that are in development where amenities and infrastructure upgrades are part of that menu. and we're seeing a lot of good tour activity, strong proposals, and feel very good about the overall velocity as we wrap up this year.
caitlin burrows -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. and then maybe just following up on that kind of investment side. i know you guys are already very active from a development -- redevelopment perspective. but how do you think about continuing that reinvestment or desire to refresh older vintage buildings that haven't been touched recently? so maybe like 1185 avenue of the americas, 1350 avenue of the americas, 110 green street properties like those?
andrew w. mathias -- president
well, i think 1185, we did recently complete a renovation there. but we have big amenity programs going in at 85 third avenue, 750 third avenue, and obviously, one madison development. so where we see that we can be accretive in terms of net effective rents, we'll make the investment in the amenities to attract that type of tenant. but there's also a lot of demand for affordable product, which is still a good portion of our portfolio, and we don't -- we like having space available to address that part of the market as well.
caitlin burrows -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. thanks.

our next question comes from the line of alexander goldfarb with piper sandler. your line is open.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey good afternoon and congrats on the opening of the summit. two questions here. first, just big picture. i think you guys took back the garage at 1515, but away from there, do you see parking as an area of focus for investment? or as you look at the landscape, wherever parking does become available, it's already priced accordingly, such that there's not as much value as there would have been maybe six or seven plus months ago?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
yes, alex, it's matt. so we did actually take back several garages during covid. several operators, one in particular, did not maintain their rent payments, not only in our portfolio, but across the city and more broadly. we elected to take, it's really a total of like eight or nine garages back, and we've started operating them really over the last three to six months or so, they'll be ramping up. so this year, not a huge impact, will be more material when we start get into 2022. as to additional investment, i don't know that it's hit our radar as a deep investment pool of opportunity. but within our portfolio, we have found that given the current environment, we can make good money off of garage if the opportunity presents itself within our existing portfolio to take another back, i'm sure we'd be happy to.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and then, matt, while you're on the phone, i'll hit you for another...
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
i'm not going anywhere, alex.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
no, i know. i know. so the two parter is on wework and the planned one vanderbilt stake sale. so on wework, is that -- have the lease term that you booked, is that the full amount? or is there any more that you're going to get from them? and then as far as the stake sale, you guys have talked about doing that. so i don't know if now this gets pushed into next year. i know you have the december investor day, you'll give us the guidance. but as we start to fine-tune our numbers ahead of the investor day for 2022, just trying to think what sort of onetime items like a lease term or like a stake sale we should be thinking about that may move from this year to next year.
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
sure. so specific to the wework lease termination we announced, that was incremental to our plan. we did not have that baked in. that was a deal that played out over several months, a huge win for us. that is the bulk of the termination payment we received, but not all. there is a portion that will come in -- supposed to come in, in early '22. and the total of those two would be 100 cents on the dollar of the guarantee and letter of credit that wework had on the space. so again, a great accomplishment to get that out of that entity. i think in the face of that, i got several questions as to why guidance wasn't increased by more. if you recall back to december last year, when we gave our full year guidance, we had layered in potential jv interest sales, further jv interest sales in one vanderbilt and one madison.
we are working both of those, but with regard to one vanderbilt because it's done so well, and now we have the summit open and the summit just opening today, ahead of it has been exceeding our expectations, we may elect to defer that interest sale to 2022 or not do it at all. and that sale had with it recognition of incremental income at closing of $9 million to $10 million. so that was baked in our original guidance if we don't do that, which it seems unlikely we will do this year. that offsets the incremental income from the wework termination that we recognized in the third quarter and get back to where we increased our guidance range by $0.05 at the midpoint.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of michael lewis with truist securities. your line is now open.
michael lewis -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you. so that was good color on the change in guidance. i had a guidance-related question as well. when i look at what the full year range implies for 4q, it looks like about $1.35 to $1.55, and my question is really what -- with two months left this year, what's kind of driving that range? is it kind of just giving you some flexibility on either side? or is there a swing factor in there that could go one way or the other on us?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
so important, when we reset the range, we upped the bottom end of the range by $0.15. so clearly, there's not a lot of downside in our numbers, and there is room to the upside. as you look at run rate q3 into q4, a couple of things. one, we have the full quarter effect of some sales that we executed in q3, not the least of which is half of 220 east 42nd street, which is a material contributor. we also have a significantly lower other income amount in q4. we had the wework termination in q3. we also had some other fee income.
now we seem to find fee income every quarter, but we don't project a lot of it. so that goes down. we -- i talked about the -- taking out the sale of an interest in one vanderbilt potentially pushing that to 2022, if we do it at all. and then we've layered into some conservatism as we always do. that's why we keep a range. so could we end up higher than our $6.65 midpoint? sure. but that is not what we guide toward. we guide toward our expected levels in q4, and that's what we set the range to.
michael lewis -- truist securities -- analyst
okay. got it. and then my second question, and i've asked this one before, but as we get closer to let 625 madison ground lease reset, is there any color you could provide on that? or is that something you think when you lay out the 2022 guidance in december that you'll kind of address some expectations for what that could be?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
so there's nothing at this point to report that's new on 625. there is a very prescribed process, we're part of an appraisal process. the appraiser will set the rent, but the appraiser hasn't even been determined yet. that is not going to happen until december at the earliest, and there is no time line as to when the rent will actually be reset. so until such time the process moves along, we don't really have anything new to add to the process.
michael lewis -- truist securities -- analyst
that's good to understand anyway. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of manny korchman with citi. your line is open.
michael bilerman -- citi -- analyst
hey. it's michael bilerman with manny. how are you? marc, my kids are really excited to go up to the summit. it looks really awesome. and i was wondering if you can just step back just on the office market broadly, you have a lot of companies that have had fits and starts to try to bring their employees back. i think that there's a lot of examples of where it's worked and a lot of examples where it hasn't. it definitely feels as though the employees may not be as excited as the ceos or the companies may want them to be. and you've already seen some companies back off from in-office work.
how do you see this playing out over the next 24 months? because it doesn't feel like a switch is just automatically going to go on and everything is going to rush back and it would seem that when companies do put those proclamations in, you could see employees just leave their companies and go to companies where they can get a more flexible work environment, having you any sort of -- and this is not just in new york, right? we're seeing this globally. this really was a trend that no one could have anticipated that we all go remote for now with the better part of almost two years. so how do you -- and by the way, while we may not have been as productive, things still got done. so how do you put all this together? and where do you see things landing overall for the office market?
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
we talked about it on the last call, slowly steadily, the numbers are building, and people are coming back to the office. i think like i said, we're averaging in excess of 30% in peak days or mid -- i think the average is close to 35%, peak days are 40%. some companies may experiment with a day or two a week of flex, but we don't see that impacting their footprint. i mean, i can't project it's going to do in terms of are they going to be five days a week or build some flex into the system. but we have pretty good visibility into is that these same companies, regardless of whatever flexible work model they're going to are still utilizing and mapping and consuming roughly the same amount of space or in some cases, more, and we don't see that many downsizing.
so if somebody works four days a week and they're out of the office one day a week, that person still needs a desk or an office or a workstation. it's not like those four days they just stand there. and we don't see a lot of sharing, hoteling, hot desking. if anything, i think covid has given rise to a little bit more personal space and larger space and partitioning. and i'd say that the era of hot desking is -- we don't see that quite as much. and we see a lot more non-office space being built into these tenant floor plans that we're building. so we will lease this year well in excess of 1 million, 1.5 million square feet.
these are tenants that are making 10-year plus commitments with the knowledge of whatever flexible work program they're going to with an expectation they're going to need and utilize that space or else -- these are sophisticated tenants. they're not going to make these commitments if they don't think they're going to utilize the space. so -- our role is not to try and get into the details of how they're going to work their flexible office. we put the space out there. and these tenants, the management leadership of these tenants, i would almost say to a person, says, we got to get back in the office. that's -- the good news is there's a recognition, which -- that the companies are more efficient, competitive and better if their people are together. i could -- there are few and far between the heads of our tenants who don't immediately come out and say that.
they're just going to evaluate whether there's a model that works for them competitively that allows them to build in some flexibility, but i don't see that in any way materially altering space demand or shrinkage of footprint. i just -- if we see it we're going to relay that to you guys. i mean the numbers sort of speak for themselves. we're still well occupied. amenitized buildings are attracting tenants. and so we're beefing up our amenity program, as andrew said, and we're leasing a lot of space in the pipeline. i don't know if i mentioned the pipeline, yes, it's 830,000 square feet of pipeline. so that -- these are -- this is a pipeline for tenants that have studied and studied where they're going to be with their space plans in the future, and that's where that demand is coming from. so there was flexible workspace before covid.
there's going to be flexible workspace after covid. the business activity in this city right now is as hot as we've ever seen. financial firm and financial profits continue to break record after record. the first half of the year, wall street profit was over $30 billion, and we're on track for over $50 billion again this year kind of matching last year, and last year was the second best year ever recorded. the technology firms are growing. the start-ups are growing. business services are growing.
michael bilerman -- citi -- analyst
so i think that's the intention, right? the economy is growing, everything is doing well, but then you get headlines, pwc going all remote, amazon saying, you know what --
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
but we don't -- our results are not based on headlines. yeah, it more of, but it's not the headlines that result, what ends up in the results column are signed leases. and in that regard, we're sitting at 1.4 million now with an 800,000 square foot pipeline. so i'm not going to go tell all those tenants hey you're not supposed to lease that space. these tenants are coming to us and they want to lease that space. and we're going to lease it to them.
chelsea, everybody said -- to your point, everybody said, oh, fitness centers, are going to have a really hard time. people are going to want to now sit at home in their basements, look at a wall, project an image, work out by themselves. guess what? chelsea just committed to a 55,000 square foot lease for a 20-year term. and we worked with them to come up with a design plan where they're going to be making a big investment in that space. so whatever the headlines say, chelsea piers thinks they're going to put people in 55,000 feet. and you know what? i think they're right.
michael bilerman -- citi -- analyst
yeah. no, i love new york. i live in new york, and i love every aspect of the interactions i get when -- in all the culture activities and when i'm in the office with my team. so that's my personal view, right, and what i feel. the question though is the office market in general and obviously, sl green can do a lot of things for their own company, but the office market at large, just feels that the employees -- every survey that you read, the employees themselves have a lot of hesitation not from safety but they feel that they can do their job effectively. and i just don't know how all that will play out ultimately to --
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
mike, maybe that was the case before covid, if you polled employees before covid, we don't think there were employees who would have said, i think i could be effective at home? i mean, come on. come on.
michael bilerman -- citi -- analyst
no, i know. but now we went through this testified, like we just put the -- everyone around the world remote like it was an experiment and then it has continued. now, i agree with your point that maybe the product --
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
firms who do it are going to suffer. firms who do it, i believe, will competitively suffer and it will work itself out. and businesses are going to operate in the way that produces the best bottom line. that's our opinion. if people don't believe --
andrew w. mathias -- president
it's a difference of opinion from you, michael.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, it's just difference of opinion.
michael bilerman -- citi -- analyst
no, no, it's not my opinion. it was more, so i'm asking the question just as we look at all of this and everything that's happening, i'm just trying to get your sense of things. i'm not trying to say it's my opinion. i enjoyed being in new york.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
the dynamic in the city right now i feel is very strong, because businesses are doing well, people are hiring. it's hard to hire. there's like a land grab for human resources and an educated workforce. we have a pipeline of 826,000 feet. we're filling our buildings. i can't speak to others, and we can operate well in this environment. and the business leaders themselves say we want to bring our people back. i believe at the end of the day, that will be the last word on the topic.
michael bilerman -- citi -- analyst
yes, i appreciate the color marc and look forward to investor day.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question comes from the line of john kim with bmo capital markets. your line is open.
john kim -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you. i was wondering if your views or expectations at the summit have changed at all, either visitors or revenue or now more recently the valuation of the summit due to what's happening at the edge?
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i mean, the summit is doing -- it just opened, so i have to see what our results are from the first hour. but i can tell you that in terms of advanced ticket sales, we are at or ahead of our projections. the people online today, it was like pandemonium down there. people were excited. they were the first ones in the place i've got pictures with hundreds of people on every floor, having a fantastic time. all the feedback from our pre-soft open over the past couple of weeks, really month, has been tremendous.
social media has been great. i have big, big expectations that summit is going to be a hit. and i don't think that's driven by the edge or any other individual particular venue. i think it's just driven by what we've created, which really is differentiated from, i think, anything in the city, anything in the world for that matter. and i think as a company, it is our shareholders and this company is going to benefit tremendously from i think, an ambitious project where i think we hit the market.
john kim -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
but what are your views on the valuation that you have put on the edge and--
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, i don't have any views on the valuation. we just opened it today. ask me -- i mean, generally, i would evaluate it after i see the revenue results. i have my projections of it, i think we're going to vastly exceed those projections. so, i wouldn't value it based on my projections, which are what we went through with you guys in december, we haven't revised those projections, it's still basically the same. with that said, i think we're going to blow them away.
and after a year of operating history, and this is a brand -- i don't look at valuation as kind of the day the door is open. i think it's value we're going to build over the next two to three years as we stabilize this asset. and when we do, we'll look at what stabilized value looks like, but whatever valuation or projections i had nine months ago, i think we're going to do far better.
john kim -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then my second question is on the uipath lease at one vanderbilt. i guess based on public disclosure, it came in at a high initial rent, but the rent bumps are pretty modest afterwards. i think it averaged a little bit over 1%. is that common in signing leases today?
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
when you say is it common, it's not common to sign leases in excess of $200 a foot. the comp set would be zero. so i don't know how common it would be to -- if you went out and said, what is the bump average on -- how big was the uipath lease rent? i mean, how big are the rents? i don't know if you want to go to uipath. i wouldn't talk about uipath.
andrew w. mathias -- president
they may have released rent. but uipath was on our underwriting. it's a tremendous lease. it's a great validation of midtown as a destination for technology tenants, which the narrative is technology tenants don't locate here and it's false. and we're very pleased with the lease.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. anyone who gave you the impression that the uipath or any of the leases we're doing here are kind of underwhelming economics, has got their kind of screw loose.
john kim -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. thank you.

our next question comes from the line of anthony powell with barclays. your line is open.
anthony powell -- barclays -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. just a question on the leasing activity that's been pretty strong this year. when you look at the tenants that have been signing leases, have you noticed any tenants that have a permanent flexible work arrangement signing the same amount of floor space? or do you see those tenants, i guess, redesigning or maybe lowering the amount that they would use on a per employee basis?
andrew w. mathias -- president
well, i'm not -- let me just clarify your question. are you asking us whether or not we see tenants leasing space that includes some component of flex office where they go to a wework type setup? or are you simply saying from a design perspective, are they using their space differently to be more flexible?
anthony powell -- barclays -- analyst
i was trying to ask if tenants who you know to be kind of going to a three or four-day in the office kind of arrangement, and are they -- go ahead.
andrew w. mathias -- president
okay. so -- i will say, broadly speaking -- let me set it up this way. we have the greatest number of large deals, large term sheets being exchanged, leases out that i've ever seen at one point in time being -- large being a 100,000 square foot or larger type transactions in our pipeline that i've ever seen in my entire career. having said that, none of these tenants really know where their requirement is going to be a year or five years from now, not necessarily driven simply by a work-from-home component. they don't know their headcounts. they have confidence that their businesses are going to remain strong, but they're changing how they use the space.
they may or may not have some work-from-home component. and even having said that, we've seen tenants that thought they were going to have a significant work-from-home component that have reversed that decision, have come back to us, in fact, and said, hey, where i was going to give up the space. i no longer want to give up that space or, hey, i actually need to lease more space. so there's a lot of -- i think there's a lot of uncertainty from -- on the tenant side as to where their space requirements are going to go. and not to suggest it's just on the downside. tenants are baking into their leases as much future growth as they are protecting themselves about having flexibility on the downside.
anthony powell -- barclays -- analyst
got it. thanks for that. and just one more on the transaction activity. can you give more detail on 48th and broadway, the deal there? the third-party contesting the rights, so just more details on the strategy and the overall transaction?
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
it's the subject of a pending litigation. so i think what we've released thus far is really all we're in a position to release.
anthony powell -- barclays -- analyst
okay. thanks.

our next question comes from the line of steve sakwa with evercore isi. your line is open.
steve sakwa -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon. marc, i was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the disposition program. you didn't sell a lot other than what you had put under contract earlier, but you talked about a pretty big pipeline, but potentially delaying some jvs? and then how does that sort of tie in with the buyback program moving into fourth quarter?
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, we see delays in jv. i think there was one in particular.
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
just one vanderbilt --
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer

we're not delaying it per se. again, i think there may be a misunderstanding by some as to the -- what's going on here at this building and in summit, the results are extraordinary, and it's not a delay as much as what we're assessing. like we've done in the past is for the benefit of the shareholders, rather than sort of go forward now without leasing up the last 9% of the building and waiting for the full year results from summit or, let's call it, one to one-and-a-half years.
it would just be possibly advised to go forward at this time, because the results of the building are outstripping where we thought we'd be in december of last year. so it's -- we're just sort of electively saying, if we're going to sell an additional interest in the building, let's make sure we're doing it at the optimal time. that's as it relates to ova. i don't think there are any other jvs that we're delaying.
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
that's right.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
and other than that, in terms of new pipeline of sales, we have several assets that are in the market where we're negotiating contracts. and hopefully, those contracts will be in the form to be executed and announceable between now and december investor, i can't make any guarantees on that. but we still see a pretty healthy market, and we still see a couple of deals in our business plan that we hope to knock down by the end of the year.
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
yes. and steve, as it relates to use of proceeds, i think i was asked this question first or second quarter, what we would do with the proceeds of incremental sales. and we said we're going to balance out debt repayment and share repurchases. so we did share repurchase $80 million worth in the third quarter, and we used some proceeds to manage the leverage point, which is something that people push on all the time is our leverage level. so we are balancing that out.
if we are able to close a transaction or two before the end of the year, we'll do the same thing, look at whether it's appropriate to buy stock with that -- with those proceeds or take down leverage. we've been trying to maintain that leverage neutrality. and when we're at the leverage-neutral level, we can buy with the incremental proceeds. we'll continue to do that.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think that's the way of saying, as we put more assets under contract, there's good chance we'll see some more buybacks, right?
steve sakwa -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. and then i don't know if you -- marc, you or andrew, can maybe just comment on the dpe activity that you're seeing. i know it wasn't -- there weren't a lot of paybacks, there weren't a lot of originations in the quarter. but just what does that business look like today? and what are your expectations moving forward?
andrew w. mathias -- president
well, i think there's very, very aggressive first mortgage market, which we'll talk about in more depth at investor day for sure. and that does crowd out when you have higher advanced rate first mortgages, has less demand for mezz dollars. so it's a competitive market out there to find new origination opportunities. and i also think you have less transaction activity than in a normal year. a lot of times, originations come as a result of those transactions. so those two things combined, i think it's a slower sort of market out there for mezz paper. but we're also taking a very conservative approach after raising the liquidity we raised in 2000. the intention is not just a turnaround and fire it back out, and we're being very selective in terms of originations.
steve sakwa -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. thanks.
operator
our next question comes from the line of jamie feldman with bank of america. your line is open.
jamie feldman -- bank of america -- analyst
great. thank you. i guess just sticking with the transaction market, can you just characterize where you think we stand today in terms of risk taking on value add? i mean, it does sound like you're kind of more optimistic about where things are heading in new york city. is there more capital looking now? and how would you explain?
andrew w. mathias -- president
well, i think there's a lot of capital raised. and i think the most notable trade that just closed probably was blackrock cbs' headquarters at 31 east 52nd. that's an older dated 6th avenue product that has not had any capital invested, hasn't been amenitized and has a very aggressive lease rollover schedule and that building traded for a very healthy per foot. so traded for $871 a foot. i think there is a lot of capital out there. there's a lot of owners that are refinancing rather than selling because debt is so cheap, and you can go out long term at very compelling rates. and i do think that there's a lot of activity sort of pending out there as capital comes off the sidelines and gets more comfortable putting money out in new york.
jamie feldman -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and then thinking about inflationary pressures and your ability to offset them. can you talk about where you think -- where -- from an operating perspective, where you are seeing the most inflationary pressures and how you can pass that through? and then, i guess, at the same time, thinking about your ability to raise rents or at least improve economics on leases? like, where do you think you have the most leverage now to improve terms?
andrew w. mathias -- president
well, i think rents, we're not there yet on the commercial space, residential market is basically fully recovered. and i think 185 broadway, which we started leasing in august, september, we'll wind up renting ahead of pro forma. residential rents have fully sort of corrected back. commercial rents, we don't have pricing power anywhere other than our best buildings. i think every landlord is holding the line. i don't think there's erosion in rents by any stretch. but in class a space, demand is there to push rents a little bit. on the expense side, do you want to?
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
we're 93% leased, and the best defense against inflation is to have a well-leased portfolio where increases in operating expenses are passed through to our tenants. and at 93%, we're in a good spot.
andrew w. mathias -- president
i don't think we've seen ramp in...
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
no, we're going through our projections for next year. we, to this point, haven't seen a dramatic increase on the expense side. we'll be looking that again before we give guidance in december.
andrew w. mathias -- president
elective rates are definitely higher and that's all pass-through.
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
but the other side of that is, for the first time in a long time, we're seeing a little bit of a surprise benefit on the real estate tax side, which came in. we got our builds in july, and they came in below our expectation.
andrew w. mathias -- president
right. so that has certainly offset any increase on the operating expense side as it should.
jamie feldman -- bank of america -- analyst
okay and thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of blaine heck with wells fargo. your line is open.
blaine heck -- wells fargo -- analyst
great. thanks. marc, to follow up on some of the flex space questions in the context of getting wework out of 609 fifth, i guess, how are you thinking about flex space in your portfolio going forward? it seems like there's a place in the market for this type of space, but there have certainly been difficulties with the operator. so how are you thinking sl green will offer flexible options in the future, if at all?
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
i mean, if the question is, what do we think about co-working as a viable sector that has -- could have tenancy within the building -- in our portfolio. if that's the question then, i would say we like the co-working sector. we have co-working tenants. we don't have a lot of exposure to that industry. yes, without the wework lease, it's got to be below 3%.
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
below. yes, it's at 1% to 2%.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
1% to 2%. so i mean it's -- in the scheme of the portfolio, it's kind of -- it has no significant representation. but with that being said, we have some very good co-working businesses, some of whom have been around for like as long as i could remember, 10, 20 years, right? i mean, or longer. so i think the business model is fine. it's -- the examples of where people run that business model well, we have emerge. and emerge has been alive and kicking for 20 years, and we have two or three facilities at any one point in time. they stay relatively leased like they are now. and they serve a role in this market.
so we -- it's not a role we focus on, but i do believe there is an important and legitimate role that co-working plays as long as it's based on a sound fundamental model where those tenants are renting at rents more than they can sustain or they don't over improve the space. they improve it to a level that is sustainable. and that's what i've seen the better ones do, and that's what emerge does. but i like the space. it's just -- it's not a very -- it's not a driver, if you will, within the city at this time. it was maybe, i don't know, five years ago or so. three to five years ago, there was a lot more talk about that space. but i think right now, it's kind of settling back to the mean.
blaine heck -- wells fargo -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and then congrats on the lease at one madison. it seems like a great tenant to have in place to drive further interest in leasing there. is there anything you guys can say about the rent chelsea is paying and the concessions involved with that lease versus maybe what you were expecting in your pro forma? and then if you could give any update on any leasing process -- progress at the office space at one madison, that would be great.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
so chelsea lease was -- it's right on pro forma, probably a little bit more capital, but we had not anticipated. what is being built far outstrips or exceeds what we had intended for the space. so it's not a fair comparison. we were looking for a little bit more of -- not that we were looking for, but we had modeled more of a traditional build-out, if you will. we probably didn't have the 60-foot climbing wall, and we probably didn't have...
steve m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
we didn't have full floor retail on the ground floor.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
full floor retail presence that chelsea piers wants because they want that retail presence. so the configuration is different, and the product exceeds our expectation, the capital is probably a little bit higher. but in the context of that deal, where we have massive savings. the excess is out of contingency, there's zero issue to the budget. and as mentioned earlier, the budget is still far under. and the use is as good as we could have asked for.
steve m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
and number one amenity.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. and now it's like it's our number one amenity for us to market off of. and chelsea piers knows that and wants us to, because they want to drive business to their place. and we want to use that as an example of the best of the best kind of tenants that will be attracted to one madison, and want to make it their home or campus. this is a step in that direction. we have other negotiations going with other tenants that i think are equally consistent with that theme.
steve m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
and then, on the office side, we have very robust tenant interest. we've got active term sheets being exchanged. we're not in a position to say whether we'll make any of those deals yet. but as we sit here today, by comparison to where we were in the life cycle of the development of one vanderbilt, the level of large-scale tenant interest at one madison is much earlier to the game than it was at one vanderbilt. i think that speaks a lot about what we're building, the quality of the location and the desire of these large tenants to want to be in an interesting, healthy amenitized work environment that is hard to find on the east side of manhattan. so we're pretty pumped about that, but we don't want to count on anything. it's a little too early to the game. but lots and lots of very good positive term sheets being exchanged.
blaine heck -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. thanks.
operator
our next question comes from the line of ronald kamdem with morgan stanley. your line is open.
ronald kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, two quick ones from me, going back to, i think, the leasing question, year-to-date sort of leasing activity is above 2019, which is pretty impressive. i think you provided color in terms of some of the sub-sectors, whether it's financials or tami. just curious, can we slice it a different way in terms of size, large versus medium and small? is there any sort of notable trends or differences between sort of now and sort of pre-covid levels?
steve m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
yeah. as i said earlier, i've never experienced such a large number of large prospects in our pipeline at any one time. as we sit here today, we have a significant number of large tenants being defined as tenants above 100,000 square feet. and i think compared to prior market disruptions, it always seemed -- in the past, it was a small tenant that sort of were the first ones to come back into the market, whether it was new businesses being formed, there were layoffs and people went off on their own.
in this case, it seems that the leasing recovery is being led by the large tenants who are looking past-covid and, are wanting to, make long-term commitments and spend the capital to reinvent their workplaces to give their employees a reason to want to be in the office. and i think that's -- it's a unique differentiator. but the good news is there's, big boys out there and they are serious about making commitments.
ronald kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. and then, the second question was just thinking about one madison, just curious, was there any sort of lessons learned after executing one vanderbilt, whether it's design, construction or the leasing plan? and sort of getting all those moving pieces together was there any sort of lesson learned or best practices that are applicable to one madison as you're sort of embarking on that project? thanks.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. well, the lessons learned definitely translated from one project to the next because the team is almost identical, in most respects. so that's a big bonus for us. so, if nothing else, just the communication and workflow between the myriad of companies and consultants, etc, is as good now as ever. and there's no learning curve, that's great. in terms of the development plan, they're pretty different kinds of development. i think some of what we learned here is that tenants greatly appreciate, i think, amenity finish, design, thoughtfulness in a way that i think is underappreciated in the market generally, having the sort of best-of-class hospitality-like spaces where you don't really cut corners. but the tenants kind of feel it and see it.
and they know when you've gotten 100% distance to deliver a great product and include great food and beverage experience as part of that and an outdoor experience and space that they can utilize for events and their own uses either during business hours or after. sometimes, developers will build these spaces and they can advertise, they have it, but it's not spaces that tenants really want to bring their guests of hundreds to and/or there's not a food and beverage or hospitality program to support it.
so putting together the human resource element, which is a great hospitality division and personnel with really well-executed food and beverage with really well-designed space and functional thought, that package together is pretty powerful in trying to differentiate product. and so we're just trying to do more of that and do it better at one madison. health -- healthy workplace, i think, is something that is borne out of one vanderbilt but also borne out of covid. so we're putting extra energy and effort into one madison to try and make it at the very top of what it can be from a health, wellness and sustainability aspect. the doas system that i think steve has spoken about previously, if not today, is sort of a hallmark of that project. steve, do you want to just...
steve m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
which -- it will be one of the largest-spec buildings to deploy doas. for those who don't know what it is, it has an ability to 100% circulate outside air as opposed to recirculating interior air. so it makes the workplace a healthier work environment. and it's something that we had designed into the project pre-covid, but it was an emphasis on using cutting-edge technology to create and emphasize healthy workplace that we saw firsthand at one vanderbilt that the tenants put a lot of value into that. so i think to marc's point, great architecture, heavily amenitized, weighted toward food and beverage and outdoor spaces and a healthy working place environment, those were all key factors that has made one vanderbilt so successful and why i think we're seeing such strong interest in one madison at this point in time.
ronald kamdem -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
that's the last question then?
operator
our last question comes from the line of nick yulico with scotiabank. your line is open.
nick yulico -- scotiabank -- analyst
thanks. just a couple of quick ones here. in terms of one vanderbilt, can you just remind us, just on a rough number, what percentage -- or rather what is the gap noi that was actually achieved in the quarter as you're thinking about the ramp that still has to happen? and then also on capitalized interest, can you just remind us how it's going to work with that project, when it gets removed from construction in progress and just how to think about capitalized interest over the next year?
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
sure. i'll get into capitalized interest more in december when i give guidance. but generically speaking, the building opened about a year ago. so one year is your time frame after which you can't capitalize on vacant space but can still capitalize while space that's leased is being built out. so we'll ramp down as space is coming online over the course of 2022. gaap noi for the quarter for one vanderbilt was $9.5 million, our share.
nick yulico -- scotiabank -- analyst
okay. great. thanks. just last question is on, i guess, the fact that leasing volume, you're talking about it is hotter than expected this year? the pipeline is strong as well. you did hit your -- you are going to hit your guidance on occupancy for the year, but you're still down versus pre-covid. so i guess any high-level thoughts on the ability to get back from 93% where you're at today, versus 95%, even 96%, i think you were at some point in 2019.
steve m. durels -- executive vice president, director of leasing and real property
it's still a very unsettled market, nick. so we're pleased with the velocity that we've seen and we've got good tenant demand. but it's hard to predict. there is a lot with the chop still going forward. and we'll have to take one data time.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i just wasn't sure and i don't know that people are still -- i don't know how many people, but we're comparing this environment to what it was 12, 18 months ago -- six, 12, 18 months ago. and it feels really good. we are still at a level in this market right now that's starting from like a 17% or 18% vacancy rate, which is very, very high. and it's going to take a lot to absorb that space, and it will be absorbed. but i would guess most of '22 will be spent absorbing that space. the good news is going to be, directionally, we're going to be heading in the right direction. and the deals are going to firm up and we expect our occupancy to rise. but it's not flip a switch kind of thing. the deals just don't roll out that way. we can only do so much leasing in a year and the market can do so much leasing in a year.
so i think we're very optimistic, but i think we're also very realistic that we're going to have to be on our best game with our best product to get back to the levels we want to be back to. i think i heard it was 95%. we want to get back to like 97%. that's where -- that's when the portfolio is really cooking in, and that's when you have a market environment that's sub 9% vacancy market. we're not there anywhere closer there now. so we'll have to do our best within that framework and hope we can deliver the results in '22.
andrew w. mathias -- president
and honestly, nick, in this market where rents are not truly reflective of the value of the space because of the vacancy in the market that marc was talking about, we actually like to just hold some space off and not lease it aggressively. so that will just -- we do want to get back to that 97%, but we're going to do it appropriately from an economic perspective as well.
nick yulico -- scotiabank -- analyst
all right. appreciate it. thanks, matt, marc everyone.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, nick. all right. operator, is that the last question?
operator
there are no further questions.
marc holliday -- chairman and chief executive officer
okay. we're all going back to the summit. so
matthew j. diliberto -- chief financial officer
