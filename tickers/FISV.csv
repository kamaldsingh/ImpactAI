frank j. bisignano -- president, chief executive officer
thank you, peter, and good afternoon, everyone. 2020 was unprecedented on many levels. we started the year strong. and after entering the pandemic, we continued investing heavily in technology, innovation, our client franchise and our people. we've now entered 2021 with tremendous momentum. your company performed very well given the circumstances across a number of facets of our business. our 22% sales growth for the year demonstrates that we're clearly winning in the client's office. we strengthened our client franchise, raising our client satisfaction scores across all measures. we invest in our people platform, resulting in top quartile engagement scores among companies in the fortune 500. we made outstanding progress on integration. we accelerated and increased synergy execution while ramping our investment in innovative products and solutions. we delivered 12% adjusted earnings-per-share growth for the year, marking our 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted eps growth, and we delivered record free cash flow. we are exiting the year stronger than we entered, and we're well positioned to capitalize on our momentum in 2021 and beyond. let me provide a brief overview of our financial results in the quarter, and bob will provide more detail later on the call.
total company internal revenue growth was 1%. that performance was led by our merchant acceptance segments, which was up 3%, a strong result in light of the global pandemic. total company adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 420 basis points and adjusted earnings per share increased 16%. free cash flow was again excellent, coming in at $1.1 billion in the quarter, bringing free cash flow for the full year to more than $3.6 billion. our sales momentum remains quite strong. fourth quarter sales were up 19%, with terrific results in our credit processing, merchant acquiring and account processing businesses. sales for the full year were up an impressive 22%. the combination of robust sales and excellent pipeline into 2021 is evidence that our formula of bringing the strength and breadth of fiserv's offerings together with our integrated sales model is extremely well received in the client's office and bodes well for the future. now i'd like to update you on how our leading digital-enabled merchant business is performing. through clover, our leading smb platform; carat, our enterprise omni-channel commerce solution; and clover connect, our rich isv solution set, we continue to drive innovation, expand partnerships and deliver leading solutions to our merchant clients.
the momentum within the digital-enabled segments of the merchant business continues to be excellent. clover's gross payment volume grew 25% to $34 billion in the quarter or $135 billion annualized. we continue to extend the breadth of services to clover merchants with innovative solutions that enhance convenience, especially in the digital segment. for example, we recently introduced invoicing capabilities that allow clover merchants, especially those in the services vertical, to build and collect payments from consumers electronically. carat. so our continued growth with global e-commerce transaction is up about 25% both in the quarter and for the full year. we saw our omni-channel transactions, such as order-ahead and pick up in store, grow more than 125% year-over-year with some of our best-known quick service restaurant clients seeing excellent growth. we continue to capture market share winning 46 new enterprise-level e-comm clients in the fourth quarter, including digital acquiring for overstock.com and wingstop in north america. in europe, we signed total, one of the largest energy providers in the world to provide global digital payment acceptance services across more than 100 countries around the world. we also expanded employer relationships, delivering new products and services to key clients such as lyft, where we are now powering disbursements to drivers. clover connect allows us to win new partnerships and drive growth in our partner solutions business. in the fourth quarter, we signed 44 new isv partners, bringing us to 176 new isvs signed for the year.
those new partner relationships are driving strong results in active merchants, up 43% in q4. and strong revenue growth in the isv channel. for example, during the quarter, fiserv signed a strategic partnership agreement with rfms, the largest provider of software services for floor installation professionals to provide omni-channel payment capabilities to their flooring customers. we also signed one of the largest providers of eye care products and technology to provide payment acceptance services to its more than 7,000 eye care professional customers. to further expand our value-added services for merchants, fiserv and citizens financial group have partnered to offer merchants a new suite of lending solutions at the point-of-sale through citizens pay, providing merchants with flexible payment options for customers to finance purchases at the point of sale. the program expands a partnership we've had with citizen since 2015 to provide new financing options. and we expect it to drive adoption in the fast-growing buy now, pay later space. moving to account processing business. we continue to expand the number of privileged relationships we have in our account processing business across financial institutions of all sizes and types. we signed 19 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including five on the dna platform, bringing the total to 60 for the year with 25 on dna. i'd like to highlight a few of our recent wins.
service first, a commercial bank with more than $11 billion in assets, signed on for a full suite of fiserv products including core processing, card services and output solutions. lakeside bank, a full-service bank with more than $2 billion in assets, signed on for our core processing, along with a robust suite of solutions that includes checkfree, debit card services and zelle. i'm also pleased that just recently, republic bank has partnered with fiserv for core processing plus a rich suite of digital and payment solutions. republic is a $5 billion asset, full-service retail and commercial bank that was voted the #1 bank in america for service by forbes in 2020. all of these illustrative wins were competitive takeaways with a common characteristic. they selected a leading core platform plus multiple surround digital solutions to support their goals of sustained growth and superior customer service. i'm also pleased to note that we signed three more de novo banks in the quarter. in our payment and network segment, we continue to see robust sales activity, including several notable card production and personalization wins. we gained a new agreement with capital one to add cap one's more than 1,500 atms to fiserv's money pass atm network, while offering their customers access to thousands of additional surcharge-free atms across the country. and i'm pleased to note that we expanded our long-standing partnership with paypal, signing a deal in the quarter to integrate paypal as a bill payment option for five share billers, a notable synergy sale. with that, let me update you on our integration efforts.
at investor day, we discussed how our integration continues to go extraordinarily well and our synergy execution is far ahead of original schedule. through december 31, we've already actioned over $1 billion of cost savings and are well on our way to fully action a $1.2 billion cost synergies by the end of this year. we entered 2021 with the majority of the integration work behind us and a focus on driving further growth and sustainable value in the years ahead. on the revenue side, we're pleased with the level of synergy sales, which accelerated in the fourth quarter. as of year-end, we've already actioned $215 million in annualized revenue synergies, and our synergy sales pipeline is growing robustly. giving us confidence in meeting or exceeding our $600 million target. our bank merchant program continues to be one of the larger synergy opportunity and offers financial institutions of all sizes and ability to offer their important merchant clients a modern suite of merchant acquiring capabilities including the innovative clover platform, along with digital capabilities like loyalty programs and e-comm solutions. in the fourth quarter, we added 45 new bank merchant clients, bringing the total to 231 new clients since the merger, with more than half of those wins competitive takeaways. the pipeline into 2021 remains robust with over 500 financial institutions, prompting our continued confidence in achieving a sizable revenue synergy opportunity.
one final point on our digital initiatives before turning it over to bob. as you've heard us discuss in the past, one of the most important strategic initiatives is to redefine the client experience by utilizing the latest technology to drive innovation and offer digital capabilities across our payments ecosystem. we've taken two important steps in the last 60 days in this area. first, we acquired ondot systems, the leading digital card services platform for financial institutions of all sizes. we're committed to deploying capital, both organically and inorganically, to develop the digital and data next generational solutions that will drive growth long into the future. and second, further demonstrating our commitment to leadership in this area, we appointed a chief digital and data officer to lead these important strategic growth initiatives across all of fiserv.
now let me pass the discussion to bob for more detail on the financial results.
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, frank, and good afternoon, everyone. we had a strong fourth quarter in light of continued pressure from the pandemic across the globe. total company internal revenue growth was 1% in the quarter, led by the merchant acceptance segment, which grew 3%. for the full year, internal revenue was flat versus last year, in line with our expectations that we communicated during our last earnings call. growth from revenue synergies, which were $46 million in the quarter and $160 million for the year, helps mitigate the impact from continued pressure related to the pandemic. during our last earnings call, we shared that we saw transaction growth rates stabilize at or around july levels. in the fourth quarter, our transaction and payment volume growth rates remain relatively in line with what we saw in the third quarter.
fourth quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 10% to $1.3 billion and adjusted operating margin increased by a very strong 420 basis points to 35.6%, driven by our rigorous cost synergy, execution, which produced $177 million of incremental cost synergies in the quarter as well as strong operating performance. for the full year, adjusted operating income increased by 2% to $4.4 billion, and adjusted operating margin increased 170 basis points to 31.4%, benefiting from $581 million of incremental cost synergies in the year and excellent operational performance. the fact that we improved our margin by 170 basis points to the worst economic cycle in memory is a strong validation of the robust quality and resilience of our business. and since most of the cost actions in 2020 were focused on permanent synergy achievement, not short-term cost savings, we believe our adjusted operating margin improvements are sustainable and expect continued strong improvements in 2021 and beyond. fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 16% to $1.30 compared to $1.12 in the prior year, as adjusted for divestitures.
adjusted earnings per share for the full year increased 12% to $4.42, ahead of our prior expectations. free cash flow in the quarter was once again very strong at $1.1 billion. for the full year, free cash flow increased 11% to more than $3.6 billion. free cash flow conversion was also very strong at 119% for the fourth quarter and 121% for the full year. turning to each of the segments. internal revenue growth in the merchant acceptance segment was 3% in the quarter, an impressive result given the headwinds faced from economy that was hampered by the pandemic. our results were once again driven by strong performances in our portfolio smb clients, supported by our clover platform, enterprise clients supported by carat and another strong quarter from our isv business. for the full year, internal revenue is in line with the prior year. as frank discussed, our clover gpv continues to grow very nicely, up 25% in the quarter despite the difficult macroeconomic environment for smbs. we feel great about the strength of that portfolio in 2020 and even better about its performance in the months and quarters ahead as we get beyond the pandemic.
our integrated payments, or isv business, continues to perform extremely well with continued strong revenue growth in the quarter. as we discussed at our investor day, we recently rolled out clover connect, a clover integrated solution for isvs. we believe that this solution will further extend our differentiation for isvs and their merchant customers and continue to drive excellent growth in the future. adjusted operating income in the aerospace -- excuse me, in the acceptance segment increased 8% to $443 million in the quarter. adjusted operating margin was up 280 basis points in the quarter to 30.7% and increased 150 basis points sequentially. on our q2 earnings call, after reporting our covid impact at low point for our acceptance financial results, we said the segment's adjusted operating margin was expected to improve by more than 800 basis points in the second half of 2020 compared to the first half. we're pleased to achieve that with our second half acceptance margin of nearly 1,000 basis points, bringing our full year margin to 25.4%. the fintech segment internal revenue declined 1% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year as growth in high-quality recurring revenue was again offset by much lower periodic revenue, most prominently, termination fees, which created approximately 350 basis points of headwind to internal revenue growth in the quarter. for the full year, internal revenue was in line with the prior year.
the shift toward digital banking took a strong step forward in 2020 with lockdowns leading consumers and businesses alike to consider new ways of banking, and we continue to see strong demand for a broad array of digital solutions as a result. for example, total mobile subscribers across our leading digital platforms, mobility and architect, grew 15% in the quarter. architect implementations continue at a strong pace. in fact, during the second half of the year, we completed more architect implementations than in all of 2019, an excellent indicator for future growth. fiserv offerings such as remote data capture, have allowed our fi clients to offer safe, convenient and fast self-service check deposits for their consumer and commercial clients, while improving efficiency in their own results. mobile deposits in q4 grew 33% over prior year and were up more than 30% for the full year, while self-service atm deposits grew more than 50% in both the quarter and full year. adjusted operating income was up a strong 14% in the quarter to $271 million and grew 12% in the full year to $992 million. adjusted operating margin in the segment increased a robust 590 basis points in the quarter to 36.5% on a combination of growth in processing revenue, operational effectiveness benefits and cost synergies.
for the year, adjusted operating margin was up an impressive 510 basis points to 34.2%. and as the benefits of growth in processing revenue in our highly scaled business and the combination of both synergy and productivity gains more than offset the impact from lower periodic revenue. the payments and network segment saw internal revenue decline 1% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year as growth in our international issuer, card services and output solutions businesses, including the benefit of revenue synergies, was more than offset by covid-driven impacts elsewhere in this segment. internal revenue for the year was in line with the prior year. debit transactions continue to show very stable levels of growth in the mid-single-digit range. we've seen this consistent mid- to high-single-digit transaction growth since june. and remain confident that this level is sustainable going forward. we continue to see excellent transaction growth in solutions, such as account-to-account and p2p. zelle transactions in the quarter more than doubled compared to prior year and were up 18% sequentially. the number of clients live on zelle has grown significantly this year, nearly tripling our client count compared to a year ago, and we expect continued strong growth in 2021 and beyond.
adjusted operating income for the segment was strong, up 5% to $660 million in the quarter, and was up 6% to $2.4 billion for the year. adjusted operating margin was up 300 basis points to 46.4% in the quarter and was up 280 basis points to 43.3% for the year. the positive impact of both revenue and cost synergies drove our solid adjusted operating income results, both in the quarter and the full year. the adjusted corporate operating loss was $87 million in the fourth quarter and $404 million for the full year, a 5% improvement over last year. this improvement was driven by a combination of cost synergies and productivity as well as lower variable compensation, partially offset by incremental covid costs. the adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.7% and 20.9% for the full year, down slightly from the prior year. for 2021, we expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate fairly consistent with the 2020 rate in the range of 21% to 22%. however, we do expect some variability in the rates by quarter, given different comparison points and the timing of discrete tax items. as such, we expect our q1 2021 effective tax rate will be higher than q1 last year. as previously communicated, our capital allocation priority for the second half of the year was to focus primarily on debt repayment. we repaid $740 million of debt in the quarter and $1.8 billion in the year. we also repurchased 1.8 million shares of stock for $200 million in the fourth quarter, bringing total capital allocated to share repurchase to $1.6 billion for the full year. we have 65.7 million shares authorized for repurchase as of december 31.
in rounding out our top capital allocation priorities, as frank mentioned earlier, in december, we announced the acquisition of the ondot systems and closed that acquisition in january. total debt outstanding was $20.7 billion at december 31 and debt-to-adjusted ebitda dropped to 3.6 times. we are well on track to achieve our targeted leverage in the second half of 2021 as we anticipate both strong adjusted ebitda growth and some further debt repayment this year. as you heard us emphasize throughout our investor day in december, we are fully committed to our long-standing capital strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, organic investment in innovative solutions and high-value acquisitions like ondot. importantly, share repurchase remains our benchmark for capital deployment.
with that, let me turn the call back to frank.
frank j. bisignano -- president, chief executive officer
thanks, bob. we expect 2021 internal revenue growth to be 8% to 12% for the full year. this is modestly better at the bottom end of the range than our preliminary outlook we shared at our recent investor day. given our current view of economic conditions, including the second stimulus in late december, and the prospect of a third stimulus package later this quarter, the significant growth rate acceleration relative to 2020 is driven by the multi-pronged impacts of our current expectations for an improving global economy, the overall continuing strength in our global merchant business, the cumulative impact of sales and implementation and continued achievement of in-year revenue synergies. we expect 2021 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.30 to $5.50, which is $0.05 above the range we provided at our investor day in december. the improvement is driven by the stronger exit rate from 2020 and the benefit of stimulus programs in the u.s. we expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 250 basis points. and free cash flow conversion will be greater than 108% for the year. our internal revenue and adjusted eps growth rate assumptions are grounded in our internal assumptions of when and how the economy will recover from the pandemic in 2021.
the midpoint of our guidance generally assumes improvement of the pandemic and increased vaccinations throughout the first half of the year, leading to economic recovery in the second half. there are several factors that we believe will impact the quarterly cadence of the year-over-year growth rates, largely driven by lapping our 2020 performance, which included pre-pandemic performance for much of the first quarter, the depth of the impact in q2 and then the start of improvement in the second half. quarterly results may vary, including rates that may fall outside of the full year guidance range both on the low and high end for a particular quarter. we expect q1 to be our toughest comparison and q2, the most favorable comparison, then see more normalized comparisons for the second half of the year. throughout this past year, every fiserv associate was challenged to work differently, to reimagine how we do our jobs to serve our clients, who in turn were learning how to serve their customers. faced with these challenges, i'm proud of our results. across a number of measures, 2020 was a successful year. our client satisfaction scores improved measurably during a time when our clients needed us the most. we saw our employee engagement scores improve even as we executed against a complex integration and through a pandemic.
we meaningfully increased our synergy targets and accelerated the time to achieve those targets and then regress the integration of first data to the verge of completion in 2021. and at the end of the day, your company achieved its 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted eps growth. among the most important initiatives your company undertook was the creation of our forward together plan to be a force for positive change in our communities. our forward together plan is a 4-part commitment to support and empower underrepresented associates, business owners and not-for-profits. a pillar of our forward together plan, the back2business program was launched last summer. as part of back2business, we committed to invest $10 million to support black and minority-owned business owners and entrepreneurs.
we are well into that monetary commitment and are now meaningfully increasing it to $50 million. as a further indication of our commitment to continued progress in this important initiative, we recently appointed a senior executive as head of corporate social responsibility to lead these efforts for fiserv as well as oversee sustainability efforts for the organization. fiserv was once again named a world's most admired company for the eighth consecutive year with excellent scores in people management, social responsibility and a host of other categories. this is well-deserved recognition of the more than 40,000 hardworking and caring fiserv associates around the world. i will close by thanking all of them, for working relentlessly to serve our clients and you, our shareholders.
with that, operator, let's open the line for questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question is from lisa ellis from moffettnathanson. your line is open.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. good stuff guys. first question for me is on carat. you called out 46 new enterprise wins in merchant acceptance this quarter. can you describe how the launch of carat is improving your value proposition in the enterprise space, and maybe give some color on some of the customer feedback you're getting on that offering?
frank j. bisignano -- president, chief executive officer
well, i think the strategic point around carat is that we've integrated for ease of access globally, so although it could be utilized in many currencies in many countries, its multinational capabilities is resonating very, very well in the client's office. and that ease of access, its ability to optimize acceptance is really what's driving a very high win rate there.
and the engineering underneath it was bringing to a single platform, a single instance and ability to execute globally. and as you've heard us talk about through the course of the year, the hundreds of wins that we've had institutionally, and those are in active, big names that are leaning into the commerce and economy. so it's resonated very well in the client's office, a lot of work done by the team to build it out and get it to be the platform that's winning in the market.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
good stuff. my follow-up quick one is for bob. could you just give a little color on the segment level outlooks for 2021, and also what type of transaction growth or unit growth you're anticipating or is embedded in your outlook? thank you.
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure, lisa. we don't give specific guidance by our individual segments, but let me try to give you a little bit of color to get you directionally. obviously, if you look at our merchant acceptance segment, it represents about 40% of the overall company revenue. we had given during investor day, an expectation of mid-term or medium-term growth of about 9% to 12%. we certainly expect in 2021 to be above even the high end of that as we rebound/recover from what has certainly been a pretty difficult year and, in particular, in second quarter of 2020.
frank laid out a little bit of some of the key assumptions that we've got in our overall revenue and eps growth for that matter. and it certainly plays a key part in the improvement, accelerated growth in the merchant segment, things like having a large number of folks vaccinated, seeing some of the restrictions that are in place, particularly in europe, but even across the united states, being lifted and seeing a recovery -- a general economic recovery in the second half of the year.
if you look at the fintech segment, very much impacted this year by periodic revenue. we've seen that really across the year, in particular, in the second half of the year, but even a little bit in the first half and overall impact this year. as we look to 2021, we see some of that persisting in q1 and a bit into the second quarter. but by the time we get to the second half of the year, we see that headwind subsiding such that we would expect the fintech segment, which has medium-term outlook of about 4% to 6%, to be in that range for the full year 2021. and we're not counting on a recovery or a rebound of a periodic revenue/termination fees. it's really that we lap the pretty significant decline we've had over the last several quarters, and it doesn't continue. and so we'll see benefit really in the second half of 2021.
and then the final segment, the payments segment, again, about the other 40% of the overall company. medium-term guidance here was 5% to 8%. i would expect this segment to probably be at the upper end of that range in 2021, as we see transaction growth improve kind of post-covid, in particular, in our bill pay business, some of our prepaids and, of course, as you know, we have a leading position in retail private label. and as those retailers improve, again, particularly in the second half of the year, we'll see some improvement.
and of course, you certainly heard us talk about some very significant wins in our issuer processing business in this segment. the very large ones that we talked about during the last earnings call really won't provide much lift in 2021. but there are quite a few below those top three. it don't take quite as long to implement, and you'll see some of those come on into 2021, and again, provide some nice growth into that business, into that segment.
and the last driver of that business, i'd probably point to is zelle. as i mentioned on my prepared remarks, nearly a tripling number of fis on zelle through fiserv and not only do we see that continuing to grow, but also more and more consumers choosing a bank-centric p2p network and seeing more transaction volume. so that gives us some confidence that we'll be kind of in the upper end of the mid-term range of 5% to 8%.
and the last thing i'd point, lisa, is we're going to see some probably unique variation in the growth rates by quarter. again, frank talked a little bit about this in his prepared remarks. q1, as you recall, in 2020, was essentially covid-free for, call it, roughly 10 of the 13 weeks of the first quarter. and we had, had a very strong first quarter until covid hit really at the latter part of march and, obviously, very significantly in q2. so i would expect q1 to not only be our lowest point in the quarter in terms of growth rate year-over-year, but actually probably be below the guidance range with a rebound and the opposite take place in the second quarter when you have much easier comps, will be on the -- above the upper end of our guidance range. such that by the time we exit the first half of the year, we're trading in that -- within the overall internal revenue growth and eps guidance range on the first half basis and be set nicely for the second half.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
fantastic color. thank you very much.
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from dave koning from baird. your line is open.
dave koning -- baird -- analyst
hey, guys. great year.
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thanks, david.
dave koning -- baird -- analyst
yeah. yeah, i guess first of all, i guess, sort of a similar question just on margin expansion by segment. i know you don't give a lot of color on this, but the merchant segment was the one that was actually still down year-over-year for margins in 2020, where the other two nicely expanded. so should we expect as revenues come back in that segment for that one probably to be the most benefited by margin expansion than the other two closer to the guidance range?
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah, you're probably not too far off in that thinking. you hit the issue right on the head. obviously, we had an extremely difficult second quarter. both in terms of revenue and margin in that segment, really nice recovery sequentially in the second half of the year. and so we head into 2021 in much better position than we did in the first half, so we'll see some nice improvement.
again, you'll get the benefit of the comparison point in second quarter of 2021. overall, i would say, when we closed the books, 12 months from now, we're on this call, i would expect margin expansion in all three segments and probably a bigger lift out of merchant acceptance business.
dave koning -- baird -- analyst
got you. thanks. and then just a follow-up, one thing you don't talk a lot about is the equity income line. it's about 5% of total profits. but i would imagine that got hit pretty hard this year, just the bank jvs and stuff and might correlate more with the merchant segment, so it would probably be up more than just the average business. i don't know if that's a good way to think about it, but i just wonder if there's any context around the equity income line.
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer and treasurer
no, actually, i think that's exactly the way to think about it. and you're right, that's the largest portion of that is the merchant joint ventures. and as we see the merchant business overall recover, i'd expect to see the joint ventures participate in that and help with that equity line.
dave koning -- baird -- analyst
awesome. thanks guys.
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, david.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from andrew jeffrey from truist securities. your line is open.
andrew jeffrey -- truist securities -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. appreciate you taking the question. my question is really around a couple of, i guess, tech-enabled initiatives, generally in merchant. i'm thinking about e-comm and the enterprise e-comm business and also omni generally, great kpis in terms of volume. bob, can you speak to yield contribution, and also maybe even clover? i assume these are higher-yielding transactions. and given the growth rates should blend up acceptance organic revenue growth, all things considered, i'm just trying to think about order of magnitude and impact from your tech-enabled business generally.
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. certainly, you're on the right track. clover, with obviously heavy exposure in smbs, generally has higher yield. and in general, tech-enabled does. certainly, the thing to consider though is that was a big element of the growth in 2020. and so you don't necessarily see a massive acceleration of that because that was actually one of the things that helped the overall growth rate of the merchant segment.
as small businesses and retail broadly shut down again, particularly in the second quarter, people moved to tech-enabled e-commerce type transactions. and you heard us report very strong growth throughout the year in overall clover volume. we'll obviously see that continue. but as a percent of the overall share of activity within the merchant segment, you won't necessarily see a big change overall. so the margin improvement really is driven by continued productivity, scale business benefit as well as synergy benefits.
andrew jeffrey -- truist securities -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. thanks. and just as a quick follow-up, frank, you called out the bank channel, which is a part of your distribution network that i know you know very well, spent a lot of time on. lots of new banks, do you feel like you can get adequate productivity out of that channel long term, especially as it relates to smb merchant acquiring or acceptance?
frank j. bisignano -- president, chief executive officer
yeah. i think, yes. it's 100%, yes. and i would think about, it in multiple ways. one, i would think about the bank channel itself. the other i think about, distribution partners also. you've seen us announce verizon, paychex, deluxe. so these are contact points where, in fact, they're touching smbs. and they think they'll enhance their relationship with the smb, through a clover offering.
i mean, you see verizon, packaging us in their offering now. so, i'd like to take a broader perspective on the partnership. and then, we could drop down to what we're doing with our bank partners. and because we have these privileged relationships in the core, the ability to brand feels very, very good and very strong.
will it have the same margin as our fabulous carat offering? the answer would be no. but if you think about our ability to deliver and grow merchants throughout the country, it's very, very high and very powerful. in some of the cases, it's just penetrating their base. it gives them a new offering into their base. our ability to do it digitally is much higher than it would have been two or three years ago.
so completely accretive and is fundamentally our responsibility with our bank partners to do this, to bring them the possibility. and it's actually a revenue generator for them also. so, from that perspective, it's good for our partnerships. it deepens it. we're building integrated stacks that caused them to have a better relationship with their client also.
andrew jeffrey -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks a lot.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from darrin peller from wolfe research. your line is open.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
all right. hey, guys. thanks. i want to circle back to clover for a minute, because we've done a lot of work on it recently. again, it was up 25%, as you guys said. and combined with other kpis, like the omni kpi, i think, 100%, it would seem that your market share position is up year-over-year.
and so i'm curious if you can give us a sense of the -- like the growth, if there was growth in the number of mids -- or the number of the merchant count year-over-year, when you couple that in the smb side together with the -- with both domestic and international and even the enterprise side sounded strong.
so really just more than volume growth and revenue growth, i'd be curious to hear anything you can share about number of merchants and the experience in the smb side versus enterprise.
frank j. bisignano -- president, chief executive officer
well, why don't i talk to you a little bit about the strategy behind it, and why that growth is happening? and it really is about market share gains. its market share gains in the isv space. its market share gains in the e-comm space. and then, its market share gains on the smb.
and really, clover has played a significant role in that. i mean, back to the question about bank partnerships and bank distributions, that's one avenue for us. so what we've seen is growth in all of those. and if you think about, what's happened and the question one might ask is, how has your business performed as it has. it's because of the fabulous client base we have, in general.
and then secondarily, us having invested heavily before we got here, actually in '17, '18 and through '19, we had a good strong industry-leading growth rate through '19. and then the combination of the two companies allowed us to be able to grow all facets of this. and i would say, when you look at it, it's growth across all of it; across smb in every manner, shape and form; across isvs as we didn't have a big position, and we continue to grow that out, and that will continue that pipeline is strong; and then bringing us into really carat offering to our large institutional clients. so it is about market share gains.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. and then just my quick follow-up is on the capital allocation. i know we left your investor day looking forward to maybe $5 billion potential or even $5 billion to $6 billion of potential capital allocation potential per year. when we think about your appetite right now, frank or bob, when we think about coming out of this blackout period pre earnings, should we expect that you guys see the stock as undervalued like many of your investors do that you'd be proactive about it now going forward from here?
and just to remind us, is that right, the right way to think about it where there's maybe as much as $4 billion to $6 billion or $5 billion to $6 billion of potential? or maybe just between buybacks and deleveraging? thanks.
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yes, darrin. i think the $5 billion to $6 billion, i assume you're getting we -- during investor day, talked about $30 billion of capital available over the next five years. we certainly expect very good free cash flow into 2021. we had a great 2020 and see that continuing this year. and certainly, we continue to focus on capital deployment through the eyes or through the lens of share repurchase. we certainly would tell you that where the share price is today. we're a buyer.
and i don't think you'll find many cfos that tell you otherwise, but we're certainly trading below 52-week high. and given where we see 2021's results and where valuations have moved, we think there's a real opportunity. and so you'll see us continue to be active. we pretty much are in the market every quarter. i think we have been, for the five years, i've been here other than when we suspended for a couple of quarters post announcing the merger with first data, and we'll continue to do that.
we do have some debt to pay down with the balance of this year. but i'm a big believer of ""the genius of the end."" and like we did in 2020, we'll pay down some debt, we'll buy back some shares, and we'll do some acquisitions. and we'll continue to do that aggressively across the company. frank, you want to add anything?
frank j. bisignano -- president, chief executive officer
no. i think as we laid out in investor day, and even if you look at what we've done over the past year and changed, you see a very balanced approach. we'll buy back shares or pay down debt, and we'll strategically acquire assets.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
got it. thank you guys.
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thanks, darrin.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jeff cantwell from guggenheim securities. your line is open.
jeff cantwell -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. and thanks for taking my question. i wanted to ask you about the ondot acquisition. can you talk a little bit about the fit there now that ondot is part of the team? it sounds like it's a very nice business, have some good scale to it. it sounds like it's a modern platform. so it seems like it's going to be a nice addition. can you tell us a little bit more about that?
and then how can ondot be enhanced, if that's the right word for it, by becoming part of fiserv full time? in other words, what are the future synergies or the future opportunities you see there on a combined basis now that it's onboard? any color there would be great. thanks very much.
frank j. bisignano -- president, chief executive officer
yes. first of all, we know ondot very well for a long time, had a great relationship. and the -- one of the founders actually came over to our company earlier. and so we -- and then we had always had a deep relationship with management. so i'd consider this a company we knew very well. and we could strategically think about how to integrate platforms. i think we always view it as the leading card-enablement platform for virtual access. but when you bring it inside to the company, our excitement and the founder's excitement are that we can do something much larger than they could have done on their own.
and if you think about the clover acquisition and what it turned into, there's great similarities. of course, this is a much larger enterprise. we definitely increased our digital dna inside the company. it will be a complement to our sunnyvale -- large sunnyvale presence with clover and then with us sitting up a chief digital and data officer, the ability to ultimately take debit, credit, core banking and give our financial institutions the opportunity to have one click for their clients to get to all of that data is really where we're taking it.
we've already inked a first win as a new company, a large name institution. so we feel great about it. i think we knew it well, so it was easy to integrate, and we are deep in integration meetings weekly and driving the top-line. and i think you could look forward to us having large growth and digital presence through its acquisition.
jeff cantwell -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
okay. i appreciate the color. i'm excited to see what you stating. thanks very much.
frank j. bisignano -- president, chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from david togut from evercore isi.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you. looking at the $500 million innovation fund you announced at the time of acquiring first data, could you address how much of that innovation spending you expect to occur this year? what's built into the adjusted operating margin expansion target of at least 250 basis points? and then are there any call-outs on specific new product innovations that we should watch out for in the next 12 months?
frank j. bisignano -- president, chief executive officer
well, thank you for that. and so we had talked about a year ago or so. we had created a number of working groups within the company to begin the generation of where these next ideas for innovation would come. and the output product of that actually was the ending up of creating a chief digital and data officer within the company. and that would have a structure to allow us to deploy the $500 million. of course, we already have begun that, and begin to do it in a way that will accelerate growth as we go forward.
now if you go back to investor day, we had talked about the $500 million was in our outlook that we had given you. but there was nothing on the top line for it and we're already spending it. so i think what you can find today is a set of initiatives, a series of projects being deployed, a structure built inside the company with a chief digital and data officer to be able to help it move forward in a manner that is across the whole company. and so i would think as we get into the second half of this year and you move into next year, you'll start seeing these digital and data initiatives, which ultimately will roll into the p&l on the top. and so ondot isn't viewed as part of the 500, but the capability it brings will allow us to move at a faster rate on many of the digital and data innovations. and what i'd say, connecting the white space between the four pillars of our business to allow us to unlock opportunity for our clients. bob, anything you want to add?
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah, dave, in terms of spending this year, certainly fully encompassed in our overall guidance and gets us still the 20% or 24% eps growth and at least 250 basis point margin improvement. there will be some incremental spend this year, of course, recall this is a fair amount of development. and so a portion of this gets capitalized, drawn on the balance sheet and comes over time. and so it isn't necessarily a big increase year-over-year and, again, certainly fully encompassed in our overall guidance.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
and our last question comes from tien-tsin huang from jpmorgan. your line is open.
tien-tsin huang -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thank you so much. just one question on new sales. i know up 19% i think, in the fourth quarter, 22% for the year. i'm curious, how you feel about the new sales outlook? or what kind of targets you set internally for fiscal 2021? do you feel good about compounding at that smo level?
frank j. bisignano -- president, chief executive officer
yeah. i mean we had talked about during the course of last year and through investor day that we see ourselves being close to a 20% sales growth company in terms of institutional sales because that's what we're really talking about there. so -- and january is off to a really good start. so i feel really good about january. so that's where i got to start thinking about it. and the pipeline of opportunities is robust. so i mean, it is a very well-received integrated model in the client's office. and so -- and then with our client stats going up, i think that bodes very well. our employee engagement going up inside the company, while we protected them in this very tough time, so i think we feel very good about what's going to happen during the course of this year around that.
tien-tsin huang -- jpmorgan -- analyst
excellent. thank you.
frank j. bisignano -- president, chief executive officer
well, i'd like to thank everybody for joining us this afternoon. we tremendously appreciate your support. if you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact us, and have a great evening. thank you for your time.

and now i'll turn the call over to frank.
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, shub. great to have you on the team. 2021 is off to a strong start with q1 at or better than our expectations across a broad range of metrics. the strength of our results reflects our continued investment in technology, innovation, our client portfolio and our people through the covid-19 pandemic. let me provide a brief overview of our strong financial results in the quarter. you may have noticed that q1 earnings presentation has been updated. if you're following along. i will provide some overview comments captured on the first three pages. and then bob will provide more detail on a subsequent slides.
total company internal revenue growth was 4% for the quarter, including low double-digit growth in march. that performance was led by our merchant acceptance segment, which was up 8%, an exceptional result in light of the global pandemic and continued covid restrictions, particularly in brazil, india and a variety of countries in emea for much of the quarter. adjusted operating margin grew 360 basis points resulting in an 18% increase in adjusted earnings per share. free cash flow grew 8% to $821 million, a 100% conversion to adjusted net income. our sales momentum remains quite strong as first quarter sales were up 42%, which strong results in our payments and international businesses and this momentum continues into the second quarter.
yesterday, we announced a 20-year agreement with caixa economica federal to become the exclusive provider of merchant acquiring services. caixa is one of brazil's largest banks with more than 26,000 sales outlets and a broad presence throughout all of brazil, making this one of the largest wins for our company in latin america and one of the largest globally. also this morning, we announced a new solution with paypal to enable our merchant network across the clover and carat platforms to accept payments via paypal and venmo through qr codes presented at the point of sale. we believe this is an important offering for our merchants as consumer preferences continue to shift toward touch free transactions. the combination of robust sales and excellent pipeline is evidence that our formula of bringing the strength and breadth of fiserv's offerings together with our integrated sales model is extremely well received in the client's office and we believe bodes well for the future.
now i'd like to update you on how our leading digital enabled merchant business is performing through clover, our leading smb platform, carat our enterprise omni-channel commerce solution and clover connect, our rich isv solutions set. we continue to drive innovation, expand partnerships and deliver leading solutions to our merchant clients. the momentum within the digital enabled segments of the merchant business continues to be excellent. clover's gross payment volume grew 36% year-over-year to $141 billion annualized. to provide some more context around the strength of the clover platform, gpv has grown 75% from $81 billion in q1 2019 in q1 to $141 billion in q1 this year, despite the economic headwinds from the pandemic. carat, our enterprise omni-channel solution, continued to perform very well. e-commerce transactions grew 24% compared to prior year. omni-channel transactions such as order ahead and pickup in store were up over 122% year-over-year.
we won a record 51 new enterprise level e-commerce clients in the first quarter, including cost plus world market, a us specialty retailer for which fiserv has been chosen to provide e-commerce gateway, point-of-sale hardware devices and value-added services like security tokenization. we had a very strong result sales internationally. the notable wins in emea include selecta, europe's leading self-service retailer offering coffee and convenience food solutions for which fiserv has been chosen to provide acquiring services and unattended pos hardware. in latam, we extended our relationship with one of the largest e-commerce marketplaces in the region. in apac, we won the merchant acquiring business where australia's second largest bill payment provider.
we also expanded our relationship with key brands such as state barn [phonetic] where we are piloting a new digital payout experience for insurance claims. recognizing our innovation to bring digital payments to all consumers, fiserv was named one of the world's most innovative companies by fast company for our role in enabling the acceptance of us department of agriculture snap online ebt payments during the pandemic. we continue to see great momentum in the isv space with clover connect. in the first quarter, we signed 42 new isv partners. our continuing strength and expanding partner relationships is driving strong results in active merchants, which were up 38% in q1 and isv channel revenue growth, which was up 34%.
for example, during the quarter, fiserv further cemented its lead in the mortgage servicing software vertical by signing a strategic partnership agreement with mortgage cadence, an accentured company, which provides more origination software to the mortgage industry. this is yet another example of a successful integrated cell continuing to fuel future growth in our isv channel. additionally, we are continuing to build and enhance our existing isv relationships by leveraging our technology and market knowledge. in the quarter, we finalized an agreement with e-tail head [phonetic] to move their large set of existing merchants to us and build upon the agreement we had in place for new merchants.
moving to our account processing business, we continue to expand our [indecipherable] relationships across financial institutions of all sizes and types. we signed 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including five on the dna platform. i'd like to highlight a few of our recent wins. as we mentioned on our last earnings call, we signed republic first bank, a commercial bank with more than $5 billion in assets and rated america's best bank by forbes for a full service of fiserv products including core processing, card services and output solutions in february. additionally, we signed two de novo banks in the quarter, including genesis bank, a newly chartered bank focus as a minority depository institution. this win continues to show our commitment to supporting minority communities. majority of these illustrative wins were competitive takeaways with a common characteristic. the client selected a leading core platform plus multiple surround digital solutions to support their goals of sustained growth and superior customer service. these wins also like the strength of our offering for a wide range of clients from de novo banks to large financial institutions.
in our payment and network segment, we continue to leverage the power of our combined solutions to drive revenue synergies. in q1, we signed a significant new agreement to provide statement and letter services to a major us healthcare services provider strengthening our position in this industry vertical. further building on our digital momentum in q1, we signed agreements to provide digital solutions to first horizon bank as well as 10 fed credit union in both cases leveraging our newly acquired ondot capabilities. through ondot, we can enable our fi [phonetic] clients to offer their cardholders personalized, real time digital experiences, driving cardholder engagement and spend. we expect continued adoption of these digital solutions across our client base.
with that, let me update you on our integration efforts. through q1, we've already actioned nearly $1.1 billion of cost savings and are well on our way to fully action $1.2 billion cost synergy objective by the end of this year. with the majority of the integration work behind us, we are focused on driving further growth and sustainable value in the years ahead. on the revenue side, we're pleased with the level of synergy sales, which accelerated in the first quarter. as of the end q1, we've already actioned $265 million in annual revenue synergies and our synergy sales pipeline is growing robustly. and we expect to meet or or exceed our $600 million target over the five years post-merger. our bank merchant program continues to be a synergy opportunity and offers financial institutions of all sizes, the ability to offer their important merchant clients a modern suite of merchant acquiring capabilities, including the innovative clover platform along with digital capabilities like loyalty programs and e-commerce solutions.
in the first quarter, we added 34 new bank merchant clients, six with assets over $1 billion. additionally, half of these wins were competitive takeaways. the pipeline remains robust through the rest of 2021. one final point on our digital initiatives before turning it over to bob. as you've heard us discussed in the past, one of the most important strategic initiatives is to redefining the client experience by utilizing the latest technology to drive innovation and offer digital capabilities across our payments ecosystem. an example of that commitment to this area is the acquisition of ondat systems, a leading digital experience platform provider for financial institutions of all sizes, which closed in the first quarter. we also acquired raduis8, a cloud-based platform that had hyperlocalized commerce capabilities to carat thereby enhancing our beyond the buy button strategy. last but not least, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire pineapple payments, a leading iso focused on integrated payments.
now, let me pass the discussion to bob for more detail on our financial results.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
thank you frank and good morning everyone. if you're following along at our new slides, i'll cover some detail on each of our segments. we had a strong first quarter in light of continued pressure from the pandemic across the globe. q1 represents the final period of pre-pandemic comparison points with the impact beginning to materialize in the final two weeks of march last year. total company internal revenue growth was 4% in the quarter led by the merchant acceptance segment, which grew 8%. first quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 15% to $1.1 billion and adjusted operating margin increased by a very strong 360 basis points to 31.4%. this margin improvement was driven by our rigorous cost synergy execution, which produced $129 million of incremental cost synergies in the quarter as well as strong operating performance. first quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 18% to $1.17 compared to $0.99 in the prior year. free cash flow in the quarter was $821 million, up 8% over q1 last year and 103% percent conversion to adjusted net income impacting q1's free cash flow was an increase in accounts receivable driven by a strong rebound in march.
turning to each of the segments, internal revenue growth in the merchant acceptance segment was 8% in the quarter. our results were once again driven by strong performances in our portfolio of smb clients supported by our clover platform, enterprise clients supported by carat and another strong quarter from our isv business. this result includes a meaningful headwind from our emea region, which experienced restrictions for much of the quarter in several important markets for us including the uk, germany, ireland and poland. as frank discussed, our clover gpv continues to grow very nicely, up 36% in the quarter. the outlook for the smb business looks strong as a sequential uplift that we witnessed in this business in the last few weeks of march has continued through april. our integrated payments or isv business continues to perform extremely well with continued strong revenue growth in the quarter. as we discussed at our investor day, we recently rolled out clover connect, a clover integrated solution for isvs. we believe that this solution will further extend our differentiation for isvs and their merchant customers and continue to drive excellent growth in the future. adjusted operating income in the acceptance segment increased 37% to $387 million in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was up 650 basis points to 27.7% driven by the strength in the topline and continued cost synergies.
the fintech segment internal revenue grew 2% in the first quarter compared to the prior year as growth in high quality recurring revenue was again partially offset by lower periodic revenue most prominently termination fees, which created approximately 150 basis points of headwind to internal revenue growth in the quarter. the shift toward digital banking and the result in strong demand for our broader way of digital solutions continues. for example, total mobile subscribers across our leading digital platforms, mobiliti and architect, grew 12% in the quarter. mobile deposits in q1 grew 30% over the prior year, while self-service atm deposits grew 65% over last year. we expect these trends to continue as users who have moved to mobile or atm for check deposits may adopt these as preferred channels after experiencing their convenience and safety.
adjusted operating income was up a strong 21% in the quarter to $246 million. adjusted operating margin in the segment increased a robust 510 basis points in the quarter to 33.4% on a combination of growth in processing revenue, operational effectiveness benefits and cost synergies. the payments and network segment saw internal revenue grew 2% in the first quarter as growth in our card services, output solutions zelle and prepaid businesses including the benefit from revenue synergies was partially offset by headwinds in our bill-pay and credit businesses. debit transactions grew a strong 16% year-over-year, slightly ahead of levels last quarter.
we continue to see excellent transaction growth in solutions such as our account-to-account transfers and p2p. both zelle transactions and the number of clients live on zelle more than doubled in the quarter versus a year ago. our bill pay and credit businesses in particular given our retail private label mix saw headwinds from the pandemic that we expect to subside as we reach the second half of the year with better economic activity and better revenue comparisons. adjusted operating income for the segment was up 2% to $585 million and adjusted operating margin was up 20 basis points to 41.4% in the quarter. the results were driven by positive impact of both revenue and cost synergies in part offset by the lower revenue in our higher margin credit processing and bill pay businesses.
the adjusted corporate operating loss was $102 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations. the adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.2% flat versus prior year. we also expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be fairly consistent with the 2020 rate in the range of 21% to 22%. during the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy by repurchasing 5.2 million shares for $612 million and we have more than 16 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase. in addition, as frank mentioned earlier, we completed the acquisition of ondot systems in january and increased our investment related to the tegra118, our former investment services business. in connection with this combination with wealthtech holdings.
total debt outstanding was $21.2 billion at march 31 and the debt-to-adjusted ebitda ratio remained at 3.6 times. we are on track to achieve our targeted leverage of less than 3 times in the second half of 2021 as we anticipate both strong adjusted ebitda growth and debt repayment this year. as you heard us emphasize throughout our investor day in december, we're fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, making organic investment in innovative solutions and pursuing high value acquisitions like ondot, radius8 and pineapple payments. importantly, share repurchase remains our benchmark for capital deployment.
with that, let me turn the call back to frank.
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, bob. given our strong q1 performance and an improved economic outlook, we are raising the low end of our outlook range for both internal revenue and adjusted eps growth. we now expect 2021 internal revenue growth to be in the 9% to 12% range versus 8% to 12% previous. we expect adjusted eps to be in the $5.35 to $5.50 range, which is a 21% to 24% growth over last year. this is up $0.05 at the bottom end from our prior outlook. we continue to expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 250 basis points and free cash flow conversion to be greater than 108% for the year. the range for internal revenue and adjusted eps growth outlook are grounded in our performance to date. the current state of the economy and our internal assumptions about the trajectory of economic recovery, both of which have improved versus february when we provided our prior outlook.
to remind you, the low end of our original outlook in february assumed no material economic recovery from where we were at that time. similarly, the 9% at the low end of our updated outlook assumes the same no material economic recovery for the remainder of the year. regionally, we are seeing good economic progress in the us driven both by government stimulus as well as covid vaccine distribution with uneven recovery outside the us as more pronounced covid impacts persisted in parts of emea, latam and apac. as we indicated during our last earnings call, given the timing of the pandemic impact last year, we expect more variability in quarterly growth in 2021. given difficult comparisons, we expected q1 performance to be below our full-year outlook range and at once. we expect q2 growth rates will be above the full-year outlook range driven by our business momentum and an easier year ago comparison.
i'm proud of the results we've delivered as we navigate the ongoing global crisis. our business has shown incredible strength and resilience leading to what we expect to be our 36th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth in 2021 and setting a foundation for even stronger results beyond. in addition to delivering on our financial results, we continue to focus on our community. during the quarter, we successfully completed our back to business grant program in the original six locations that were selected in 2020. we also held two additional programs in milwaukee partnering with the milwaukee bucks to celebrate black history month, march 2 event partnering with the bucks and nancy lieberman during women's history month to award additional brands to minority women owned small businesses. last, let me thank our more than 40,000 talented associates around the world for their commitment and courage as we stand together to deliver value for clients, our colleagues and for you, our shareholders.
with that, operator, let's open the line for questions.
",":
operator
thank you. we would now like to open the phone lines for questions. [operator instructions] our first question comes from dave koning from baird. your line is open.
david koning -- baird -- analyst
yeah. hey guys, great job.
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, david. good morning.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
thank you. good morning.
david koning -- baird -- analyst
yeah, thanks. so i guess first of all, just on the acceptance segment really nice momentum there, maybe could you kind of walk through how january and february trends were? and then how kind of march and april trends were? just to kind of understand how the months worked as things kind of progressed.
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i'd take it at the macro level. january and february obviously began a little movement up in volume, but really not very much. if you remember, in february we talked to you all and gave a little look at what we saw up until then, and that's when we took really that bottom end up from through the flow up from 7 to 8 because we felt better than it did when we talk to you on december 8 at investor day. we did see a strong march. we saw a weaker february in the us. i'd credit a fair amount of that to whether there is store [phonetic] going on. we saw a stronger march, but i think on top of that we saw more lockdowns in emea and brazil as i had talked about previously, although hampered tremendously by covid still had spending going on. and i feel as we come into april and as we're going to head to the end of it we see the progression in the us.
obviously, india is a challenged environment in total right now. emea is beginning to open up and brazil continues to perform. and why we take the bottom up from 8 to 9 there if that's helpful here.
david koning -- baird -- analyst
yeah. thank you. i guess another way, kind of to think through this as we look really into q2. i look back at the last five years of first data, the gbs segment and very routinely, it was up about 10% sequentially in q2, very close to the same every year and margins were up like the incremental margins were nearly 100%. so it's like a 300 basis points, 400 basis points, 500 basis points sequential jump in margins. is there anything different about that seasonality? it would almost seem like the season now would be even better this q2 than some of those past trends, but just trying to triangulate that.
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think you're thinking about it right. i mean look at it -- and january versus last january was definitely a back compare would consider q2 and why we talked about it as being outside the top end of the range is because it's against the weak comp. so i would expect that seasonality to perform better than you would have ever seen.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
dave, recall during our earnings call last quarter 90 days ago, when we talked about the cadence of our revenue growth, we expected q1 to be below the full- year guidance range, given the comps against pre-pandemic period really all of january, february and half of march, then second quarter would actually be above the full-year guidance range with the second half of the year more in line with that overall full year. we do expect sequentially to continue to see seasonality benefit q1 to q2 in the merchant segment.
we also see the benefit of pandemic continuing to subside, particularly in the us as more and more people get inoculated and hopefully improvement in emea as some of the lockdowns began to be relaxed.
david koning -- baird -- analyst
yeah, great. thanks guys. nice job.
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
great to talk to you in the morning too, dave.
david koning -- baird -- analyst
thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from darrin peller from wolfe research. your line is open.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey guys, great job. thanks. i want to just hone in on looking at the outperformance in the merchant side going back. frank, if you look at what you guys outperformed on, there's a lot of debate, was it mix or was it -- the technology. you showed some really good data points on clover and carat isvs and now when thinking about coming on the other side of this pandemic. first of all, if you can comment on that point that it's probably a good combination of mix and technology. what was the areas that really stood out technologically? what are the areas that you now see on the other side of the pandemic that are doing more than you would have thought pre-pandemic and could drive even better growth to that 9% to 12% merchant range you've talked about?
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think mercialys [phonetic] think about clover growth very, very strong, e-comm wins and that's the backlog that is on boarding continues to be very, very strong. our isv business performing well. i mean lockdowns in emea definitely affect us and i would see us coming, we could feel that in the uk opening up. our client mix, we've been bullish on the whole way, but i've also been very clear that we have a huge diversed client base from smes to large enterprises across every industry sector as well as the large presence in geographies.
and so i think when you look at outlook goal, we still have lagging verticals, restaurants, travel and services. so we have an expectation in the later second quarter and in the third quarter that recover well. we've invested heavily and clover continue to do it heavily and carat continue to do it heavily and clover connect. so i look forward to us being able to continue the type of momentum we have for a long time.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. all right. so all of those areas are really going to be a bigger percentage of the mix coming out of this than they were before i guess, right?
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
sorry again, darrin.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
so whether it's clover or carat or isvs the mix contribution -- the revenue contribution from those areas probably will be notably bigger percent of revenue coming out of the pandemic than they were before. i would say, and i don't know if you can give any update on data points around that, but the investor day started this off with some good ones. is that fair?
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yeah, darrin. i think there's a couple of things that will play. number one is as frank pointed out, while we have strength of diversity of geography and client base, meaning we serve the largest retailers in the world, all the way down to the smallest smbs, the breadth has served us well. but we also of course have pretty meaningful exposure to restaurants and retail that have still a lot of recovery ahead of them that will help us with growth going forward. we think we've outperformed the market in the last four, six, eight quarters, quite frankly, and we have the opportunity to continue that.
the other dynamic of course is as clover and isv and e-comm, which are growing faster than the overall average, become a larger part. you will see better growth from those becoming a more meaningful piece of the overall company. as we pointed out $1 billion e-comm business to grow nicely, it becomes a bigger part of that $6 billion segment and providing some nice growth.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
all right. just very quickly, repurchasing shares. i think you did 5 -- a little over 5 million shares. again that's a key area that we focus on for you guys, especially given good free cash conversion. so, just can you update us on your appetite and your capacity for the rest of this year. and thanks again, guys.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure. we feel great about the position that we're in, good cash generation in the first quarter. i mentioned in my prepared remarks, a little bit of accounts receivable growth driven this given the strong march, which of course will generate cash in the second quarter as we collect those receivables, 103% conversion in the first quarter, well on track to do the 108% for the full year. so we feel that we've got continued good strong free cash flow generation, gives us the capacity to buy back shares and of course, as you heard us lay out in our earnings, looks to me at our investor day back in december $30 billion of capital to deploy over the next five years. we did a meaningful buyback in the first quarter and we see the opportunity to do that for the balance of the year.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. thanks again, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from lisa ellis from moffettnathanson. your line is open.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
good morning, guys. i had a specific question on the use of the digital sales channels for clover. if i recall prior to the merger with fiserv, this was an area of first data had invested really heavily in building online sales channel so a merchant could apply, get approved instantly by their clover's directly and i realize we hadn't heard a lot about this too much in the last year or two. so i was just wondering at the time that was a major differentiator for your platform compared to your large competitors. could you just update us on how widely this channel has been deployed and how significant of a factor it is in clover sales? thank you.
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
i'd say, first of all, we continue to hear in there and when you hear us talk about the addition of new bank programs we view every one of those as us ultimately driving digital adoption, right? we always believe that partners were great places for digital adoption and we believe clover itself was great place for digital adoption. when you look at the totality of our business globally, i would still put it in the not meaningful in total category, but a channel, which continues to accelerate its growth and one that we believe we will deliver more integrated opportunities for digital sign-up. and when you think about things we will do longer-term with our bank partners having a one of a kind digital experience for that bank merchant partner while continuing to work with paychex and the verizons also and using our direct channels to digitally sign up.
so i think it will be part of the five-year journey we talk about. it's not the overwhelming part of our sign-up machine, but our capability is huge and our ability to attract new partners because of that digital capability and sign up merchants is being contributing to the growth rate.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
okay. and then my follow-up, another one related to go to market or distribution on the merchant side. just a question on your strategy with e-commerce platforms and i'm thinking specifically about businesses that aggregate smbs in a particular industry like restaurant aggregators or retail aggregators of a particular type. with everything you're doing with clover, with carat, with clover connect with the recent acquisitions, how are you serving these types of customers? or how are you -- how do they sort of fit into your strategy in merchant? thank you.
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think it fits completely in our strategy. we've always viewed us as a partner of choice., a great distributor. we operate in basically every vertical and every capability and you hear us today, talk about extending our relationship in brazil, in latin america with one of the largest income players. that's really an example of us, our commitment to market places actually and you'll see that happen internally on the new open coming marketplaces us being an enabler and a distributor for them too. so i think we have a deep commitment there as you can capabilities are strong and you hear it and the things we will say today in our announcement.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
terrific. thank you. good stuff.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from dan dolev from mizuho. your line is open.
dan dolev -- mizuho securities -- analyst
hey, thank you. amazing results, very impressive. great job, frank and team.
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, dan.
dan dolev -- mizuho securities -- analyst
so i almost refused to accept the explanation that it's just a macro improvement. i mean i think there is significant share gains that you guys are getting out there and that's what we are hearing from the channel in merchant acquiring. can you maybe give us a little bit of an understanding of who you're taking share from, who you're displacing? what are you seeing out there? how are you winning and who are you winning against? thank you.
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
well, if you think about, -- it's a global -- it's a global business we're in. so you saw us announcing a large deal in brazil. and we've been -- we started that brazilian business back '14 and '15 and we've been taking share beyond where anybody had thought was capable on that market itself. so i'd point to that because we weren't a big isv player back in '15 and '16 or probably '17 until we bought cardconnect and bluepay [phonetic] but there we fit together with clover and began that journey. you see that. you well know probably people thought we're an e-comm lagger [phonetic] and we continue to win in that space.
now in summary statements. it's new markets but in many cases, taking it from all the places you won't suspect and you know i would look at us saying, hey, if you go through the hundreds of bank merchant wins we have talked about, fundamentally, those are 50% takeaways. so we continue to compete against everybody very strongly. and that in every market and in every vertical and it gets back to what we had said on investor day, when you look at this portfolio with clover, with clover connect, with carat, with global distribution with the client base that we have from largest in the world to the corner as i like to say it the corner store i think we've built a business that's the most diverse and probably has the most technology in all honesty.
dan dolev -- mizuho securities -- analyst
thank you. and then, a quick follow-up. if i think about that 8% growth in merchant, would you -- and i'm sorry if i missed it, can you give us maybe the cadence like january, february, march, and what it's looking like in april specifically on that 8% in merchant? is there any way to parse it out a little bit?
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yeah. dan. i think there is a couple of things. if you look at the year-over-year growth rate obviously given the pre-pandemic comparison in january and february and then march half of the quarter was pre-pandemic. the other half -- half a month -- the other half of the month was a pretty severe shutdown as particularly in the us, but also in europe. people really significantly went home and commerce really took a hit in the second half of march last year. so you see the year-over-year comp get significantly better in those last two weeks. if you just look at kind of the raw transactions, january started out the year, the quarter strong, february as frank mentioned, we saw some weather, particularly in the south in the us slow things down a bit, and then march came back quite a bit stronger. if you -- if you can adjust for weather, i would say january started out nice, february again adjusted for weather was again in line or good with january and then we started seeing things really pick up in march, i'm sure not coincidentally and help supported by the sim 3 payments that started flowing out. and we've seen that continue into april.
so we're definitely feeling the the recovery of the pandemic as vaccines really spread in the us. we're seeing more and more commerce retail picking up, restaurants starting to pick up, still down year-over-year in a meaningful way but starting to improve sequentially pretty nicely.
dan dolev -- mizuho securities -- analyst
thank you. i appreciate it.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from andrew jeffrey from truist securities. your line is open.
andrew jeffrey -- truist securities. -- analyst
hi. pardon me. good morning. i appreciate you taking the question. lots of helpful inputs and commentary in the acceptance business. can you talk a little bit about churn. i'm just trying to get a sense of how that might improve or what the dynamic looks like as we reopen in terms of what's coming in the top of the funnel be that clover sme enterprise e-comm versus what's coming out of the bottom the funnel and how we think about that sort of all translating into sustainable internal revenue growth in your acceptance business?
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. well a pandemic, i guess, a lot of people did shut down their businesses and get a lot of people to open up new businesses. i think we're going to see the strongest small business formation in the second half that we've ever seen. and that's why these channels we have are so darn valuable. our commitment to the small businesses you probably saw us as a technical provider one of a few to the sba for the restaurant brand. so i think we've done a good job over the long haul of keeping our clients and i think our clover platform, our isv platform, our carat platform all are well received by our client base. and i look for strength in small business formation even for those who shut down to come back in a different shape and form. so i guess churn seems very good for us, if you want to think about attrition, i mean we feel strong about what job we're doing and of course any client leaving upsets us at any level.
but i think the other part we got to put on top of it is tremendously strong small business formation and why all of these channels we have we believe are so darn valuable for us in that process.
andrew jeffrey -- truist securities. -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. thank you. and bob, quick follow-up on payments. again really nice kpis, whether it's zelle or debit transaction growth and i realize there are some pandemic headwinds perhaps in credit. can you offer some insight as to win some of the digital solutions p2p i'm thinking in particular really start to move the needle from a topline perspective in that business.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yeah. andrew, there -- as you pointed out, we saw some very nice kpis support in the overall payments business, zelle with both the number of transactions and number of users doubling certainly supports debit processing as well as the debit network performing quite well. we continue to love the acquisition of ondat and our ability to provide additional digital services for card controls and card activation to our overall channel. we see that as a significant growth opportunity not only to obviously provide that particular capability, but that as an overall part of our solution. we certainly have the benefit of some of the significant wins in the credit issuing business that we talked about over the last couple of quarters beginning to ramp late 2021 and into 2022. the 2% growth in the payments segment in the first quarter here is not an indication of where we see the opportunity for the full year. there are some definite headwinds there from the pandemic that we expect to subside.
and i think we said this at the end of last earnings call, but still believe it today. we expect the payments segment for the full year to be at the upper end of the medium-term outlook for internal revenue. so we believe 2022, 2023 that payments segment can grow 5% to 8% and we think this year will be at the upper end of that as we head into the second half of the year and we see the full-year results. so i think we're in a great spot. we'll see some continued growth, particularly in our digital side of the payments and we'll see improvement in that bill pay and credit issuing particularly the retail private label in the second half.
andrew jeffrey -- truist securities. -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from tien-tsin huang from jp morgan. your line is open.
tien-tsin huang -- jp morgan -- analyst
hi, good morning. really appreciate the new slide formats real good. just looking at the acceptance side here, the 8% internal revenue growth and 13% global volume growth, do you see potential for that spread between revenue volume growth to narrow or even flip in the second quarter or the second half of the year? i'm asking because based on what frank said around new businesses reforming and hopefully more in-store behavior that should help you i think on the spread. so i just wanted to check that.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think, that's the right way to think about it. there is certainly opportunity going forward and we'll see obviously how the economy rebounds into the second half of the year. all indications right now are quite strong. it's why we lifted the bottom end of our guidance range now twice in a row from 7% back in december to 8% in last quarter and now 9%. we see the economy improving and that helps overall merchant acceptance it helps the overall company but merchant acceptance in that spread also.
tien-tsin huang -- jp morgan -- analyst
that's great. and then just a quick follow-up. i wanted to ask about star and your pinless debit initiatives and investments in light of i think visa did disclose that doj is looking in into some of the debit practices so those good time to check in with you on, on what's happening with the pinless debit.
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i mean star and excel are standout performers for us and our investment and business continues to be large. i think you'll continue to see us invest where card on pinless debit and other aspects around signature too as we had talked about over time. that's a long haul. it's not a short haul. it's a lot of the infrastructure work, but we're investing heavily in the network and we have a deep belief in the growth in network and the power of the network, especially in this company, where we have a network business and we have merchants and it is good for financial institutions, star and excel together and good ground merchants, so a long journey. but that will continue to be something that we'll talk to you about it and we're committed to and show as part of the star-performing businesses in the company. no but intended.
tien-tsin huang -- jp morgan -- analyst
got it. thanks for the update.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
thanks, tsein-tsin.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from david togut from evercore isi. your line is open.
david togut -- evercore isi. -- analyst
thank you. good morning. looking at the acceleration in clover tpv growth from 25% in q4 to 36% in q1, can you drill down a little bit into the drivers there, for example, how much would have been from on-boarding new clients versus an improvement in same-store sales? just trying to understand the sustainability of this higher growth rate for clover.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think the way to think about it is, number one, we do think the growth rate of clover is quite sustainable. we've seen very strong growth the last several years, 25%. 30%, 35%, 40% in a given quarter. i think you saw in fourth quarter really the second half of last year some slowing driven the pandemic obviously as we anniversary that and continue to see, as frank pointed out, new business formation that certainly is a beneficiary to clover given the depth of our channel capability and our distribution system, we think we can benefit very nicely from that new business formation. so i would expect that clover revenue to me their gpv growth to continue for some time going forward, and we continue to invest in capability there and continue to enhance our solution set.
david togut -- evercore isi. -- analyst
understood. just as a follow-up. looking at the 2% organic revenue growth in the fintech segment in q1, can you call out the headwind that you saw from declining periodic revenue, so we can gauge the underlying internal growth going forward?
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yeah. for q1, that periodic headwind, which again was largely driven by termination fees, was about 150 basis points. said another way, outside of that, we would have grown about 350 bps. we do expect the headwind to continue into second quarter although to a slightly abated rate level and then as we enter the second half of the year that will no longer be a headwind for us going forward as it gets to a diminished level and then we'll see what happens beyond that in terms of, as the economy improves, do you see more bank mergers, which tends to be a driver of termination fees, but that headwind subsides a bit in q2 and then i anticipated not being a headwind that we discussed in the second half of the year.
david togut -- evercore isi. -- analyst
understood. thanks so much for the helpful detail.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
sure. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from ramsey el-assal from barclays. your line is open.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
hi guys, thanks for taking my question here. i wanted to ask about the broader m&a strategy. should we expect more deals sort of similar size to pineapple and ondat? or would you take a swing at something a little larger if -- or maybe more transformative if the opportunity presented itself?
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think, first, we feel great about our capabilities and the total hand we have, the tuck-ins have played very, very well for us for a very long time. i think if you'll look at ondot and you're going to see that gets spread across the product base, to client base that digital capability and integrated fashion. i think pineapple takes us on another area around our isv capability. i think if you look at radius8, it is about bringing that across this large platform, so they played very, very well for us. we've been very committed to our capital allocation strategy, tried and true and all of these acquisitions fit exactly within that envelope but of course, we pay attention, think about everything and as a dynamic world it keeps changing. so i think we're pretty committed to the path we're on, and we think about all things in the market always around the table. and so it has to work for our shareholders for it to make sense and that's why we held our capital allocation strategy.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
all right. that makes lot of sense. lastly for me, this is just a point of clarification, forgive me if you guys already covered off on it, but in the slide deck you mentioned pressure on long cycle credit processing in the payments segment, what is that exactly? and as a headwind, do you expect to persist?
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yeah, i would -- that is essentially -- our credit issuer processing business is not transaction driven. and so as we see the economy improve in more active accounts, we'll see an improvement in that revenue. and so that's a bit of a lagging indicator and we expect that to to take place really in the second half, as the economy improves, we'll see more activity. in addition, you'll get different comparisons. and so we think that helps lift the growth of the the payments segment and obviously the credit issuer processing.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
great. got it. okay. so that's just a euphemism for credit issuer processing effect, right? okay. terrific. thanks so much.
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. and our last question comes from george mihalos from cowen. your line is open.
george mihalos -- cowen -- analyst
hey guys, thanks. thanks for squeezing me in. just wanted to ask kicking things off on the merchant side, the nice momentum you're seeing there. as it relates to emea, we're hearing anecdotally that things are getting better throughout the course of april, particularly in the uk, and i'm just curious if you could share any high-level trends that you might be seeing through the month of april and would you guys expect that region to be in the black in 2q. is there any reason why that's not possible?
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
i think the uk is, we can feel it, we see it. i think referred to potentially somewhere along the line here too. i think ireland still has challenges but you know, our expectation is that in the second half. emea is in recovery. i don't want to be thinking too hard about this quarter itself as much as the full year. and we believe the emea business will perform well in the second half. i think it's been under pressure in the first half.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
certainly feels like it's in the right trajectory though, as you say the restrictions are beginning to lift uk in particular and hopefully some of the other countries in that region soon.
george mihalos -- cowen -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and just as a quick follow-up, bob, on the on the fintech segment, should we continue to believe. i mean it seems like it's tracking in the right direction, but is the 4% to 6% growth for fintech. i think that you laid out last quarter, is that still on the table for '21 or how are you guys feeling about that range?
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yeah, we didn't give a guidance for '21, that 4% to 6% is our medium-term guidance. we don't give specific in your guidance on our [indecipherable] segment level. i'd just reiterate we did -- we printed it too, if you adjust for the periodic revenue. it's a 3.5% in the quarter that subsides pretty meaningfully in the second quarter and is no longer a headwind in the third and fourth quarter. so we'll see a nice uptick in that segment and believe we'll be in that range in the second half of the year for sure. okay. thank you, guys. congrats on the results. thank you very much.
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
i'd like to thank everybody for their time today. i look forward to taking to you all. and we appreciate everything you do. have a great day.

"
2021-Q2,FISV,2021-07-27 08:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
welcome to the fiserv 2021 second quarter earnings conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. at this time, i will turn the call over to shub mukherjee, senior vice president of investor relations at fiserv.
shub mukherjee -- senior vice president, investor relations
thank you, and good morning. with me on the call today are frank bisignano, our president and chief executive officer; and bob hau, our chief financial officer.
our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the investor relations section of fiserv.com.
our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives and expected benefits and synergies from the first data acquisition. forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. you should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors.
please refer to our earnings release and supplemental materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-gaap financial measures discussed in this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable gaap measures. unless otherwise stated, performance references are year-over-year comparisons, and all references to internal revenue growth are on a constant currency basis.
and now i'll turn the call over to frank.
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, shub. second quarter was a very strong quarter for us across the company. total company adjusted revenue grew 20%. adjusted operating margin grew 510 basis points, resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 41%. adjusted eps grew 47% to $1.37. free cash flow in the quarter was in line with last year, just under $900 million, including the impact of a diminished nol. second quarter sales were up 31% with growth across the business.
our strong second quarter was driven by a combination of continued economic recovery and strong execution of our business strategy. on the macroeconomic side, we saw continued recovery in the us with uneven recovery in other parts of the world. the shift to digital commerce drove consumer demand for seamless experiences across channels. amidst these trends, we executed on our strategies to continue to win business and grow share.
we serve as the operating system for commerce across our client base, ranging from micro merchants to the world's largest corporations, financial institutions, banks and credit unions, fintechs and governments. this enables us to focus not only on growth at our core but also on new services, business models and adjacencies.
given the strong results to date and our solid pipeline, we are raising our outlook range for internal revenue growth and now expect 10% to 12% growth for 2021 from 9% to 12% previously. additionally, we are raising our adjusted eps full year outlook and now expect a range of $5.50 to $5.60, up from $5.35 to $5.50 previously. the increased adjusted eps guidance outlook represents a 24% to 27% growth versus last year.
drilling down to the business segments, the quarter was led by our merchant acceptance segment, which posted internal revenue growth of 41% year-over-year. normalizing for the year-ago comps, the segment posted a 13% growth in the quarter on a 2-year basis above our pre-pandemic run rate. both north america and international largely grew in line with the segment average. north america purchase volume was up 33% in the quarter led by strength in retail, petro and restaurants.
one of the trends that the pandemic has accelerated is the shift to omni-commerce. consumers are increasingly looking to engage with merchants in whatever way is most convenient. fiserv's ability to support clients with leading solutions in both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce environments is a differentiator. we saw the manifestation of this trend during the second quarter as offline commerce recovered with volumes growing 46% versus 2020 and 11% versus 2019.
online commerce volume also grew unabated at 21% year-over-year, highlighting the criticality of equipping merchants with omnichannel commerce capabilities. our lead in omni commerce is the reason we were honored with the omni channel provider of the year award from the strawhecker group, a leading payments industry analyst firm. as you know, clover, carat and clover connect are fiserv's leading platforms for small and medium-sized merchants, enterprises, and isvs respectively.
starting with clover, gpv in the quarter grew 96% year-over-year, reflecting a 38% cagr since 2019 to $184 billion on an annualized basis. in the smb space, we continue to build out vertical specific solutions in retail, restaurants and services.
our vertical sector strategy aims at expanding beyond the buy button offering an integrated suite of products that help merchants generate revenue and run their business. value-added services on the clover platform include clover capital, clover dining, clover order ahead and clover inventory as well as our unique app marketplace, which provides access to services such as payroll management, loyalty, and marketing that enable us to increase our share of the merchant's wallet and become the platform of choice.
on the enterprise side, carat, our enterprise omnichannel ecosystem, continued its strong momentum in the second quarter with new wins and continued innovation in key verticals. in restaurants, carat powers digital commerce for 10 of the top 15 qsrs. carat has helped burger king expand its mobile payments experience into latin america; in restaurant brands international expansion in the uk and other parts of emea. in grocery, where carat now serves 9 of the top 10 grocers, we have helped new clients such as wakefern, aldi, and the companies of ahold delhaize usa, expand their digital grocery ordering capabilities with new payment types. evidence to carat's commitment to the grocery industry and transform digital experience is exemplified by carat's leading online ebt program that has processed $2.5 billion in gpv year-to-date.
in retail, where carat serves 7 of the top 10 retailers, we're expanding our merchant services by working with clients such as adidas on innovative solutions, including our new consumer recommendation engine. this engine connects digital experiences to local stores enabled by the integration of radius8, an acquisition we completed in the first quarter of this year.
carat has also established new at-scale leadership with crypto wallets, where we power cards funds in and funds out solutions. through this capability, we helped consumers move more than $4 billion in payments volume in and out of wallets for the past 12 months. in the second quarter alone, we moved $2 billion of volume, demonstrating the sharp ramp in digital currency movement.
moving to clover connect, our isv-focused offering, momentum continued in the second quarter with isv volume up 122% year-over-year. we signed 53 new isv partners in the quarter, bringing the new isv partnerships to 95 year-to-date. we're signing up isvs that are new to payments and those that are converting from competitors. year-to-date, almost half of our wins are competitive takeaways. our isv partners derive great value in getting access to our partner management tool, copilot and integrating with clover.
on our investor day, we talked to you about our merchant acceptance growth strategy for international. we remain focused on growing our global market presence with world-class bank partners and through our direct channels, all while leveraging the strength of common platforms and connections. in the quarter, we announced the jv with deutsche bank in germany that offers us access to over 800,000 merchants, many of whom will power with our clover platform. in asia pacific region, we won a multi-country acquiring processing mandate from citibank for its new integrated digital commerce offering, spring by citi.
early in july, we began onboarding and processing payment transactions as part of the merchant acquiring services agreement signed with brazil's caixabank in april of this year. the onboarding began 70 days after contract signing, once again demonstrating our speed to market.
in addition to the successes i mentioned above, in our merchant acceptance segment yesterday we announced a strategic relationship with goldman sachs to integrate cross-border payment functionality into our b2b accounts receivable and accounts payable solution, snappay. as you know, b2b payments is a vast and growing market ripe with opportunity. we believe that in partnership with goldman sachs, we can deliver best-in-class b2b payment capabilities, enhancing visibility, operational efficiencies and cost savings for our large and mid-market business clients.
moving to the payments and network segment, we posted internal revenue growth of 7% over the second quarter of last year. positives in the quarter included the continued growth of zelle, continued strength in debit transaction volume, initial recovery in credit account volumes and international growth with some weakness in bill pay, although results improved sequentially.
the differentiated and industry-leading businesses within our payments and network portfolio and our agile execution are the key reasons why we continue to win with clients. we are proceeding well with onboarding $120 million of credit issuing wins we told you about on our investor day. we completed boarding atlanticus in q2 and have completed several stages of migrating both alliance data and genesis financial to the optus environment. in less than 12 months, after announcing these three banner wins, we are poised to recognize revenue on all three clients in the third quarter of this year.
we continue to grow our relationship with innovative growth-stage fintechs, digital banks and consumer lenders. in june, we signed an agreement with prosper, a fintech pioneer and a premier ai-driven consumer lending marketplace for credit card processing services. this space is a growth focus for us. our revenue with fintech issuance grew over 300% during the first half of this year versus the same period in 2019. on investor day, you'll recall that driving best-in-class integrated digital consumer journeys is a key differentiator and imperative for our clients.
experiences are the new currency of loyalty.
customers gravitate toward institutions that could give them a unified, seamless experience across both channels and products. to that end, yesterday we announced enhanced fiserv digital capabilities for integrated digital banking and card management. this enriched mobile-first suite will enable financial institutions to offer their consumer and business customers a best-in-class digital banking experience that's designed for the way customers expect to engage.
to introduce these enhanced capabilities, we rapidly integrated two recent acquisitions, ondot and spendlabs. the result is a single unified platform for consumer and small and midsized business cardholders that enables expense and business card management. this offering allows us to deliver a single point of access for all banking products.
our enhanced fiserv digital capabilities will span all three business segments: in payments through a leading digital cardholder experience; in financial technology, by driving the penetration of our core account processing in digital surrounds; in merchant acceptance, by increasing the uptake of value-added services from integrating spendlabs with our clover platform. we expect to see incremental usage, engagement and services revenue on the fiserv platform as a result.
before i close out the payments segment, i would like to mention the strong growth we are seeing in our debit networks, star and accel as we are winning new issuers through our ability to support all transaction type, including best-in-class fraud management and chargeback products.
moving to the financial technologies segment, the quarter was in line with our expectations, posting internal revenue growth of 5%, including an 80 basis points headwind from periodic revenue. i want to highlight some key achievements in the quarter that reflect our strong market position. we added 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including 8 on the dna platform and 4 in the over $1 billion asset size market. as the smaller end of the banking industry consolidates, we're moving up the asset chains, winning share in the $1 billion to $50 billion market. one such win is sunstream business services, a service entity which spans 12 financial institutions and provides business and technology services to farm credit associations, totaling more than $115 billion in assets. sunstream will be converted into dna and a number of surround solutions.
continuing our strong momentum in the de novo bank market, we signed lca financial services, a newly created -- a newly chartered bank focused on small business. while we continue to win with our digital surround solutions, abiliti is the new paradigm in digital banking, a single retail and business online and mobile platform. we had our first client go live on the abiliti platform in the second quarter with more than 100 clients signed up. we are also fully embracing openness as a strategy.
the fiserv developer studio is aimed at attracting the developer community to build innovative products using the range of apis we expose across cards, payments, banking, small, medium and large businesses. additionally, we are building a pre-integrated fintech app marketplace where our financial institutions clients can acquire, test and deploy third-party apps seamlessly, easily and quickly.
this openness strategy creates a net new revenue opportunity within our existing client base while widening the value-added services opportunity.
with that, let me update you on our integration efforts. through the second quarter, we've already actioned over $1.1 billion of cost savings and are well on our way to completing our $1.2 billion cost synergy objective by the end of this year. with the majority of the integration work behind us, we are focused on driving further growth and sustainable value in the years ahead.
on the revenue side, we're pleased with the level of synergy sales, which accelerated in the second quarter. as of the end of the second quarter, we've already actioned $325 million in annual revenue synergies, and our synergy sales pipeline is growing robustly and we expect to meet or exceed our $600 million target over the 5 years post merger.
revenue synergies in the quarter were driven by payments, debit network and card sales across our three major client segments fis, corporates, and government. additionally, as the partner of choice, we continue to see momentum in our bank merchant program.
now let me pass the discussion to bob for more detail on our financial results.
robert hau -- chief financial officer
thank you, frank, and good morning, everyone. if you're following along on our slides, i will cover some of the detail on each of our segments, starting with slide 4.
we had a very strong second quarter, thanks to our broad portfolio of products and services as well as the positioning of our assets and strong execution across the business. total company internal revenue growth was 18% in the quarter, with growth across all segments and led by the merchant acceptance segment, which grew 41%. year-to-date, total company internal revenue grew 11%, also led by the merchant acceptance segment, which grew 23%.
second quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 41% to $1.3 billion, and adjusted operating margin increased by a very strong 510 basis points to 33.9%. this margin improvement was driven by our outstanding revenue results and our continued and disciplined cost synergy execution, which produced $90 million of incremental cost synergies during the quarter as well as strong operating performance.
first half adjusted operating income increased 28% to $2.4 billion. adjusted operating margin through the end of june expanded 440 basis points to 32.7%.
second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 47% to $1.37 compared to $0.93 in the prior year. through june 30, adjusted earnings per share increased 32% to $2.54, putting us on a pace to achieve our 36th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth, a testament to the incredible resiliency of this company.
free cash flow in the quarter of $897 million was in line with last year, with free cash flow for the first 6 months of the year up 4% to $1.72 billion. free cash flow conversion was 97% to adjusted net income, including a $172 million impact from reduced net operating loss carryforwards. year-to-date, free cash flow conversion came in at 100% and we continue to expect at least 108% free cash flow conversion for 2021.
now looking at our segment results. internal revenue growth in the merchant acceptance segment was a stellar 41% in the quarter and 23% year-to-date. our results were driven by a strong performance of our smb platform, clover; our enterprise platform, carat; and our isv platform, clover connect. these results were driven by a strong global performance despite uneven economic recovery outside north america. the second quarter was a record quarter for clover. in addition to a very strong 96% annualized gpv growth, this quarter was also the highest shipment volume for clover hardware, having recently shipped our 2 millionth clover device.
moving to carat. we won 52 new global enterprise e-commerce clients on a platform in the quarter. including existing clients, carat won or expanded business with brands such as sporttrade, aldi, and yapstone. in india, carat won the business of a leading digital food delivery platform.
our isv volume in the quarter through clover connect grew 122% year-over-year. and we're winning both isvs that are new to the payments as well as competitive takeaways.
adjusted operating income in the acceptance segment increased 135% to $524 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up more than 12 full percentage points to 31.4%, driven by the strength in the top line. through june 30, adjusted operating income improved 80% to $911 million and adjusted operating margin grew 950 basis points to 29.7%.
the payments and network segment posted internal revenue growth of 7% in this quarter, resulting in year-to-date growth of 4%. debit transactions grew a strong 31% in the quarter and this was a low double-digit sequential grower versus last quarter. we continue to build upon the strong momentum of transaction growth in account-to-account transfers and p2p solutions. versus prior year, zelle transactions in the quarter were up 94% and the number of clients live on zelle was up 88% in the quarter.
our bill pay business saw a sequential improvement in growth from q1 and is expected to continue to improve through the second half of this year. we continue to expect to see the full year internal revenue growth for the payments and network segment to be toward the upper end of the medium-term growth rate of 5% to 8%. adjusted operating income for the segment was up 14% to $636 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 260 basis points to 44.6% in the quarter. year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 8% to $1.2 billion and adjusted operating margin was up 140 basis points to 43%. the results were driven by positive momentum in our issuer business and the impact of revenue and cost synergies.
the financial technology segment internal revenue grew in line with expectations at 5% in the second quarter as continued growth in high-quality recurring revenue was partially offset by lower periodic revenue, which created an 80 basis points of headwind to internal revenue growth. for the first half of the year, internal revenue growth for the financial technology segment is now 4%, reaching the lower end of our medium-term outlook for the segment of 4% to 6%. demand for our digital banking capabilities and for our deep offering of digital solutions continues to build momentum. as frank mentioned, we added 10 new core account processing clients in the quarter.
total mobile subscribers across our leading digital platforms, mobiliti and architect, grew 9% in the quarter. mobile deposits in q2 grew 12% over the prior year, while self-service atm deposits grew 70% over last year.
adjusted operating income was up a strong 8% in the quarter to $273 million and up 14% year-to-date to $519 million. adjusted operating margin in this segment increased a robust 80 basis points in the quarter to 36.2% and 300 basis points to 34.9% through the end of june, due to a combination of revenue growth, operational effectiveness benefits, and cost synergies.
the adjusted corporate operating loss was $124 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations, up from last year largely on higher variable compensation expenses. the adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.3%, increasing 80 basis points versus prior year. we also expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate will be fairly consistent with 2020 rate and at the lower end of our previously forecasted range of 21% to 22%.
during the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy by repurchasing 5 million shares for $588 million, and we have more than 55 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase.
we completed two acquisitions in the quarter, spendlabs, a mobile native cloud-based commercial card payments and software company; and pineapple payments, a leading independent sales organization focused on integrated payments. additionally, we divested our remaining interest in the investment services business and received pre-tax proceeds of $460 million from the transaction.
total debt outstanding was $20.8 billion on june 30, and the debt-to-adjusted ebitda ratio decreased to 3.3 times, putting us well on track to achieve our targeted leverage of less than 3 times by the end of this year. we are fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, making organic investments in innovative solutions and pursuing high-value acquisitions. importantly, share repurchase remains our benchmark for capital deployment.
with that, let me turn the call back to frank.
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, bob. i'm very proud of the results we've delivered. the quality of our assets, our relentless focus on innovation, our agility, speed of new client implementation with examples like caxia, ads, atlanticus and genesis put us in a great spot to serve our clients.
our speed to market with the enhanced fiserv digital capabilities for banking and card management announced yesterday along with the integration of business expense management into the clover platform, all of which leverage the full capabilities of recent acquisitions, ondot and spendlabs, add to our continued success.
in addition to delivering on our financial results, we continue to focus on our people and on our communities. earlier this month, fiserv was named by forbes as the best employer for diversity, recognizing our commitment to putting diversity at the forefront of our values and having implemented long-term initiatives to create a more inclusive environment.
during the quarter, we published our first annual corporate social responsibility report, which is available on the corporate social responsibility section of our website. we also expanded our back-to-business grant program beyond the original locations that were selected in 2020.
in may, we partnered with the new york mets to recognize small businesses as part of our asian, american and pacific islander heritage month. and in june, we awarded grants to businesses in tulsa as part of the centennial observation of the tulsa race massacre. none of these achievements would have been possible without our world-class talent. i thank our more than 40,000 associates around the world for their commitment and courage as we stand together to deliver value for clients, our colleagues and you, our shareholders.
and finally before i close, i want to congratulate the milwaukee bucks for winning the nba championship at fiserv forum last week. the bucks are terrific partners, and our partnership goes way beyond putting our name on their arena. clover has been deployed throughout fiserv forum for food and beverage concessions, providing attendees with seamless, quick and easy transactions. they also partnered with us for several back-to-business events earlier this year. congratulations to the entire milwaukee bucks organization.
with that, operator, let's open up the line for questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from lisa ellis from moffettnathanson. please go ahead.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks, guys. good to hear from you. i wanted to follow up on the two-year cagr call out for the merchant acceptance segment. i believe you said it's running now at a 13% internal revenue growth on a two-year cagr basis. one, wanted to just confirm that number.
and then two, i wanted to kind of just drill into it a little bit, given that that's above your medium-term outlook for that segment, which as per investor day was 9% to 12%. can you just highlight like what you're seeing, say, in north america versus ex-us?
and are there any unusual dynamics in this quarter or do you see that sustainable going forward? and kind of what's different about the business now than prior to the pandemic when i believe it was running close to about 10%? thank you.
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think it starts with the us has been the strong spot in the recovery right now. you heard us talk about unevenness outside the us. but i do think you saw a robust even last july when it all began coming back. i do think you've got to focus on the three legs in the us and internationally. the three legs are clover, carat and clover connect, right? and all of those were continued investments, continued build out and we're seeing it show up in the clients' office. so i would say, it's really driven by us. when you see that we say us and international for the quarter performed fundamentally evenly, that was a spotty evenness, meaning not every country was the same and you could kind of map to where recoveries happened or not. so i think it's all about our platform strategy and our client strategy that's driving the outcomes. and i think our teams galvanized very well around it.
robert hau -- chief financial officer
and lisa, just to hit the first part of that question, the 13% is an average growth rate. if you look at q2 of last year, it was actually down 15% over the prior year. we're now up 41% over 2020. so the average 13% there.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
terrific. thank you.
operator
next, we'll go to the line of david koning from baird. please go ahead.
david koning -- robert w. baird -- analyst
maybe my first question, just on the merchant segment momentum, i guess a little bit like what lisa was asking about, i went back several years and the second half usually has quarters that look a lot like q2. so usually q3 and q4 look a lot like q2. but the question, i guess is, is the momentum building? you mentioned international still has room to improve. us momentum seems kind of off the charts, bams actually grew faster year-over-year than your core merchant business for the first time probably in many, many years. so are we in a momentum situation that q3 and q4 could actually be better than q2 this year compared to when normally it's the same?
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
i think the answer to that is yes. there is concern in the world. right? so that's a little bit in how we think about it when we talk to about what we're doing. so there is a degree of us saying, the world's not out of the woods yet, although i think they've learned how to grow with this. so it's highly possible what you're saying could happen. we're driving the business to get the results we're getting. you see all the partnerships we're aligning to, to bring more. so, yeah, i'd say it's possible. but the world has spottiness right now too.
david koning -- robert w. baird -- analyst
yeah, that's great. and i guess, secondly, just as a follow-up, the past, i guess, handful of quarters at different times kkr has sold -- they're down to a much smaller position they were a year or two ago. but on the heels of now a really good quarter, what do you think their thoughts are about selling now?
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
i'd start off with, first and foremost, i do not anticipate them conducting additional secondary offerings. their holdings are just under 10% now. and they have told us they intend to sell shares on the open market over time in a routine and pragmatic way going forward. so i don't think we're going to see another secondary.
david koning -- robert w. baird -- analyst
sounds great. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. next we'll go to timothy chiodo from credit suisse. please go ahead.
timothy chiodo -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks a lot. thank you for taking the question. so over the last year or so, we've seen a few merchant acquirers become public. they have pretty fast growth in some more niche verticals. so online gambling, regulated financial services. clearly, the first data fiserv merchant acquiring business is extremely well diversified and has a much, much larger scale, meaning that any one vertical can be overly meaningful, but maybe you could just touch on your approach to participation in those types of verticals, the extent to which you either are or will, how much it could help your business, what are the pros, cons, etc.? thanks a lot.
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think we're in every vertical. when we talk about grocer, qsr, retail but we're in gaming, we're across the board. you don't have a business of this size and scale that isn't serving all markets. and when you look at our capability, we do a good job of bringing base capability, and then segmenting to what verticals specifically need. so i think we are completely deployed against -- and we're deployed against growth, i mean, we're deployed against growth. where we invest is where we believe the growthier segments are.
robert hau -- chief financial officer
tim, i think one of the keys for our growth and, quite frankly, how we work through the pandemic and continue to grow the business meaningfully is we're very well diversified in terms of the way we go to market, whether that's our direct channel, through our bank partners, through our non-financial institution partners, joint ventures, etc., but also extremely well diversified across verticals and participate essentially in all of them, and have offerings that get us revenue growth across a very wide spectrum.
timothy chiodo -- credit suisse -- analyst
all right. excellent. thank you so much. really appreciate that. as a minor follow-up, was there any comment you could give on the assessments' timing on the contra revenue, any impact in q2 given the difference in quarter-over-quarter growth, q1 to q2, some of those impacts that we saw last year?
robert hau -- chief financial officer
yeah. you recall, we had a pretty significant impact in q2 of last year, a negative impact in q2 that rebounded in the second half of last year. we're seeing the opposite now as we saw a big rebound in second quarter of this year. we do have a tailwind that will be muted a bit in the second half of the year. we don't have quite the same snapback in the second half as we did in the second half of last year. so, call it, roughly, of the 12 full points of margin improvement we saw this year over q2 of last year, about 4 points of that was the brand assessment fees. and then that will be a bit of a headwind for us in the second half of the year. but we certainly see margin expansion continuing into the second half.
timothy chiodo -- credit suisse -- analyst
perfect. that's really helpful. thank you so much both of you.
operator
thank you. next we'll go to the line of james faucette from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks a lot. and really appreciate your comments this morning. i know bob talked a little bit about capital allocation. but i'm wondering if you can just help us think about how priorities or at least the way that you allocate may be changing, if at all, especially given kind of what's happening from the perspective of your stock is a little cheaper now, and so maybe that speaks to wanting to do buybacks. on the other hand, we're kind of continuing to see massive flows of capital into competitors, both through the private and public markets and the like. so just wondering if there's any evolution there on your thinking of how to prioritize use of capital going forward?
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
i'd start with three[phonetic] on leverage, that will be well behind us. and we did talk about investor day, $30 billion of free cash. and so i think you also see us continuing the strategy of taking silicon valley digital expertise and capability, integrate it into our company and fundamentally creating experiences that nobody in peer group can do. you saw it with clover back in the day. and when i talked about ondot, i did say that the acquisition of ondot and then subsequently spendlabs, but ondot specifically, would bring a clover-like effect to our company. and the fact that -- so you'll see us deploy capital to those type of acquisitions. but i want to bring clarity to what i mean in a clover type.
we've created a single instance for consumers to be able to get every banking product they have and have card functionality that surpasses the industry by a lot. so we have tremendous -- everything from digital issuance to the ability to put it in the wallet. i think you've got to really think about what we're doing there. and then we will invest in these products quite heavily. right? so i think you'll see us continue to do those type of acquisitions that drive the digital presence, but we've done things unparalleled through those acquisitions. so we talked about $30 billion. you see the properties we bought. you see us integrating those properties, integrating for growth. and i think you'll see us unique, always though using buyback as a benchmark.
robert hau -- chief financial officer
james, i think this quarter is perhaps a prototypical example, this digital enhancement, this digital innovation that frank talked about in his prepared remarks and just referenced is a combination of investing in our business organically, internal investment, advancing our digital banking capability with mobiliti, bringing more feature function capability to our mobile capability, adding to that inorganic investment the acquisitions of spendlabs and ondot in a quarter that we also repurchased 5 million shares.
so the $30 billion of capital available we have this year and for the next four or five years allows us to buy back shares, making organic investment in m&a and develop internal products and internal innovation and generate very high return.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's great color. thank you very much to both of you.
operator
thank you. next we'll go to dan dolev from mizuho. please go ahead.
dan dolev -- mizuho securities -- analyst
hey, guys, good morning. great results. so did i hear that correctly you said that this quarter was a record shipment quarter for clover?
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
that's correct.
dan dolev -- mizuho securities -- analyst
and so it sounds like it's more idiosyncratic share gains than anything market or reopening related. maybe can you comment a little bit on who you're gaining share from, maybe specific verticals? and then maybe kind of the trajectory, you went from 36% in q1 to 96% in q2. how should we think about the remainder of the year? thank you.
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
well, why don't i start off with a look at -- i think clover is a platform of choice and clover is a partner platform of choice. and we did talk about that clover would get other distribution channels, and that distribution could be our own outside the us. it could be with our isv partners. and then just in our base core business, our own, i mean, your question of share, when you're as big as we are, we're competing with everybody and we feel that clover is at the top of the list of what people want as a product. so i think it is about the differentiated product and the capability that gets it the type of numbers you saw in this quarter.
robert hau -- chief financial officer
and then, dan, just to add, the 96% growth year-over-year, remember this is the quarter that's comparing to the second quarter of last year, which was obviously a very difficult year across the board. but i think the pertinent number here is a 38% cagr over the last two years.
so, obviously, clover growing incredibly well, continue to expect that to be a lift and a share gainer for us as we lead with clover in the marketplace. we're seeing benefits of continued innovation, continued investments in clover as new business formation kicks in post-pandemic, as merchants that were not transacting at all or very much come back. our investments in clover dining, etc. pay off when the economy recovers, people think of clover and allow us to serve them with clover devices, hitting our record shipment as well as giving us that nice lift in overall gpv.
dan dolev -- mizuho securities -- analyst
yes, great. i agree, it's definitely everywhere, great stuff. thank you.
operator
thank you. next we have darrin peller from wolfe research. please go ahead.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks, guys. let me just shift to the fintech segment for a minute, which for several quarters was really in the 3% to 4% range and did show the acceleration to that 5%. you guys have talked about it being something that can do 4% to 6% growth. and we're seeing some signs of improvement now. you talked a lot about digital bank in your release also. and so i'm curious from a structural standpoint, given all the new competition out there, if you could touch on the assets you have and your capabilities and, in your view, confidence level around that segment actually being in that 4% to 6% or better versus low single-digit over time, that'd be great. thanks.
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
well, you see a number of things going on our fintech segment, but let me bring -- i want to bring complete clarity on the digital offering because i think it affects both core and our digital business. and ultimately, what we have a deep belief is that we're here to help our clients serve their clients. so the ability to take 2,100 mobiliti banks and bring them a fully integrated card experience at the highest level of card via the ondot and bring that in a way that -- maybe the simple way to think about it is everything you can imagine in one application that allows you to do everything from originate transactions to digital card issuance to digital card view to card free cash, all in the same place that you're doing your bill pay and you're doing your zelle transactions.
so we're going to take 2,100 mobiliti clients, 1,300 cardvalet and bring that to them. and then that will be what we -- and those are financial institutions, we believe that will also help our clients increase their digital adoption quotient with their clients. so we see this as a game changer. so it's early innings. we got banks up and running on it. and we will deploy. and then you hear us talking about, on top of all that for financial institutions, we bring in abiliti that sits on top of all of it. but the most important thing to think about is our cores are strategic. the front end, though, is where we believe the tip of the spear and where we win to help our clients serve their clients. and you saw what we posted now, but i look forward to continuing to generate more revenue through better function we bring to clients that allow them to do more with their clients. and then, you've got an integration of a spendlabs into clover, which allows -- these are our digital platforms. we're talking about digital platforms, one-of-a-kind digital platform.
and i think what you should take away, there's an element of this company that's digitally agile and can deliver, and you saw it on those credit conversions. i think those are good track rated speeds for those size and scope. caixa is unparalleled. 70 days from signing, we're boarding merchants for them every day. and then you look at us taking spendlabs and ondot and i think we're going to have that same effect that clover had when we look years out from now.
robert hau -- chief financial officer
going back to the -- sorry, go ahead.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
no, no, bob, go ahead, please.
robert hau -- chief financial officer
i was just going to bring you it back to the 5% growth. obviously, we had a good quarter, hitting 5%. we indicated that periodic revenue headwind would abate. i think it was 150 basis points. last quarter, we said we expected this quarter to be half that. we saw 80 basis points into the second half of the year. we see that no longer being a headwind. and through the first half of the year, we're now at 4%. so we reached the bottom end of that medium-term guidance and continue to be quite comfortable that we will be in that 4% to 6% range this year. and the things that frank's talked about, the investments we're making in digital banking gives us an opportunity to continue to see that good mid-single digit growth going forward.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. great. hey, frank, just quick follow-up on m&a. what are your thoughts on doing more tuck-ins that keep improving the tech stack and really thinking about maybe even just accretive to revenue growth, maybe even dilutive to eps just type deals, just really add to the long-term growth strategy? thanks, guys.
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
well, i feel -- obviously, you've watched over time the type of properties we buy. our isv strategy was born out of acquisition. now it's a winning strategy. clover was born out of acquisition. and i think you'd have to argue that's a bigger than winning strategy. you'll watch these assets, ondot and spendlabs, so i think you're just going to continue. i don't think it needs to be dilutive to eps. i think we know how to make it accretive pretty darn quick. and what i just talked about was kind of the dream of the acquisition when we put the companies together, that we could take an asset like an ondot and spread it all the way through because of what a great bank partner we were, and that we could bring it all the way from merchant to our fintech. so i think you should expect us to continue to do more like that. and i think we have a skill at it that we keep the talent, we grow the talent, and we build a bigger digital gene pool in the process.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jason kupferberg from bank of america. please go ahead.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america securities -- analyst
can you comment just on any july trends in the acceptance segment? any impacts from the delta variant? and then also just on the revenue yield dynamics, i know those were positive in the second quarter in acceptance, how should we think about that for q3? will volumes and revenues be a little bit more in sync?
robert hau -- chief financial officer
yes. so in terms of july trends in our merchant segment, i'd say, obviously, through what 26 days or so, we have information yesterday, day before, slightly better than june. so continued improvement in growth. and i'm talking about versus 2019. when you do a 2020 compare, you get some real odd variations on the comparison points. so we're looking at versus prior year as well as versus 2019. but slight improvement in july versus what we saw in june, consistent with what we've got loaded in our full-year outlook with that growth rate and eps growth. call it mid-20%, 25%, 26% merchant growth, volume growth over 2019.
in terms of yield, you saw a recovery, so to speak, in q2 versus what we saw in q1 as our smb portfolio continues to grow nicely. i think that's going to be consistent in the second half of the year.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america securities -- analyst
okay. so, we should expect those positive yield dynamics to continue. i just wanted to switch over to the payments segment for a minute. i know you're reiterating the higher end of the 5% to 8% target range. and i think you probably have to do 10%, 11% in the second half to get there. i know you've got some new portfolios ramping up, but just talk about the visibility on that acceleration relative to where you were in the first half.
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
i think you see the credit momentum and you see us talking about that we'll have good second half revenue from that. you see, in general -- that's on the wins, and then, you see general credit momentum beginning in our portfolio. debit networks, i've talked about the strength of them and we feel very, very strongly about what's going on there in debit transaction growth. so when you put all those in the calculation, you saw us go from 2% to 7%, and you should expect us to continue our trajectory north.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america securities -- analyst
okay. good stuff. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. our last question comes from ramsey el-assal from barclays. please go ahead.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
hi guys. thanks for squeezing me in here. i wanted to ask about your payment mix in the acceptance segment sort of in a post-pandemic environment. i know we're maybe not 100% there yet. but when you think about digital versus offline, debit versus credit, smb versus enterprise, do you expect kind of a different mix in your business after the pandemic and how does that feed into your kind of longer-term growth algorithm?
robert hau -- chief financial officer
ramsey, i think we certainly have seen a broad movement to digital everything. that's why you hear his talk about the investments we're making in mobile capability and integrating our digital banking and card management experience. more and more digital transactions, e-commerce, etc. is certainly -- i believe the pandemic brought forward multiple periods of transition into that space. and i do think it was not transitory. those changes are here to stay. and we'll see, as people return to whatever normal is going to be, what that continued transition growth rate happens, but, obviously, we're seeing great growth in zelle.
we're seeing more and more transactions on account to account transfers and good e-com volume, you heard us talk about in our merchant space, up 21%. so getting mobile first capability and digital experiences was a focus of ours over the last several quarters, and we're bringing a number of that into a single instance right now and continue to see that integration going forward.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
great. let me squeeze one quick last one in here, which is, do you see the feds revisiting the durbin routing rule as kind of opening up a market opportunity for star and accel?
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
short and sweet.
robert hau -- chief financial officer
obviously, ramsey, it remains to be seen the timing and when that will happen, but does look to be a real opportunity for us.
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think the thing is, our capabilities around fraud and chargeback management and our capabilities to serve the biggest issuers is very deep. and i think that many times having a third network is very valuable to everybody, both merchants and issuers, and so -- and star and accel, we've invested heavily in them. and that's why we get the type of transaction growth you're seeing there. so, we really, really love our debit networks.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
great. fantastic. thanks.
frank j bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
so thank you for joining us this morning. we appreciate your support. if you have further questions, please don't hesitate to contact our investor relations team. stay safe and have a great day.

before i turn the call over to frank, please note, that going forward we will be using the term organic, constant currency revenue to replace internal revenue. there is no change in how we calculate this measure just to change in terminology.
and now, over to frank.
frank j. bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, shub, and thank you all for listening in as we share our results for the quarter and highlight the progress against our growth agenda. as you know, we serve as the operating system for commerce and money movement across our client base of the banks, fintechs and businesses, ranging from smbs to mid-market to large enterprises. we help our clients grow by extending our platform to capture new services and new money flows. we are also seeing real benefits from the ongoing economic recovery, especially here in the us. we remain optimistic and continue to invest in growth.
turning to our performance. we had a strong third quarter with total company adjusted revenue up 10%. adjusted operating margin expanded a 130 basis points to 34.2%. adjusted eps grew 23% to $1.47. we attained our highest quarter of actioned revenue synergies of $95 million. to date, we have achieved $420 million of actioned revenue synergies, 70% of the increase commitment of $600 million for the five-year period following the merger.
as we invested to accelerate growth, free cash flow came in at $572 million for the quarter and $2.3 billion year-to-date. free cash flow was driven by a combination of the following: first, increased capital expenditure in the areas of technology, innovation hubs and the integration of newly acquired capabilities; second, the working capital increase driven by revenue growth; and finally, reduced benefit of our net operating loss carry-forwards.
on the back of our results and the strength of our investments, we are tightening our outlook for organic revenue growth and raising the lower end of our outlook for adjusted eps. we now expect organic, constant currency growth of 11% for the full-year and adjusted earnings per share between $5.55 and $5.60. this raises the lower end of our prior adjusted earnings per share outlook by $0.05, a growth of 26% to 27% over last year.
turning to the business segments, let me start with merchant acceptance. we continue to grow beyond the buy button by investing in world-class omnichannel capabilities, solutioning around vertical and horizontal business needs and capturing new flows. we achieved all of this through our three growth platforms. clover for small business, clover connect for isv and carat for enterprises. driving into our performance, merchant acceptance led the quarter, posting organic revenue growth of 18% year-over-year with north america and international largely in line with the segment average for the quarter.
our global merchant locations have been growing at a healthy clip, up 10% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, driven by positive net new merchants across all regions. the quarter was driven by growth in global volume and transactions of 15% and 12%, respectively. north america volume and transactions grew 14% and 9%, respectively, led by strength in travel, restaurants and petro. excluding the impact of the loss of a large processing client through one of our jvs, north america volume and transaction growth in the quarter would have been 19% and 14%, respectively.
next, let's go deeper by platform, starting with clover. gpv grew 47% year-over-year or 39% cagr since 2019 to $196 billion on an annualized basis. in the smb space, we remain focused in building vertical-specific solutions, offering an integrated suite of products that help merchants to generate revenue and run their business. as part of our vertical strategy, we entered into an agreement to acquire bentobox, a digital marketing e-commerce platform, focused on driving growth in engagement for restaurants. this transaction will expand our clover dining solutions and industry-leading commerce and business management capabilities, which already enable nearly 200,000 restaurants of all sizes to deliver unique and differentiating dining experience from quick and casual, to fine dining. we expect the acquisition to close in the fourth quarter, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. additionally, we continue to focus on building value-added services for the clover platform, including clover capital, clover dining, clover order ahead and clover inventory, as well as our unique clover app marketplace.
on the enterprise side, carat, our enterprise omnichannel platform continued its strong momentum in the third quarter with new wins, product innovation and a gradual recovery in cross-border commerce. global e-commerce volume grew unabated in the quarter, driven by cross-border and international growth of 25% on a year-over-year basis, as volumes recovered from the pandemic lows with secular tailwinds expected to sustain future momentum. omnichannel transactions such as order ahead and buy online pickup in store grew 35% in the quarter.
we had notable e-commerce wins in the quarter, including johnson & johnson and caesars entertainment. we also expanded our existing global acquiring relationship with microsoft to be their provider for network tokens. in the quarter, we added paypal and venmo as digital wallet payout options to our global [indecipherable] platform, cementing carat as a leader in digital payouts with over 10 billion processed year-to-date, an increase of 230% on a year-over-year basis. additionally, we are building a new partnership with bakkt, a leading crypto and consumer wallet solution provider. bakkt will utilize fiserv's industry-leading funds in funds out solution and together, fiserv and bakkt, will develop new crypto use cases from both merchant and fi clients.
moving to clover connect, the strength of our isv-focused offering show that through the third quarter with isv volume of 71% year-over-year. clover connect allows us to bring together two strong fiserv assets. the world-class hardware and software platform of clover, along with the best-in-class partner management and operational tool of copilot, which gives isvs a unique view into all of the merchants activities ranging from merchant application processing to support. our commitment to being the best partner for isvs is resonating. we signed 47 new isvs in the third quarter, bringing our total wins to 142 year-to-date. we continue signing up isvs that are new to payments and winning against the competition. this quarter, more than half of our wins were competitive takeaways.
before i address our international progress, i'd like to highlight another focus area in our merchant business, point of sale lending. we are leveraging our position as the operating platform for businesses, small, medium and large to offer a range of buy now pay later options. we are expanding our referral relationships while simplifying the merchant experience through integrations with our platforms like clover. we currently have referral agreements with zip, citizens pay and bread. we're also working with our fi clients to bring their bnpl offerings to market. for example, we are partnering with synchrony to offer buy now pay later solutions on our card processing platform optis. synchrony also recently announced acceptance of private label cards through clover.
on our investor day, we talked to you about our merchant acceptance growth strategy for international. we remain focused on growing our global market presence with world-class bank partners and through our direct channels, all while leveraging the strength of common platforms and connections. the global expansion of clover platform into apac, latin america and emea are all currently in play. we are on track to roll out clover in india by the third quarter of 2022, a tremendous opportunity, given the size and growth potential of the market. clover is already in market in argentina, as expected to launch in brazil next year, thereby, covering the two largest markets in latin america. in emea, clover is in market across the uk, germany and netherlands and ireland with a further boost expected with the rollout of the deutsche bank jv that we announced last quarter. among the key apac deals completed in the quarter is an omnichannel merchant acquirer processing mandate from bank of china with their fast-growing macau market.
moving to emea, fiserv partnered with postfinance, one of the largest financial institutions in switzerland to provide credit card acquiring services to their swiss merchant clients. we are starting with an initial 4,000 merchants that accept the postfinance card today with plans to expand to the entire merchant base of 60,000 over time. fiserv is also supporting restaurant brands, owner of iconic brands, including burger king and popeyes, as the company expands its footprint across europe through an [phonetic] omnichannel approach. fiserv will provide acquiring services for burger king in the uk and the nordics and popeyes in the uk.
to close on the merchant segment, as you may recall, in april, we won a 20-year deal to become the exclusive provider of merchant acquiring services for caixa economica federal, one of the largest brazilian banks. we are pleased to report that the implementation of this mandate started at the beginning of august and is going extremely well with 65,000 merchants onboarded as of last week.
moving to the payments and network segment, organic revenue grew 6% in the quarter, resulting in year-to-date growth of 5%. our payments segment consists of three businesses: global credit processing and output solutions, which we call issuer solutions, which is 40% of the segment; debit processing and debit networks, which we call -- refer to as card services, also one-third of the segment; and the third business is comprised of digital solutions bill pay and our prepaid business. our issuer solutions business, which grew just below the overall payments segment average is seeing the benefit of a continued credit recovery with general purpose credit gross active accounts up in the high-single digits. note, that our credit issuer solutions revenue is driven by number of accounts not credit volume. however, as credit volumes recover, the number of accounts will follow. looking ahead, we expect growth in the business to be driven by the continued ramp of last year's notable wins, including three of the top 25 issuer wins, which we announced last year. we also recently completed pnc's conversion of bbva's card portfolios to our platform. our retail private label portfolio also continues to recover from its covid loans, although at a slower pace than we anticipated at the beginning of the year.
within card services, which grew organic revenue a couple of points faster than the overall payments segment average, we saw a strong growth in debit transactions driving our issuance and network businesses. looking ahead, we expect to sustain growth for this business by broadening our total addressable market. for instance, in the quarter, our star debit network signed an agreement with leading us consumer fintech, chime, to become its preferred unaffiliated network for debit. we believe that aligning with one of the largest fintech issuers is a testimony to the scale and technical capabilities of the star network and positions the network well for future growth. this was also one of our notable action synergy revenues in the quarter.
during our investor day, we discussed the opportunity to offer a fully managed by fiserv of credit card issuing option to community fis and share that we were actively exploring this market. we are pleased to announce that we are currently piloting our agent-credit program offerings branded credit choice, and we'll launch in q1 2022. credit choice is a fully managed credit card issuing-as-a-service solution that allows our community fis to offer their customers and fi-branded credit card experience that is fully integrated into their debit solution, but without the operational burden of running their own credit card portfolio. credit choice leverages our scale distribution and world-class card issuing surround solutions such as ondot and spendlabs to expand into a sizable new addressable market for fiserv where the economics per card are considerably richer than in processing. we have already seen strong early interest from clients with hundreds of prospects in the pipeline.
on the q2 call, we spoke to you about our rich mobile-first consumer and business offerings, powered by recent acquisitions ondot and spendlabs. the early results of the launch has been very encouraging. we completed the integration of the card hub platform into our credit and debit processing platforms into our mobiliti mobile banking platform. we are seeing tremendous demand for this integrated solution from both new prospects, as well as existing cardvalet clients whom we expect to fully migrate to the integrated card hub solutions by the end of 2022. in addition, we expect to expand the platform to add loyalty, instalment payment and dispute management, thereby, establishing card hub as a key differentiator to drive new sales and client retention. for our financial institution clients, this solution is a game changer. it enhances consumer engagement with their digital banking platform, creates more fee income through greater card usage and catapults the fis overall digital experience into the leagues of some of the world's top banks and neobanks.
in the third business, results are mixed. we had good growth in our digital payments activity led by zelle transaction growth of 75% in the quarter and the number of clients live now reaching just under 750. prepaid growth was driven by new client wins within our solutions business. we expect growth to continue driven by new use cases. our bill pay business, which encompasses both the direct biller and bill pay through our financial institutions continues to grow slower than expected. however, we are extending our bill pay capabilities beyond the financial institution channel going live later this month as an enabler of paypal's bill payment functionality within paypal's new app. additionally, we expanded our relationship with a large telecom provider to enable commercial card payments with our billmatrix solution.
moving to the financial technology segment, the quarter was in line with our expectations, posting organic revenue growth of 4%, resulting in 4% growth year-to-date. we added 14 new core account processing clients in the quarter, including seven competitive takeaways and two de novo wins. our dne platform is seeing great success, including with larger financial institutions as evidenced in the valley national bank and dollar bank wins with assets over $40 billion and $10 billion, respectively.
abiliti, our modern cloud-based api-driven digital banking platform is seeing great momentum with a 150 incremental sales in the quarter. 138 of these sales were to existing clients, which would drive our client's digital transformation and deepen the penetration of our fully integrated digital surrounds, such as card hub, zelle and spendlabs. the remaining 12 were new logo sales with half being core competitive takeaways. we also continue to enrich our open banking and fintech ecosystem. again, in line with the goals laid out in last year's investor conference.
we launched our new developer portal, which we call the fiserv developer studio toward the end of the third quarter. the developer studio provides rich and expansive api integrations to support banks, fintechs, merchants and enterprise clients with developer tools needed to accelerate innovation, integrations across the entire fiserv ecosystem. additionally, we also announced partnerships with exciting news fintechs, futurefuel.io and streetshares, and that [phonetic] creating new whitespace opportunities in digital for both retail consumer and small business lending, respectively. we believe that we're extremely well positioned to continue to drive revenue in a segment higher by delivering new innovation, such as abiliti, strategically acquiring and integrating attractive surround solutions like ondot and spendlabs and leveraging the power of the developer community through our developer studio api portal or dedicated go-to-market integrations like futurefuel.io and streetshares.
now, let me pass the discussion to bob for more detail on our financial results.
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer
thank you, frank, and good morning, everyone. before i begin reviewing the detailed business results, as shub mentioned, we are aligning with the broader community and simplifying our message by clarifying our internal revenue growth metric as organic, constant currency revenue. this does not change how we calculate this measure, just clarifies the terminology. it will be the same definition and calculations we've used in prior quarters.
on slide 11, we've included a new schedule to clearly provide an understanding of the walk from gaap revenue to internal or organic revenue for the third quarter. this summary could be seen in more detail in the appendix of our presentation.
now, i will cover some detail on each of our segments. if you're following along on our slides, i'm starting with slide 4. we feel great about our performance for both the quarter and the first nine months of the year and we are well positioned to achieve strong full-year financial results. total company organic revenue was up 10% in the quarter, with growth across all segments, led by merchant acceptance segment, which grew 18%. year-to-date, total company organic revenue grew 11%, also led by the merchant acceptance segment, which grew 21%. total company adjusted revenue also grew 10% to nearly $4 billion in the quarter. year-to-date, total company adjusted revenue has grown 11% to $11.7 billion.
third quarter adjusted operating income was up a strong 15% to $1.4 billion and adjusted operating margin increased by 130 basis points to 34.2%. this margin improvement was driven by our strong revenue results and our continued disciplined cost synergy execution, which produced $64 million of incremental cost synergies during the quarter. and we have now actioned $1.16 billion program today. year-to-date, adjusted operating income increased 23% to $3.8 billion. adjusted operating margin year-to-date expanded 330 basis points to 33.2%.
our third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 23% to $1.47 compared to $1.20 in the prior year. through september 30, adjusted earnings per share grew 29% to $4.01, putting us on pace to achieve our 36th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth, a testament to the incredible strength and resiliency of this company.
free cash flow for the first nine months of the year was $2.3 billion, resulting in an 85% free cash flow conversion. this result was driven by increased capital investments related to technology, world-class facilities and the integration of newly acquired businesses, working capital increase driven by revenue growth and a reduction in the net operating loss carry-forward benefit. with these investments and strong revenue growth, we now expect free cash flow conversion to be 95% to 100% for the full-year.
now, looking to our segment results starting on slide 6. organic revenue growth in the merchant acceptance segment was a very strong 18% in the quarter and 21% year-to-date. our revenue was driven by a combination of growth in volume and transactions. our results were once again driven by strong performance across all three platforms, clover for smbs, carat for large businesses and clover connect for isvs. clover continues to build upon the momentum and strength of our product offering as it posted a very strong 47% gpv growth year-over-year or $196 billion on an annualized basis with growth across all of our distribution channels. with carat, we won 45 new global enterprise e-commerce clients on the platform in the quarter. in addition, carat expanded its mandate with existing high-quality brands, such as valero. continuing its lead in the high-growth online ebt space, carat has launched more than 50 clients to online ebt in the past 12 months. our isv volume in this quarter to clover connect grew 71% year-over-year, and up almost 150% versus the third quarter of 2019. we are winning both isvs that are new to payments, as well as competitive takeaways.
adjusted operating income in the acceptance segment increased 30% to $552 million in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was up 300 basis points to 32.2%, driven by top line strength. through september 30, adjusted operating income improved 57% to $1.5 billion and adjusted operating margin grew 710 basis points to 30.6%.
turning to slide 7, the payments and network segment posted organic revenue growth of 6% in the quarter, resulting in year-to-date growth of 5%. as frank outlined in the composition of this segment, our card services, digital payments and prepaid businesses outperformed the segment organic revenue growth rate. global issuer solutions came in just under the segment average, while bill pay was a headwind. account to account transfers and p2p solutions continue to rise with consumer demand. zelle transactions in the quarter were up 75% and the number of clients live on zelle was up 65% in the quarter. debit transactions grew 11% in the quarter, a strong result in light of the tougher year-over-year comparisons in the third quarter versus the second quarter, driven by the macro impact of the reduced benefits of the stimulus.
given the performance year-to-date, we expect to see the payments and network segments full-year organic revenue rate to be within the medium-term outlook growth rate of 5% to 8%, driven by the continued ramp in new client onboarding and strong uptake of our advanced digital offering. however, this outlook is slightly tempered versus our previous expectation of approaching the higher end of 5% to 8% organic revenue growth target range.
adjusted operating income for this segment was up 7% to $650 million and adjusted operating margin was up 50 basis points to 44% in the quarter. year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 7% to $1.9 billion and adjusted operating margin was up 110 basis points to 43.4%. the results were driven by positive momentum in our card and issuer business and the positive impact of revenue and cost synergies.
turning to slide 8, the financial technology segment organic revenue grew 4% in the quarter. year-to-date, organic revenue growth for the segment is 4% within our medium-term outlook for this segment of 4% to 6%. our digital banking capabilities and digital solution offerings continue to win in the marketplace. as frank mentioned, we added 14 new core account processing clients in the quarter, half of which were competitive takeaways. we completed our integration of ondot card management capabilities into our mobiliti mobile banking platform and are currently in market with that offering. mobile deposits in q3 grew 10.5% over the prior year, while self-service atm deposits grew nearly 60% over last year.
adjusted operating income was up 4% in the quarter to $275 million and up 10% year-to-date to $794 million. adjusted operating margin in the segment decreased 40 basis points in the quarter to 36%. however, on a two-year basis, adjusted operating margin has increased 560 basis points versus the third quarter of 2019. adjusted operating margin expanded 190 basis points to 35.3% year-to-date.
the adjusted corporate operating loss was $121 million in the quarter, in line with last year. the adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.3%, improving 260 basis points versus prior year. and we now expect our full-year adjusted effective tax rate to be about 20%.
during the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy by repurchasing over 3 million shares for $365 million. we have more than 52 million shares remaining authorized for share repurchase.
as frank mentioned, earlier this month, we entered into an agreement to acquire bentobox, a digital marketing and e-commerce platform, focused on driving growth and engagement for restaurants that we will integrate into clover's dining solutions to further strengthen our omnichannel restaurant platform. we expect to close this transaction later this quarter.
total debt outstanding was $21 billion on september 30 and the debt-to-adjusted ebitda ratio decreased to 32 [phonetic] -- to 3.2 times.
q3 was another demonstration of our time-tested capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, making organic investment, innovative solutions and pursuing high-value acquisitions.
with that, let me turn the call back to frank.
frank j. bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, bob. i'm very proud of the results we've accomplished with another quarter of double-digit adjusted revenue growth and double-digit adjusted eps growth. in addition to delivering on our financial results, we continue to focus on our associates and our communities. in july, fiserv was named the disability:in's disability equality index 2021 best places to work, and in september, received the silver torch award from the national black mba association as partner of the year, recognizing our commitment to putting diversity at the forefront of our values and talent and client engagement strategies.
during the quarter, we also entered into a multi-year relationships with girl scouts usa and the russell innovation center for entrepreneurship. these partnerships focus on increasing access and opportunity for aspiring women in minorities within the entrepreneurial ecosystem. we also expanded our back-to-business program to detroit and the washington dc, maryland, virginia area, as well as internationally with our entry into the uk.
additionally, during the quarter, we also completed our cdp submission and for the first time, published our eeo-1 filing on our internet site. none of these achievements would have been possible without our world-class talent. i thank our more than 40,000 associates around the world for their commitment and courage as we stand together to deliver value for clients, our colleagues and you, our shareholders.
with that, operator, please open the line for questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from tien-tsin huang from j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks so much. good morning. i wanted to ask on acceptance. i'll ask on acceptance, looks like you outperformed global fees volume if i'm looking at this correctly, but the yields turn negative in the third quarter, and it was positive last quarter, so just a question here on pricing and mix in general for acceptance and what the outlook on yields might be here going into the fourth quarter? thanks.
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer
yes. tien-tsin, it's bob. good morning. i would attribute largely that variation to the difference between volume and trans of our mix relative to what you might see in visa, as well as -- the yield ever so slightly, that ebbs and flows within the quarter depending on the mix of smb versus enterprises. overall, we feel quite good about the overall performance, how we're performing against the overall market and against our peers.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got you. so more mix than pricing. thank you.
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer
yes.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from lisa ellis from moffettnathanson. please go ahead.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson llc -- analyst
terrific. thank you. i think i'll follow up on tien-tsin's question and actually specifically ask about the large processing client roll off that you highlighted that looks like it's about a 5-point drag on overall volumes in merchant acceptance and a larger drag on e-comm. can you just elaborate a little bit on that situation? and specifically, how should we think about how it's affecting revenues like if it's a low-yielding client? and then also, is that something now that will take another three quarters before it lapsed? or just any additional detail there would be helpful? thank you.
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer
yeah, lisa. good morning. the way to think about this is a large client that we processed through a joint venture. we pointed it out in terms of adjusting our volume and transactions for transparency. it has very little impact overall on the actual revenue and the revenue numbers you see there are as reported. so, including that decline that client is largely off our platform at this point. and so, you'll see it from a year-over-year standpoint, but there is no more decline going forward because they're essentially off our platform at the end of the third quarter.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson llc -- analyst
terrific. thank you. thanks for the clarification.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from dave koning from baird. please go ahead.
david koning -- baird -- analyst
yeah. hey, guys. nice job. i guess, first of all, just in acceptance, i think last quarter you even mentioned q4 being up sequentially from q3. i guess, is that still the case? and maybe as i look back on some of the more normal years, it seemed like you'd grow a few percent sequentially in q4. just wondering, anything in q3 or q4 that would disrupt that kind of normal few percent up sequentially pattern.
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer
so you're talking about growth quarter-to-quarter sequentially?
david koning -- baird -- analyst
yeah. just sequential revenue growth in acceptance, it looks like a few percent up is kind of normal in q4.
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer
yeah, david. i think it's tough to call anything normal these days. i would expect our fourth quarter to be roughly in line with third quarter sequentially for this year.
david koning -- baird -- analyst
okay. okay, cool. and then, i guess, secondly just payments. i know you kind of called out how it's going to be within the range, you said for maybe at the upper end of the range. is some of that anything that's falling into 2022 now? were there any maybe delays in implementations or anything there that just kind of makes 2022 now a little better than it previously would have been?
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer
yeah. i wouldn't call it any delays per se, but we highlighted a few growth drivers that we'll see into 2022. a couple of the new wins, paypal going live, we signed a new large us telecom that will go live soon. and, of course, the announcement of credit choice will help us as we launch that program. as frank pointed out, we're now in pilot. we're seeing very strong demand for that program for something that we had not formally announced yet. so we're just now announcing that. so we have some good early read on that and, of course, we'll have card hub offering that we acquired through ondot are for a full-year next year and that is now fully integrated into our mobiliti platform and we continue to build out that capability.
frank j. bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
we also have -- there is three of the top 25 issuers that are beginning onboarding. so that will be within the numbers next year. and you heard us talk about us converting the bbva on pal platform also for our client pnc. so -- and you're going to continue to get the zelle ramp in there also as that continues to grow and we onboard more. so, i think those all will factor into next year's numbers.
david koning -- baird -- analyst
sounds great. thanks guys. nice job.
frank j. bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. next we have james faucette from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you very much. i wanted to ask a little bit more of a strategic question. i appreciate all the color on near-term trends and benefits that you're getting from new customer wins. but frank, it seems like you have picked up a little bit the pace of acquisitions, at least the announced ones recently. can you talk about how you're feeling about potential and importance of doing acquisitions as part of your fis or as part of your overall strategy and if that's evolving at all? and i guess, tied to that, bob highlighted the balanced capital allocation. but i'm wondering if it makes sense to accelerate debt pay down a little bit to improve optionality in case bigger deals come along. thanks a lot.
frank j. bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
well, maybe i'll talk about what we've been doing on m&a and how we're looking at m&a. and i think the first thing is, whether it's m&a, we're building our businesses. we're investing organically and inorganically. and i think the thing that, hopefully, you see is our agility and speed and innovation. we talked about ondot and it's fully integrated beyond its initial capability and now in our mobile product did winning in the market. you see us go and look at bentobox and we're extending our total addressable market with the capability that we'll start with restaurants but actually, it could be a storefront in much larger. but all of these are nurturing good strong start-ups that then will allow to drive in our environment and we put the capital behind them to integrate them and grow, and you hear how we bring spendlabs all along with it.
so, i think you should expect us to continue that and realize that, i think, we believe we have a deep skill set in integrating properties, transforming our property itself, in some cases, we're even disrupting ourselves in the process as we move from cardvalet to card hub to an integration. so you should expect us to continue to do that and be very, very thoughtful about acquisitions, but we will invest inorganically and we'll invest organically and we also invest organically in the acquisitions to allow them to drive within our ecosystem and not to be stand-alone entities.
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer
and then, james, as far as paying down debt, we've seen a significant reduction or improvement in our leverage now with 3.2 times back -- when we completed the merger, we were just over 4 times, but we continue to generate good free cash flow. and as you may recall, back at our investor day last december, we talked about the capital to deploy over the next five years, a more than $30 billion. as we enter 2022, not only we have very strong cash flow, but we will also have capacity on the balance sheet as ebitda grows, the company will quote naturally de-lever. and so, we'll have the capability to borrow just to maintain that historic leverage ratio. so, we feel like we're very good positioned to be able to complete acquisitions that we feel we want to complete. it's not prohibited or more constrained by capital.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's great color and context. thanks, frank. thanks, bob.
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer
sure.
operator
thank you. next we have jason kupferberg from bank of america. please go ahead.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america -- analyst
thanks, guys. good morning. i just wanted to start with a follow-up on the -- that large processing client that is coming out of the numbers here. i guess, it looks like it's in e-comm clients just based on how much it impacted the e-comm volume numbers specifically. and was this just a competitive situation that was becoming too price intense from your guys' perspective. just wanted to get a little bit more color, because it's fairly sizable it appears.
frank j. bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, let's go, first, that volume coming off our system is in our revenue number. so hold that thought, right? i mean -- so when you look at a large processing client off a jv, that's exactly what it sounds like, which is, first of all, they -- this was long telegraphed by the client. but when we always talked about our business, we knew the rpg on this and never saw as an real economic impact, really just a volume impact to our business. and they went in-house. it wasn't a competitive takeaway and it was part of their strategy and we are happy to support them with our processing capability to rollout jvs for the period of time that we're given.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. thank you for that. and just on the free cash flow conversion, i just wanted to hone in on what, i guess, where the most significant changes in your expectations versus last quarter, because -- i mean, at the end of the day, i know on a quarterly basis, obviously, working capital can move around, but full-year revenue is coming in right in line with your plan, presumably the diminished benefit of the nol would have been known previously. so is this really just a function of kind of higher capex than you anticipated at the end of the day versus what you were thinking last quarter?
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer
yeah. jason, the way to think about it is, our 11% revenue outlook, certainly, at the high-end of our original outlook was 7% to 12%. so we're growing quite a bit faster than we originally expected overall. we are also seeing meaningful opportunities to invest for growth. so, to your point, capex is higher in terms of spending on creating new capabilities, new products and services, as well as integrating the acquisitions that we announced earlier in the year, things like ondot, the software development that we're investing there to integrated into our existing capabilities, our other products and services, but to create new capability with some of those acquisitions led us to make the decision to continue to invest in growth and still have very good free cash flow and good cash conversion overall.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america -- analyst
yeah, yeah. it doesn't sound like any structural. okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. next we have ramsey el-assal from barclays. please go ahead.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
thanks for taking my question today. frank, i wanted to ask you a kind of a broader question. there seems to be some debate or discussion among investors about potential fintech kind of disruptive forces in the marketplace. at the same time, it seems like you guys function as somewhat of an infrastructure or enablement layer for fintechs. i mean, even from the call today you talked about chime and bakkt and paypal and i know there's a slew of others. so, can you talk about this tension between fintech as a competitor and a potential disruptor versus fintech as just sort of a high-growth distribution channel for the business?
frank j. bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, i think this as a long-term issue really back in time, right? i mean, we are a platform as i like to say for everything from fintechs to smb, the large enterprises. and if you think about what we did with clover, that was open up a community to the development community. so we can be a platform for them and then a platform for end users. so, my view and our view is we're happy to do things to disrupt ourselves. like you see us doing with the spendlabs, the ondot, and even clover was a disruptor of ourselves. and we continue to use our platform to enable and ultimately, we want to serve all communities.
so, i think if you think about things we've talked about here, chime, previously [indecipherable]. bakkt being an enabler and a lot of our clients point this. if you think about us bringing paypal into the bill payment ecosystem, we are going to use our platform to enable and then we're going to compete heavily with our full capabilities. so, our traditional clients who will get all the capabilities and continued innovation and we will also enable those that have the capabilities that we believe our clients would use. when you think about all of this -- if you hear us talk about being a token provider for microsoft, that's about bringing their authorization rates higher. so, i don't really find any conflict here. we have waterfront property, we open up the waterfront property and our job is to enable commerce and we get paid for enabling commerce.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
that makes a lot of sense. i appreciate your answers there. thank you.
operator
thank you. next we have darrin peller from wolfe research. please go ahead.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey. thanks, guys. i want to hone in on clover because i know there has been a lot of discussion on what that asset could mean for you. so, help us understand any more metrics you think makes sense on the success of that asset? obviously, it's continues to grow well, but any other metrics in terms of how big the revenue is from that now? what kind of growth do you anticipate? maybe any kind of profitability volume?
and then also, is there an opportunity given some disruption we're hearing about in the market around the chinese competitor having some challenges on their terminals in the market now. i think they have 3 million or so terminals that might be a challenge now. could there be a replacement opportunity for clover on that?
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer
yeah. darrin, it's bob. i think, overall, obviously, we are quite pleased with the progress in the continued growth prospects of clover gpv up 46%, just under $200 billion for the third quarter on an annualized basis. we continue to invest in new capabilities and expand our reach there. as you know, large proportion, about 90% of that volume is new to fiserv. and so, that is certainly a growth driver for the company overall, and continue to expect that going forward. we're adding capabilities. bentobox as a great example is building out some of the verticals across that capability. we have significant strong distribution channels and with the dissolution of the bams joint venture we have a good and very quickly growing direct channel that we -- you didn't see us have a few years back. and so, we continue to see good opportunity there.
and in terms of that terminal dynamic, we have -- obviously, we have our own clover devices. we also use other terminals for the other parts of our company. i mean, we have a variety of different providers of those terminals and no disruption to us at this point.
frank j. bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and i would just add, clover is a platform of choice. you heard about the international expansion of that. and i would think that as people are making choices going forward where disruption for others that will just further accelerate our growth.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
yeah. i think that could be an opportunity for you to take a lot of share in the us, at least with what's going on there. quick follow-up is just on the cash flow and the capital deployment. just given what normalized earnings could be, how strongly or would you consider a more material accelerated share buyback by any chance just given -- you're now -- you probably will be at about that 2.8 turns leverage target, let's call it, at the end of the year. thanks, guys.
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer
yeah, darrin, i think the way we think about capital deployment has been and remains quite consistent and quite balanced. we continue to focus on growing the business organically. doing value-accretive inorganic growth, i.e., acquisitions and then still looking to return cash to shareholders where appropriate. i don't think you ought to anticipate us doing a large buyback. as you know, we're essentially in the market every quarter and have been for years short of the short period of time between announcing and closing our merger back in 2019 and we'll continue to be a disciplined capital allocator.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from timothy chiodo from credit suisse. please go ahead.
timothy chiodo -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you for taking the question. i want to dig in a little bit more of a two mix-related questions on clover and you sort of alluded to in the last question, but hopefully we can get some of the mix percentages. so, first, would be around the portions of revenue. so large portion would be payments-related, but also you highlighted at the investor day some increasing software attach, strength in value-added services and then also clearly there is the hardware component. so, even if you could just give us sort of rough breakdown of those components?
and then the second part is around mix and distribution. so you alluded to some of the various channels, whether it'd be direct and bank partners, retail iso, wholesale iso. even just broad strokes on the mix of distribution would be really helpful.
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer
yeah, tim. so a couple of things to think about there. one, in terms of channel, we are seeing right growth across all of our channels, whether it's through partners, through the isv, isos, through obviously our joint ventures, as well as, as i mentioned in the previous question of building out our direct channel. we have had and continue to be focused on having a very wide breadth of distribution capabilities and continue to focus on winning in all of those channels and that remains -- has been and will continue to be a broad focus of ours.
and then in terms of breakdown of revenue, we haven't given detail around the mix of hardware versus software versus processing. obviously, the vast majority of our revenue in the merchant acceptance business is the merchant acquiring revenue inside of clover. obviously, we've got hardware that we sell, but the magic to clover is, you saw the hardware and then you have a processing client, a merchant acquiring client for years and years with high attach and high attainment rate and we continue to focus on that.
timothy chiodo -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay, great. thank you so much for the help.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from david togut from evercore isi. please go ahead.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you. good morning. within merchant acceptance, what impact are you seeing on your payment volume when a competitive buy now pay later solution is added at one of your e-commerce clients? and in particular, i'd appreciate your help with two things, number one, are you retaining the merchant acquiring or merchant processing when a bnpl company has added or they bring in their own merchant acquirer? and number two, do you have any insights into funding mix when bnpl gets added at one of your clients in terms of debit ach versus credit? thank you.
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think a couple of things, number one, we have a number of referral partners and over the last several quarters, we've announced. we've talked about these whether it's zip or bread or citizens pay. we continue to be focused on enabling multiple options for our merchants and, obviously, we're the merchant acquirer for those merchants and so providing that capability, maintains that relationship with those merchants.
in terms of credit versus ach, etc., i think broad industry view is, today, a large portion of that paying for buy now pay later activity is actually paid for or finally executed through card payments.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
so you're not seeing any specific mix in terms of ach when you look across kind of bnpl adoption at your customers?
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer
no. i think the key there is, well, buy now pay later has a high volume in terms of news. it's still a relatively small portion of the overall gpv or merchant space and not moving the needle and, in fact, in some instances, instead of one transaction you're actually seeing four transactions.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from dan dolev from mizuho. please go ahead.
dan dolev -- mizuho securities -- analyst
hi, guys. good morning. thank you for taking my question. can you give us some color on the -- what's implied in the fourth quarter organic growth guidance for the two other segments for payments and fintech? that would be great. thank you.
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer
dan, you were quite -- can you repeat that question?
dan dolev -- mizuho securities -- analyst
can you give us some color on what's implied by the guidance of the organic growth guidance for the other two segments, fintech and payments and networks?
robert w. hau -- chief financial officer
yeah. so i think i tried to give some of that color in our prepared remarks. in our fintech segment, year-to-date, we're now at 4% and we expect for the full-year to be in that medium-term outlook range of 4% to 6%. and then in our payments segment, again, relative to kind of our medium-term guidance or medium-term outlook, 5% to 8%. we expect to be in that range, that is adjusted from previously were expected to be at the high-end of -- toward the high-end of the range. right now it's in the range. and year-to-date, we're at 5%.
dan dolev -- mizuho securities -- analyst
got it. understood. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. and that was our last question for today's call.
frank j. bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
i'd like to thank everybody for joining us this morning. we appreciate your support. if you have further questions, please contact our investor relation team. have a great day. and thank you for everything.

2021-Q4,FISV,2022-02-08 08:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
welcome to the fiserv 2021 fourth-quarter earnings conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. at this time, i would like to turn the call over to shub mukherjee, senior vice president of investor relations at fiserv.
shub mukherjee -- senior vice president, investor relations
thank you, and good morning. with me on the call today are frank bisignano, our president and chief executive officer; and bob hau, our chief financial officer. our earnings release and supplemental materials for the quarter are available on the investor relations section of fiserv.com. please refer to these materials for an explanation of the non-gaap financial measures discussed in this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable gaap measures.
unless otherwise noted, performance references are year-over-year comparisons. our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results and strategic initiatives. forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. you should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors.
as a reminder from our last earnings call, we will now be using the term organic revenue, which has replaced internal revenue and is still calculated on a constant-currency basis. and now over to frank. 
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, shub, and thank you all for joining us this morning. as you know, we serve as the operating system for commerce and money movement across our client base of banks, credit unions, fintechs, and businesses ranging from smbs to mid-market to large enterprises. we help our clients grow by extending our platform to capture new services and new money flows. as we exit the second year of a pandemic, we had another successful year of delivering on our growth agenda.
we delivered 11% organic revenue growth for both the fourth quarter and full year at the high end of our 7% to 12% outlook that we originally provided at our december 2020 investor day. we expanded full-year adjusted operating margins by 250 basis points. we also achieved 26% growth year over year in adjusted earnings per share to $5.58, well above our original outlook of $5.25 to $5.45. our merchant platforms: clover and clover connect for small- and medium-sized businesses, and carat for enterprises are showing very strong growth.
we are winning in omnichannel and seeing strong growth in value-added services such as clover software, fraud, risk, lending, and payment flows, including disbursements and cross-border. our acquisitions of bentobox and netpay give us the assets to enhance self-service offerings in verticals like restaurants and allow us to power new flows via paybacks. we are successfully meeting our fi clients goal of driving digital engagement for our best-in-class online and mobile banking platform ability, as well as integrated mobile-first surround solutions, such as cardhub, featuring ondot for retail customers, and spendlabs for small business customers. recall that we bought ondot and spendlabs in 2021 and are already seeing great traction with them.
we expect these solutions will have a positive effect, strengthening our client value proposition across core banking, payment processing, and the network business. we made outstanding progress on the integration of fiserv and first data. the fourth quarter marks the completion of our cost synergy program. we achieved our target of $1.2 billion, $300 million above our original commitment and two years ahead of schedule.
we actioned $480 million of revenue synergies and are now at 80% of the increased commitment of $600 million. we anticipate obtaining the full $600 million of revenue synergies by the end of this year, 18 months ahead of schedule. strengthening our leadership as our clients' partner of choice, yesterday, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining ownership interest in finxact. we were an initial investor in finxact, a leading developer of cloud-native banking solutions that is powering digital transformation across financial services.
this is an investment in the next-generation financial technology that supports our strategy to continuously innovate for our clients and broaden our total addressable market. finxact will not only augment our ability to enrich and accelerate the delivery of digital solutions we offer to our existing clients, but also broaden our solutions to include large financial institutions, fintechs, bankings as a service, and embedded finance opportunities. we've worked closely with the finxact team and look forward to welcoming frank sanchez, his leadership team, and the entire finxact organization to fiserv when the deal closes later this year. our business momentum and investments thus far position us very well for the future.
accordingly, we have good visibility into accelerating our organic growth to a rate of 7% to 9%, above our average for the last three years and in line with our medium-term outlook. we expect 2022 adjusted eps to be $6.40 to $6.55, which is a growth of 15% to 17%. this, when combined with the 26% growth we delivered in 2021, will generate a two-year compounded annual growth of 21%, above the high end of our medium-term outlook range of 15% to 20%. turning to the business segments.
let me start with merchant acceptance. we continue to focus on investing in our leading merchant operating systems, clover and carat, to provide products and services that expands our addressable market and to drive growth for our clients in the smb and enterprise space. these operating systems continue to perform well and were key drivers of merchant acceptance organic revenue growth of 19% and 20% for the quarter and year, respectively. clover continues to be the commerce and business management platform of choice for smbs in the u.s.
and around the world. in 2021, as small business recovery took hold, merchants turned to clover for leading in-store payment solutions, online commerce capabilities, and new vertical services to grow their business. we completed our acquisition of bentobox, a leading digital ordering and delivering management platform to help out close to 200,000 restaurant owners on our platform reach more customers. in addition to bentobox, we signed a variety of strategic partnerships to enhance the tools restaurants need to be successful.
one such example is our new partnership with google to enable customers to more easily find and order from clover restaurant locations. as we roll out these holistic saas-based solutions, we see notable increases in the average revenue per merchant. we are very excited about continuing this success and replicating it across other verticals. closing out 2021, clover is better positioned than ever as the leading operating system for smbs.
carat, our omnichannel ecosystem serving enterprise clients, continues to grow across the board. we saw particular strength in omnichannel transactions, which were up 51% in 2021. as the demand for omnichannel solutions persisted through 2021, demand for our integrated solutions, such as disbursements and payback enablement, ebt, and other digital capabilities, rose to an all-time high. disbursements have become an important part of the consumer experience in many verticals through the pandemic.
consumers and businesses want simple, fast access to their money digitally. carat is well-positioned to drive growth in disbursements as evidenced in its expanded relationships with a number of companies within the insurance and ride-sharing sectors, as well as digital wallet companies, including marquee brands such as coinbase. turning to our cross-border capabilities, we continue to see strength from the recovery with double-digit cross-border transaction growth in 2021. looking forward into 2022, we will continue to push deeper into key priority areas, including omnichannel disbursements, and cross-border to expand the breadth and depth of services for our enterprise clients.
moving to the payments and network segment. organic revenue grew 8% in the quarter and 6% for the full year. within the issuer business, we saw notable strength in general-purpose active accounts, now ahead of pre-pandemic levels. our card business continues to provide growth above the segment average from strength in digital risk solutions, debit network volumes, and debit transaction growth.
market-leading innovative solutions like cardhub and spendlabs are both enhancing revenue and reducing churn. in fact, spendlabs' product-market fit is stronger than we had originally anticipated. and this offering, along with cardhub, are notably contributing to our expanded presence with mid-market fis for card processing solutions. these surrounds not only greatly enhance the competitiveness of our credit and debit card processing offerings, but also serve to drive more cards into our demo network and more opportunities for fiserv to offer risk and fraud, digital banking, and account processing solutions, yet again, demonstrating our ability to harness the power of our unmatched distribution platform.
looking to 2022, we expect to see continued momentum from the ramp of our large credit issuer wins in 2020 and 2021, including alliance data, atlanticus, and genesis, three top 25 issuers, strengthen our digital offerings with cardhub and spendlabs and strengthen zelle. moving to the financial technology segment. the fourth quarter was in line with our expectations, posting organic revenue growth of 4%, closing out the year up 4%. we finished 2021 strong on sales with 48 new core wins, including competitive takeaways with marquee names, such as valley bank and dollar bank.
not only are we winning in core account processing, but also seeing success in cross-selling pan-fiserv capabilities to clients. this is demonstrated in our competitive takeaway of great southern bank, an institution with more than $5 billion in assets. with this agreement, great southern bank will be moving to a complete suite of fiserv offerings across core account processing, digital banking surrounds, card processing, and output solutions. we are continuing to win in the higher-growth $1 billion to $50 billion asset segment.
clients continue to choose fiserv as their strategic technology partner to power combined entities into the future. key wins in 2021 include nycb's merger with flagstar and first interstate bank's merger with great western. sales of digital surround solutions grew strong double digits in 2021, driven by the increased digital focus of our financial institution clients and the success of mobiliti, our modern online mobile banking platform. we finished the year with 434 sales to existing and new logos.
sales to existing clients help deepen the penetration of our fully integrated digital surrounds such as cardhub, zelle, and spendlabs. it is clear that our solutions are already winning in the market. we will accelerate this momentum through our announced agreement to acquire finxact, which will enable clients to quickly deploy modular banking services, including deposits, loans, cards, as well as launch new banking solutions, including a digital bank, bank as a service, and embedded finance. we have already made strides in the category of api development, and the market is recognizing our leadership.
in 2021, we are proud to accept an award for the best finance apis for our communicator advantage api platform at the api world awards, and for alldata connect, our data aggregation portal at the business intelligent groups 2020 to big innovation awards. looking into 2022 and beyond, the powerful combination of our market-leading banking cores, along with finxact, which enables clients to launch modern, flexible, and highly personalized digital banking experience is -- and abiliti, our industry-leading online and mobile banking platform, will position us to better serve our existing clients and a broader array of customers. now let me pass the discussion to bob for more detail on our financial results.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
thank you, frank, and good morning, everyone. i'll cover some detail on each of our segments. if you're following along on our slides, i'm starting with slide 5. we feel great about our performance for both the quarter and the full year, and we are well-positioned to achieve a strong 2022 and beyond with sustained value for our clients and our shareholders.
as frank said, we are projecting 7% to 9% revenue growth for 2022, which is 150 to 350 basis points above our average growth over the last three years. total company organic revenue was up 11% in the quarter with growth across all segments, led by the merchant acceptance segment, which grew 19%. for the full year, total company organic revenue grew 11%, also led by the merchant acceptance segment, which grew 20%. total company adjusted revenue also grew 11% to over $4 billion in the quarter.
and for the full year, adjusted revenue grew 11% to $15.4 billion. fourth-quarter adjusted operating income was up 11% to $1.4 billion, and adjusted operating margin was in line with the prior year at a very strong 35.6%. for the full year, adjusted operating income increased 19% to $5.2 billion, and adjusted operating margin expanded 250 basis points to 33.9%. we expect 2022 margin to expand an incremental 150 basis points or more above last year.
this is driven by strong organic revenue growth of 7% to 9% on a scaled business and a continued focus on productivity, all while we continue to make meaningful investments for organic growth. in addition, as you heard earlier from frank, we are proud to announce that we reached our $1.2 billion action cost synergy goal in the quarter, which is a result of our disciplined execution to drive value. fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 21% to $1.57. and through december 31st, adjusted earnings per share grew 26% to $5.58.
free cash flow was $1.2 billion for the quarter, up 18% from fourth quarter last year, resulting in a conversion of 119%. for the full year, free cash flow was $3.5 billion with a conversion to net income of 94%, driven by strong revenue growth and increases in working capital, as well as capital investment and organic innovation for our clients, integration of our acquisitions, and investment in technology infrastructure and real estate to create world-class collaboration space for our associates as we return to offices. for 2022, we expect free cash flow conversion to be between 95% and 100% of net income. investments in products and services to accelerate growth and the tail end of technology infrastructure and real estate investments, particularly our new technology and innovation hub in north central new jersey, which we will occupy later this year.
now looking to our segment results starting on slide 7. organic revenue growth in the merchant acceptance segment was a very strong 19% in the quarter and 20% for 2021. global transactions and volume grew 13% and 16% in the quarter and 13% and 19% for the year, respectively. excluding the impact of the exit of a processing client we discussed last quarter, global transactions volume grew 18% and 22% in the quarter and 17% and 24% in the year, respectively.
building off one of the best years for merchant location growth, we ended the fourth quarter with 10% higher global merchant locations versus the comparable quarter a year ago. clover continues to build upon the momentum and strength of our product offering as opposed to the very strong 50% gpv growth year over year or $201 billion on an annualized basis. we've seen exciting opportunities for clover this quarter, including our partnership with the university of notre dame and the ubs arena in new york. these wins further strengthen our positioning with sports arenas globally and highlight our success in integrating the money pass mobile business we acquired in 2020.
carat, our platform for enterprise clients, saw omnichannel transaction growth of 26% in the quarter, driven by 59 client wins, including notable wins such as papaya gaming and expanded relationships with wegmans, a regional supermarket chain with 106 stores and with a leading home improvement client to serve their clients end to end. our isv volume this quarter through clover connect grew 64% year over year and 53% on a two-year cagr. we signed 45 isvs this quarter, bringing our total signs to 187 for the year, and we are winning both isvs that are new to payments, as well as competitive takeaways. we had several notable international wins in the quarter, including an expanded partnership with unionpay international, one of the world's largest payment networks to broaden the acceptance of unionpay cards across fiserv's global footprint, and with firstcaribbean international bank for merchant processing across its banking footprint in the caribbean region.
additionally, we executed on an agreement with national australia bank for merchant processing in australia. adjusted operating income in the acceptance segment increased 20% to $533 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up 60 basis points to 31.3%, driven by continued top-line strength. through december 31, adjusted operating income improved 45% to $2 billion, and adjusted operating margin grew 540 basis points to 30.8%. before i leave the merchant segment, as you may have noticed in our third-quarter 10-q filing, we anticipate the sale of a portion of our back book to a merchant alliance partner.
this is fully contemplated in our outlook and will have less than a 50-basis-point impact on adjusted revenue for the company in 2022. we expect the transaction to close in the current quarter. turning to slide 8. the payments and network segment posted organic revenue growth of 8% in the quarter, resulting in a full-year growth of 6%.
for the quarter, card services and digital payments outperformed the segment organic revenue growth rate. credit came in slightly under the segment average and bill pay continued as a headwind. within card services, debit transactions grew 14% in the quarter. the strength of our credit offering for financial institutions was manifested in a notable win in the fourth quarter, an agreement with randolph-brooks federal credit union, an institution with over $14 billion in assets and over 1 million members to provide our credit processing capabilities.
within issuer solutions, we are well underway with our onboarding the $120 million of new business we announced at our december 2020 investor day, as well as other mandates awarded since. we have completed the onboarding of atlanticus, a competitive takeaway; and bbva, an m&a consolidation win. onboarding is well underway for genesis, another competitive takeaway, and for alliance data. this momentum continues.
in addition to the merchant processing wins i mentioned earlier, we also signed long-term card issuing agreements with both national australia bank and unionpay international. these wins demonstrate our ability to serve our clients on multiple fronts. consumer demand for content count and p2p offerings continued with zelle transactions up 71% and the number of clients live on zelle was up 57% in the quarter. finally, within bill pay, we have two notable fourth-quarter wins in the healthcare vertical, demonstrating our strength in this high-growth segment of the market and broadening our client base from what has traditionally been the utilities and telecom-focused offering.
blue shield of california, a leading health plan in california, has chosen to extend the relationship with fiserv as part of their enterprisewide process of digital transformation. additionally, caresource, a nationally recognized nonprofit healthcare plan competitively selected fiserv to improve their member experience through our robust technology platform. adjusted operating income for the segment was up 8% to $713 million, and adjusted operating margin was down 20 basis points to 46.2% in the quarter, given tough comps. q4 operating margin was the second-highest margin recorded for the segment, second only to q4 of last year.
for the full year, adjusted operating income was up 8% to $2.6 billion, and adjusted operating margin was up 80 basis points to 44.1%. turning to slide 9. the financial technology segment organic revenue grew at 4% in the fourth quarter and for the full year within our medium-term outlook for this segment. our digital banking capabilities and digital solution offerings continue to win in the marketplace.
in the fourth quarter, we added 14 new core account processing clients, bringing us to 48 core wins in the year, more than half of which were takeaways. mobile deposits in q4 grew 9% over the prior year, while self-service atm deposits grew 52% over last year. adjusted operating income was up 6% in the quarter to $287 million and up 9% year to date to $1.1 billion. adjusted operating margin in the segment increased 80 basis points in the quarter to 37.3%.
for the full year, adjusted operating margin expanded 160 basis points to 35.8%. the adjusted corporate operating loss was $102 million in the quarter, in line with our expectations. the adjusted effective tax rate for both the quarter and full year was 20% and in line with our expectations. we expect 2022's effective tax rate to be approximately 21%, up slightly as 2021 benefited from a few discrete tax planning items.
2021 was another demonstration of our disciplined capital allocation strategy, which includes fortifying our strong balance sheet, returning value to shareholders through share repurchases, driving organic growth through investment, and pursuing high-value acquisitions. we invested approximately $850 million in m&a to acquire capabilities that we are best positioned to deploy across our scaled platform. we completed our acquisitions of bentobox, netpay, and integrity payments, bringing our total transactions to seven in 2021. and as frank mentioned, we further strengthened our portfolio through the announced acquisition of finxact, a developer of cloud-native banking solutions.
additionally, we returned $2.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchase this year, including $1 billion in the fourth quarter for 9.9 million shares. we have more than 42 million shares of repurchase authorization remaining. and finally, total debt outstanding was $21 billion on december 31. the debt to adjusted ebitda ratio decreased to 3.1 times, down nearly a full turn since we merged.
with that, let me turn the call back to frank.
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, bob. i'm very proud of the goals we've accomplished with another quarter of double-digit adjusted revenue growth and double-digit adjusted eps growth. given the breadth and depth of our portfolio, as well as our history of strong operational performance, we believe we will deliver 7% to 9% organic revenue growth and 15% to 17% adjusted earnings-per-share growth to a range of $6.40 to $6.55. we expect each of our business segments to deliver organic revenue growth within the range of our medium-term outlook.
finally, i invite you to participate in an investor call we will be hosting in the next several weeks focused on our merchant acceptance business with a particular emphasis on clover as a key driver of growth for the segment and the company. in addition to delivering on our financial results, we continue to focus on our associates and our communities. our approach to corporate social responsibility is designed to incorporate a philanthropic, associate, and community engagement to deliver thoughtful, strategic decisions where we invest our time and talent. diversity and inclusion remains on the top of our esg agenda and the results of our efforts speak for themselves.
in january of the current year, fiserv was named to the 2022 bloomberg gender equality index, marking our sixth consecutive year for this recognition. for the second consecutive year, fiserv has been designated a best place to work for lgbtq+ equality in the human rights campaign foundation's 2022 corporate equality index. now in its 20th year, the cei is the national benchmarking tool on corporate policies, practices, and benefits pertinent to lgbtq+ employees. since 2020, we have allocated $35 million of the $50 million commitment designed to help small minority-owned businesses affected by the covid-19 pandemic and associated initiatives.
in q4, fiserv was ranked no. 4 on military times best for vets employers list, the fifth year in a row in the top five and no. 1 ranked in our category. continuing our initiatives to support better and affiliated businesses, this quarter, we announced an extension of our partnership with the institute for veterans and military families at syracuse university.
and during our fourth-quarter season of giving campaign, associate donations along with corporate matching donations from fiserv contributed to over 1,200 community groups globally. i am proud of the positive impact of philanthropic and community programs have had in 2021, and i look forward to us doing more in 2022 to help businesses and communities thrive. i will close by thanking all 40,000-plus hard-working fiserv associates around the world for working relentlessly to serve our clients and you, our shareholders. with that, operator, please open the line for questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from lisa ellis from moffettnathanson. please go ahead.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. good stuff here. i had a question with just hoping to drill in a little bit on your outlook for merchant acceptance for 2022.
i know you mentioned you're expecting it to return to the medium-term range. i think that's 9% to 12%. so are you expecting merchant acceptance to get back to double-digit growth? and then could you drill in a little bit on two of the big drivers in there, what you're looking for out of clover and then maybe what you're looking for out of your international business as you look out into 2022 to give you confidence in that outlook?
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
so first of all, yes, 9% to 12%. and yes, we're driving business to double digit. i think there's a multipronged effort here. and obviously, we have a lot of assets in the portfolio that are performing very, very well, whether it be our isv business, whether it be in carat.
but specifically, the growth in clover, we believe, will happen both in the u.s. and then in our global expansion on it also. and we continue to see that have very, very strong visibility and how deployment will happen outside the u.s. during the course of this year.
and then you layer on top of that the caixa partnership, the dacia partnership, and you can see us extending out in all regions, really. so you should expect to see clover growth. you should expect to see geographic expansion. but you should also expect to see strong e-comm trajectory along with isv trajectory as we continue to invest in clover and carat and the isv business and continue to fuel our international growth.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
terrific. thank you.
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, lisa.
operator
next, we'll go to the line of tien-tsin huang from j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks so much. yes. really happy to see the 7% to 9% organic revenue growth for this year. i want to ask just on the margin outlook to get there for the segments.
where are you investing more aggressively? i know you have some integrations and implementations to do as well plus productivity. so any color there would be terrific. thank you.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yes, tien-tsin. i'll start and frank can jump in. i think you'll see continued investments in all three of our segments. obviously, each one of them have a slightly different growth trajectory.
as frank just talked in answering lisa's comment about the 9% to 12% merchant growth, we expect all three of our segments to perform in the medium-term outlook range, 4% to 6% for the fintech segment and 5% to 8% for payments. and you're seeing us focus on bringing new solutions to our clients on where they want us to meet, obviously, really across the board, the continued drive for digital, for mobile expanding out our capabilities to integrate all of our solutions. you heard me in my prepared remarks talk about the new wins with unionpay and with national australia bank, two individual contracts that both had merchant and payments incorporated in them. and so we'll continue to invest in building out those capabilities.
we continue to invest in our digital capability around our cardhub acquisition with ondot, with spendlabs. our abiliti solution, our bank -- digital banking solution that we launched earlier this year, a cloud-native online banking solution will continue to expand in the marketplace. and obviously, once we close with finxact, it will be a focus of ours as we build out that capability.
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
maybe i'd say one or two other things. we have tremendous visibility due to the amount of wins you've heard us talk about. you could see that we have had very, very good momentum in the sales cycle, and that's all about future growth. i also think the investments we are making are for future growth.
so the 7% to 9% we're talking about here in the medium term is what's right in front of us, and we have good visibility to it. but we also are integrating a lot of products building for the future, being very offensive toward how we're going to build. and so when you think about our spending, it's really not against this year's revenue, it's for future years' revenue.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yep. thank you for the details, guys. thank you.
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, tien-tsin.
operator
next, we'll go to the line of jason kupferberg from bank of america. please go ahead.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks. good morning, guys. wanted to see what color you might give us just on omicron impacts you may have felt in december and january, particularly in merchant, but maybe a little bit on the issuer processing side, too. and then just how that translates into how we should be thinking about first-quarter revenue growth by segment.
i know you generally have some pretty easy comps there in q1.
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
i'll start, bob could fill in. i mean it definitely had an effect. we saw it as we came through december. you definitely felt it, and outside the u.s., more than even inside the u.s., i'd say.
but -- and it has spilled into january across basically dividend credit when you think about it and affect the spending in general. but i view that as a short-term issue, nothing systemic there. bob, anything you want to add?
bob hau -- chief financial officer
no. jason, i think january, consistent to how we kind of closed out december, a little bit light. obviously, the u.s., europe, the globe is dealing with omicron. we're starting to see the restrictions in europe lifted, particularly in u.k., ireland.
germany has still got a number of restrictions in various regions. it's not a countrywide program, it's region by region, and we're starting to see those lifts. and so we expect things to improve as we progress through the quarter. i do expect each of the four quarters to be within that 7% to 9% range.
so i don't think we have any quarter that's well below that and another quarter well above that. but with january being a little bit lighter, there could be some impact to q1 there.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. great color. thank you, guys.
operator
next, we'll go to the line of dave koning from baird. please go ahead.
dave koning -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
yeah. thanks. hey. so i guess a couple of questions.
first of all, on payments, 2021, it looked like full year about 5.5% organic, and you're kind of saying 5% to 8% would be 2022. so i'm just kind of thinking through the accelerating and decelerating factors, like i would think debit probably decelerates. but then what should accelerate to kind of propel growth in '22 to offset the debit deceleration?
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we have seen some of that deceleration in debit. again, it was part of the december to january dynamic. we certainly see some nice lift from the credit issuer wins that started going live really the second half of 2021.
so we've got good lift from those in the full year of 2022. and with atlanticus and ads yet to onboard here in early 2021, that will give us some nice lift. so i think our credit issuing business will perform nicely. the improvement or the new contract wins that we talked about in bill pay will help stem some of that headwind that we dealt with in 2021.
and broadly, the contract wins and the implementations and new services, cardhub is certainly having an impact on both our debit and credit business as we bring a more fulsome solution, very digital, state-of-the-art capability into our clients. and we see some real opportunity there.
dave koning -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
gotcha. thanks. and just secondly, the acceptance segment, i was kind of looking back. it looks like the last few years mostly were down kind of 3% to 5% sequentially in q1.
you also mentioned selling the back book. i don't know how much impact that has. but is -- are we in kind of a pretty normalized like maybe down 3%, 5% sequentially?
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so first, the sale of the back book will -- we expect to take place this quarter. we're almost halfway through the quarter. it isn't closed yet, but we do expect it soon.
so it will be a modest -- it's a modest impact to the year, less than 50 basis points to the adjusted revenue for the company for the year. so a pretty small impact to q1, particularly given that it's not yet closed. but i think you're largely in line. i don't expect any difference in terms of the seasonality as you go from q1 -- q4 to q1.
dave koning -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
gotcha. thanks, guys.
operator
next, we'll go to the line of james faucette from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you very much. i wanted to ask quickly on capital allocation, and you seem to have stepped up the pace of acquisitions recently. and i'm wondering with the slowing in valuations that we've seen at least in public markets, is that creating incremental opportunities for acquisitions, do you think? and how dynamic or flexible can you be on capital allocation, especially between acquisitions, buybacks, and debt reduction? just love to get kind of your sense and color around those topics.
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean, we talked about $850 million, and then we have finxact here. also, i mean we feel very, very, very confident in our ability to deploy capital where appropriate and all of that is to further accelerate growth rate. and i accentuate further accelerate.
two, we think we're darn good at integrating these properties. and the properties that we've acquired, we've also had invested. we invest in properties early, watch them, grow with them, nurture them and integrate them. so i think you should expect that these things are all strategically thought about ahead of time, whether it was a restaurant segment, whether it's our ability to bring a complementary product across our core.
our ability is without scale to be able to acquire some of these founder-led companies and then utilize them across us. i mean, you look at an ondot, and that's already completely deployed, integrated, and succeeding in the clients' office. so we feel good about our ability to deploy the capital. we feel good about the platform's ability to scale the use.
and they're all to us, middle of the fairway of where our business model is. and that's how you should think about us deploying the capital or against acquisitions. obviously, we added a very strong year in repurchasing also because we thought it was appropriate to return money to shareholders in that fashion, $2.6 billion. so i think it's a very balanced approach.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
james, just to kind of put an emphasis on that last point from frank, it isn't an either/or it isn't an m&a or a share repurchase. in 2021, we deployed capital across the board. we spent $850 million on m&a. we repurchased $2.6 billion, so returned $2.6 billion to shareholders.
that's the highest we've done as fiserv, including $1 billion in the fourth quarter. we continue to invest organically. and all that done at the same time, we lowered leverage to 3.1 times, down half a turn in the year and really, a full turn since our merger. so our ability is about deploying what is significant free cash flow across the portfolio and in a variety of different ways.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's great. thank you so much, guys.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
thank you, james.
operator
next, we'll go to the line of timothy chiodo from credit suisse. please go ahead.
timothy chiodo -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks a lot for taking the questions. i want to talk about inflationary impacts to the top line across a few of the segments. within the acceptance segment, obviously, there's a little bit of hardware revenue.
but with the rest of the revenue, maybe you could just remind us all on the proportion of that, that comes via ad valorem fees or basis points, how much of that is on a cents per transaction or other? and then also within fintech, maybe you could just touch on the cpi-based pricing escalators worked into the contracts there for core banking.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
sure, tim. so you had a lot of elements to that question, make sure i hit all of them. first and foremost, as you point out, we have a variety of different methods for revenue generation in our merchant business, certainly a mix of volume driven, as well as transaction driven. and of course, the other element of that is a variety of different distribution channels, whether it's a direct channel or through our partners or through a joint venture.
so lots of different ways that that revenue comes to us. ultimately, we feel good about the pricing dynamic of the market. inflation in 2022 will give us a natural lift on the activity that is volume based as volume goes up on higher volume transactions, which can be higher volume activity, we'll get a lift on that. and roughly, in the merchant business, about 65% of our revenue is volume-based pricing and about 35% is transaction-based.
if you turn to the fintech segment, it's the segment that we probably have the highest level of cpi clauses in our contracts and certainly will be a lift for us in 2022 as those cpi increases go in. i don't have a percentage for you off the top of my head, but it's a good portion of the fintech or the core account processing portions of fintech that have a cpi index in it.
timothy chiodo -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thank you so much for sharing those splits within acceptance. really appreciate that.
operator
next, we'll go to the line of darrin peller from wolfe research. please go ahead.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey. thanks, guys. can we just touch on the investments and the capital intensity you're putting into the business? obviously, it's -- with the strong growth you have, it probably begs the question of whether or not your free cash conversion should stay in this 95% to 100% range versus the historic median term, which i think we kind of anticipated. but i'd just love to hear a little more color on what your thought process is on that.
and then also whether or not we still feel good about the $25 billion of free cash over the next few years, $30 billion of capital deployment capabilities. and then just really one quick follow-up. i thought it was interesting that you guys are hosting this call in the next few weeks on merchant and clover. any kind of preview on what the goal is for that? is it just to give us more comfort and color on sustainability and the breakdown of the business given how strong growth has been?
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. why don't we start with that first? the concept on that is to really get you all to better understand the value being created for each client, that when you think about average revenue per merchant, clover's impact to give you a real good look at the growth rate. and we talked to you about the e-comm business, too. we said, cover the both.
so when you look at it, you could see what that long-term ramp we have in here and the power of both of those platforms. so that would be answering the last part first. we had talked about $30 billion of capital to deploy. that number hasn't changed for us at all, in our changing in a conversion rate here.
and if you want to think about what we're doing, i just -- i think it's about delivering integrated solutions as we acquire products, it's about delivering a changed experience ultimately in the client's office, all designed at long-term accelerated growth. so in many cases, we're also building functionality, which has given us a greater total addressable market as we approach it. so it's completely offensive in terms of us leaning into the opportunity. the beauty of this platform is its size and scale and its client base, and that size and scale in that client base avail us more opportunity than we actually imagine when we put the two companies together and the complementary nature of the assets and the ability to invest is really about growth.
bob?
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yes, darrin, the two pieces i'd add, i guess is, one, that the $95 to $100 that we have for 2022 and the $94 million we did in '21 is in part driven by our increased spending on really three things. one is we are moving with a faster speed than we traditionally have around integrating new acquisitions. so a classic example is we acquired ondot in the first part of 2021. and within a few months, we had that integrated in some of our mobile banking capability and started selling it as a truly integrated solution where traditionally, we might have taken a bit longer to actually integrate.
we might sell it as a bundle, but really integrate it into the software, into the software offering. we're moving at a much faster speed. secondly, you heard us talk in this -- on the prepared remarks about technology infrastructure spending. it's really associated with the merger of fiserv first data and finishing the swing on that.
that's capital spending we're doing across our technology infrastructure. and then the third piece is building up some real estate. as we bring our organization back into the office after what's been a couple of years of working from home, we're building out what we think are world-class collaboration spaces to respond to what employees want and need now to enhance that collaboration. you heard us earlier in the year announce our new technology hub -- innovation and technology hub in north central new jersey.
that will be built out and occupied later this year. so that technology infrastructure associated with the fiserv first data merger and some of this real estate spend, you'll see kind of tail off at the end of this year, and then we'll see a shift in free cash flow going forward.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
that's really helpful. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. and our last question comes from david togut from evercore isi. please go ahead.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks. good morning. just bridging to the earlier question on inflationary impacts on revenue. could you walk through the impact of inflation on your cost structure and what's built into the adjusted operating margin expansion guidance for 2022?
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, i would say, first of all, there's definitely a war on talent, and there's definitely an inflation. and when you look in our model, we've accounted for the world we live in within that guide. we are very maniacally focused on how to create these work environments that attract the best talent, retain the best talent and continue driving innovation in a manner that gives us the outcomes that we've been getting and continue to drive forward.
you know, bob, maybe --
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yes. i would punctuate saying, number one, with 7% to 9% top-line growth on our scale business that provides some nice operating leverage, that will improve operating margin but also allows us to continue to invest in the company. we also have a long track record of good, strong productivity. the last couple of years that's been called integration savings or synergy.
but we continue to have real opportunities for productivity. as such, we feel comfortable that we'll have at least that 150 basis points of margin improvement in 2022.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. and then is the 95% to 100% free cash flow conversion target for 2022 the new normal going forward as opposed to the 105% plus, which we saw historically?
bob hau -- chief financial officer
no. i would not say that. obviously, at this point, we're not ready to update 2023. but given some of that technology infrastructure spend and the real estate spend that i talk about -- that i talked about earlier, i expect that to drift down as we exit 2022 and beyond.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you.
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
great. thank you very much. i'd like to thank everyone for their attention today. please feel free to reach out to our ir team with any questions, and have a great day.
thanks for your time today.

frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, shub, and thank you all for listening in as we share our results for the quarter and highlight the progress against our growth agenda. as you know, we serve as the operating system for commerce and money movement across our client base of banks, credit unions, fintechs, and businesses ranging from smbs to mid-market to large enterprises. we help our clients grow by extending our platform to capture new services and new money flows. our relentless pursuit of innovation for our clients has placed us on the list of the world's most innovative companies by fast company for the second consecutive year.
we've entered 2022 with strong momentum. we delivered 11% total company organic revenue growth in the first quarter. we expanded adjusted operating margin by 60 basis points to 32%. we also achieved 20% adjusted eps growth to $1.40.
we attained $40 million of actioned revenue synergies in the quarter, reaching $520 million since the merger, 87% of the increased commitment of $600 million for the five-year period following the merger, and now expect to hit that goal by the end of this year. as we shared with you on our year-end 2021 earnings call, we concluded our cost synergy program, having actioned the promised $1.2 billion of synergies since the closing of the merger. as we invested to accelerate growth, free cash flow came in at $603 million. the outperformance on the top and bottom line versus our full year guidance ranges puts us in a good position to meet or exceed our full year outlook.
as we evaluate the year ahead, we believe it is prudent to leave our 2022 guidance unchanged, given the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop with high inflation, rising interest rates and geopolitical issues looming. accordingly, we are maintaining our 2022 outlook for organic revenue growth of 7% to 9% and adjusted earnings per share in a range of $6.40 to $6.55, representing growth of 15% to 17% for 2022. now, turning to our business strategy. fiserv solutions are geared toward merchants and financial institutions, including fintechs.
starting with merchants, we are transforming from selling merchants individual point solutions to offering operating systems, clover for small to medium-sized merchants and carat for large enterprises. this operating systems approach expands the size of our total addressable market and makes us more valuable to our customers. we grow and create value in three ways. first, attracting more merchants to our operating systems.
second, expanding the relationship we have with our merchants by encouraging adoption of more software and services modules. and third, benefiting from the organic growth of our existing customer base. turning to our financial institution clients. we remain steadfast in our commitment to continuously innovate for our clients and broaden our total addressable market.
in early april, we closed the acquisition of finxact, a leading developer of cloud-native banking solutions. we have already seen a tremendous amount of interest in the platform from existing and new clients. we believe this acquisition will augment our ability to enrich and accelerate the delivery of digital solutions to existing clients, as well as broaden our client base to include large financial institutions and fintechs through banking as a service and embedded finance opportunities. we advanced our strategic focus on data and analytics.
this quarter, we announced partnerships with equifax, finicity, and mx, which will utilize our vast and highly valuable real-time data to create insights to strengthen and create new offerings across fraud, risk and marketing. while early in the journey, we expect data and analytics to be a new growth driver for us. next, diving deeper into our performance in the quarter by business segment. let me start with merchant acceptance.
we posted a very strong organic revenue growth of 20% year over year. global merchant volume and transactions grew 11% and 8%, respectively. our global active merchant accounts grew 6% year over year in the first quarter, continuing a positive trend since the start of 2021. results were strong across all regions.
north america was led by strength in smbs, particularly within the restaurant vertical, as well as strength in enterprise verticals such as travel and petro. spending across emea was strong in the quarter as restrictions were lifted in the u.k. and the netherlands in early january, followed by ireland, poland, and germany later in the quarter. travel was particularly strong, followed by restaurants and hospitality.
our merchant business in latam was also very strong in the quarter. we've made significant progress in on-boarding merchants through exclusive merchant acquiring mandate from caixa in brazil with 140,000 merchants currently on-boarded. in just one year since signing the agreement, we are also expanding our presence rapidly in mexico and colombia. spending trends in apac were very strong as key markets such as india and australia continue to resume normalcy, fueling discretionary spend in verticals such as travel, retail and restaurant.
in addition to the cyclical rebound, the region has continued to win and implement new business. moving to our merchant operating systems. clover and carat continue to gain significant traction with clients. clover's global revenue grew 39% in the quarter, driven by volume growth of 39%, as well as close to 200 basis points of sequential growth in software and services penetration of revenue to 15%.
we continue to make progress on our vertical focus. starting with restaurants. the integration of bentobox into clover is well underway, and the early proof points in both lead conversion rate and arpu are all very positive. within the services and retail verticals we are offering merchants leading solutions to address key business functions through a combination of pre-installed apps and tailored vertical saas offerings.
carat, the omni-commerce operating system for enterprise clients, grew revenue 20%. we saw broad-based growth across verticals, including travel, government, technology and quick-serve restaurants. in the quarter, we had some impressive wins across omni and e-com acquiring, including a card-not-present acquiring mandate for the leading fantasy sports player, draftkings, an extension of our long-standing omnichannel partnership with chick-fil-a, a mandate for fast food brand jersey mike's subs. within new payment flows, carat's leadership and digital payouts continues with the doubling of disbursement volume processed in the quarter.
during the quarter, we extended our contract with coinbase to support their launch of an nft marketplace. we are making rapid inroads into the high-growth markets such as payment facilitators and platforms. the november acquisition of netpay gives us a differentiated solution in the market, including fully managed on-boarding, risk and funding services to support these high-growth platform businesses. we have seen rapid growth in this end market with new clients signing nearly doubling transactions in the past year.
finally, before closing out the merchant segment, an update on the progress of our point-of-sale lending offering. our strategy all along has been to leverage our position as the operating platform for businesses, small, medium and large, to offer a range of buy now, pay later options. we are simplifying the merchant experience through an integration into the carat operating system for large enterprises and enabling bnpl app downloads through the clover app market for small and midsized businesses. by enabling our clients to easily connect to bnpl providers of their choice, we are making it possible for them to offer their customers in-demand payment options in an easy-to-manage cost-effective way.
moving to payments and network segment. organic revenue grew 5% in the quarter. this growth was enabled by a variety of drivers for cross-sell business lines. our north american credit active accounts on file grew 10% versus q1 of last year.
this growth was driven by new business on-boarding and our favorable credit environment. we fully ramped genesis financial onto our platform in the quarter, which along with the on-boarding of atlanticus last year, marked the on-boarding of two of the three major credit processing mandates we announced in 2020. we had solid growth in our debit networks, star and accel, and debit processing businesses, driven by new wins despite the stimulus-induced tough growth comparisons in the year ago. we've seen impressive growth in engagement metrics across our fis, driven by market-leading digital solutions like cardhub, spendtrack, our loyalty platform and our ai-based fraud system.
these surrounds not only greatly enhance the competitiveness of our credit and debit card processing offering but also serve to drive more cards into our debit network and more opportunities for fiserv to offer risk and fraud, digital banking and account processing solutions, demonstrating an attractive flywheel effect. we continue to see growth in digital payments driven by zelle, which posted transaction growth of a strong 40% in the quarter. finally, while we still see softness in our bill payments business, sequential growth rates continue to improve as we create new use cases like bill pay for fintechs, including crypto digital wallets, and enter long-term renewals with large clients, notably u.s. bank and regions bank.
additionally, this summer, we will launch a revamped bill pay interface to elevate the customer experience. looking ahead, our sales and product pipeline gives us confidence in our ability to grow the payments segment in the 5% to 8% medium-term organic revenue range. our client wins in the quarter support this momentum. we signed a long-term renewal with a highly valued client, synchrony, spanning across issuer processing, bank services and merchant acquiring, reinforcing our commitment to providing best-in-class solutions to our clients.
we continue to win credit processing mandates globally. in the first quarter, we signed a new installment loan provider, flexiti financial, in canada. the debit wins in the quarter included a processing win extending our relationship with keybanc, and an integrated debit processing, network and digital surround solutions win with heritage federal credit union, a $900 million asset size client. these wins showcase the breadth and reach of our debit processing capabilities, spanning from smaller credit unions to some of the nation's largest financial institutions.
we also continue to show the power of our enterprise offering and our competitive advantage when working with fintechs. this quarter, we signed an enterprise agreement with a new digital financial services company across bank services, credit and debit processing and output services. we will also fully on-board bread financial, previously known as alliance data, for card processing in the second quarter of this year. the tailwinds from our large-grade implementations, recent debit wins like keybanc this quarter, chime and great southern over the last couple of quarters and the investments in our digital surround solutions gives us confidence of continued growth in payments and network segment.
moving to the financial technology segment. we posted strong organic revenue growth of 6% in the quarter. we had 12 core wins in the quarter, including four competitive takeaways. sales of digital surround solutions continue to grow at a healthy clip, driven by the increased digital focus of our financial institution clients and the success of abiliti, our modern online and mobile banking platform.
sales to existing clients help us deepen the penetration of our fully integrated digital surrounds, such as cardhub, zelle, and spendtrack, thereby creating stickier clients. the competitive landscape continues to evolve quickly, and we believe that our fintech strategy combined with finxact's modern core capabilities positions us uniquely to offer a full stack of offerings aimed at expanding the addressable market for embedded finance and banking as a service. the linchpin of our fintech strategy is our open finance initiative. in the third quarter of 2021, we launched our new developer portal called the developer studio, a platform for exposing our microservice apis for the developer community with the goal of becoming the destination of choice for the embedded finance ecosystem, including card issuing and processing, merchant and core banking integrations.
our banking as a service capability enables financial institutions to expose modern fintech solutions to their client base to increase engagement and relevance while extending their reach into new market segments. our banking as a service capability is also a turnkey solution for fintechs and merchants wanting to offer banking and payment services. we believe we are best positioned to power the ongoing revolution in banking as a service and embedded finance due to our footprint of community financial institutions and breadth of banking and payment capabilities. now, let me pass the discussion to bob for more detail on our financial results.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
thank you, frank, and good morning, everyone. i'll cover some additional operating detail on our three segments. if you are following along on our slides, i'm starting with our financial metrics and trends on slide four. as frank said, we started off the year strong.
total company organic revenue was up 11% in the quarter with growth across all segments, led by the merchant acceptance segment, which grew 20%. total company adjusted revenue grew 10% to over $3.9 billion. our adjusted operating income was up 12% to $1.2 billion, and adjusted operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 32%, in line with our expectations. as a reminder, we delivered 360 basis points of margin expansion in the year-ago quarter, resulting in 420 basis points of expansion over the last two years.
we reaffirm our outlook to deliver at least 150 basis points of adjusted margin expansion for the year. first quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 20% to $1.40. free cash flow was $603 million for the quarter, resulting in a conversion rate of 65%, driven by a combination of, first, increased capital expenditures in the areas of technology and integration of newly acquired capabilities. second, increased working capital investment, driven by revenue growth, including growth in anticipation revenue in latin america.
third, increased hardware inventory to minimize any potential disruption to our clients given the supply constraints. and finally, timing factors impacting cash from one quarter to the next. we reaffirm our outlook to achieve 95% to 100% free cash flow conversion for the full year. now, looking to our segment results, starting on slide five.
organic revenue growth in the merchant acceptance segment was a very strong 20% in the quarter. adjusted revenue growth was 18% year over year. global merchant volume and transactions grew 11% and 8%, respectively. excluding the loss of a processing client mid last year, global merchant volume and transactions grew 15% and 10% in the quarter, respectively.
clover, our operating system for small and medium-sized businesses, continues to build on the strength of its product offering to attract and retain more merchants and expand relationships with them. in the quarter, clover posted a strong 39% revenue growth, and quarterly gpv was $49 billion or $197 billion on an annualized basis, 39%. our isv volume in the quarter through clover connect grew 51% year over year. we signed 44 isvs this quarter.
carat, our omni-commerce operating system for enterprise clients, grew revenue 20% in the first quarter. adjusted operating income in the acceptance segment increased 21% to $470 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 70 basis points to 28.4% as we balanced efficiency gains with continued investment for growth. in the quarter, we completed the sale of certain merchant contracts from an alliance joint venture that we disclosed last year. as we shared with you on the fourth quarter 2021 earnings call, the impact of this sale is estimated to be under 50 basis points of total company adjusted revenue.
it is fully contemplated in our full year 2022 outlook. turning to slide six. the payments and network segment posted organic revenue growth of 5% in the quarter, within our guided range of 5% to 8% for the year. as expected, our credit issuer solutions business saw strong growth, driven by the growth in credit active accounts on file, as well as the impact of new clients coming onboard.
our debit processing and network businesses continued to perform well, driven by the compelling value proposition of our digital surrounds even as debit transaction growth decelerated to 3% year over year against a very difficult year-ago comparison. consumer demand for account-to-account and p2p offerings continued with all transactions up 40%, and the number of clients live on zelle was up 57% in the quarter. the offsets in the quarter were the prepaid business, which faced very tough stimulus-driven year-ago comps and bill pay. adjusted operating income for the segment was up 7% to $625 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 110 basis points to 42.5% in the quarter.
turning to slide seven. the financial technology segment organic revenue grew 6% in the first quarter, including 100 basis points from periodic revenue. adjusted operating income was up 12% in the quarter to $275 million, resulting in adjusted operating margin expansion of 200 basis points to 35.4%. the adjusted corporate operating loss was $122 million in the quarter, in line with the average of the last four quarters.
the adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.3%, 10 basis points higher than last year. the 2022 adjusted effective tax rate should continue at the same quarterly pacing as last year and is expected to be approximately 21% for the full year. additionally, we returned $500 million to shareholders through share repurchases this quarter. we have more than 37 million shares of repurchase authorization remaining.
total debt outstanding was $21 billion on march 31, and the debt-to-adjusted ebitda ratio decreased to 3.0x as we approach our target leverage level. turning to a new slide, slide eight. we highlight our balance sheet performance and capital allocation results over time. we've made meaningful strides to lower our debt to adjusted ebitda ratio by over half turn from q1 last year and a full turn since the merger.
over the last two years, we've generated $7 billion of free cash flow and have allocated $4.9 billion toward a combination of m&a and share repurchases, representing 5% of shares outstanding. additionally, we have deployed $2.1 billion over that time toward debt repayment and integrations, both of which are expected to significantly decline as we completed the integration of the first data and fiserv merger at the end of last year and approach our goal of under three times debt to adjusted ebitda leverage. this will allow us to allocate even more capital to value-creating acquisitions and share repurchase. finally, turning to slide nine.
although we outperformed on adjusted revenue and eps for the first quarter, we feel it's prudent to keep our 2022 outlook unchanged. given that it is still early in the year and the macroeconomic backdrop remains uncertain. with that, let me turn the call back to frank.
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, bob. i am very proud of the results we've accomplished this quarter. as diversity and inclusion continues to be at the top of our csr agenda, we are focused on ensuring alignment and investment into our employee and community engagement strategies. in the first quarter, in addition to the fast company most innovative recognition i mentioned earlier, fiserv was named as a 2022 great place to work in argentina, uruguay, colombia and mexico.
for the second consecutive year, fiserv has been designated by vets indexes as a five-star employer. in addition, our nenagh technology center in ireland has been recognized as a great place to work for the fourth consecutive year. fiserv has activated several initiatives in response to russia's invasion of ukraine, including financial grants for our associates, direct donations to local not-for-profit organizations and other humanitarian programs for civilians displaced in the region. we've also activated a matching donation campaign in support of american red cross efforts.
a quick note that our 2021 csr report will be finalized and published in the coming weeks. as i close, i would like to thank all 40,000-plus hardworking associates around the world for working relentlessly to service our clients and you, our shareholders. with that, operator, please open the line for questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question will come from the line of tien-tsin huang from j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, thanks so much. i had a couple of questions. the first one, on the acceptance segment, obviously, very strong there. it looks like volume growth matched visa's but the revenue growth did exceed that.
so what's driving the higher revenue spread to volume in this quarter? and what should we expect here going -- as we go through the balance of the year? and i had a quick follow-up, if you don't mind.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yes, tien-tsin. i think there's -- like we saw in previous quarters, there are a number of differences between our volumes and visa's volumes and the international mix and cross-border mix, etc., etc. so as you said, we're in line from a volume standpoint. we had good revenue growth overall.
as we've talked, yield is a metric that ebbs and flows quarter-to-quarter. the last couple of quarters, the math has been a little bit weaker. this quarter, it's quite strong. i think there's a lot of variation in there.
and it's one of the things we continue to point to, that we're quite focused on revenue growth and margin expansion, a little less so on the yield because of that quarterly variation. clearly very pleased with the performance of our merchant segment with good, very strong growth continuing in clover, good growth in carat and across the board. having a 20% organic revenue growth for the segment in the quarter is a great start to the year.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah.  i'll come there, bob. so let me ask my quick follow-up, if you don't mind, just on the free cash conversion. i heard the capex and opportunistically buying some terminals here, but you're keeping the full year at 95% to 100% the same.
so what's the outlook for some of the moving pieces here to drive that confidence in getting to that 95% to 100% for the full year?
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
i think -- it's frank. first of all, it was way more than physical terminals. it was component parts also, and we thought it was a very prudent and smart move to buy ahead into the supply chain given the volume opportunities we have across the board which drive growth. so that would be clearly in the one-timer inventory category.
obviously, we see -- as we reiterate our confidence on margin also, we see the ability to grow and expand margins as part of the confidence story going forward. and obviously, these are ebbs and flows quarter-to-quarter also and timing of capital. so i think about it in those manners. we feel great about the growth.
we feel good about our ability to expand the margins. and we feel good about the ability of what we bought ahead actually thrive, grow and not have that expenditure going forward.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
understood. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from lisa ellis from moffettnathanson. please go ahead.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
good morning. thank you. i'll take payments and networks, i guess, which came in at the lower end of your long-term outlook of 5% to 8% there. i know there's a lot of moving pieces within payments and networks.
you highlighted, i think, both some lapping effects of stimulus hitting the prepaid business and the debit business but then also the bill payment business, which has been a bit of a struggle coming out of the pandemic. can you just parse those apart a little bit, meaning what was sort of onetime versus lapping issues related to stimulus in the quarter versus where we might see more of a protracted drag as we go throughout the year? and then i have a quick follow-up as well. thank you.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
sure, lisa. so within the payments segment, stimulus certainly created a tough compare to q1 of last year with our prepaid business. and as we saw really late '20 and into '21, a consumer shift of credit to debit, which we think was stimulus-driven, we're now starting to see that kind of revert back to mean or to norm with more move to credit than it is debit. of course, as you know, we get paid on a per transaction basis on the debit side, but on a credit processing side in the payments segment, we're paid on gross active accounts.
and so, now we're seeing a nice lift in the number of accounts, but the transaction shift from debit to credit doesn't manifest itself in revenue directly. so good growth in our credit business this quarter versus q1, still had growth in debit but not as high as we had all of last year. debit q1 of last year was quite weak and came back throughout the year. and then, in the bill pay and biller side, we've actually seen an improvement of the headwind.
so it's still an issue for us. and we talked to a couple of things that we see, things beginning to improve over probably the last two quarters. the rate of growth decline has improved quite a bit. and as we go live with a number of new clients, particularly in the fintech space, and as we launch the new user interface this summer, we see continued opportunity to improve both in the bill pay/biller business but also in payments overall.
and of course, as we now have implemented two of the big three credit issuers, with the third one going live here late second quarter, you'll see accelerating growth from the credit issuer side of the business.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
got it. ok. a quick just follow-up maybe for frank on the new -- i guess, new highlight around advanced data and analytics with these partnerships with equifax and finicity, etc. can you just give maybe a little bit of color or examples of the types of offerings there? and is this kind of new revenue stream or is this more of a win rate stickiness dynamic in the bank base? just elaborate --
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
no, it's a new revenue stream. we've always believed that we had a data advantage. and we did some things organizationally, maybe you remember, at the top of the house where we've dedicated talent against it, and it is manifesting itself. we have a pretty good road map to capabilities to offer to our clients and then to jointly offer with partners and combining capabilities.
that is why we believe when we come into the latter part of this year and then going into next year, a completely new revenue stream with high margins in those capabilities in providing real-time data, in providing decisioning data, and that's what we have right now. we do see the opportunity, as we said, in marketing and other information. we haven't proved out that proof of concept yet, but the others have been proved. and we expect to be in market at the latter quarter of this year.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
terrific. thank you.
operator
next, we'll go to the line of darrin peller from wolfe research. please go ahead.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey. thanks, guys. first, on the growth side, on the top line, i just want to touch on both -- first, the fintech segment. when we look at the growth, it does seem like mid-single digits seem pretty resilient now.
and on top of the finxact acquisition and what that can do, i'd love to hear more thoughts on what that can actually do to add to business given the pipelines you're seeing. but cpi price escalators potentially built in, to what extent do you expect to push those through this year? and can that also contribute?
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
the one i'd talk about, i think the team in fintech and their maniacal focus on how to serve the client and growth is showing up. we had an expectation that we would get to these types of levels. and when we laid it out in december of 2020, i think the action plans in that team and the product innovation and bringing all the components of the company where we think we have a strategic advantage actually got us to where we are today. i think our digital assets play very, very well.
so i talked about those surrounds. our ability to have a good digital lens really is a strategic advantage. and then, you saw us do things like bringing ondot into mobiliti, which also is a one-of-a-kind offering. and when that all comes together in the client's office, it gets us to where we are today.
i think thinking beyond today, finxact is very strategic. as we had said, we think it expands our tam capability. and we think over the long haul, a combo of our assets plus finxact, allow us to get to other markets we weren't intending to before. so when you look at it, we feel great about the job the team has done.
the finxact acquisition, as you know, 20-plus days closed, and that's moving along very, very well. the integration of the team and the ability to deliver what we expect over the next few years from that, we have clear line of sight, we believe. and i think that's how we think about the totality of our current business, our digital offerings and our future digital offerings and expanding the total addressable market that we were addressing around that segment.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
and darrin, in terms of cpi, we do get -- particularly in our core account processing business, a typical contract does allow for annual cpi changes. those are very typically annual items. so at the end of the year, we calculate the cpi index and apply it to the next year's billing. and contracts vary.
some have caps, some have full cpi, and it varies across the board. but that is fully baked into, first of all, our guidance. you're seeing it in the q1 results. and because it's an annual bill, that's locked for the year.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
i have one quick follow-up -- that's helpful. but frank, just from an m&a standpoint, when we think about what you just said, the leverage level now below three. obviously, opportunistic buybacks make a ton of sense. but at the same time, there's definitely valuations coming in across the market.
so can you just revisit your preference in terms of capital allocation going forward and what types of assets? thanks again, guys.
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think we've demonstrated a pretty balanced approach to our capital allocation, both if you look at what we did with finxact or if you look what we've done with bentobox or ondot. and you'd find all of them really leaning into helping our clients grow their business with their clients in a digital framework. so i put that out there because it is largely about addressing new markets, new opportunities and how, in fact, we help our clients grow their business, which, in fact, would become the beneficiary also.
and you should expect that mindset around future acquisitions, which is just another form of investing for growth. you just saw and bob talked through that 29% over the last 24 months of our capital allocation went into merchant integration expense and debt paydowns. and that capital is now deployable, and obviously, we will continue to have a better growth rate. and i think you should expect that we will use the same methodology of investing for growth where we believe we can leverage our assets inside the house to bring other market opportunities, and we'll be buying back the shares opportunistically and returning those dollars to our shareholders as we always have in that tried-and-true methodology.
and we feel kind of great about what we've done so far on the capital allocation. hope you guys do too, and we feel even stronger about it going forward.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from dave koning from baird. please go ahead.
dave koning -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
yeah. hey, guys. great job. yeah, yeah.
and i guess my first question, you had the investor meeting a few -- a handful of weeks ago and talked about 11.5% growth in merchant over time. should we expect that every quarter of the year? and i guess, kind of behind that, it seems like we're entering a period maybe we'll get into smaller tickets, inflation. pricing seems to be getting better in the industry. now, all those things contributing -- are all those fair assumptions? and then that 11.5% question.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
so from a quarterly flow standpoint, obviously, first quarter closing after going through that merchant conference, we put up a 20% number. so we certainly don't expect 11.5% every year or 11.5% every quarter. obviously, a great first quarter out of a five-year projection, lots left to do, in very good shape in terms of executing on the multiple elements of growth that we talked about during that conference. clover and carat continued to perform well.
we continue to invest in new capabilities there. so i feel like we're off to a great start. of course, that conference, i think, was in early march. so we're early into the process, but we're in a very good position, and we think we've got a great set of assets in terms of operating systems to bring to both our enterprise and small business clients.
we've got a great distribution system, our global reach and geography. frank talked about in his prepared remarks how well caixa is going and the strength in latin america. so i think we're hitting on all cylinders. and we're quite pleased with where we are so far, but plenty more to go.
dave koning -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
yes. great, great. and then, just one follow-up. the margin cadence through the year, q1 was a little slower than the guidance.
q2 a little slower, too. is that fair and then the back half is when you get maybe above the full year guidance?
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yes, that's exactly where we're at. and i believe we said in prepared remarks, we're up 60 basis points for the first quarter. that's right in line with our internal expectations, and obviously, our internal expectations have us achieving the 150 for the full year. and we continue to execute.
and it's not really ""a hockey stick."" it's a matter of the tempo of the business. we did, as you know, a significant amount of integration work in the last couple of years. we ended merger and integration treatment, i.e., we're no longer adding back to our adjusted results for merger and acquisition -- merger and integration spending. and we still have some of those projects going on as we finish up the, what, two-plus years now since we merged.
that will ease in -- over the next couple of quarters, those costs will be reduced, and we'll continue to get good growth and fall-through into the business. so you'll see the 150 come in over the course of the year.
dave koning -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
yeah. sounds great. thanks, guys. good job.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
thanks, dave.
operator
next, we'll go to the line of jason kupferberg from bank of america. please go ahead.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning, guys. thanks.  i just wanted to come back to the payments segment for a second. it sounds like you're seeing some positive signals there.
you've got some newer wins coming down the pike. but just so that our expectations are calibrated properly, i know you're talking about the medium-term range of 5% to 8% being good for this year, but should we think about more of the lower half to maybe the midpoint just given that we're starting the year at 5%? i just want to make sure that we've kind of got the right cadence in our thought process because i know the comps get tougher from here on out.
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
comps do get tougher, but pipeline comes in over time, too. and i think we talked about the elements of it. obviously, we've talked a whole bunch leading into this year about $120 million of issuer wins, and we're beginning to see them in our numbers. we also feel the assets are very, very strong assets.
and you heard us talk about a change in direction on bill pay from where we were a year ago. so we feel -- we don't feel at all that we're at the low end in our range on that in the go forward.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. that's good to hear, sure. and just a follow-up on the finxact acquisition. how much revenue do you expect it to contribute to the fintech segment this year? and can you just go a little deeper maybe into the go-to-market strategy there and the kind of synergy that fiserv is going to bring to this asset?
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, you won't -- bob can talk about more, but you won't see anything in this year's numbers. so we change structurally our growth rate. obviously, these are long cycle sales.
but the go-to-market strategy has multi prongs. one is the ability to bring to our clients today a digital sidecar if they want to. if they want to build crypto or digital bank capability, we have the ability to do that. so that expands the tam of what we can do, and i think doing that given the fact that you won't see anything in the economics for this year.
but that's one element of it. the second element is the combination of dna and finxact together being able to bring an unbelievable offering to a number of clients in a different manner. the third is standing up fintechs and digital banks and other embedded finance. and you hear us talk about our open finance initiative and how well finxact complements that.
and then, i think finxact has a great demonstration of a current base that they've sold into that, in some cases, would be larger than where maybe our lifetime sweet spot was. but you should expect that to be more tam opportunity. we go to market together in a very concerted fashion. and when the assets on our surrounds all come to it, it becomes a very, very strong offering.
i think you'll see that growth in the outer years, not in this year, but you should expect it to be highly accretive to our growth rate over time.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
ok. and just to hit the point home on revenue this year. of course, it would all be inorganic. so it it wouldn't impact our 7% to 9% for the total company or the 4% to 6% for the fintech segment.
but overall, very small from an adjusted revenue standpoint also.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
next, we'll go to the line of ramsey el-assal from barclays. please go ahead.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
hi. thanks so much for taking my question this morning.  can you guys share your updated view on consumer spending trends? are you seeing any sign across the business that inflation or higher fuel prices or other macro factors are sort of tipping from tailwind to headwind? any kind of clues that the robust spending levels that we've seen will prove sustainable?
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
well, i mean, i would say if you looked at april, it fundamentally looks the same with maybe some places having a little more and some places having a little less. obviously, areas like petro services and restaurants are holding up at the same level, maybe a little bit on travel and retail. but clearly, we've been conscious of the consumer. and as we think about the future, we factored in what would happen if this slowdown did occur, and that's really -- that's in our prepared remarks.
we talked about our prudence and prudent management around the thought process. so very little change right now, but we're very guarded and we're managing in a guarded fashion.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
ok. and i also was wondering if you could give us a little more color on the revamped bill pay interface that you mentioned that would be rolling out, i believe, in the summer. what kinds of things can you do with that business to kind of continue the nice inflection that i think you're seeing back in the right direction?
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think it's really about the user experience. it's all about the user experience and about giving them capabilities that were refreshing in that environment. it allows our bank partners to then be able to actually increase their bill pay capability with their clients.
so remember, we're always focused. and you hear it in my m&a comments. you hear it in how we run the business, on how we give our clients the opportunity to do more business with their clients. so think about it as a very good, easy, usable front end that actually will be the most modern you can touch, that allow much more ability for that end user to be able to navigate versus what they had before.
and our banks and us believe -- that change, as we've completely built it with our banks in mind and their conversation, we believe that it allows them to get more user capability, which will equal more usage and higher engagement by the client base.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
got it. all right. thanks so much. appreciate it.
operator
next, we'll go to the line of james faucette from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you very much. i wanted to touch on the fintech segment first. just obviously, the -- and try to get a sense of appetite of banks to spend and continue to upgrade their systems, especially given what looks to be a strong earnings period and potential for them as interest rates change, etc. so just what's your feel right now for opportunity sets there? and are you seeing any changes or improvements in appetite?
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. having spent a fair amount of time in charge of the spending of banks around these assets and now having been here, what i find is that the appetite is very, very strong. the appetite being strong means if they can get digital capabilities, if they can serve their clients better, if they believe that the change is actually going to help them grow and do a better job, they're completely committed. we've seen a lot of those dna wins.
we've seen it from small to tall, as i would like to say. and the addition of finxact, in my mind, just has opened a lot of our current banks' eyes and a lot of our nonbanks', that we're not serving in that space, eyes toward the capabilities we can bring to them in the here and now. so i find it to be a tremendously encouraging time for that business.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. got it. and as you think about -- obviously, there's lots of focus always on the merchant business and that kind of thing. but consistent with the finxact acquisition and when you think about m&a, is there place where you feel like, ok, we need to prioritize if we're going to look at potential acquisitions on merchant versus fintech? or based on what your -- where you're seeing traction and where you feel like there's opportunity, are you leaning in one direction or another as you're evaluating acquisitions?
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think finxact was a very, very big acquisition which gave us, in my opinion, the most modern platform in the industry that can tremendously scale. so i think that that was very important and sets us up for the long haul. if you go back to my comments earlier, i think we're very focused on helping our clients grow in places we're not -- weren't or we're not in manner. if you look at bentobox, it allows us to move to be in the front of the store capability.
what that does to arpu for us in our restaurant business is very, very strong. and so, you should expect us to deploy our capital in acquisitions more in the space of how to better serve our clients in markets that we're not collecting revenue, so investing for growth as opposed to back-end synergies and really a digital eye on all of it.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's great color. oh sorry, bob.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
james  yes, the one thing i'd add is, i guess, i don't think about it and i don't think frank thinks about it as which should we do. i think given the capital we have available to deploy, we think we can do both. in the last 15 months, i think we've done eight different acquisitions, both focused on digital, as well as on our merchant business. those digital investments benefited our merchant segment, they benefited our fintech segment, and they benefited our payments segment.
and ultimately, as frank pointed out, it's all about how can we better serve our customers so that they can better serve their customers.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
 that's great color, gentlemen. thank you very much.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
great. thank you.
operator
and our final question comes from jamie friedman from susquehanna. please go ahead.
jamie friedman -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
hi. thank you. this slide 25 on the annual guide is super helpful. but bob, i was wondering if there were any call-outs specific to the q2 of '22.
for example, are there any standouts that we should be aware of from the q2 of '21, like periodic or anything else that we should keep in mind?
bob hau -- chief financial officer
no. i guess, the thing to think about is within every individual quarter last year, we had ebbs and flows of the pandemic recovery. we had a big stimulus push in q1 of last year. not only did we benefit by having more cash into the u.s.
consumer, but we actually helped put the cash into the consumer, i.e., we issued the cards. that was a q1 activity. and then, q2 and q3, we saw -- and q4 for that matter, we saw the benefit of the consumer using that cash. but overall, if you look at the q2 growth rate last year, it's a pretty difficult compare.
we did 18% growth, in particular very strong merchant business, but that was off of a recovery of a very difficult q2 of 2020. and we feel good about the overall growth of the business, and we expect all three of our segments to continue to perform well.
jamie friedman -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
any similar comment about the q2 margin expectation?
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yes. we talked a little bit about this earlier. we get various flows. we actually, i think, said this back in q4 when we first gave the 150 basis -- at least 150 basis points expansion for the full year.
because of some of the timing of the investments we're making, because of the ramping down of some of the integration work that we're no longer adding back from an adjusted operating margin standpoint, you'll see margins improve in the second half. obviously, we still improved this quarter; in fact, a little bit better than we expected at 60 basis points. but you'll see us reach that 150 for the full year throughout the year but more expansive, i guess, in the second half.
jamie friedman -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
got it thanks for the color.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
sure.
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
thank you. thank you, everybody, for your attention today. please feel free to reach out to our ir department and team with any questions. and have a great day, and i look forward to talking to you in the future.
thank you.

operator
welcome to the fiserv 2022 second quarter earnings conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. at this time, i would like to turn the call over to shub mukherjee, senior vice president of investor relations at fiserv.
shub mukherjee -- senior vice president, investor relations

and now over to frank. 
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, shub. and thank you all for listening in as we share our results for the quarter and highlight the progress against our growth agenda. as you know, we serve as the operating system for commerce and money movement across our client base of banks, credit unions, fintechs, and businesses, ranging from smbs to mid-market or large enterprises. we help our clients grow by extending our platform to capture new services and new money flows.
our relentless pursuit of innovation for our clients yet again won us several accolades in the quarter. fiserv was named a leader among merchant payment providers for the carat operating system by forrester wave. fiserv was also awarded the prestigious webby award for our developer studio, a platform, which provides rich and expansive api integrations. now moving to our second quarter results.
we delivered a strong 12% total company organic revenue growth, once again exceeding the 7% to 9% guidance range we provided for the year. the terrific performance on the top line resulted in 14% adjusted eps growth to $1.56, bringing our year-to-date adjusted eps growth to 17%, at the high end of the 15% to 17% guidance range provided for the full year. we attained $180 million of actioned revenue synergies in the quarter, reaching $700 million since the merger, exceeding the increased commitment of $600 million two years ahead of our original commitment. the impact of high inflation and our continued investment in the business resulted in adjusted operating margin of 33.5%, down 40 basis points from second quarter last year.
we continue to see opportunities to innovate for our clients. through our recent acquisitions, such as ondot, bentobox and finxact, as well as organic investments across our portfolio. additionally, these investments and accelerated revenue growth resulted in higher capital expenditures and working capital, leading to free cash flow of $658 million for the quarter and $1.3 billion year to date. looking into the remainder of the year, our year-to-date organic revenue growth outperformance of 11% puts us in a very good position to beat our prior organic revenue growth guidance for the full year.
given the strength in the first half of the year, we are raising our full year organic revenue growth outlook to a range of 9% to 11%, up from 7% to 9% previously. the low end of this revised growth outlook assumes a macro slowdown in the second half versus the first half of the year. with this higher organic revenue outlook and the year-to-date adjusted eps performance of 17% growth, we are raising the lower end about full year adjusted eps guidance range by $0.05 to a new range of $6.45 to $6.55, representing growth of 16% to 17% over 2021. given the elevated inflation environment, unfavorable foreign exchange and our plans to continue to invest in innovation for our clients.
we now expect our full year adjusted margin expansion to be at least 100 basis points. now turning to the business strategy. fiserv solutions are geared toward merchants and financial institutions, including fintechs. starting with merchants, we are transforming from selling merchants individual point solutions to offering operating systems: clover for small to medium-sized merchants and carat for large enterprises.
this operating system approach expands the size of our total addressable market and makes us more valuable to our customers. we grow and create value in three ways: first, attracting more merchants to our operating systems; second, expanding the relationship we have with our merchants by encouraging adoption of more software and services modules; and third, benefiting from the growth of our existing customer base. turning to our financial institution clients. we remain committed to continuously innovate for our clients and broaden our total addressable market.
since we closed the acquisition of finxact, a leading developer of cloud-native banking solutions in early april, we have been focused on three key areas: integrating our existing digital surrounds into finxact; selling finxact to our existing clients as an innovation platform or sidecar core; and winning new logo sales on the finxact solution. the feedback from both existing and new clients has been very positive. now let's dive deeper into our performance in the quarter by business segment. let me start with merchant acceptance.
we posted very strong organic revenue growth of 17% for the quarter. merchant volume and transactions grew 10% and 7%, respectively. our global active merchant accounts grew 5% in the second quarter, continuing the positive trend since the start of 2021. results were strong across all regions.
north america was led by the strength in smbs, particularly within the restaurant vertical as well as strength in enterprise verticals, such as travel and petro. our international regions also had very strong performance on a local currency basis, in part offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. spending across the emea region accelerated during the quarter, driven by strength in hospitality, restaurant, and retail verticals. our merchant business in latin america was very strong in the quarter as we continue to make significant progress in the argentina market.
and in brazil, onboarding merchants throughout exclusive merchant-acquiring mandate from caixa. we are also expanding our presence rapidly in mexico and colombia. spending trends in apac were strong, driven by a rebound in the economic activity across nearly all markets, as well as new wins and implementations. moving to our merchant operating systems.
clover and carat both continue to gain significant traction with clients. clover global revenue grew 24% in the quarter, driven by volume growth of 27%, as well as growth in software and services penetration to 15%, up over 350 basis points. clover's vertical-focused strategy continues to deliver in market with bentobox now fully integrated into clover for all e-commerce payments. when bento and clover are sold together, we see an over three times increase in average revenue per user versus a clover-only restaurant.
in addition, ubereats was launched in the second quarter as another integrated delivery partner for our restaurant merchants. carat, our omni-commerce operating system for enterprise clients, grew revenue 22%. we saw a broad-based growth across verticals, including petro and quick service restaurants. in the quarter, carat made several strides in further strengthening its positioning within the petro vertical.
among the notable wins include a contract with wawa, a large chain of convenience stores and gas stations. additionally, we expanded our relationship with a long-standing client to introduce a customized dealer settlement and reporting platform supporting over 10,000 retail locations in north america. in keeping with carat's mission to continuously innovate for our clients, carat launched pay by plate, enabling our petro partners to facilitate transactions based on license plate recognition for customers that opt in, replacing the need for a physical card. carat continues to capture new payment flows and has made significant progress across digital payouts and ebt online, with transactions growing 69% and 54%, respectively, in the quarter.
further bolstering its capabilities, carat launched new payout options in the quarter to include digital checks, prepaid cards and crypto wallets. we also had some notable wins within our enterprise business in north america during the quarter. we expanded our partnership with walmart to facilitate onetime digital payouts to consumers and won a contract with sodexo, a leading global facilities management company, to digitize consumer and employee payouts. turning to our international merchant business.
we continue to show strong momentum with the following highlights in the second quarter. in emea, fiserv signed a deal with abu dhabi commercial bank, one of the largest banks in the region with over $115 billion in assets and a significant presence across the retail, corporate and smb space with over 24,000 pos terminals deployed today. fiserv will be providing it's acquiring as a service suite of solutions, including our automated onboarding solution and omnichannel acceptance platform, with softpos-enabled deployment. the bank will also benefit from fiserv's enhanced risk, real-time broad management solutions, our merchant portal and reporting capabilities.
in apac, we went live with sportsbet, the market leader in online sports betting across australia; and boarded 10,000 sub merchants from myob, a leading provider of digital business accounting services to small businesses in australia. moving to the payments and network segment. organic revenue grew 8% in the quarter. this growth was enabled by a variety of drivers across our business lines.
our north american credit active accounts on file grew 14% versus q2 of last year. this growth was driven by both new business onboarding and a favorable credit environment. as a reminder, in the second quarter, we completed the onboarding of bread financial, formerly ads, the largest of the three top 25 credit issuing wins we announced in 2020. bread was the third of the three wins to onboard, completing the $120 million in annual revenue related to new wins we announced at our last investor conference.
looking forward, our current implementation and sales pipeline remains very robust. our international issuing business grew strong double digits, driven by macroeconomic improvement as well as onboarding of new clients. our debit business continues to post solid growth, driven by new client wins on our debit networks, star and accel, even as debit transaction growth continues to normalize industrywide following the stimulus-driven high debit volumes last year. our market-leading digital solutions, including cardhub and spendtrack, have become key differentiators in our new business pursuits and serve to drive more cards into our debit network, more opportunities for fiserv to offer risk, fraud, digital banking and account processing solutions, demonstrating an attractive flywheel effect.
we continue to see growth in digital payments driven by zelle, which posted transaction growth of a strong 35% in the quarter. our 1,000th zelle client went live during the quarter, a feat we accomplished in under four years of commencing zelle implementations. and we expect this momentum to continue with line of sight into doubling our zelle client base over the next two years. fiserv recently won a competitive bid to support the state of california's middle-class tax refund program.
fiserv will manage the program and distribute prepaid debit cards to qualified program recipients. this win reinforces our position as a leading provider of government programs, an area of expanding opportunity. we had a notable win in the student loan processing space which will considerably extend our position as a provider of choice to student loan servicers. we continue to win credit processing mandates globally.
in the second quarter, we expanded our relationship with a u.k.-based financial services company, newday, to provide processing and other services as they relaunch the john lewis partnership card, one of the u.k.'s most popular retail rewards credit cards. moving to the financial technology segment. we posted another strong quarter with organic revenue growth of 7%, driven by strength in our account processing and digital activity as well as the timing benefit of periodic revenue. we had seven core wins in the quarter, including four competitive takeaways.
sales of digital surround solutions continue to grow at a healthy clip, driven by our 3-pronged approach. our proprietary online and digital banking solutions with integrated surround solutions, such as cardhub, zelle and spendtrack, offer a leading modern banking experience for our clients and users. in keeping with our open sourced approach to serving our clients, we are also pre-integrating third-party digital solutions into our cores and making these solutions discoverable to clients their our app marketplace. last but definitely not least, we are making our platform attractive to the developer community by exposing our microservice apis through our developer studio with the goal of becoming the destination of choice for the embedded finance ecosystem, including card issuing and processing, merchant and core banking integrations.
and finxact further cements our lead in next-generation banking. our finxact product was selected by colorado-based national bank holdings to utilize finxact's modern core to pursue an smb-focused digital-only greenfield initiative called 2unifi as part of their initial modernization effort. as an example of cross-selling finxact into fiserv's existing core clients, massachusetts-based martha's vineyard bank will utilize finxact's open apis to deliver innovative new products and services across all channels, including highly personalized experiences for its customers. the combination of finxact's technology and fiserv's size and scale, ecosystem of digital surrounds and knowledge of banking, is winning over other competing offers in the market.
together, we are delivering value to our clients by accelerating their modernization journey. now let me pass the discussion to bob for more detail on our financial results.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
thank you, frank, and good morning, everyone. if you're following along on our slides, i will cover additional detail on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on slide 4. we had a strong second quarter thanks to our execution across the business and our broad portfolio of products and services. total company organic revenue growth was 12% in the quarter with strong growth across all segments.
notably the merchant acceptance segment, which grew 17%. year to date, total company organic revenue grew 11%, also led by the merchant acceptance segment, which grew 18%. second quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 10% to $4.2 billion and adjusted operating income grew 8% to $1.4 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 33.5%, a decrease of 40 basis points versus the prior year. for the first half of the year, adjusted revenue grew 10% to $8.1 billion and adjusted operating income increased 10% to $2.7 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 32.7%, consistent with the first half of last year.
the adjusted margin was impacted by a combination of factors, including: first, cost inflation for both labor and material, including point-of-sale terminals for our merchant acceptance segment and paper and plastic for our payments segment; second, investments related to new acquisitions, including bentobox and finxact; and third, continued reinvestment into the business, including wrapping up of the fiserv-first data integration projects. as we previously indicated, these began ramping down late in the second quarter and into the third quarter. this will lead to improved margins as we complete the spending and as the benefits of those projects materialize in the second half of the year, particularly in q4, leading to a strong exit rate for 2023. second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.56 compared to $1.37 in the prior year.
through june 30, adjusted earnings per share increased 17% to $2.96, at the high end of the 15% to 17% guidance range which we provided for the full year. free cash flow came in at $658 million for the quarter and $1.3 billion for the first six months of the year. free cash flow conversion was 65% to adjusted net income this quarter and year to date. the free cash flow conversion was driven by a combination of: first, increased capital expenditures, particularly in the areas of innovation and integration of newly acquired capabilities; second, increased working capital investment, driven by the very strong revenue growth, including growth in anticipation revenue in latin america; third, increased inventory to minimize any potential impact to our clients given the risk of supply chain disruption; and fourth, continued investment in software and application development to drive sustainably higher growth across the business.
as we look forward, we expect the free cash flow conversion to improve meaningfully to end the year at 90% to 95%, which is slightly below our previous outlook of 95% to 100%. we are focused on serving our clients with innovative solutions and sustainably stepping up our growth rate for the company to high single digits or even better this year from historic levels of mid-single digits. now looking to our segment results, starting on slide 5. organic revenue growth in the merchant acceptance segment was a strong 17% in the quarter and 18% year to date.
adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 14% and 16% for the first half. merchant volume and transactions grew 7% and 5%, respectively. when excluding the loss of a processing client mid last year, which we will fully cycle through in the third quarter, merchant volume and transactions grew 10% and 7% in the quarter, respectively. clover, our operating system for small and medium-sized businesses, continues to build on the strength of its product offering to attract and retain more merchants and expand relationships with them.
clover posted a strong 24% revenue growth for the quarter and 30% year to date. quarterly clover gpv was $58 billion or $233 billion on an annualized basis, up 27%. our isv volume in the quarter through clover connect grew 39% and 44% year to date. we signed 45 isvs this quarter, bringing our total signed to 89 year to date.
carat, our omnicommerce operating system for enterprise clients, grew revenue 22% in the second quarter. adjusted operating income in the acceptance segment increased 13% to $593 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was down 20 basis points to 31.2%. this was driven by inflation and continued investments in the business for growth. year-to-date adjusted operating income improved 17% to $1.1 billion and adjusted operating margin grew 20 basis points to 29.9%.
we expect adjusted margin in the merchant acceptance segment to improve in the second half of the year as we see the benefit of lower inflation, continued strength in revenue and productivity. turning to slide 6. the payments and network segment posted organic revenue growth of 8% in the quarter, at the high end of the 5% to 8% medium-term guidance range. notable growth drivers in this segment include active accounts on file in our north american credit processing business; the output solutions business; our debit networks, star and accel; and zelle, led by an increase in the number of clients and transaction growth.
we expect the momentum in this segment to continue through the rest of the year, resulting in the full year organic revenue growth rate to come well within our medium-term outlook of 5% to 8%. adjusted operating income for the segment was up 5% to $668 million, and adjusted operating margin was down 80 basis points to 43.8%, driven by a combination of inflation and investments in the quarter. year to date, adjusted operating income was up 6% to $1.3 billion and adjusted operating margin was up 20 basis points versus last year at 43.2%. moving to slide 7.
the financial technology segment organic revenue grew at 7% in the second quarter, resulting in 6% growth for the first half, at the high end of our 4% to 6% medium-term guidance range. as frank mentioned, we added seven new core account processing clients in the quarter, including four competitive takeaways. the combination of finxact's modern core and fiserv's leading digital surrounds is winning in the client's office. adjusted operating income was up 3% in the quarter to $281 million and up 7% to $556 million year to date.
adjusted operating margin in the segment decreased 120 basis points to 35% in the quarter, driven by investments in finxact, which we acquired early in the quarter; as well as increased organic investments in the business. for the first half, the segment's adjusted operating margin grew 30 basis points to 35.2%. the adjusted corporate operating loss was $125 million in the quarter and $247 million year to date. the adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 21% and was 19% for the first half.
we continue to expect 2022 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 21% for the full year. total debt outstanding was $21.5 billion on june 30, and debt to adjusted ebitda ratio was 3.0 times, in line with our target leverage. in june, we increased our bank revolver to $6 billion from $3.5 billion previously and extended the maturity to june 2027. the new revolver provides additional capacity and flexibility.
during the quarter, we continued our disciplined capital allocation strategy, repurchasing 5.1 million shares for $500 million. we had 32 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. additionally, we have had nearly $400 million of share repurchases so far in july. we are fully committed to our long-standing capital allocation strategy, which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, repurchasing shares and pursuing high-value and innovative acquisitions.
with that, let me turn the call back to frank.
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, bob. i'm very proud of the results we've accomplished, with another quarter of double-digit growth in both adjusted revenue and adjusted eps. in the second quarter, we published our 2021 csr report, which included a number of key enhancements to add disclosures and respond to new reporting standards on environmental impact and corporate governance. we are proud to share our esg journey as we continue to optimize the business while generating value to shareholders and communities.
in june, we expand our back-to-business program in nebraska. in addition to a $10,000 grant, businesses receive access to innovative business management technology from clover, ongoing community support and small business resources. our program in nebraska is expected to award $1 million in grants for small diverse businesses. we are incorporating green building design principles as a priority for our offices and facilities.
in the second quarter, fiserv received leed gold green building certification for our downtown manhattan location. and we are working toward leed status at the completion of our berkeley heights, new jersey, and dublin, ireland hubs. finally, before i turn it over to the operator for q&a, i'd like to thank shub for her terrific work as our head of investor relations for the last 18 months. shub is taking on a new assignment as our head of strategy, and i look forward to continuing to work with her.

thank you. [operator instructions] for our first question, we'll go to the line of dave koning from baird. please go ahead.
dave koning -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
oh, yeah. hey, guys. great results across the board.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
thanks, dave.
dave koning -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
yes. i thought one of the most interesting things, volume up 10% in merchant. yield must be up 7%. i think that's the biggest in maybe ever that we've seen.
is that primarily -- you called out mix of smbs, but there could be pricing components or just more services to the merchants. is there any one or two of those that's more prevalent? and how sustainable is that?
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yes. dave, thanks. as you heard us say over the last couple of quarters, we don't like to necessarily track yield. and the fact is we're not managing for yield, we're managing for revenue growth and overall margin.
there's always quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. this quarter, last quarter are two examples where both yield is positive. as we continue to sell more value-added services, as we see more revenue per merchant, obviously, we see the benefit of yield. and yes, we believe our overall revenue growth is sustainable, and we'll continue to see good growth in the business.
some of that will be ""yield"" because of more value-added services. some of that will be more transactions.
dave koning -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
great. and then just as a follow-up, just on margins. i know you called out investments and inflation impacts. but as we look in the back half, i think it has to be up about 200 bps in the back half, 200 bps year-over-year.
is q3 or q4 above or below that? like maybe the cadence just of the two quarters remaining.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yes. i think you should expect the margin to improve into q3 and more so into q4. the combination of -- we do anticipate inflation to subside a bit from the very high levels we saw in the first half of the year. additionally, as we've talked about in the prepared remarks as well as last quarter, we have this carryover work that we have going on from an integration standpoint.
last year, we dialed those costs out. we added them back to adjusted earnings. beginning in january 1 of this year, we stopped dialing that back out. and therefore, you see those costs hit in q1.
in q2, they started to ease. in the latter part of q2, they will continue their easing rate. so those costs go away. in addition, you get the benefit or the productivity out of that integration work.
and so you'll see a bigger improvement in fourth quarter than you do in third, and second half stronger than the first half.
dave koning -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
great. great job, guys. thanks. 
operator
next, we'll go to the line of lisa ellis from moffettnathanson. please go ahead.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. good morning. thanks, guys.
i guess, i think i'll start with actually the follow-on question to dave's question. same question for you, bob, on the free cash flow bridge throughout the remainder of the year. conversion running 65% year-to-date, you're now expecting 90 to 95% for the full year. can you just help us with what gives you confidence in the improvement in conversion in the second half? thank you. 
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yes, lisa. so good morning. i think a couple of things there. one, we definitely see the improvement in inventory in the back half of the year.
we have been buying significant amounts of inventory, both in terms of point-of-sale devices, but also in paper and plastic for our payments segment, our output solutions business payments. we see that easing into the second half of the year. that was done not only the case of actual point-of-sale devices, but some components to protect our clients from having hardware available. and we see that easing in the second half of the year so we'll see an improvement there.
overall, i believe working capital will improve into the second half as well as some improvement in capex from a timing standpoint. and then, finally, as we see improved margins, a bit more productivity to get more cash flow.
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i would just add. we've had tremendous opportunity for greater product build-out, organic opportunities and market opportunities. we didn't look at it.
i now look at finxact, bento and ondot as three examples where i think we are very, very pleasantly surprised by the opportunity to have a much larger footprint on those. finxact would be a perfect example. we're building into industrial strength at a much faster speed. and i think one of the other items i highlight is we have increased our speed of execution.
you see in our revenue numbers, it does affect our capex number also. but if you look at the speed at which we implement, the size and scope of which we operate, it's been a very, very good, strong trajectory, increased speed and execution.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
and lisa, i think those two last elements that frank pointed out is really at the heart of why we've taken our full year outlook down from the 95% to 100%, now 90% to 95%. continue to see those opportunities, and we want to work those opportunities.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
ok. good. and then my second one is more of a strategic question related to zelle because you had a number of zelle-related call-outs this quarter: 35% transaction growth, 54% client growth. can you just remind us how big zelle is as a contributor to payments and networks? like how we should think about the monetization model of zelle and its contribution to both, i guess, size and growth of that segment?
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yes. i think overall, it's a relatively small piece. it's, call it, roughly 2% of the payment segment. we've obviously seen good growth there and is part of the growth driver of the business.
and as that continues to ramp, now we have a number of financial institutions, and therefore the number of users, as we see more and more ubiquity of that capability of that tool, i.e., more consumers making more payments, we'll continue to see good growth and so.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
perfect. thank you.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
thanks, lisa.
operator
next, we'll go to the line of tien-tsin huang from j. p. morgan. please go ahead.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks, and good morning. congrats to shub on the new role. i'm excited for her. i just want to upfront ask on the visibility side, if you don't mind.
just any interesting trends in july to call out? are volumes and new sales ramping as expected? and same thing on the cost side. you have better visibility now on the cost to support this better revenue growth.
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'd say first of all, look at july volume. it's getting in line with q2. the consumer remains resilient, fundamentally in line in volume and transaction standpoint also.
so although the month's not over, this month seems to be continuing in the fashion. and visibility on the expense side is very, very clear. we have clear line of sight. obviously, we made a bunch of decisions to grow this business, probably at a level that is where we like it.
and we continue to see that opportunity, but we do see the opportunity to take down expenses on a run rate basis relative to margin, or productivity opportunity to put our productivities in front of us. probably don't have to -- we know how to get it very well.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
and tien-tsin, as i pointed out, and obviously, we expect inflation to subside a bit. we have the productivity of completing those integration projects. those have been ramping down as of the kind of middle to end of second quarter. you see clear line of sight to see that continuing into q3.
and we see good opportunities to continue to invest, focused on sustainably growing this business much faster than it has in the past, taking our revenue guidance up this year from previously 7% to 9% to now 9% to 11%. and those opportunities that frank talked about to increase our speed of execution and drive innovation not only is an impact to cash flow, but margin. and therefore, you saw us lower margin a bit even though we took up eps given stronger growth.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. overall encouraging for sure. just my quick follow-up, just with your target leverage now. you bought a lot of stock, it sounds like, in july.
curious on the appetite to continue with the buybacks versus doing deals. it seems like there are some payment fintech properties for sale out there. so just curious if there's any change in thinking.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
no. i would say no change in thinking. the strength of our balance sheet and our cash flow gives us the opportunity to both buy back shares and look for value-accretive acquisitions, and we'll continue to do that. if you look, we did about $1.4 billion through yesterday or so, through july so far.
but we also completed a number of acquisitions. and in fact, what, over the last call it, 15, 18 months, seven different acquisitions for about $2 billion while we're also buying back shares. so we'll continue to do both. as you know, we're in the market regularly.
we clearly believe there's real opportunity in the value of our stock, so we'll buy back. but we also look for value-accretive acquisitions.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you.
operator
next, we'll go to the line of darrin peller from wolfe research. please go ahead.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks, guys. could we revisit the revenue growth strength we saw? i mean, really across all three segments, but if we hone in on merchant for a minute. again, i mean, this kind of 17% growth was definitely well above what anyone, anybody expected. and when we look at the sustainability to that, is there anything anomalistic in growth in this segment in the quarter, or for that matter either of the other two segments, that wouldn't be sustainable in your mind? and maybe medium term, is this a sign of things to come in terms of elevated growth, first? and then just to revisit again the spread between revenue and volume.
you talked about value-added services, i think, and again, smb. but is that kind of a spread? really, do you expect revenue to outperform volume consistently now?
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
i'd start on merchant. we purposely had investor conference to talk about how we saw it over the longer haul. and obviously, we do believe in driving up our penetration rate of software services. you saw that go up 350 basis points.
at 15%. we talk about moving that over the longer haul to 25%. so arpu is clearly a focus of ours. our ability to also continue to expand in markets.
you hear us talk about colombia, argentina, mexico, along with our vertical of -- and we feel very, very strong about our capabilities we're going to build out over the long haul in the restaurant vertical and then move into the services verticals. so we feel our partnerships continue to grow. we believe we're the partner of choice in that business. and what you see in there, obviously, we had a couple of points of inflation in there.
but what you really see is the strong growth of the investments we've made, the businesses we've bought and integration capability of the total franchise. i mean, i do believe that we get leverage from our bank partners and other partners in a way that only we can. and of course, clover and carat are two leading products in the industry that we continue to invest heavily. and so i think the sustainability, minus inflation, is right in front of us.
and we've been driving this for a long time and i have talked about for a long time, and you're seeing the fruits of the labor.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok. and bob, just a quick follow-up on the yield again, if you don't mind.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
sure. yes. so obviously, very positive yield this quarter, was last quarter. there's always variability quarter to quarter, and so we try not to get too myopically focused on that calculation within a given quarter.
we think it kind of evens out over time. as we continue to provide value-added services, we'll continue to see improvements. we are very focused on adding merchants to our portfolio, i.e., signing up more merchants. we're very focused on selling more products to those merchants.
that lifts our po and drives revenue and margins for the company.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok. guys, just very quickly, the free cash and margin profile. i mean, the business is obviously growing notably faster. so should we expect maybe a more moderate margin story going forward, or free cash conversion, just to support this kind of growth? or is it just the anomaly stic items around inventory build and restructuring, and either way, you should get back to that 95% longer term?
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yes. i'm not ready to update our medium-term or long-term outlook. obviously, the crystal ball these days is a little bit fuzzy in what '22, '23, '24, '25 is going to look like. look, at the end of the day, we're focused on driving sustainable growth in our revenue.
we're up significantly from where we've been historically. we took up this year -- we said the merchant business, the medium-term outlook was 9% to 12% in our last full investor conference at the end of 2020. in march of this year, we actually took that up and extended it. so we went out to 2025 and said we believe we'll be at 11%.
so we're driving for sustainable growth. that obviously helps the top line. it's growing the bottom line. we took our eps growth up this quarter for the full year and we'll continue to look for those opportunities to drive overall value by growing the top line, bottom line and generating great free cash flow.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
all right. nice job, guys. thanks.
operator
next, we'll go to the line of ramsey el-assal from barclays. please go ahead.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question today. i wanted to ask about the competitive environment. and along the lines of it's sort of hard to argue, over the past few years, we haven't seen a lot of profitless, irrational competition.
are you seeing or do you expect to see any improvement in the competitive environment? i guess primarily driven by fintechs who maybe have a harder time raising capital to compete with you with.
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
i mean, the way i think about it is we run a large enterprise. we have competition in every country. we have competition in every business. i think our solutions are world-class and leading.
and i think ultimately, this is about how we provide our clients an opportunity to grow their businesses, whether it's a small business, a community bank or large enterprise. so i don't really look at it as anything other than our job is to be the best and provide the best. and from a competition standpoint, there's a lot of great competitors out there, but we feel when you look at our numbers and you look at what's going on, that we're gaining market share.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
and ramsey, maybe the thing i'd add to punctuate is, at the end of the day, we believe profitable, scaled businesses will perform over time. and competition comes and goes. we'll continue to execute, we'll continue to perform for our clients, and we'll continue to win.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
got it. ok. follow-up for me is, i was wondering if you could give us an update on how mix is trending in your acceptance segment. and i mean that from both an online, off-line as well as credit versus debit? and i guess the broader question is, do you think the mix in your business has sort of stabilized at this point? or is there still some sort of post-pandemic readjustments that need to occur in order to get back to that stabilized place?
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
i think from a debit, credit, it's stabilized. i think it's been stabilized. maybe there's a percentage point, two, delta from when we started pre-pandemic to now in that credit, debit mix. but i think we're at a normalized rate there.
and obviously, we keep driving e-comm, we keep driving car, and that trends up. but we do have a very large footprint globally, so those move in small increments relative to the size of our merchant business.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
great. and online, offline, same story?
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
ramsey el-assal -- barclays -- analyst
yeah. ok. great. thanks a lot.
appreciate it.
operator
next, we'll go to the line of jason kupferberg from bank of america. please go ahead.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning, guys. just wanted to start on the revenue side. obviously, nice to see the upside there and the raise in the outlook. can you give us just a little more detail on how to think about the segment level outlook for the year? i think i heard you say, for payments that you'd be comfortably within the 5% to 8%.
just a little bit more color across the board there would be great.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yeah. jason, thank you and good morning. if you look at the three segments, obviously, we've lifted the full company from 7% to 9% previous outlook to 9% to 11%. so we're above the year -- we're above the midpoint of the -- excuse me, above the medium-term outlook that we've given in the past.
in the payment segment, as you pointed out, we said during the prepared remarks that we think it's well within the range of a 5% to 8%. merchant, we had previously guided or provided an outlook of 9% to 12%, which is in line with our medium-term outlook. at this point, obviously, given we're 18% year to date, we're off to a good start in the third quarter with volumes in july continue to be in line. so we expect that to be above the guidance range or above that 9% to 12% outlook.
and fintech at 4% to 6%, we're 6% year to date. i would expect that to be in the range for the full year basis. there are obviously some ebbs and flows with periodic revenue. but overall, we feel good about the growth rate of all three of our segments to be at or better than our previous outlook.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. and just a follow-up on costs. can you just comment on your ability to pass some of these inflationary items on the labor material side on to your customers, perhaps with some sort of lag? it seems like that's probably the biggest driver of the 50 basis point reduction in the margin outlook for the year.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yes. i think, so it varies by segments and varies by business within that segment. if you think about the overall impact of inflation, obviously, we've got some revenue growth or revenue growth driven by that inflation, but bigger impact from an expense standpoint. we do see that flowing down for the balance of the year.
so both a little bit less benefit on the top line but a little less hit on the expense side. so we'll see some margin improvement into the second half of the year. that is the large driver of that, combined with those investments that we're seeing, are driving the reduced growth in our margin. still up 100 basis points over the prior, at least 100 basis points over the prior year, but inflation and those investments are certainly driving some of that.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from james faucette from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you very much. thanks for all the color and detail. you mentioned the cloudy crystal ball right now. can you just give us a little bit of insight of how you're thinking about kind hof macro assumptions and what you're seeing maybe right now that's influencing those in terms of how you're formulating outlook for the rest of this year?
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
what -- if you go back to how we've guided. really at the low end, you'd have to think -- you heard the comment i had made that that assumes some macro slowdown, and that would be 400 basis points deceleration in the second half. now i just gave in july quarter to -- month to date which isn't exactly showing that yet. but that look is a look of really caution relative to going on both in inflation, what's happening in the workforce dynamics, where we see interest rates.
obviously, that's the low end. if you go to the high end of that, it's continuing the way we're continuing right now. we're not looking for anything go much better, we think and we do believe that we have a great opportunity with the m&a coming out, getting the benefit to that, and improved productivity, having put in the merger behind us, where in fact you go back in. so those are really the assumptions inside here from a macro standpoint.
bob, anything you'd like to add?
bob hau -- chief financial officer
james, obviously, if you read the wall street journal or pick up any news report with interest rates and inflation and, obviously, a headwind. unemployment is quite low, that's remarkably resilient. the consumer balance sheet is quite strong. so overall, we feel pretty good about the visibility near term.
it's the '23, '25, we're just kicking off our 2023 budgeting cycle. at the end of the day, i think one of the keys to think about is the demonstrated resilience of this company in every cycle. so if we were to hit a recession, which i think some people believe we're technically in right now, how deep does that recession go? how long does it last? what's the overall input? is it a job-full recession? all of that creates some of that murkiness. but at the end of the day, we have proven to be incredibly resilient throughout those cycles.
we've got levers we can pull right now. we are making a decision given the strength of the top line, the ability to invest, and make sure that we are providing continued innovation for our clients. a little bit lower in margin, but actually raising eps, we think, is the right near term, midterm and long-term decision. but if things were to suddenly go very soft, we've got levers to pull, we'll drive productivity and we'll continue to deliver.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
appreciate that. and quickly for you, bob, just with that rising interest rates are recapturing the impact, potential impact on your interest cost appropriately? or is anything that you would call out that we should keep in mind there?
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yes. i think two things there. one, we're about 85% fixed debt, 15% variable. look, by far, the biggest chunk of that is commercial paper, and there's a balance of commercial paper both in u.s.
dollar and euro. obviously, that's going up, but that is quite a bit lower than fixed rate debt. so we're in good shape there. and of course, as a company, we have a bit of a natural hedge.
we have interest with variable rate debt, but we also have float revenue. so we have cash on the balance sheet that actually generates interest that roughly offsets that variable rate. so overall, rising interest rates, net-net, are actually good for us within reason, given that we're naturally hedged. and higher interest rates are good for our financial institution clients and therefore provide opportunity for us.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks for that, bob.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
thanks, james.
operator
and our final question comes from vasu govil from kbw. please go ahead.
vasu govil -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
thank you very much. i think most of my questions were answered. i just wanted to get more color, and bob, you alluded to it a little bit in the last answer. but just as we think, market's is obviously worried about macro concerns, so maybe you could help remind us how each of your segments would behave in a recession? where you expect to feel most pressure, where you would see more resiliency.
and then also on the margin front, what kind of cost levers you have going into a potential recession.
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yes. i think if you look at the three segments kind of in order of what might see impact in a meaningful downturn: merchant first, followed by payments, followed by fintech. overall though, we think we proved quite resilient. obviously, even in 2020, which was a very difficult year by all accounts, we managed to well flat revenue, grow earnings per share double digits, up 12%.
and so to the earlier comment i made, we have levers to pull, we have investments, we can mitigate and manage the overall bottom line. this is the 37th year of double-digit earnings, assuming we deliver on our guidance for the year, which obviously we fully expect to do. that's through lots of different cycles, both good and bad. and so we believe broadly that we'll do quite well.
if we see a sudden shock, go back to q2 of 2020, obviously, at the height of pandemic, everybody took a hit, and we sustained quite well overall. so we feel good about our opportunities to weather storms.
vasu govil -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
excellent. and just one quick modeling one on fx. obviously, fx headwinds are trending a little bit worse. can you update us on what the expectation on that is for the year?
bob hau -- chief financial officer
yes. we've previously had been expecting about 100 basis points headwind on revenue from fx. that's now up to 200 basis points, clearly driven by euro and lat am, latin america, largely argentine peso conversion. but in general, certainly a headwind that everybody is facing.
vasu govil -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
thank you very much.
frank bisignano -- president and chief executive officer
i'd like to thank everyone for their time, and we look forward to talking to you. appreciate it. have a great day.
