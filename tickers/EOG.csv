[operator instructions] and our first question will come from leo mariani with keybanc. please go ahead.
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey guys. i was hoping to get maybe a little bit more color on some of the cost reductions on the well side from a capital perspective this year. just looking through the slides, i mean, it looks like maybe it's a little bit more concentrated in the permian in terms of your expectations. i know that's where a lot of your activity is occurring.
but are you seeing kind of outsized gains there maybe relative to the eagle ford in terms of your expectations for rest of the year?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thank you, leo. we're going to ask billy to comment on that.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yes, you're right. most of our capex is generally directed toward the delaware basin. so certainly, on a dollar basis, that's where most of the savings are as well. just to give you a little more color on the capital savings, about a third of the capital savings are from efficiency gains, a third are from pricing improvements and a third is really just delaying facilities and infrastructure from the second quarter into the future third and fourth quarter.
so from that, we were able to see most of the cost savings probably on the completion side of our business, as i mentioned during the notes on the call. and you have to remember, we're still under some long-term contracts for drilling rigs and frac fleets. so as those roll off, we expect to be able to capture some of the market rate savings on those in the future. but we're seeing savings on some other ancillary services that i mentioned, largely things like maybe chemicals being down 20 to 25%, some of the equipment rentals being down 20 to 30% and things like that.
so you're seeing some savings on some of the other aspects of the business, not necessarily on the frac fleets and drilling rigs.
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's helpful color for sure. and i guess i was hoping maybe you could talk a little about the potential issue surrounding federal acreage here. certainly saw from the slides that you guys are kind of saying roughly half your premium inventory is located on federal land.
so obviously, the election is clearly uncertain, but do you guys have any thoughts as to kind of whether or not there might be any limitations going forward on the event of a biden victory?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, leo, this is bill. we've got a lot of experience drilling on federal land for decades. and we've been able to successfully navigate all the changes in the past. we've had many changes over the years.
and so i'm confident we're well positioned to continue to adapt and not let those changes significantly affect us. there are two reasons why i'm confident, and then i'll ask billy to add some additional color. the first is we've got a large amount of premium quality drilling potential on nonfederal land. so we have a tremendous inventory that's really not affected federal changes that provides significant operational flexibility.
on top of that, our exploration program that ezra mentioned, we believe, is going to provide some outstanding opportunities to continue to improve our inventory with better rock, and most of that is located on nonfederal land. so we've got a lot of confidence that we can continue to generate and add nonfederal potential that's even better than what we have. and then we've got a very strong growing backlog of approved drilling permits on federal land. and i think billy has got some numbers on that.
and then number two, our government has a system of checks and balances that allow the voices of many stakeholders to be heard. and as a part of these checks and balances, any changes would take time and have to consider all those stakeholder interests. and so the success of our responsible development is aligned with many important states and communities where we operate. for example, from federal lands, they're shared -- the revenues are shared with the states.
and in 2019, over $2 billion of revenue was paid out to over 35 states. so it's not an easy thing to change significantly the federal drilling potential. so i'm going to ask billy to add some more color.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yes. thanks, bill. as bill mentioned, we're starting with a lot of flexibility. with our decentralized culture, multi-basin approach, we have the ability to move activity around quite extensively.
on top of that, our exploration program, which is in basins really outside of our current operating areas, has the opportunity to further add to our nonfederal drilling inventory. as bill mentioned, we have quite a few premium locations that we've announced. and about half of those are on nonfederal lands. in addition, almost half of our premium locations that work at $30 are also on nonfederal lands.
and you can look at slide 10 of our deck that illustrates that. so the part of those that meet the rate of return hurdle at $30, about half of those are nonfederal. so a pretty good distribution of both federal and nonfederal make up that entire inventory list. and the non-federal inventory is just as high-quality as our federal.
so in fact, of our nonfederal inventory, it supports at least eight years of drilling with similar capital efficiency as we're experiencing in our 2020 plan. and bill mentioned, we have quite a few federal permits. we have about 2,500 federal permits that are approved or in progress, which is certainly more than four years of inventory. and also in the permian basin, over 90% of our federal acreage is held by production.
our government also provides, as bill mentioned, an important system of checks and balances, which provides for due process before any regulatory changes, and these changes have to consider the interest of all stakeholders. ultimately, regulatory and legislative changes that deny access to current property rights could amount to a government taking. so there'll certainly be some legal consequences of going through the process. and then just to point out, too, we have a very close alignment with our stakeholders, including the communities we work in.
new mexico is a great example of that. we recently conducted a very successful partnership with the state to complete our closed-loop gas capture project that i mentioned earlier. and on a day-to-day basis, i'm very proud of that close working relationship we have built with the regulatory agencies really to have a responsible development, open communication, paying attention to their needs. it also enables us to meet our goals and operate in a timely and efficient manner.
and our success, in turn, has helped support the quality of life for the people of new mexico, for example. in 2019, the state received nearly 40% of its overall revenue from the oil and gas industry. and that certainly supports the initiatives to increase funding for public health, education, infrastructure improvements and so on. on top of that, oil and gas development supports 100,000 jobs in new mexico, along with the associated economic activity and benefits.
a significant amount of that revenue from oil and gas activities on federal lands is also disbursed to the state governments to support local communities. and of course, the two states that benefited the most are new mexico and wyoming. new mexico received $1.2 billion and wyoming $641 million in 2019 alone. and the blm estimates that oil and gas activity on federal lands provided about $70 billion of economic uplift nationally and supported about 300,000 jobs.
so there's a lot of important considerations and stakeholders involved in any of these decisions to consider when changing the rules on federal land. so for these reasons, along with our diverse and really growing inventory, we remain extremely confident that eog will be able to continue to navigate through any changing regulatory landscape just as we have in the past.

and our next question will come from bob brackett with bernstein research. please go ahead.
bob brackett -- bernstein research -- analyst
good morning i'm intrigued by the comment that bringing back shut-ins led to flush production and lower-than-expected decline. is there a learning there to apply to future developments? and is the mechanism understood?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
billy, do you want to comment on that? or ken?
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
yes, this is ken, bob. the majority of our wells are single-zone wells under primary depletion. so as we shut those wells in, they continue to build bottom-hole pressure. and then, when we turn them on, those wells will show flush production until that bottom-hole pressure has gone down to what it was prior to that.
so it's a mechanism that's well understood for the horizontal wells that we have that are under that. we don't have any wells that are under waterfloods or multiple zones where you can have one zone damaging another. so it is well understood, and it's following exactly what we expected on the flush production profiles.
bob brackett -- bernstein research -- analyst
and then what about the lower-than-expected decline?
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
on the base decline, in terms of the base decline, we see the lower base decline was just that we saw those wells. we had forecasted them conservatively, and the wells are performing better than what we thought they would.
bob brackett -- bernstein research -- analyst
ok, that's great. thank you.
operator
our next question will come from paul cheng with scotiabank. please go ahead.
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
thank you. good morning. bill or billy, i'm just curious, i mean, one of the comments is that with the slowdown in the activity, you have seen a substantial improvement in the efficiency because you have more time there to work on. so if we extrapolate that, i mean, even when the commodity prices are returning to a higher level, is it better off for the company from a return standpoint for you to slow your activity level and not trying to grow as fast?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, paul, thank you. the efficiencies, we've seen a substantial amount of innovative ideas that have been generated. and i think when people have more time to think, instead of doing things, they think through and able to look at the data and analyze it, they're able to come up with more ideas and a lot of creative ideas. one of the basis of our disciplined growth strategy is to grow at a pace that we can get better.
we don't ever want to grow so fast and have so much activity that we cannot get better at the same time. so it really is a balance. you can only allocate capital at a certain speed. if you go too fast, you outrun your learning curve, etc., etc.
so there is a benefit to a proper pace, and we have been able to benefit from this slowdown. every downturn that we are in, and we experienced multiple ones over my 40 years, every downturn, we make the biggest improvements in the company. it's a challenge. the times are challenging.
this has been, though, different than any of the others, other than we're working more remotely than we ever have. and we're very fortunate to have in place our very extensive inflation technology system and our database and all of our apps in that we've leveraged all that technology to analyze and to make changes and to come up with ideas how to try to continue to improve the company. so we're super excited about where we're headed. i think we're going to exit this downturn a much, much better company, able to generate even higher returns than we have in the past and really do all of our business better than we have in the past.
so it's a very exciting time for us.
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
can i follow up on that slightly different way? one of your major competitors is also a well-known premium growth e&p company had drastically shifted their business model and taken a more balanced growth and cash return and with a well-defined cash flow reinvestment approach or a distribution approach. and one of the arguments that they also make is that while growing faster may, on paper, see a higher net present value but in the margins, you are at the mercy of opec. and i think the behavior of mbs and putin in the recent times show that that may no longer be reliable to depend on. so i mean do you guys agree with that kind of argument? and if not, why not? i mean we're trying to understand why a premium operator like eog will not want perhaps to have a more balanced growth and cash return business model and trying to grow at a slower pace than what you previously has been, even when the commodity price is getting much higher?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
paul, yes, that's an excellent observation. and we are fundamentally a return-focused company, and that's what we've been doing for a number of years. if you look back at the last three years -- we gave out these numbers, they're on our slide deck, and i talked about it in opening -- we've been a leader in the industry in return on capital employed. so we're focused on improving returns every year, and we've also been a leader in generating free cash flow.
we generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow over the last three years, every year, for $4.6 billion. and that funded a very sustainable growing dividend. we increased the dividend by 72%. and we reduced our debt, our net debt by over $2 billion.
so we've been a very disciplined company, and we did all that at a spending level that was our cash -- our capex to cash flow ratio was about 80%. so really, what you're hearing from really the rest of the industry is we're now moving into the model that eog has been working really for the last three years. and we're thrilled about that. that is fantastic for the industry, for investors.
and certainly, it's very positive for oil prices as we move forward. so we agree. they're doing the right thing. and that's the thing that we've been doing for a number of years, and we fully support their move.
operator
our next question will come from neal dingmann with suntrust. please go ahead.
neal dingmann -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
good morning. nice to see the continued diversified approach. my first question is around comments in your release about the improved 2021 maintenance capex leading to a higher 4q exit rate. and really, i guess, bill, my comments on this, based on this, could you speak to what this means for the trajectory for next year, as well as what this potentially could mean for even '22?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
billy, do you want to address that?
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yes. neal, this is billy. so our 2021 maintenance capital, previously, in the previous quarter, we outlined the same capital number for about 420,000 barrels a day, which was believed to be, at that time, what our exit rate would be for 2020. and certainly bringing on a bunch of extra production this year, but also incorporating the cost savings we're achieving this year, we believe we can do the same capital dollar number, $3.4 billion, but maintain the exit rate we're seeing this year of 440,000 barrels a day, which is a significant improvement again in our capital efficiency number.
so we believe we can maintain that as we go forward. that is not just meant to be a single snapshot. i think one thing it doesn't bake into -- and to make sure everybody understands this, it's forecasted on what we're achieving today. it doesn't bake in any improvements in well performance that we expect to be able to continue to see, as well as cost reductions.
if things stay where they are and we're staying in this environment, we're extremely confident we'll continue to see cost improvements that will drive our maintenance capital number improvements in the future. so yes, i'm extremely confident we can have an ongoing maintenance capital program in this same kind of area that we're talking about today.
neal dingmann -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
very good. my second question, just around your technical innovations. given the strength that i think you all have really above anybody else on the upstream side, would this ever lead you to consider broadening the business by considering any sort of clean tech or ngl-related investment?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
neal, yes, our focus on ghg reductions is -- and forming this sustainable power group within our company is to really focus on technology, bringing technology forward more quickly inside the company, and it's really another organic like we do everything else inside the company to really improve our emissions but also make sure that we can do it at a very high rate of return. and so it's really to facilitate our ongoing culture. we have tons of ideas that are coming from our divisions and our folks involved in the field operations. and so we're really excited about the technology and the innovations that's coming forward, and we're really excited about continuing to reduce our emissions.
and certainly, any kind of technology in this area, we believe, will not only benefit eog, but it could benefit the industry. and so we're open with that. it's not a proprietary thing. it's something we're doing to really continue to improve our environment.
operator
our next question will come from phillips johnston with capital one securities. please go ahead.
phillips johnston -- capital one securities -- analyst
hey, guys. thank you. just a follow-up on paul's question. eog really stands out because unlike all your peers, you never cut the dividend over the last six years.
and you also resisted all the pressure to buy back your stock over the last few years, while most of your competitors destroyed a lot of value doing that. the company that paul talked about has laid out plans to start paying variable dividends or special dividends on top of the regular base dividend. i realize you guys want to continue to grow the base dividend at a healthy clip. but my question is, is there any appetite at the board level to supplement your regular dividend with a recurring variable dividend? and if not, what kind of flaws do you see with that type of payout strategy that would prevent you guys from going down that road?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. phillips, yes, your observation is right. we believe a sustainable growing dividend backed by an impeccable balance sheet is certainly the best way to return cash to shareholders, and we're very committed to that. and we don't want to take anything away from that.
having said that, we're certainly open to consider other additional options. and so we certainly welcome any shareholder input on that, and we remain open and flexible to do what's best for everybody.
phillips johnston -- capital one securities -- analyst
ok. are there any flaws or drawbacks that you kind of see with that type of variable dividend strategy?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i think the biggest one is it's kind of unknown and inconsistent. and the feedback we've received from many folks is they would rather us focus on a more consistent growing dividend. and certainly, as you pointed out, we've never ever cut the dividend. and we want to make sure it's sustainable and certainly backing it up with an impeccable balance sheet.
and so the mix we've had over the last several years, as we talked about, we believe, is a really good mix, and we believe that that will create a very, very significant shareholder value going forward.
operator
and our next question will come from doug leggate of bank of america. please go ahead.
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, doug, i think as we stated in the opening remarks, fundamentally, we believe we've got a very, very strong game plan. and we've got a tremendous track record to back that up, being the leader in return on capital employed in the industry while generating very significant free cash flow and giving it back in a very strong dividend increase and strengthening our balance sheet. and we believe that was the right strategy before the downturn. it certainly has put the company in a tremendous position where we are right now.
and going forward, we believe that's the right strategy going forward: to continue to create significant shareholder value going forward. so we believe our game plan is really solid. our growth has always been very disciplined. again, we've only allocated about 80% of our cash -- the capex.
and so we've been able to grow the company at a very disciplined pace. and as we go into 2021 and in the future, obviously, we need to keep our eye on the macro view of oil. we need to be aware of the market conditions. we're not interested in growing oil volumes at a strong pace in an oversupplied market.
certainly, that's not the right thing to do. but we want to continue -- when the time is right, we want to continue to grow the company at a disciplined pace, at a pace to where we can continue to improve our returns and improve our performance.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
bill, but as a footnote to the question, i think people would really appreciate your leadership as a company here because you are one of the bigger companies, and capital discipline needs to be defined, and i would urge you to try and do that. my follow-up is maybe an obtuse way of asking the same question. you're running 10 or 11 rigs right now. you've got the potential clearly to run three times that amount.
so i guess what i'm really trying to get at is, are you planning to retain the same operational capability? in other words, the risk that you'd move back to that level or is -- like, some of the other companies, is there an opportunity here to address the cost base of the company by rightsizing to perhaps a lower level of activity? and i'll leave it there.
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, doug, the -- we are really committed to our employees. they are the ones that are making our company better. they're the most valuable asset we have in the company. and so we have a lean, we run lean.
we actually peaked on employment about four or five years ago. even though we've gotten a much bigger company, our employee base has really not grown. and so they're very highly productive. they're highly motivated.
and they're certainly the part of the company that we want to keep intact and take care of and encourage. so we believe we're at the right size to be effective, to be ready as the downturn is over. so we're focused on continuing to maintain and to actually increase our culture, our ability as we go forward. so we're very committed to keeping the company in great shape going forward.
operator
and our next question will come from scott gruber with citigroup. please go ahead.
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. good morning, scott.
scott gruber -- citi -- analyst
good morning. can you hear me?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, sir. we can hear you. yes.
scott gruber -- citi -- analyst
i actually think -- your rig count today, i think, is around half a dozen rigs. correct me if i'm wrong on that number. given the continued efficiency gains that you guys continue to achieve, what is the new level of maintenance rig activity and frac activity?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
billy, do you want to answer that one?
billy helms -- chief operating officer
sure. scott, this is billy. so yes, you're right, we have actually seven rigs, counting the one in offshore trinidad. so six domestically and one offshore.
and our maintenance capital plan would require about 20 rigs and 10 frac fleets, and we're generally running, as i mentioned, seven rigs and five or six frac fleets today. so we're well under. and when we pulled back our activity, we dropped to a level well below our maintenance capital level. and that's important to note.
so the plan, certainly, going into the third and fourth quarter, is to be looking at whether or not we want to add a rig or two going into the next year to get to that maintenance level or not.
scott gruber -- citi -- analyst
got it. and then you had mentioned also that you have -- most of your rigs and frac is under long-term contracts. i imagine those were the ones you kept just given the cost of ending those contracts. are these generally multiyear contracts in support of new e-frac fleets? or did the majority roll off over the next 12 months? i'm trying to ascertain when those savings manifest.
i imagine the rigs and frac crews today, given the deflation on other services, these rigs and frac crews may be pushing toward 40 or 50% of your direct well cost. so just trying to get my head around when you could see those savings roll through.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yes. sure, scott. yes, they are multiyear contracts. and i'd say there are various terms on the contracts.
but in general, they're starting to roll off in the next 12 to 18 months. i think the one thing that's important to note is we build what we think are valuable relationships with our most trusted service providers. and we work through this in partnership with them to make sure we retain not only the performance and the high-performing equipment and personnel but the ability to ramp back up when we need to. so it gives us a lot of flexibility as we work through this.
and i think certainly, we build a lot -- by building that relationship, it's a very trusted relationship we have, it allows us to capture some cost savings, just being able to capture rates at below market rates in current times, but also maintain the high-performing levels of activity that we need to sustain our business. so we're very proud of our relationships we have with them. but they typically roll off in the next 12 or 18 months. and we'll kind of reassess where we need to be working with those trusted partners.
operator
our next question will come from juan jarrah with td securities. please go ahead.
juan jarrah -- td securities -- analyst
yes. thanks guys, and thanks for squeezing me in. congrats on the exploration success in trinidad. i did want to follow up a bit on your onshore exploration efforts.
and i know this is easier said than done, but can you comment on any other exploration efforts you'd consider pursuing outside of the lower 48? and with that, canada comes to mind. and as you know, one of your peers recently announced adding a position to their montney in canada. so just curious on that, and i'll stop there.
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
ezra?
ezra yacob -- executive vice president, exploration and production
thanks, juan. this is ezra. as you know, we've got -- you mentioned our trinidad exploration effort, and then our domestic exploration effort. and so when we think about anything else outside of the lower 48, it really comes down to how competitive can it be with our preexisting domestic portfolio.
and that's the main driver on it. when we talk about any of our new exploration ideas, whether it's trinidad or the new domestic portfolio, we're exploring for prospects and rock quality that will be additive to the front end of our preexisting inventory. at 10,500 premium locations, i'm not sure if we necessarily just need more to continue to backfill that deep inventory. what we're really trying to do is add to the front end of it.
and that's what the exploration effort is focused on.
juan jarrah -- td securities -- analyst
i had to ask. but thanks for your time.
operator
the next question will come from brian singer with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
brian singer -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning you mentioned in the 10-q that you expect to replace the 750 million of debt coming due next year with other long-term debt. and i thought that was interesting because you've been talking a while, i think, about paying down debt and having the cash on the balance sheet to do so. and so i wondered if you could add a bit more color on, a, how you're thinking about the right level of free cash flow to pursue; and then, if not allocated to paying down debt, where you see the best areas of allocation between incremental drilling, returning it to shareholders or keeping a high amount of cash on the balance sheet or deploying it elsewhere, like m&a.
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
tim?
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
yes. so the reason we chose to keep the debt and long-term debt at june 30 was just the uncertainty of the market going forward between now and february when our next debt is due. certainly, the goal has not changed, and that goal is to pay down debt. so if market conditions play out as such that we have the cash -- sufficient cash, then we will pay down that debt.
but to be conservative, we left it in long-term just because of the uncertainty in the market. and i guess bill will address the capital allocation portion of your question.
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, the right level of free cash flow, brian, is really a function of -- it's obviously variable every year, number one, based on the oil price. we -- normally, we have and we will continue to kind of use a conservative view, our macro conservative view, of what oil prices will be that year. and then we certainly have a goal every year to generate significant amount of free cash flow. as an example, the last three years, we've generated about $1.5 billion a year, on average, free cash flow.
and we want to use that to continue to, as tim said, consider paying our debt down. our goal is to continue to pay our debt down more and certainly continue to work on our dividend when the environment is healthy. and then after that, we will allocate the capital, continue to allocate it at a very disciplined level just like we have in the past. and discipline means that we're not going to allocate the capital at a speed that's too fast to where we cannot learn and grow and get better.
we want to always be increasing our capital efficiency, lowering our funding costs, continuing to lower our operating costs and those kind of things. and so you have to go at the proper speed to do that every year, and that's really the governor on allocating the capital. and whatever free cash flow is left over after all those things are done, obviously, that will be variable year by year according to the commodity prices. we will continue to be committed to using that capital to continue to create shareholder value and making sure we get the highest return possible avenue on using that cash.
brian singer -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. and then my follow-up goes back to the exploration program. i think ezra, you mentioned a couple of comments i thought was interesting. one was that the exploration you're pursuing is even better than what you have and then that it's in basins outside the current operating area and largely not on federal land.
and i wondered if you could add a bit more color on what type of impact the onshore exploration you're pursuing could have on your potential production or capital investment one or two years out, what the proximity is to being able to really move these plays into development and have a level of materiality on your production and then whether there are aboveground issues that need to be worked out with the areas from a midstream or other perspective.
ezra yacob -- executive vice president, exploration and production
yes, brian. this is ezra. let me try to unpack that one by one here. first, i'd say our -- as we've talked about in the past, our domestic exploration effort, these aren't really in frontier or wildcat basins.
these are in basins where there is established legacy oil and gas production. and so if these prospects work out, the way that we think they will, and they're additive to the front-end quality of our inventory, we should be able to move them into an active development basis pretty quickly, obviously, pending results. the second part of that, going back to just the quality of what we're looking for, this is -- it's a better rock quality, as we've talked about before. a lot of what we're looking at is tied to what we think we can develop with our horizontal completions technology.
and what i mean by that is just exactly how does the rock, how is it going to respond, how is it going to actually be stimulated and fracture in combination with our stimulation designs. and so those are the two things we think are really -- we're focused on. it is definitely not traditional, unconventional types of rocks that have been focused on in the past. and so as we continue to kind of push these prospects forward and get data on them, we will update you guys with our results on the testing.
but we're feeling very confident, everything that we're seeing to date, that they are going to continue to be, as i said earlier, additive to the front end of our -- of what really is a pretty deep inventory to begin with.
operator
this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to mr. thomas for any closing remarks. please go ahead, sir.
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
in closing, first, we want to thank all eog employees for the outstanding job you're doing to improve the company during this historic and challenging downturn. as we said, the company is improving very rapidly. and we're going to emerge from this downturn a better and stronger company. and so we're eager to extend our leadership in return on capital employed, disciplined growth, free cash flow generation and sustainability.
thanks for listening, and thanks for your support.

bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, tim, and good morning, everyone. eog's second-quarter results demonstrate the company's ability to quickly adapt to an unprecedented drop in commodity prices. we exceeded our own expectations by delivering more oil for less capital and lower operating costs, allowing the company to generate significant free cash flow during the quarter. in may, we published our revised plan, which aggressively reduced our full year of capital, more than 45%, and loe more than 20%.
eog employees rose to the challenge, not only achieving the incredible reduction targets we set but beating them. compared to our aggressive plan and guidance for the second quarter, we produced 7% more oil, spent a whopping 26% less capital and our cash operating costs, which includes loe, transportation and gathering and processing were 10% lower. with the rapid reduction in capital and operating costs, the company generated nearly $200 million of free cash flow, while oil prices averaged less than $28 a barrel. our second-quarter results are a testament to the return-focused culture of eog employees and our ability to pivot quickly in response to the unprecedented level of market volatility and industry conditions.
last quarter, we laid out seven strategic focus points for the remainder of 2020. here's a quick progress report. our first strategic point is only to invest capital if it generates a premium rate of return. premium return is defined as a 30% or higher direct after-tax rate of return using a price deck of $40 flat oil.
in this downturn, we have raised the return bar even higher by using $30 oil instead of $40 to calculate our 30% rate of return. our second focus point this year is to exercise operational flexibility to quickly reduce costs. with capital 26% below target and cash operating cost 10% below target, our second-quarter results demonstrate our ability to move quickly in a volatile environment. our third focus point is to accelerate our technical innovation across the company.
this is an area we're most excited about. while we anticipated some additional opportunity for innovation because of the slowdown in our pace of development, our employees' ability to accelerate innovation even while working remotely has exceeded our expectations. we recently completed our yearly technical conferences across each discipline, all via video conferencing. we are amazed at the volume of new innovative ideas presented from creative ways to cut costs to new tools to identify and evaluate prospects.
i am confident that the tremendous progress we've made this year will accelerate eog's lead as these sustainable improvements start paying dividends in the future by driving down the price of oil required to generate double-digit returns and extend eog's industry leadership and return on capital employed. our fourth focus point is to exit 2020 with momentum into next year by increasing production into the price recovery. as billy will cover in a few minutes, we've increased our quarterly and full-year production volume estimates. in addition, with the cost reductions we're making this year, we have improved our maintenance capital outlook for 2021.
we now expect we will be able to maintain higher volumes for the same capital and cover both capital and the dividend with cash flow at less than $40 oil. our improvements in volume, coupled with reductions in well and operating costs, are setting us up for strong performance next year. our fifth focal point this year is to remain hyper-diligent about maintaining our financial strength. our goal each year is to spend within cash flow and maintain an impeccable balance sheet to support operations and protect our dividend.
this downturn has demonstrated the value of eog's historically strong balance sheet more than ever. with this goal in mind, we reduced capex more than 45% to $3.5 billion, so that full-year cash flow funds capex in the low 30s. if oil prices average $40 for the year, full-year cash flow also funds the dividend and generates free cash flow. sixth, our focus is to continue to invest in the long-term value of the business.
in fact, once again, this break in our pace of development has actually accelerated our progress by creating more time to fine-tune our quality exploration market. we continue to drill on prospects that we believe will further improve company performance. you will hear from ezra in a moment regarding recent exploration progress. the seventh focus point this year is the most important.
protecting and enhancing eog's culture is the key to our continued success. we have highly skilled employees who are focused on constantly improving every area of the company. we remain committed to our employees as they are the ones who are making eog a much better company during this downturn. armed with extensive data, proprietary apps and information technology, eog employees are overcoming the challenging conditions by continuing not only to innovate but to accelerate innovation.
we believe we're in the process of making another significant improvement in eog's performance similar to the last downturn when we initiated our premium drilling program in 2016. as a reminder, with premium standards in place from 2017 to 2019, eog delivered an industry-leading average return on capital employed of 14%, generated $4.6 billion in free cash flow, increased the dividend by 72% and reduced net debt $2.2 billion and increased proved reserves by 55%. the eog culture is rising to the challenge again with innovation that is significantly improving the company's current and future performance. eog's long-term game plan has not changed.
we remain focused on high-return reinvestment, disciplined organic growth and generating substantial free cash flow to fund a sustainable growing dividend and maintain a strong balance sheet. eog will emerge from the downturn a much better company and our commitment to creating long-term value for our shareholders has never been stronger. before i turn it over to tim and billy, i want to note how excited we are to continue our progress toward reducing ghg emissions. we are near the start-up of our eight-megawatt solar and natural gas hybrid electric-powered compressor station.
in addition, we recently formed a sustainable power group within the company. this group will support our innovative culture to bring return-focused, low-emissions technology and projects forward quickly. eog is committed to being an innovative leader in sustainability and the long-term energy solution. next up is tim.
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
thanks, bill. eog proved to be exceptionally resilient during one of the most severe quarters for the industry in our memory. i'd like to review the high level changes in eog's cash position during the second quarter. eog had $2.9 billion of cash at the end of the first quarter.
during the second quarter, the company generated discretionary cash flow of $672 million. and after deducting capex of $478 million, we generated $194 million of free cash flow that nearly covered dividend payments of $217 million. over time, eog's working capital position tends to be fairly balanced between current assets and liabilities. however, during periods of market volatility, our working capital balance can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.
changes in working capital in the second quarter represented a net cash outflow of $1 billion, which was more than offset by net cash inflow from working capital in the first quarter of $1.2 billion. we expect changes in working capital will be approximately neutral for the full-year 2020 based on the current outlook for commodity prices. moving on to the financing side of the ledger. eog issued $1.5 billion of new debt and paid off a total of $1 billion of maturing notes during the quarter.
this left the company with $2.4 billion of cash on hand at the end of the second quarter. considering total debt of $5.7 billion, this yields a net debt to total cap ratio of 14%. in addition to cash on hand, our very strong liquidity position is further supported by a $2 billion unsecured revolving line of credit, which has no borrowings against it. looking ahead, we expect discretionary cash flow to exceed capex and dividend payments for the remainder of 2020 at oil prices in the mid-30s.
in late april and early may, we elected to close out most of our hedge positions for the remainder of the year as the volatility in commodity markets had abated and prices seem to have more upside than downside. we effected this primarily by entering into offsetting contracts for those hedge positions we elected to close. therefore, the timing of cash received or paid for settlement of these closed-out hedges will remain in the periods for which they are effective. we expect to receive $360 million in net cash payments in the second half of 2020 from these hedge positions that have been closed.
as 2021 comes into focus, we will be opportunistic about adding hedges if prices look attractive relative to our assessment of market fundamentals. next up is billy to review our operational performance.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
thanks, tim. last quarter, we made the decision to shut in existing production and defer new wells rather than sell into an uncertain and low-price market. our intent was that our lowest activity levels, lowest capital expenditures and lowest production volumes would coincide with the lowest point of the commodity price curve. in doing so, we enhanced the cash flow and margins for each barrel produced and maximized the rate of return for our investments.
our employees' execution of our challenging new plan during the second quarter was stellar. they answered the challenge by beating by a wide margin nearly every capital expense and production goal we targeted under the new plan. after rapidly reducing our full-year capital plan by nearly half, second-quarter capital came in an additional 26% below target. we also reduced our cash operating expenses a total of 10% compared to the target.
one of the hallmarks of eog is driving for continuous improvements, but the downturn brought a new intensity to this effort. our employees delivered even more by continuing to innovate capital and expense reductions that will benefit future operations. for example, we increased our full-year total well cost reduction target to 12%, up from 8% just a few months ago. our operating teams continue to drive efficiency in every aspect of our business.
drilling times are consistently improving, yet completion costs have seen the most improvement during the quarter, down more than 15%. about half of the capital savings can be attributed to cost efficiencies and the other half to service cost reductions. our drilling rigs and frac fleets are largely under existing term contracts, so service cost savings have been more from ancillary services. as rig and frac fleet contracts expire, we expect to see further cost reductions.
therefore, we believe most of these savings to be sustainable. our cash operating costs were down more than $50 million or 10% relative to our second-quarter guidance. our operating teams went into high gear to identify opportunities to reduce expenses during the second quarter with a focus on every category. some of the largest cost reductions are our reduced work over expenses, water disposal and lease maintenance and repairs.
these reduced expenses played a major role in helping to generate free cash flow during the second quarter. it is also important to note that we have reduced our full-year cash operating cost guidance by almost $20 million or 6% on a per unit basis. on the production side, we also beat our forecast. this is mainly due to bringing the shut-in volumes back on sooner than anticipated.
one observation from our production data revealed that almost every well exhibited some level of flush production before returning to its previous decline profile, further evidence that the well sustained no damage from the shut-in period. in addition, the decline observed from the base production was less than previously forecasted, also contributing to the production beat. as a result, we have raised our full-year oil production guidance by 16,000 barrels of oil per day or 4%. our dramatically reduced activity and the temporary shut in of production, combined with the expense reductions, generated positive net cash flow and deferred a large amount of production into a higher-price quarter.
slide 12 of our presentation this quarter illustrates the updated shut-in volumes and the corresponding product price. while we have slowed our overall spending, we have maintained our commitment to reducing ghg emissions by continuing to invest in innovative new technologies and initiatives. our focus on reducing flaring continues with our gas capture rate now exceeding 99.5%. to further minimize flaring, particularly when caused by unpredictable downstream market interruptions, we tested a new eog innovation we have named closed-loop gas capture.
closed-loop gas capture is an automated process developed in-house to reroute natural gas back into existing wells when a downstream interruption occurs. initial results were successful and indicate that our closed-loop gas capture process has the potential to both reduce flaring and return the majority of the captured gas from the well back to production. in late 2019, we initiated a pilot project in new mexico to combine solar and natural gas to power electric motor-driven compressors. compressors typically use natural gas to power the engines and are a source of ghg emissions from stationary combustion.
since solar power is only available during the day, we designed a hybrid power plant to supplement daytime solar power generation with reliable natural gas generation at night. during the day, the solar panel should produce eight megawatts of power with no combustion emissions. compared to the traditional natural gas-powered compression, we believe our hybrid power compression will result in lower operating expenses and a meaningful reduction in emissions. this facility will become operational later this month.
both of these projects demonstrate that we approach esg like every aspect of our business, focusing on sound economic decisions and continuously improving our operations. eog has a long history of adapting to changing industry conditions and using technology to improve the company. as bill noted earlier, to further enhance our efforts to be a leader in ghg reduction, we recently announced a new strategic initiative to identify and implement returns-focused, low-emissions power generation within eog. we are confident that this initiative led by our sustainable power group will be another area in which eog will lead the way in finding more cost-effective methods to generate power while reducing our impact on the environment and generating a healthy rate of return.
and finally, i am extremely proud of how all of our employees have responded to this year's challenges and doing so while adapting to remote working conditions. here's ezra for an update on recent exploration success in trinidad.
ezra yacob -- executive vice president, exploration and production
thanks, billy. eog has had a very successful business in trinidad for 27 years. about 20% of eog's natural gas production comes from shallow water offshore fields in the columbus basin of trinidad. most of the gas is sold as feedstock into a sizable petrochemical industry on the island, primarily producing ammonia and methanol.
trinidad has had a competitive financial profile within eog due to our competitive advantages in the country as a low-cost operator and our long track record of exploration success. while our capital investments in trinidad typically make up a small percentage of our overall capex budget, the returns on that capital are competitive with eog's domestic portfolio and consistently generate free cash flow and net income. the latest round of exploration and development in trinidad kicked off in the spring of 2018 with the acquisition of a set of modern seismic images. the combination of new seismic and updated geologic models provided a deep inventory of prospects to develop our exploration plan.
this plan included farming into new acreage held by another operator where we could apply our low-cost structure to improve the economics on these high-potential exploration blocks. drilling began in july 2019, and we have recorded four initial discoveries with estimated natural gas potential of one tcf gross and 500 bcf net to eog. the discoveries are located in shallow water off the southeast coast of trinidad. our two open water exploration wells support the installation of new production platforms beginning in 2021.
the final two wells in the current drilling campaign are in process and should be completed by year-end. production from this drilling campaign will more than offset natural declines from existing wells and provide a foundation of growth for eog's total production in trinidad. lastly, the initial success of this latest exploration program sets up the potential for additional delineation and exploration drilling in trinidad in future years. i would also like to take a moment to discuss our ongoing domestic exploration effort.
we have made good progress moving multiple prospects forward during 2020 despite a reduction to our initial capital plan. leasing across multiple basins is going well, and we are capturing contiguous positions in what we feel are the sweet spots of these plays. we have initiated drilling in some projects and are currently incorporating modern well logs and core data into our geologic models. we look forward to providing updates regarding the testing of these prospects at an appropriate time.
next up is bill to provide concluding remarks.
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, ezra. in conclusion, i would like to note the following important takeaways. first, our second-quarter operational results were outstanding. we rapidly reduced capital and operating costs while increasing volumes.
this resulted in significant free cash flow. second, we have improved our full-year 2020 guidance by increasing volumes and further reducing costs. third, our 2021 maintenance outlook has improved to include more oil with no increase in capital. we can maintain higher volumes and cover both capital and the dividend with cash flow at less than $40 oil.
fourth, as demonstrated by ou results, the eog culture continues to rapidly and sustainably improve the company. during this downturn, we believe we're in the process of making another step change to improve profitability. and finally, eog's fundamentals have not changed. our focus on returns, disciplined growth and generation of significant free cash flow to fund a growing sustainable dividend and strong balance sheet have not wavered.
our commitment to creating long-term shareholder value has never been stronger. thanks for listening, and now we'll go to q&a.

[operator instructions] and our first question today will come from arun jayaram with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
arun jayaram -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah, good morning. bill, my first one is for you. in 2021, you're gonna hold, call it, a maintenance program. and based on your '22 and '23 outlooks, you could have some growth, call it, 8% to 10%.
i guess, my question is, given typical shale cycle times, would you have to spend any incremental capital in 2021 to prepare you to meet that 8% to 10% growth in '22?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, hi, arun, i'm gonna ask billy to comment on that.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yeah, arun, no, we don't anticipate that we would have to spend any additional capital this year to be able to accommodate growth in the future. and beyond this year, i would add that we'll only add activity once we see a more balanced market, as bill described.
arun jayaram -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
fair enough. fair enough. tim, i got one for you. in the guide, we did note a step-change lower in the tax deferral with the company's current tax mix now above 90%.
can you talk about the drivers of the higher cash tax mix in 2021? and as we would have thought some of your idcs would have led to a lower cash tax rate. and can you just talk about, is this a one-year phenomena or indicative of the go-forward tax rate?
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
arun, this is tim. yeah, so as we become more and more profitable, obviously, it has lowered the price that we have to make a taxable income. so that's the first thing. we are an extremely profitable company now.
and if you go back and look to the -- to 2020, for sure, in the $39 oil, there wasn't much tax profit there. so in the $50 environment, we have significant taxable income, and we have no net operating losses left to offset that with. so it's a simple math of being a very profitable company and paying taxes. so beyond that, i could clarify it more offline, if you'd like, but that's the general answer.
operator
and our next question will come from jeanine wai with barclays.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
hi, good morning, everyone. thanks for taking our questions. so sorry, tim, not to keep pushing you on arun's question right now. but in terms of '22 and '23 on the deferred tax, how that might trend, is it possible that the deferred guidance might improve a little bit next year as you get back to growth to 8% to 10% because you'll be spending more money? the strip is backward dated, which, i guess, is lower cash, so good news, bad news for this.
as well as you've got a lot of gains on the nat gas side for this year that maybe may not material next -- materialize next year. so maybe just furthering on arun's question, is it possible that 0% to 15% could be something different in '22 and '23 as you get back to growth?
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
that's exactly right. as we spend more capital in a growth mode, obviously, we'll have more idcs to deduct to lower our cash taxes. so in a backwardated environment where we got lower oil prices, then yes, it would lower that deferred ratio.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
ok, great. thank you for the clarification. my second question is just on cash returns. so given the high-class problem of your forecasted free cash flow and you formally set the total debt target to $3.7 billion with no plans to further reduce debt, what's the minimum operating cash balance that you're comfortable? and i guess, it's a backdoor way of asking like does your new formalized debt target, does that imply that you plan on paying out 100% of excess free cash flow in a year after dividend and after whatever you may allocate toward low-cost property acquisitions? or am i just getting ahead of myself here?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. jeanine, i'm gonna let tim talk about the cash needed to operate the company.
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
so what we have said is that of around $2 billion is the number we feel comfortable with through the cycles. that doesn't mean it's a hard-and-fast rule that we will have $2 billion on the balance sheet. some quarters, it will be more; some quarters, it will be less, especially during the quarter based on how money comes in and out of the company. so that's the level that we're comfortable with for now.
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. and jeanine, the second part of the question is, i think it's important to know that our board is very, very committed to returning cash to shareholders. and we -- i think we've demonstrated that certainly, over the last 20 years, a 20% compounded annual increase in the dividend, the last four years, 146% increase. and then, last year, even in a down year, we increased the dividend and sustained it by 30%.
so we're very committed to giving cash back. at the same time, we think it's important to be flexible and opportunistic, which means we want to be able to give the cash back in the way that it creates the most return, the most total shareholder return. and so that will be different in different situations. in an up-cycle, it certainly could be we want to continue to work on the regular dividend.
that's the primary way we want to give cash back. and so we are gonna continue to work that really, really hard. and then, on top of that, we'll consider other things opportunistically. as the company continues to improve and get better and improve our free cash flow potential, which we think we're gonna be able to do very consistently over time, we'll consider other options.
as tim mentioned, potentially, a supplemental dividend; potentially, in certain situations, stock buybacks. and then, we are always looking at opportunistic low-cost, high-return bolt-on property acquisitions. and we did a number of those last year. some of those were in our exploration plays.
some of those in -- really in the delaware basin, where we're actually drilling bolt-on acquisitions. so we're always looking to improve the drilling potential of the company through those kind of things, too. so we've got a lot of great options. we're very excited about having a lot of free cash flow and continuing to build on that.
that's not a problem. that's a great opportunity. and we're just looking for the right way to redistribute that and generate the highest returns for the shareholders.
operator
and our next question will come from bob brackett. please go ahead.
bob brackett -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
hey, good morning. i was comparing the net expected well completions for this year by play versus last year. and am i over-interpreting it? but i see a decrease in the nonfederal areas, call it, the texas eagle ford. i see a rise in the prb in the delaware.
is that program predicated on federal lease concerns or desires? or am i over-interpreting?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, bob, yeah, this is bill. i'm gonna ask billy to answer that one.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yeah, good morning, bob, no, i would say, we've -- in the past 10 years, a lot of our growth previously came from the eagle ford, and that is a more mature play at this point. and going forward, they still have quite a bit of inventory, and a lot of that is still double premium. but we see a lot of the growth coming from the delaware basin and the powder river basin, as you mentioned. part of that is that in the last couple of years, even last year, we built out some infrastructure on federal land.
and just as a natural progression of our development program, we start moving activity into those areas. that's true both in the delaware and the powder river basin. but that's kind of where we see activity moving. and that will also help in the decline rate that bill and ezra we talked about earlier in the call.
bob brackett -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
thank you for that.
operator
and our next question will come from scott gruber with citigroup. please go ahead.
scott gruber -- citi -- analyst
yes, good morning. i want to continue on jeanine's line of questioning. thinking more about this year, you'll have about $2.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet post bond repayment, and you mentioned retaining $2 billion over the long term. but you also have the '23 maturity, and then you'll generate $1.5 billion of free cash at $50 this year and even more, another $1 billion or so at $60.
so just how do you think about use of cash this year, especially if capex is not going to flex? how do you think about building cash for the '23 maturity? is that above and beyond the $2 billion you mentioned? and how do you balance that against returning cash this year if the strip is right?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
tim, do you wanna take that one?
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
sure. so we've already committed to spending $1.7 billion of the free cash flow through the payment of the bond that matured and then our regular dividend. so that's the first thing. and then, at the end of each quarter, we will review with the board what our cash position is, and we will look at, sight into the future and see what the condition as an industry look like and make decisions based on where we are at that point in time.
so there's no hard-and-fast rule on what that answer will be. it's a long-term outlook, not a short-term outlook. so that's the way we're building this model.
scott gruber -- citi -- analyst
is the $2 billion kind of how you're thinking about the right cash balance for this year? or does it -- is that a little bit higher given the '23 maturity? how does that come into consideration?
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
no, the $2 billion is -- two pieces to the $2 billion: one is normal operating conditions and one is a surplus for abnormal operating conditions. so they're both built into that number, and that's the number that tim driggers feel comfortable with. so that's how that number was derived. having lived through a lot of these cycles and knowing the size of our company, i know what i feel comfortable with to not be stressed in a stressful situation on the cash side.
so that's how we derive that number.
operator
and our next question will come from leo mariani with keybanc. please go ahead.
leo mariani -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi, guys. just wanted to delve a little bit into the capex here in 2021. certainly noticing from the slides that you guys are spending an extra $500 million kind of above maintenance. i wanted to get a sense of how much of that is devoted to some of these new exploration plays that you guys were discussing here.
and then, ultimately, it sounds like there's quite a bit of testing happening with the drill bit in '21 versus last year. do you guys see this year as really having a potential as kind of a breakout year for exploration success for eog, given the higher spend?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, leo, let me start that, and then i wanna ask ezra to give some color on it. but the important thing to consider on our exploration program is that we're investing in plays that we believe will make a significant step-change in the performance of the company. and when i talk about that, that's in addition to the double-premium change we are making this year. it's above and beyond that.
we're really looking for plays that are really the new technology we see for the future of horizontal drilling for the most part. these are much, much better rock and have the potential to be much better than -- and deliver results like lower decline rates to help us to generate even more free cash flow and higher returns than ever before. so we're investing in very significant potential -- future potential for the company. the breakdown on the half of the $500 million is $300 million in exploration and $100 million in international and $100 million in esg projects.
and i'm gonna let ezra comment just in general on our exploration efforts and give a little bit more color.
ezra yacob -- president
yes. thank you for the question, leo. so as bill highlighted, we pulled back in 2020 a little bit on our exploration budget, commensurate with reducing the capital spend across the board. and so we are excited this year to be able to return 2020 levels to kind of a pre-pandemic level or more of a historic balance level for the exploration side.
and while i can't promise specifics on timing or anything like that, i can give you a little bit of color on how the process goes. and obviously, we like to capture leasehold, and we prefer not to talk in too great a detail about our exploration plays until we get the leasehold captured. and especially what we think is not only the tier 1 areas, the sweet spot of these plays, but also in a contiguous position. and then, as you can see from the last few announcements, dorado, the powder river basin and the wolfcamp m and third bone spring, we like to have a handful of wells tested, not only testing the geologic concepts and the producibility of the play but also just testing the repeatability on it.
and so those things are different from each of these plays, each of the rock types, giving us the confidence and the transparency to start talking about those publicly. as bill said, and you highlighted, we are leasing and testing across multiple plays this year. we're very excited about the potential that they'll dramatically increase the quality of the already-robust inventory that we have. and as we shifted from premium in 2016 to focus on double premium this year, we really think these exploration plays have the potential to deliver another significant step-change for eog's performance in the future.
and we're -- last thing i'd highlight is we are doing this at a time when much of the industry has really pulled back on any new exploration at all. and that leaves us in kind of a countercyclic opportunity here where we are excited that we've been able to put together these prospects and get them drilled and tested and provide a little additional color for you, guys, when we have the information.
leo mariani -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
that's great color, for sure. i really appreciate that. just for my follow-up question, i just wanted to ask a little bit about kind of production cadence here on the oil side in 2021. obviously, the goal is to kind of keep things roughly flat with the 4q '20 levels of 442,000.
you're kind of, obviously, starting at a lower point in 1q because of a lot of the storm downtime. does that imply that we're gonna see a bit of a gradual ramp on those volumes to kind of get to the average as we work our way into midyear and second-half '21 for the u.s. oil volumes?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. billy, would you?
billy helms -- chief operating officer
sure, leo, no, the production each quarter will be about the same, targeting around that 440,000 barrels a day, which really was our target here in the first quarter. obviously, the storm affected basically a one week of production, and that came largely in the delaware basin and eagle ford areas. all that production is back on now. and that downtime is gonna result in about a 4% decrease in the first-quarter production.
and we've stated we've not -- we are not gonna grow production in an oversupplied market. so basically, once we kind of get this production -- now that the production is back on, we'll maintain this rate at around the 440,000 barrels a day in each of the remaining three quarters.
operator
and our next question will come from neal dingmann with truist securities. please go ahead.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
morning, guys. bill, just a quick or easy question for you, or tim, just wondering about hedging these days, your thoughts. you did pretty well with it in '20, when you had some on, you took off, realized the gains on that. so i'm just wondering, with the improvement we've seen in oil prices here, although we're in kind of, obviously, steep backwardization, how are you all thinking about that?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. neal, we remain opportunistic on our hedging. obviously, the price has moved up very dramatically here in the first quarter of the year, faster than really we had thought. we added a few hedges there at the beginning of the year, just to lock in above 50 and 55.
but we're currently watching the market and watching it move up, and we'll be opportunistic and add hedges as we feel that they will be beneficial. and we have no hedges in natural gas at this time.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. and then, just you guys have been successful on your organic exploration you've talked about. i'm just kind of curious, with the plan this year, as you have -- i guess, my question is, do you have a set plan on sort of regardless what happens to either pricing or the success of these plays throughout this year and into the '22 what you would do activity and sort of spending-wise on that? is it pretty set? or is that -- could that still ebb and flow?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i'm gonna let ezra talk about that.
ezra yacob -- president
yes, neal, thanks for the question. we have kind of a base plan setup for our exploration, but what i would say is much of it's going to be dependent on what we see -- how we get these leases put together and what we see on the early results of these plays. so we remain fairly flexible on how quickly we think we could start to allocate capital to these. what i would say, just a little more color, is all of our domestic exploration plays, as we've highlighted in the past, are in areas of preexisting oil and gas operations.
so they're not frontier basins or anything like that. there is some form of infrastructure, albeit maybe legacy. and so we would be able to get these things kind of produced and up and moving once we have the results on the repeatability of the plays and have the acreage tied up.
operator
and our next question will come from brian singer with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
brian singer -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thank you, and good morning. my first question is a two-part question with regards to the decline rate impact from the shift to double-premium locations. what characterizes either the underlying geology or what you're doing in your completion techniques to achieve these lower decline rates? or is it just a shift away from the eagle ford? and then, if this represents a new capital-efficient shift for the company, why would it not push down maintenance capital below the $3.4 billion?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. billy, will you wanna talk about that?
billy helms -- chief operating officer
sure, brian, good morning. so as far as the decline rate shift, that's coming mostly from focusing our areas on better rock, to be honest, that as we mature the eagle ford play, as we mentioned earlier, and more of our capital is going toward the delaware basin and even the powder river basin, in general, those are plays that had essentially better rock and capability of a lower decline. so that's a large part of that. and then, on the new -- with the shift in the capital efficiency and the maintenance capital, i would remind you, the $3.4 billion, when we set that, i guess, a year or so ago, that was at a production rate of about 420,000 barrels a day.
and that was also pre-dorado. so we are maintaining the $3.4 billion at a higher oil production rate of 440,000 barrels a day, and we've also added in the capital on dorado because that is part of our announced plays going forward.
brian singer -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thanks. and my follow-up actually does involve dorado because you mentioned that a couple of times in your prepared remarks as a potential global energy solution. and i wonder how you monetize that.
is there an lng contract or partnership with a global player? or are you taking a more bullish view on medium- or longer-term u.s. natural gas prices?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. brian, i'm gonna ask lance to talk about the lng potential for dorado.
lance terveen -- senior vice president, marketing
hey, brian, good morning. this is lance. yeah, i mean, i think as we've talked about in the past, that's what makes it so exciting about the dorado play. it's just -- when you think about the proximity to the market, i mean, we're so close to the proximity to both -- all our domestic customers, but then also the lng markets as well.
so i think the biggest thing, again, is just the proximity. it's the location. it all -- it's very complementary with what we've done in the past in a lot of our plays, moving gas downstream to, obviously, try to capture the highest prices. so we'll just continue to stay very opportunistic there, but the big thing i want to focus on is just the proximity and what's in place today.
operator
and our next question will come from doug leggate with bank of america. please go ahead.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning, it's doug leggate, actually, from bank of america. i'm afraid that i'm just going to focus on one issue, bill, and you have to forgive me, it's on the growth plan post 2021. and i want to kind of just set this up a little bit. and then, my question really is why 8%, 10% is the right number and how you define a balanced market? now i know i've gone through some of this before, but i just want to set it up here a little bit.
basically, just about everybody has dropped their breakeven price. and i think saudi would argue that their optimal production rate is a lot higher than where it is today. so when you talk about an optimal plan, you talk about a $53 average oil price in the last four years, but we know that saudi was subsidizing that. so i'm back to the same question i had a number of years ago, which is why when you represent 0.5% of global supply, it's ok to grow at 10% or 5% of global demand because that puts you back to being part of the problem? hopefully, you see where i'm going with this because if everyone else said the same thing.
the u.s. is 500,000 to 1 million barrels a day. and your price war comment, my last comment, i want to just offer a little different perspective on that. saudi put 2 million barrels of a day on the market in april, put it on a ship and sent it to the u.s.
that was a price war. it wasn't a russia price war. it's an e&p u.s. subsidized growth price war.
and so my question for you is, why is 10% ok? how do you define a balanced market? and will you revisit this at some point in the future because it puts us back in the same place you were a few years ago?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, doug, yeah, thank you for the question. it's -- first of all, we've been really clear. we're not gonna push oil in an oversupplied market. we're very, very cognizant of the fragile recovery that we're in, and it's important that we don't put any more pressure on that and allow the market to recover.
and we are going to watch that the rest of this year. obviously, we're not gonna -- we've made a commitment. we're not going to be increasing production this year, and we'll watch it next year before we set our plan. so we're not -- we are not interested in growing oil in an oversupplied market, period.
and when the market is right and we begin growth again, the reason that 8% to 10% is the right number because it really optimizes all the metrics in the company, returns and free cash flow potential over time. we got a great chart that we put together in slide no. 10, and it really shows that the operating efficiency, the operating cost, the earnings and cash flow per share growth, the return on capital employed, the three-year cumulative free cash flow and the long-term free cash flow, all are at an optimal level at an 8% to 10% growth rate. if we go slower, some of those are not optimal; they're worse.
if we grow faster than that, at the same thing, some of those are not optimal; they're worse. so the 8% to 10% really optimizes a balanced growth rate, a moderate growth rate, where the company can continue to get better very fast and optimize our returns, our earnings potential, our cash flow potential and our long-term free cash flow.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
maybe as a quick follow-up then, bill, on the same topic. so i understand the point about optimal, but optimal is because of what the strategy you decide to adopt. so for example, you don't need to spend $0.5 million or $1 billion on exploration. if you do, you could high grade.
you never rightsize the company with a slow growth rate. and you still describe taking 5% of global demand as moderate. so i guess, my question is, between 2017 and 2019, saudi have 2 million barrels a day held up to market before covid. is your definition of a balanced market that the lowest cost producer is still subsidizing the business by bringing back any production? because that, by definition, is subsidizing your business.
so optimal -- i'm just having a tough time understanding why you're not learning any lessons from growing nine times in 10 years with very little cumulative free cash flow, and your share price response, obviously, was terrible. so why is 5% global demand growth for a company with 0.5% global supply ok?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i think there's two elements that we look at really closely, obviously, to determine whether the market is relatively balanced or not. one of them is the inventories. we want to see them get down to the five-year average or lower and keep hitting lower.
then the other is spare capacity, worldwide spare capacity. so we're watching spare capacity, and as it's -- at the moment, it's still 10 million barrels a day, and we need to have some work. so we want to get spare capacity down in the world to kind of a historic normal level. and so we'll be watching both of those.
and we are very definitely committed to not overpressuring the market and working with the market we have to work with and staying disciplined and not trying to push oil or grow oil into an oversupplied market. we're making that commitment. we've always done that. we did it in 2015 and 2016.
we didn't grow. we, obviously, shut in production last year, and we're staying -- we're maintaining that exit rate this year. so we're very disciplined and we're very cognizant of that. beyond that, when the market is available, we want to run a company to generate the highest total return for the shareholder value.
that is our job. we want to generate value, business value, really core business value. and that's what we're about, and that's what we're going to stay focused on.
operator
and our next question will come from charles meade with johnson rice. please go ahead.
charles meade -- johnson rice -- analyst
good morning, bill, to you and whole team there. i wanted to ask a question about your double-premium inventory and really the rate of change there. if you took that definition of double premium and applied that to your '19 program and your '20 program, what percentage of that '19 program or '20 program would have fit -- would have qualified for that double-premium bucket? and what's it gonna be in '21?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, charles, yeah, the double premium, we've been building more double premium every year as we get our cost down and improve our well productivity. last year, it was about 50%. in 2019, it was less than that. so last year, it was about 50%.
and this year, our goal is to get it up to 75%, maybe even higher percent as that. and then, next year, it will even be higher than that. so we're focused on improving the wells, not only with the cost, but there's a slide, slide no. 7, i think it is.
it shows that these double-premium wells are much, much more productive. in fact, over the first two years, they cumed 39% more oil than the wells we've been drilling in the last several years. so they're better wells. obviously, we're lowering our costs at the same time.
and i think that's really a differentiator for eog. as the industry data shows, most of the industry well productivity is flattening out. where at eog, the well productivity is continuing to increase. so we're not through.
we're gonna get better every year. we figure out how to target better rock. our completion technology continues to increase. obviously, our well costs are going down significantly.
and all that is sustainable. and that's on really the eog culture and our methodology of not really getting into a maintenance mode and just doing routine every well the same. we are in the learning process. we gather tremendous amount of data and technology.
we're learning the geologies. we drill the wells. we're learning the pay quality. and we're figuring out just continuously on a real-time basis how to get better in every aspect of the company.
and so we're excited about our future and continuing to increase returns and capital efficiency and free cash flow potential as we go forward.
charles meade -- johnson rice -- analyst
thank you, bill, that's helpful insight into your thinking process. and perhaps, picking up that one thread on better rock, am i interpreting that the right way that -- is that essentially the shift from these -- the resource shale plays more toward these combo-clastic kind of plays? and is that a -- is that just kind of a coincidence? or is that more of a fundamental arrow for you guys?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, it's not a coincidence. i'm gonna let ezra talk about that.
ezra yacob -- president
yeah. charles, thanks. that's perfect. you kind of hit the nail on the head.
as you move away from these, the actual true shale plays themselves are some of the tightest rock. and so as we've moved into not only different basins and different formations but especially targeting the specific landing zones. as we've developed some of our petrophysical, some of our geologic models to really understand the specific landing zones in rocks like the austin chalk per se, you fundamentally have higher porosity and permeability, just better all around rock quality that adds to not only the returns but also, as bill was highlighting, to the shallower decline profile.
operator
and our next question will come from paul cheng with scotiabank. please go ahead.
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
thank you. good morning, guys. two questions, please. last year, you signed a gas supply agreement.
that seems to be well timed, given the sharp rise in the jkm prices. can you tell us that what is that volume for this year? and how quickly you would ramp to 440 million cubic feet per day? how many years that we get there? and also that since it's linked to both jkm and henry hub, can you tell us that what percent is on jkm and what percent is in henry hub? that's the first question. second question, i think this is probably for bill. some of your competitors have decided to formalize the excess cash return framework that once that they have excess free cash after capex and paid dividend, they will pay that out.
just curious that why from eog standpoint, you don't think that will be a maybe workable program for you because i think the market would love cash return, but that they also love transparency and sort of understanding that under what circumstances they can get what. so just curious that, why that we do not believe that will fit into the eog model? thank you.
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, paul, i'm gonna to ask lance to talk about the jkm.
lance terveen -- senior vice president, marketing
hey, paul, good morning. this is lance. how are you?
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
very good. thank you.
lance terveen -- senior vice president, marketing
hey, yeah, thanks for your question, especially related to lng. yeah, i'd say it was fairly bearish last year, right, related to jkm and just global lng pricing with the warm weather and, obviously, the oversupply. and things have changed, haven't they, quite drastically to where, on a go forward, it looks very constructive, definitely, as you look at global prices. so yes, just as a reminder there, paul, we've got 140 million a day that goes into that agreement that we have with cheniere.
like you said, we're excited for the benefit there that we've seen, especially in a go forward. we kind of had that view going into before and finalizing our agreement. we're definitely constructive kind of long-term related to global prices. and obviously, having exposure to jkm and being very correlated with oil too and having the upside, that's where we kind of wanted to be positioned from an lng pricing standpoint.
so yes, we've been very pleased here in the first quarter with that pricing and constructive from a long-term standpoint as well. and yes, your second question was -- there was just kind of how it ramps up, and you're right. it's the 140 million is the jkm, and there's an additional 300 million that will be tied to henry hub.
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
and for the jkm link, is that a one to one or that does affect us?
lance terveen -- senior vice president, marketing
paul, could you ask that one more time, please, sir?
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
for the link to the jkm, is it a direct price you get the jkm? or you say factors? is there an s-curve or anything like that?
lance terveen -- senior vice president, marketing
you know it's -- i'm not gonna go into the specifics contractually, but it's very familiar from what you've heard from cheniere as well in their ipo model. and so that's how we've structured that.
operator
and this will conclude our question-and-answer session. i'd like to turn the conference back over to bill thomas for any closing remarks.
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
2020 was a year with many challenges, and i'm so very proud of the employees of eog. they responded with an exceptional performance in an exceptional year. we entered 2021 and this next up-cycle with lower cost and more potential than ever in the history of the company. our organization and culture are focused on improving returns, playing a significant role in the future of energy and delivering substantial long-term shareholder value.
so thanks for listening, and thanks for your support.

good day, and welcome to the eog resources fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note that this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to tim driggers, chief financial officer. please go ahead, sir.
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
good morning, and thanks for joining us. we hope everyone has seen the press release announcing fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 earnings and operational results. this conference call includes forward-looking statements. the risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and eog's sec filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call.
this conference call also contains certain non-gaap financial measures. definitions, as well as reconciliation schedules for these non-gaap measures to comparable gaap measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. some of the reserve estimates on this conference call or in the accompanying investor presentation slides may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the sec's reserve reporting guidelines. we incorporate by reference the cautionary note to u.s.
investors that appears at the bottom of our earnings release issued yesterday. participating on the call this morning are: bill thomas, chairman and ceo; billy helms, chief operating officer; ezra yacob, president; ken boedeker, evp, exploration and production; lance terveen, senior vp marketing; and david streit, vp, investor and public relations. here's bill thomas. 
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, tim, and good morning, everyone. last year was historic, and we were tested like never before. in a challenging environment, i am proud to say our eog employees who personify our unique culture responded exceptionally without a beat. i'd like to thank our employees for delivering such outstanding performance.
we generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow, earned adjusted net income of $850 million and ended the year with $3.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. we increased our sustainable dividend rate by 30% and shored up what was already an industry-leading balance sheet to a low 11% net debt-to-cap ratio. we lowered our finding and development cost, improved our capital efficiency and earned a direct after-tax rate of return of more than 50%, with an all-in after-tax rate of return of 25% based on our premium price deck of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. such extraordinary results in a $39 oil price environment were made possible by our shift five years ago to our premium strategy, which established an investment hurdle rate of 30% direct after-tax rate of return using flat $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas prices.
using such a stringent hurdle rate shields the company from cyclic oil and gas prices. 2020 was a true test of that shield, and that is a testament to the power of our premium strategy. beyond delivering stellar financial results last year, we continued to invest in long-term value of the company. through our low-cost organic efforts, we added 1,500 net premium locations to our inventory, including 1,250 from the newest addition to our portfolio, dorado, a south texas natural gas play with 21 tcf of net resource potential at a breakeven price of less than $1.25 per mcf.
we believe dorado is one of the lowest cost and lowest emissions natural gas fields in the u.s. and expands eog's portfolio of assets that we believe will play a significant role in the long-term global energy solution. we also completed two pilots of infield technology to reduce emissions, a hybrid solar and natural gas-powered compressor station that reduces combustion emissions and a closed-loop gas capture system to reduce force flaring as a result of downstream market interruptions. reducing flaring is an industrywide priority, and we plan to publish our closed-loop gas capture technology for others to replicate.
we entered the next phase of the cycle a much improved company. with the countless, creative and innovative ideas we implemented in 2020, we're in the process of making significant improvements to eog's future performance. looking forward, the following six steps summarize the foundation for our 2021 plan and outlook for the next three years. number one, maintain fourth-quarter 2020 production.
there is no reason to consider growth until the market rebalances. signs of an earlier recovery will not change our $3.9 billion 2021 capital plan. number two, shift to a double-premium drilling program. our focus on increasing returns never waivers, and this year is no exception.
we're raising the investment standard again. double-premium wells earn 60% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas and make up the top half of our 23-year drilling inventory. shifting to double premium will make another step-change in our future performance by delivering higher returns, lower decline rates and more free cash flow potential. we have more than 10 years of double-premium inventory and are optimistic we will replace double-premium locations faster than we drill them.
number three, accelerate new exploration projects. last year, our exploration program focused on technical evaluations across numerous new prospects. we're excited to resume a more robust leasing and testing effort this year. we're evaluating a large number of double-premium oil plays in the u.s.
and internationally with the potential to deliver low finding costs and development costs and low production decline rates. the focus of our exploration program is to continue to improve the quality of our inventory and eog's total shareholder value. number four, raise the bar again on our esg performance and ambitions. after achieving significant improvements in safety, emissions and water performance in 2020, we have announced our ambition to reach net zero scope 1 and scope 2 ghg emissions by 2040.
as one of the steps along the way, we expect to eliminate routine flaring by 2025. we believe this is possible using creative applications of current and future technology. we're currently implementing internally developed technology with a goal of measuring granular real-time emissions data for all facilities in the company. this will encourage innovation and development of unique solutions to achieve our net zero ambition.
number five, resume moderate production growth only when the market is balanced. assuming a balanced market by year-end, we are positioned to grow oil 8% to 10% in 2022 and 2023. we forecast that our shifting well mix toward double premium will lower our base decline rate to less than 25% within five years from 34% last year. this optimal growth rate delivers the most long-term total value by delivering higher returns, lower decline rates and more free cash flow over the long term.
and number six, generate significant free cash flow. all cash allocation decisions are focused on enhancing total long-term shareholder value. our top priorities for free cash flow are to sustainably grow the dividend and reduce debt. beyond these priorities, when excess cash materializes, we will evaluate other options opportunistically, such as supplemental dividends, share repurchases and low-cost property additions.
with our deep inventory of double-premium locations, moderating decline rates and sustainable cost reductions, eog's free cash flow potential is improving significantly. before i turn it over to billy, i want to address our thoughts on federal acreage. from the statements made by the current administration, we believe that our current existing federal leases and corresponding federal drilling inventory can be fully developed. eog is well prepared to manage through any regulatory changes that could impact the pace of development on federal acreage.
the combination of our large number of federal permits in hand, our flexibility to pivot within our deep inventory of double-premium locations and our ability to add new inventory through organic exploration gives us the confidence that the future performance of the company will not be affected. now here's billy.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
thanks, bill. let me start by expressing my warmest appreciation to all of our employees. i am truly amazed by their talent, commitment and resiliency as demonstrated by the dramatic improvements achieved in 2020. within weeks of publishing our initial 2020 capital plan, we quickly cut capital by scaling back activity by nearly half.
to protect the company's financial strength, our employees responded with urgency and purpose, finding new ways to sustainably reduce our well cost structure further. what stands out the most to me is how the eog culture of innovation and multidisciplinary collaboration and teamwork increased at a time when everyone was working remotely to protect themselves, their families and their communities. the results of that innovation and teamwork can be seen clearly in our 2020 operational performance. we significantly improved our capital efficiency by reducing total well cost 15% and per unit cash operating cost 4%.
with respect to our year-end reserves and excluding the low impact of low commodity prices, we reduced finding and development costs 15% to a low of $6.98 per barrel of oil equivalent and replaced nearly 160% of our 2020 production. the speed with which we spread technical innovations directed at lowering cost and improving well performance throughout the company has increased. we believe the communication challenge presented by remote work and the teamwork required between individual operational areas to execute our significantly revised plan last year inspired what we believe will be a permanent improvement in how we integrate new learnings and innovations companywide. our operational execution fired on all cylinders during 2020, reaching our stretch goal to reduce well costs 15% last year with about three-quarters of that coming from sustainable efficiency improvements.
we expect to maintain this momentum and reduce well cost another 5% this year. we also expect to carry sustainable operating cost reductions into 2021. our reductions to loe during 2020 remarkably outpaced the volume reductions and shut-in production as a result of exceptionally low commodity pricing. we reduced loe 22% on a total-dollar basis versus 8% decline in production volumes.
shutting in volumes afforded us the opportunity to take a closer look at our maintenance and workover programs and streamline our lease upkeep practices, resulting in sustainable cost reductions. we finished the year with fourth-quarter oil production at a little over 440,000 barrels of oil per day and having spent $3.5 billion of capital, exactly what we forecasted back in may when we revised our plan in response to the downturn in oil prices. we increased our rig count from a low of five rigs last summer and are now running about 24 rigs to support a 2021 program that will maintain essentially flat oil volumes. the rig count is currently at the high point, and it will drift down throughout the year to an average of about 22 rigs.
looking back to when we introduced the premium strategy in 2016, our per unit cash operating costs have declined by 18%, and our per foot well costs are down about 40%. this operational excellence has enabled eog to raise the bar further and target double premium as our new investment standard. with such significant progress the past five years and the momentum we are carrying, i'm convinced we are only just getting started at being one of the lowest-cost energy suppliers. we also made significant strides in our esg performance in 2020.
first, on the safety side, our total recordable incident rate, the primary safety metric, improved more than 25%. safety is always our first priority, and we continue to focus on ways to enhance our safety culture even further. on the environmental side, we increased the percent of reused water used in our operation to about 45% of our supply and significantly reduced total barrels of freshwater used. and we increased our already-strong wellhead gas capture rate from 98.8% in 2019 to an astounding 99.6% in 2020.
our ambitions for the future are a reflection of that performance. we have set a goal to raise the wellhead gas capture rate to 99.8% in 2021 and achieve zero routine flaring by 2025. we're literally fighting for the last remaining 0.1 percentage point now. longer term, we have set an ambition to be net zero in scope 1 and scope 2 ghg emissions by 2040.
ultimately, it is our highly creative and passionate employees that gives me confidence in this aspiration. in the past five years, we have achieved a number of technical innovations and operational advancements that have enabled us to generate significant reductions in methane and overall ghg intensity rates to date. our approach to emissions reductions remains operationally focused, investing with returns in mind and seeking achievable and scalable results. our investments in projects such as closed-loop gas capture and solar-powered compression pay off in two ways: they lower emissions and function as learning mechanisms for future innovation.
we know that to be part of the long-term energy solution, we not only have to be low cost; we have to do it with one of the lowest environmental footprints. our newly formed sustainable power group is working to identify low emissions power generation solutions and accelerate innovations to support our missions, goals and ambitions. i'm excited about all the innovation occurring in the company, and that gives me confidence we can achieve our goals and ambitions. finally, i want to take a minute to express my sincere gratitude for the tireless efforts of our production and marketing teams in the wake of the severe winter weather event last week.
the teams worked in difficult conditions without any safety incidents to manage the production interruptions caused by extensive freezing weather and delivered as much critical production to our downstream customers as possible. all of our production is now back online, and we expect our average daily production in the first quarter to be reduced by about 4%. beginning with the onset of the storm, the production staff also worked in close coordination with our marketing team who communicated with our downstream customers to redirect natural gas production in texas to local distribution companies that deliver natural gas to heat homes and to utilities for electric power generation. these efforts supported by critical -- these efforts supported critical human needs throughout the dallas, fort worth, san antonio, austin, houston and other central and east texas communities.
further, in line with our core values at eog, we sold these redirected gas shipments at prices consistent with those received prior to the winter weather event rather than high and volatile daily spot prices. through it all, the eog culture of interdisciplinary teamwork and nonbureaucratic decision-making, technology leadership and commitment to do the right thing shone through, and i couldn't be more proud of everyone involved. here's ezra for an update on our exploration efforts.
ezra yacob -- president
thanks, billy. our organic exploration focus has always been the driver behind successfully replacing what we drill every year with better inventory. our current effort is built around adding plays with shallower decline rates that also meet our double-premium hurdle rate, ultimately offering higher capital efficiency than our existing inventory. dorado, the south texas natural gas play we announced late last year, is the most recent example of eog creating shareholder value through low-cost organic exploration.
early entry and capture of a high-quality reservoir across a contiguous acreage position with access to low-cost services and proximity to multiple markets is the recipe for a high-return investment opportunity and is exactly the type of prospect we're looking for. our strong financial position, combined with our proprietary database of unconventional plays, has positioned us to capitalize countercyclically and capture exploration opportunities with little to no competition. we are focused on oil, and we are in the process of drilling and testing high-potential prospects. we are optimistic we can prove up a number of them and capture additional acreage at competitive pricing that will further improve the quality of what we believe is already one of the best portfolios of assets in the industry.
our vision is to develop double-premium oil plays in each operating area, including international. this is highly efficient and allows us to allocate capital across a wide array of plays to optimize returns and capital efficiency. this decentralized multi-basin approach is a hallmark of eog, one that leverages our competitive advantages in exploration, technology and low-cost operations, all benefiting from knowledge transfer between the basins. the results, if we are successful, will flow through our financials with higher return on capital employed, lower operating costs, higher capital efficiency, shallower declines and even more free cash flow.
when we look back at this time several years from now, i'm confident we will recognize 2021 as a step-change in eog's performance and financial profile, much like we look back on our shift to premium drilling in 2016. here's tim to review our financial position.
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
thanks, ezra. eog's financial performance in 2020 demonstrates the resiliency of our business model and portfolio of high-return assets. in response to the lower oil prices caused by the price war and pandemic, we elected to utilize our operational flexibility to quickly cut activity. levered by the sustainable cost deductions that billy discussed, we reduced capex in 2020 by 44% to $3.5 billion.
the result was $1.6 billion of free cash flow, a great performance in what we certainly hope will prove to be the bottom of the cycle year. the board of directors voted to increase the dividend by 10% to an annual rate of $1.65 per share. eog's dividend has grown at a compounded annual rate of 20% over the last 21 years. this reflects the continued improvement in the profitability and cost structure of the company and our confidence in eog's long-term resiliency.
i'm pleased to say we have never cut the dividend and never issued equity to support it. we analyze numerous stress down-cycle scenarios to evaluate the size of the dividend and to ensure it can be sustained over the long run. the regular dividend represents our first priority for returning cash -- free cash flow to shareholders. beyond that, we have set a target to reduce debt outstanding by $2 billion from the level at the end of last year.
we have made a down payment on that goal, paying off with cash on hand a $750 million bond that matured in february 1. there are no additional debt maturities until 2023 when a $1.25 billion bond is scheduled to mature. beyond that, we have no plans to further reduce debt. our goal is to maintain about $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet on average through cycles.
this is not a hard-and-fast rule. the actual amount of cash on the balance sheet at the end of each quarter will vary depending on business conditions at the time, but this should give you some rough idea of what to expect going forward. eog is firmly committed to generating significant free cash flow. our top priorities for free cash flow remain -- is to remain sustainable dividend growth and debt reduction.
as cash materializes and we have more visibility into the future, we will opportunistically consider other options, such as a supplemental dividend during the up-cycles or share repurchases during market lows, along with low-cost property additions with potential to improve eog's performance. now let me turn the call back to bill.
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, tim. in conclusion, i would like to note the following important takeaways. first, due to market conditions, eog will not accelerate production in 2021. second, after this year, once the market rebalances, developing our current drilling inventory at a moderate growth rate of 8% to 10% optimizes returns and free cash flow potential over time.
third, our shift to double-premium investment metrics paves the way for another step-change in eog's returns and future performance. fourth, our domestic and international exploration portfolio is stronger in both quality and quantity than it's ever been. this year, we are accelerating the testing and leasing efforts on many of those prospects that have the potential to significantly enhance total shareholder value of the company. our exploration projects have the potential for higher returns, lower costs and lower decline rates than our current inventory.
and finally, we are passionate and excited about the innovation and technology that continues to manifest itself in eog. it gives us confidence that we will continue to lower well costs and operating costs and reduce our environmental footprint. our goal for eog is to be one of the lowest-cost, highest-return and lowest-emissions producers playing a significant role in the long-term future of energy. thanks for listening.
now we'll go to q&a.

thank you. the question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [operator instructions] questions are limited to one question and one follow-up question. we will take as many questions as time permits.
[operator instructions] and the first question comes from scott gruber of citigroup. please go ahead.
scott gruber -- citi -- analyst
yes, good morning.
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
hello, scott.
scott gruber -- citi -- analyst
so, the most common question we receive i know you touched on it a bit in the prepared remarks which is the framework, you know, that you guys use to determine that -- the $1 special dividend was the right amount, now is the right time, can you just elaborate on that a little bit more, you know, around the framework and the timing? you know, obviously, folks are trying to get a sense of whether the special dividend can repeat in the future.
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, scott. you know, certainly, we're demonstrating our commitment to our shareholders by returning a significant amount of cars back to them. and as you know, the $1 per share, you know, i think is a very significant number and large enough to be very meaningful. and i'm going to ask tim to kind of go through, you know, some of the -- some of the numbers to give you a little bit of the background on the reason that we picked this number.
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
thanks, bill. so, going back to our priorities over time, it's consistent within our priorities. if you look back, our regular dividend has increased 146% since 2017. that's one of our highest priorities.
we reduced that by $2.1 billion. so, that set us up to be in a position to now return more cash to the shareholders. when you look at our cash position, we were sitting at $3.4 billion of cash. so, returning $600 million at this point in time as bill pointed out is a significant amount and it follows through on our long herd -- long-held plan to return cash to the shareholders.
so, it's simply following through on what we've been committed to for a long time.
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
you know, i want to add, scott, you know, going forward, you know, our free cash flow priorities and framework haven't changed. and so, you have to put that special dividend in context with our total framework. and just a reminder, we've already said this but our first priority is sustainable dividend growth. we believe that a regular dividend is absolutely the best way to give cash back to shareholders and we certainly are working on that, and have worked to get a great history of doing that.
and then the next one is debt reduction and we've got a little work left to do with that as tim noted in his opening remarks. our next options are the special dividend. and certainly, in favorable times like we have right now, those are the things that we are doing. and then we'll -- also, we want to keep in mind, you know, the potential for opportunistic share repurchases in downturns, counter-cyclic opportunities in share repurchases.
and then after that, you know, we also want to be able to consider high-return, bolt-on acquisitions. and these are acquisitions that go in our best operating areas, obviously, where we've got a lot of synergy and a lot of ability to move quickly and drill wells. and some of them could be in our new exploration plays where we can capture a very high-potential acreage at a very low cost. and so, we'll just continue to evaluate all these options and work with this framework, and we'll evaluate the best use of cash on a quarter-on-quarter basis.
we're in a dynamic business environment all the time, so it's important to have the flexibility to use the cash in a way that creates the most shareholder value.
scott gruber -- citi -- analyst
got it. and then my follow-up relates to the growth strategy in '22 and beyond. you know, if the oil markets have healed next year and you guys have been very explicit around the fact that you're looking at, and you laid out the 8% to 10% growth cadence on your last call, but there seems to be some discussion around -- now around, you know, the potential for a middle ground if you will. maybe some growth cadence below that 8% to 10%.
so, i just want to hear your latest thoughts around 2022, you know, if the oil markets have healed and it's time to grow again, what is the right growth cadence? you know, what factors are you looking at to determine that rate of growth if the markets have healed. you know, and is there a middle ground, you know, somewhere between 0% and 8% to 10%, or is it just, you know, if it's time to grow, we're going to grow at 8% to 10%?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, scott, for that question. we want to make sure we're really clear on that and i think we have. you know, we're not going to grow until, you know, demand is recovered to pre-covid levels, which is -- it's on the way to do that.
i think everybody can see that. and we want to make sure that obviously, world inventories, u.s. inventories are below the five-year average. and then we're looking for spare capacity to be certainly a lot lower than it is right now.
and that just means, you know, not a lot of oil shut in to you -- to mass supply and demand. and every year, the market factors, you know, that year -- going into that year will determine our plans. and so, we want to be flexible and we want to be able to, and we will modify our growth plans to fit those market conditions. if we need to grow at a lower rate or no growth at all like we're doing this year, you know, whatever that right growth plan is, whatever fits the market conditions, that's what we want to do.
above all everything else, we are committed to staying very disciplined and not forcing oil into a market that's not ready.
scott gruber -- citi -- analyst
got it. thank you. appreciate the color.

the next question comes from arun jayaram of j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
arun jayaram -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. i guess my first question is kind of the dovetail on the special dividend talk. you know, bill, this year, you've guided to $3.4 billion in free cash flow, you know, $1.5 billion for dividends, another $750 million for the debt you've already paid down. so, that leaves a little bit more than $1.1 billion of free cash flow and i know you're above your, you know, minimal cash targets.
so, i guess the question is how are you gauging, you know, the market for bolt-ons versus, you know, potentially if the oil price, you know, holds up here in terms of -- in looking at -- in more cash return this year?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, arun. you know, we take the -- we evaluate, you know, where we are every quarter. you know, i can't give you any specific on anything, but we evaluate where we are every quarter and we're constantly looking at bolt-on potential and evaluating that.
so, we want to make sure we leave room to fully consider that, something that would make a very significant difference in the future of the company upgrade. you know, our, you know, our high-quality premium, double premium inventory. we want to do that. so, you know, we're very fortunate and we've got a lot of cash, and we've got a lot of hopefully, we believe a lot of cash coming.
so, that's a lot of great opportunities for us to consider, you know, additional special dividends, bolt-on acquisitions, etc. and we keep in mind, you know, as tim talked about, we want to keep in mind our debt reduction targets in a year and then -- excuse me, in 2023, and also be able to, you know, continue to think about growing our regular dividend. so, we'll just keep all those in the proper framework and, you know, you just need to know that we're committed to doing the right thing at the right time for the shareholders, you know, to maximize total shareholder value.
arun jayaram -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. and my follow-up, bill, you cited this as being, you know, the company's, you know, best free cash flow quarter in history. but i want to see if you could provide a little bit more detail on how the unique pricing conditions for natural gas given winter storm uri, some of your leverage to jk, and how that contributed to the free cash flow, you know, how would you call that out? i know there's some incremental costs, but what was the puts and take on on the gas price this quarter?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'm going to ask tim to give some details on that. but just to -- before i turn it over to tim, you need -- everybody needs to know that the special dividend has nothing to do with the storm and the natural gas process. so, tim, do you want to give some detail.
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
sure. when you boil everything down, the effects of uri was about $40 million to cash flow and net income in the quarter. obviously, there are big components in there but that's the bottom line. it was very immaterial to our cash flow or net income.
arun jayaram -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. great. thanks a lot.

the next question comes from scott hanold of rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
scott hanold -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks. first and foremost, i want to, you know, i appreciate your very direct commentary on your desire not to grow and, you know, what the plan is. so, hopefully, that does clear the air a bit. you know, what i'm wondering is strategically, if we do stay in sort of the current environment, you know, whether it's '22 or even beyond, you all do build a lot of free cash flow.
i mean, you know, we're talking with something, you know, around $3 billion even after your base dividend annually. do you all see if there is a benefit into setting up a more predictable return to cash -- cash return to shareholders, you know, like some of the -- your other peers did? do you think there's a benefit to that predictability or would you rather see that more opportunistic?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, scott, you know, we -- we're always in a very dynamic business environment. so, it's important, you know, we believe to have the flexibility to use the cash in a way that creates the most shareholder value. you know, we're -- the -- one of the reasons we don't -- the biggest reason we don't want to get into a strict formula because we don't want to be put in a position to where we're growing oil say at 5% when the market clearly does not need more oil. so, we want to be in a position where we can do the right thing at the right time, and to maximize the use of the cash in our plan to maximize shareholder value.
scott hanold -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. thank you for that. and my next question, maybe this one's for ezra. you know, you all talked about, you know, shifting to double premium that's generated know significant increases to eurs, and page 8 shows just a massive uptick.
do you all have any color on, you know, how much of that is organic versus mix shift? i would assume the shift to relatively more permian has, you know, relative to say eagle ford has buys that upward. but do you have a sense on, you know, how much is mix shift versus organic?
ezra yacob -- president
yes, scott. thanks for the question this is ezra. yeah, definitely in the permian we have a higher percentage of those 5,700 double-premium locations are located in the permian. but part of that is simply just because we have so many targets captured there in the delaware basin.
what i would say is we have a fairly wide variety and fairly distributed variety of double-premium wells across our entire portfolio, including the eagle ford, the recently announced austin chalk dorado play, and the powder river basin as well.
operator
the next question comes from doug leggate of bank of america. please go ahead.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everyone. i apologize i was just taking you off my headset. bill or ezra, i wonder if i could press on scott's point.
i'm afraid i'm not quite where scott says in thinking this draws a line under the growth story. so, my question is really simple. you currently have one of the lowest free cash flow yields in the sector or arguably a reflection of your share price. but my point is that everyone has got the capacity to spend more money.
what happens to your 10% return at $50 oil if the whole industry follows your lead and goes back to a 10% growth rate?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, doug, i want to make it really clear. we're not stuck on 10% growth rate or 8% growth rate. we are totally focused on making sure we do the right thing at the right time. so, we -- the oil price does not guide how much we're going to grow, it's the market fundamentals.
and so, we're really focused on that. we've laid out, i think, a strong set of fundamentals that we're focused on and we will adjust our plan each year, which means our growth plan each year, to those market fundamentals. and maybe certainly, we -- next year, that we don't grow at all or we may grow at 4% or 5%. we'll just have to see what the market fundamentals show.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
that's actually a great answer, bill. it's not set in stone is going to of what i was really trying to get to. my follow-up is ezra, very quickly, 10 years of inventory, double premium at the current pace, if you do choose to grow back to growth, one assumes that 10 years shrink some. so, can you talk about the sustainability and how that plays into, again, the, you know, how you think about that activity level? and i'll leave it there.
thanks.
ezra yacob -- president
yes, doug. that's a good question. similarly, as we've done over the past few years, you know, we're consistently focused on getting better year after year. and so, by driving down well costs through sustainable well cost reductions, some of which billy spoke to in opening remarks, but also through applying technology and innovations to increase the well productivity gains.
we're able to convert some of our existing inventory every year into that double-premium metric. in addition to that, we have two other avenues, the first which bill has touched on is bolt-on new acreage acquisition opportunities in areas of pre-existing development. but then also our exploration effort. and as i talked about in the opening comments, you know, our exploration effort is really focused on, again, making another step-change to our current inventory.
it's focused on adding low-decline, high-impact plays that really increase the overall return profile of the company. and again, here, you know, regardless of any growth rate, when you're reinvesting in higher-return opportunities and adding lower-cost reserves to your company, you're really, you know, driving down the cost base of the company year after year. and that's essentially what translates into our corporate financials and allows us to lower that price required for a double-digit roce every year.
operator
the next question comes from neal dingmann of truist securities. please go ahead.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
good morning all. my -- guys, my first question is around how you look at your reinvestment rate. i'm just wondering number one, could you talk about sort of current strip, how you see the reinvestment. and, you know, again, let's assume another $5 or so higher, what would that do to that?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, neal. thanks for the question. we're going to ask billy to comment on that.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yeah. thanks, neal. i think, you know, for the reinvestment rate, we're always looking at, you know, as bill mentioned earlier, what's the market look like and what's the need for oil. and we're not certainly not going to grow into a market that doesn't need the oil as he pointed out, and just trying to make sure reemphasize that point.
and then in going forward each year, we'll do the same thing we always do. we'd kind of see where the market is and what the prices are, and what our opportunities are to develop our assets. and we balance that against the cash needs of the company. so, it's not really a straight formula, it's more about where the market is at that current time.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
i'm glad to hear that. i wish more others would say the same. and then just a follow-up, could you talk about, you know, i would call this question more on sort of your regional allocation process. i know, you know, bill, you talked about sort of the new hurdles, the premium new locations.
but i'm just wondering how does that factor in when, you know, you've got some exciting, you know, but not quite as developed areas like in the prb that i think have high potential. but if you're just strictly looking at maybe what they produce immediately, might not compete. so, i'm just wanted to how do you factor in some of those high-potential wells with this plan?
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yeah. neal, this is billy again. let me take a stab at that. so, as we look at all of our assets, that's the beauty of having a decentralized culture where we are focused on multiple plays across our portfolio.
you have plays that are in different phases of their lifecycle as you might think about it. as you just said, you know, like the eagle ford is a more mature play, it's had a growth for about 10 years, it's further down that maturity window than say the delaware basin. and then the powder river basin is certainly an early maturing or early growth-phase play. so, each one of those, we certainly go in with the idea of delineating the play first, putting in the infrastructure to drive down our cost over time, and then maximize returns.
so, each one of those have a different lifecycle that commands a different amount of investment. and overall though, the company is able to maintain a very steady pace of activity and future value creation through that -- the way we operate the company.
operator
the next question is from leo mariani of keybanc. please go ahead.
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
on spending here. so, we're noticing that just based on your guidance, your capex was ticking up, you know, out here in the second quarter. i just wondered what was sort of driving that. i wasn't sure kind of, you know, what was kind of causing that.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yeah, leo, this billy. so, the guidance on the capex, it's up a little bit in the second quarter relative to the first quarter is simply the timing of when wells are available to be completed. so, we'll have a little bit more completion activity in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter. that simply is.
i think in general, we'll have about 50% -- 52% of our capex spend in the first half, the remaining to be spent more ratably through the rest of the year. and the volumes will be really pretty much keeping with that 440,000 barrels a day per-quarter average the rest of the year. so, it's a -- we'll be maintaining 240,000 barrels a day each quarter going forward.
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok, that's helpful for sure. i just wanted to ask on the exploration plays. if i'm not wrong, i think you guys are certainly diverting more capital there, particularly to the drill bit in 2021 here. i just wanted to confirm, you guys kind of drilling out, you know, multiple plays, you know, at this point.
i think you did a little bit of that in the last couple of years as well. and as a result, you know, maybe you just can kind of speak to, you know, high level what your confidence is in being able to maybe, you know, prove some of these up in the next year?
ezra yacob -- president
yes, leo, this is ezra. i appreciate the question. yeah, on our exploration plays, you're right, we're -- we've allocated about $300 million to the exploration effort this year. over the last few years, we've done a little bit of drilling, those dominantly kind of leasing, putting some of the acreage together.
and then, of course, there was a pullback here in 2020 due to the reduction in capital allocation associated with the downturn in prices and covid. but this year, we are back to drilling multiple prospects. we're at a point where the prospects have started to move at different phases. i would say we're drilling exploration wells across some of the prospects, across others.
we're into more of what i'd call appraisal wells and we're feeling very confident with where we're at, the results that we're seeing, and we hope to be able to provide some results on that soon.
operator
the next question comes from jeanine wai of barclays. please go ahead.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone. thanks for taking our questions. maybe a question for ezra following up on the explorations.
you're in oman now and i believe we saw last month that you paid a nominal amount for an interest in the beehive oil prospect offshore australia. so, can you talk about what attracted you to australia? and do you still have interest in other international plays?
ezra yacob -- president
yes, jeanine. that's a great question. this is ezra. yeah, the opportunity there in australia, as you mentioned, it's on the north-west shelf, obviously, everyone knows a very prolific hydrocarbon region.
it's a shallow-water opportunity that we've stepped into there, as you mentioned, for a very low upfront cost. it's exposing us to a prospect that we think has the opportunity, the potential to be impactful to our company. it -- we're forecasting it has the potential to really compete with our domestic returns. and what we've -- the opportunity that we've -- we have here in australia is really an outgrowth of our experience in trinidad, where for nearly 20 years, we've been operating in the shallow waters offshore of trinidad.
and really, this is a geologic province and a type of play where industry has really moved away from. and so, we've found ourselves as kind of a niche operator and we've developed not only operational procedures but also some geologic techniques where we think we can come into some of these shallow-water prospects and make very, very good returns. the attractive thing about australia, again, is -- not only does it fit into our experience level from operations and a technical perspective, but it has many offtake and oilfield service availability there. and of course, the low cost to entry to, you know, an exciting amount of upside in the prospect.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
ok. interesting. we'll be looking forward to that. my second question and i apologize in advance for beating the horse again on this.
but on the special dividend, the perception in the market is simply that, you know, cash difference aren't consistent to formulate, you can't capitalize on evaluations, you don't get credit for it, etc. with that in mind, you mentioned that you evaluate the health of the business every quarter, probably more frequently than that. and specifically, when it comes to the special dividend, can you just clarify is it really a matter of just holding $2 billion minimum operating cash plus $800 million to $1.25 billion for the 2023 maturity, and then everything else kind of gets paid out in due time, and it kind of needs to be meaningful? i know you also mentioned a couple of times that having optionality for high-return bolt-ons is also one of the priorities. so, if you have any kind of commentary on what a comfortable placeholder for that would be, that would be really helpful.
thank you.
ezra yacob -- president
yeah, jeanine. you know, tim's given, you know, i think some answers for some of those on there. yeah, we want to keep ample cash on the balance sheet to run the business and that's around $2 billion. and then, you know, we have set aside or looking at plans for reducing the $1.25 billion bond in 2023.
so, that's all fits in and that's part of our, you know, evaluation of how we use the cash and when we use the cash. but really, the special dividend just fits into, you know, the framework that we've already laid out and our commitment to giving back cash to shareholders. so, you know, we will look at our cash position and look at bolt-on potential opportunities. they can truly be any size, you know, from a very small.
we've done in the past, you know, $20 million, $30 million deal, but they could certainly be bigger than that too. so, we'll take all that and work it into our framework, and evaluate where the company is, and in the outlook for the business. and, you know, our goal is to continue to return cash to shareholders through that framework.

the next question comes from charles meade of johnson rice. please go ahead.
charles meade -- johnson rice & company l.l.c. -- analyst
thanks. good morning, bill, to you, and your whole team there. i really just have one question and it goes back to the -- some of your prepared comments, bill, and more specifically, share repurchases. yeah, i recognize that that hasn't been your mo in the past and they kind of have a bad reputation maybe because usually share repurchases wind up being pro-cyclical.
in the way you talked about it, you said for you, you would look at it in an opportunistic way is the word i remember, and you said, in a downturn. and i guess my question is it's easy to see a downturn in retrospect, right? you know, six months ago, you guys had a three-handle on your stock. but it's hard to recognize when you're in it. so, is there any guidepost that you can share about how you would recognize when you're in one of those downturns and it's time to be opportunistic? or is it just one of the things, you know when you see it?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, charles. i think, you know, it goes right along with the supply demand and market fundamentals analysis that we do. you know, we can -- we've gotten more sophisticated, we've got a very sophisticated model now developed through our information technology and we're gaining a lot of confidence in it on being able to kind of be on top of the oil market and where it's headed and certainly, the oil price that's the biggest indicator. but we -- i think we'll be able to determine, you know, when is the right time, when is the opportunistic counter-cyclic kind of to maybe consider share buybacks.
and of course, now, you know, we have a lot of cash on the balance sheet and we want to continue to watch that and keep that. we will have an opportunity when we do have a downturn to have cash to do that if that happens.
charles meade -- johnson rice & company l.l.c. -- analyst

neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning, team, and congrats on a good quarter here. the first question is bill, any updates on permitting on federal lands and how that process has been to apply for four new permits? and in general in your conversations with washington, does it seem like some of the risks around the federal lands exposure in the delaware has diminished?
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yeah, neal. this is billy helms. so, on the permits -- the federal permits, certainly, we were very active in obtaining permits prior to the -- to administration change just to protect our activity levels. since this moratorium has been lifted, we are receiving a steady stream of permits.
the permit stream is coming very well. we're receiving permits in all of our areas too. so, i think the working relationships we've been able to maintain with the regulators is -- and working through the process with them has benefited us really well. so, we're not really seeing any restrictions there.
and i think the biden administration clearly has said that activity -- he wants to maintain activity on valid leases, so we're very comforted by the fact that we'll be able to continue then.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's great, guys. and the follow-up is just on the macro. you guys talked a little bit about the tools that you have to evaluate, the direction of oil price, and the way things are trending. be curious if you could unpack what you're seeing real-time and how you're thinking about the commodity price moving from here for both for oil and for natural gas.
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, neil. on oil, you know, as we already talked about, the fundamentals are definitely improving. the, you know, it's been a little bouncy on the covid recovery and oil demand but we're seeing very very steady improvements with -- i think we're up to maybe 95-million-barrel-a-day demand right now. we think, you know, maybe by the end of the year, that will get to pre-covid levels of somewhere around 100 million barrels a day.
we'll just have to watch it and see. the inventories are dropping and we think, you know, they'll be fairly consistent draws on inventory from here on out, especially during the summer pickup activity. and so, that's all looking really good. and then the, you know, the spare capacity, you know, is going fine.
it's been extended and drawn out a little bit farther than what it started out to be at the beginning of the year. but, you know, we believe again as demand picks up that that that spare capacity will be put back online, you know. but i want to give you, you know, our -- the data when everything's ok. we'll just have to watch and see it.
but certainly, everything is going in the right direction and i think the market, you know, as oil prices have responded to that, i think it's -- that what we're saying and seeing is not different than what the consensus view is. on natural gas, you know, we're mildly bullish. inventories are low and supply the is less and demand is higher this year than supply. so, we're going to be entering the summer and particularly the fall of the year with pretty low inventories.
so, depending -- obviously, it always depends on the weather on gas. and so, we'll just have to see how all that turns out. but, you know, we were optimistic on gas also.

the next question comes from michael scialla of stifel. please go ahead.
michael scialla -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yeah. good morning, everybody. you just highlighted for quite a long time your esg sustainability ambitions. i just want to see where you stand on the government putting a price on carbon or carbon tax.
and do you see any economic opportunities in the energy transition for eog?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. michael. i'm going to ask ken boedeker to talk on that. just, you know, before we start, so -- that, you know, that the carbon tax or issues like that, we're going to leave those up to the legislatures and not come out with our opinions on that.
you know, we'll work with, you know, whatever transpires on that. so, ken, do you want to talk about other opportunities?
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
yeah. we really have no interest in lower -- in a lower-return business that this might lead to, but we've really made excellent progress in reducing our emissions over the last four years. and you can see that with our intensity rates coming down as indicated in the attached slides that we've got on the presentation there. we're focused on reducing our own emissions with projects that have competitive returns before we consider a second phase of applying technology such as carbon capture to reduce our emissions.
and we do believe that we can use, you know, 1% to 2% of our capital budget every year to make substantial progress toward our goals of no routine flaring by 2025 that's been endorsed by the world bank. and our ambition of scope 1 and 2 net-zero by 2040.
michael scialla -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. thank you. and bill, you mentioned some of the things you're doing to lower well cost, the larger pads, and the super zippers. some of your competitors have talked about three-mile laterals in the permian.
i think you guys have done some two-mile-plus laterals in the eagle ford, but do you see the trend toward three-mile laterals, particularly in the permian? or if not, what are the issues that would prevent that?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, michael. yeah. thanks, michael.
so, on the three-mile laterals, you're right. we've done several, i'd say between two and a half and three-mile laterals in multiple plays where it makes sense and we do them probably more predominantly in the eagle ford. and then we've had some in the bakken and also in the dj. so, -- but there are unique circumstances that allow that to happen for us and they're more driven by geology in that particular area, but also the access issues on the surface.
you know, i think just as a general rule, i'm not sure that it always makes sense to go through two or three-mile lateral. i think you have to take into account the efficiencies of being able to complete that last mile of lateral economically, compared to a two-mile lateral, those kinds of things. and a lot of it does depend on the geology. and as you know, we spend a lot of detailed time working through the geology and how to best approach every single well location we have.
so, there are some limitations on where you can do that effectively. and so, it's not a broad-brush approach.
operator
the next question comes from vincent lovaglio of mizuho. please go ahead.
vin lovaglio -- mizuho securities -- analyst
yeah, hey. hey, guys, thanks for having me on. i wanted to ask on the double-premium locations and you might have touched on it last quarter, but if there's anything you need to the geology across these plays that lends itself to higher productivity but also the lower declines described in slide 8. and, you know, if so, how that might affect your pursuit of new opportunities that are double premium, why you guys have differentiated in that pursuit, and also in the development of those opportunities.
ezra yacob -- president
yes, vin. this is ezra yacob. that's a great question. and, you know, what we're highlighting there in the slide deck, it really comes down to what you touched on with the unique geology.
these are -- the double-premium plays are usually in areas where we've really refined our target down to get -- in our existing portfolio down to get rock quality that is higher, better permeability. and really, the big step changes as we look forward into the exploration prospects. as we've talked about before, we're, you know, looking for new plays that historically haven't really been drilled routinely with horizontals. we're looking for a higher quality of rocks that we can apply the horizontal drilling and completions technology to.
and really, it's the higher permeability, higher porosity that lends itself to the shallower declines. and we think that, you know, this is not only going to be a step-change for our performance as a company going forward, but really, potentially, those are going to be the new reservoirs the industry eventually is looking at to apply horizontal drilling to in the future.
vin lovaglio -- mizuho securities -- analyst
perfect. thanks. and maybe second. any additional color that you can maybe give on conventional eur, just where it stands in the eagle ford right now.
thoughts on applicability across other plays and then maybe how that could improve your environmental footprint going forward. thanks.
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
yeah. this is ken. as far as eur goes in the eagle ford right now, we've high-graded our eur process and we have some of our units that are in blowdown and other units that we're continuing to inject into eur is much more challenged in a higher gas price environment with our double-premium returns. so, we are evaluating it for other areas based on that across the company.
operator
the next question comes from nitin kumar of wells fargo. please go ahead.
nitin kumar -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hi. good morning, gentlemen, and first of all, congratulations. your market is definitely receiving the special dividend very well. my question is perhaps a little different from some of the other ones that have been asked.
what we're trying -- i was going through slide 9, you've migrated to this double-premium strategy. with the macroenvironment as favorable as it is, what happens to the single premium or the lower half of your core inventory here? you -- ezra mentioned the expiration phase can have returns as high as 80%. so, just wondering is there an opportunity to -- with any market opening to monetize some of those? or how should we think about that part of your inventory?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
that's an excellent question, nitin. we appreciate it and appreciate your compliments. yeah, we are always evaluating property sales. and i'm going to ask ken boedeker comment -- to comment on that in general for the company.
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
sure. thanks, bill. you know, we're always high-grading our portfolio and divesting those properties with minimal double-premium potential remaining. and we've actually sold about $7 billion in assets over the last 10 years and we will continue to high-grade our assets as we see the market giving them fair value.
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
and certainly, you know, in the last few years, it hasn't been a seller's market, but it is -- it will turn as people get short of inventory. and we think that the premium -- the single-premium assets that we have, you know, even those are probably some of the best inventory in the industry. so, those certainly have a lot of value.
nitin kumar -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. and they don't -- with $60 oil and costs where they are today, they don't compete for capital within your program?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. that's correct. the 30% rate of return at $40 doesn't compete in our program right now. it needs to be a 60% rate of return at $40 flat.
it's a -- it's definitely a huge shift in our returns. and that's what we've been talking about, you know, for the last several quarters in our script and in our slide detail a lot of really good information. but certainly, the shift to double premium is we believe by far the highest reinvestment standard in the industry, and it is a clear separator for eog. and it will drive exceptional performance for the company going forward.
operator
this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to mr. thomas for any closing remarks.
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
in closing, our excellent fourth-quarter results are a testament to eog's ability to generate significant shareholder value. we're proud of all of eog employees and their outstanding contributions to continuously improve the company. our excitement about eog's ability to improve returns and increased value has never been greater. so, thanks for listening and thanks for your support.

good day everyone, and welcome to eog resources' first-quarter 2021 earnings results conference call. as a reminder, this call is being recorded. at this time for opening remarks and introductions, i would like to turn the call over to chief financial officer of eog resources, mr. tim driggers.
please go ahead.
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
good morning and thanks for joining us. we hope everyone has seen the press release announcing first-quarter 2021 earnings and operational results. this conference call includes forward-looking statements. the risk associated with forwarding-looking statements have been outlined in our earnings release and eog's sec filings and we incorporate those by reference for this call.
this conference call also contains certain non-gaap financial measures. definitions, as well as reconciliation schedules for these non-gaap measures to comparable gaap measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. some of the reserve estimates on this conference call or in the accompanying investor presentation slides may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the sec's reserve reporting guidelines. we incorporate by reference to the cautionary note to u.s.
investors that appears at the bottom of our earnings release issued yesterday. participating on the call this morning are bill thomas, chairman, and ceo; billy helms, chief operating officer; ezra yacob, president; ken boedeker, evp, exploration and production; lance terveen, senior vp marketing; and david streit, vp, investor and public relations. here is bill thomas. 
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, tim, and good morning, everyone. eog is delivering on our free cash flow priorities and our strategy to maximize long-term shareholder value. yesterday, we declared a $1 per share special dividend to demonstrate our commitment to returning cash to shareholders. combined with a regular dividend, we expect to return $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends in 2021.
double premium, well productivity, and cost reductions are substantially improving our returns and increasing our ability to generate significant free cash flow. in order to maximize long-term shareholder value, we will remain flexible as we carry out our free cash flow priorities in the future. by doubling our reinvestment standard, the future potential of our earnings and cash flow performance are the best they've ever been. this quarter, we generated a quarterly record $1.1 billion of free cash flow and earned $1.62 per share of adjusted net income, the second-highest quarterly earnings in company history.
in addition, our balance sheet is in superior shape with a peer-leading low-net-debt-to-cap ratio. next, ezra will review our capital allocation strategy in more detail, billy will go over our operational performance, and tim will cover our financial performance before i make a few closing remarks. and here's ezra.
ezra yacob -- president
thanks, bill. yesterday's dividend announcement is just the latest in a long line of achievements that demonstrate the value of eog's fundamental strategy of returns-driven capital allocation, including the impact of permanently raising our investment return hurdle rate for the second time in five years. in 2016, during the last downturn, we established our premium investment strategy which requires a 30% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. the premium investment strategy drove a step-change in our capital efficiency and resulting financial performance.
it is the reason we entered 2020 in a position of operational and financial strength, which enabled us to generate positive adjusted net income and free cash flow in a year of unprecedented oil volatility and prices that averaged just $39. this year, we increased the return hurdle once again, doubling it to 60% at $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. sustainable improvements in our inventory of drilling locations and continued progress in exploration have paved the transition of double premium. the data driving our confidence to make this move is illustrated on slide 6 of our investor presentation, which details the return profile of every drilling location.
half our current inventory earns at least two times the premium return hurdle rate we established back in 2016. 5,700 double-premium locations is more than 10 years' worth of inventory at our current pace of drilling and is more than we had when we made the transition of premium five years ago. just like we did with our premium inventory, we are confident we can replace our double-premium locations faster than we drill them through line of sight and through additional cost reductions that will increase the returns of existing inventory, and through exploration. a number of innovations which billy will discuss in a moment are being piloted across our operating areas and will sustainably drive down both well costs and operating costs as we implement them throughout the company.
our exploration program is focused exclusively on prospects that will improve on that 60% median return. in fact, our anticipated return on the current slate of new exploration plays is more than 80%. to see the impact of our premium returns-focused capital allocation strategy, a closer look at our corporate financial performance is required. as we replace our production base by drilling locations with higher well level returns, the price required to earn 10% return on capital employed continues to fall.
prior to establishing premium, eog required oil prices upwards of $80 to earn a 10% roce. as the premium strategy matured, the oil price needed to earn 10% roce came down and averaged just $58 the last four years. this trend is illustrated on slide 9 of our investor presentation. for 2021, that price is just $50 and we're not stopping there.
we expect it will continue to fall as our well level returns improve. the impact of reinvesting at higher returns is also showing up in our free cash flow performance. we more than doubled the dividend over the last four years and improved our balance sheet, reducing net debt by nearly $3. as a result, net debt to total capital at the end of last year was just 11%.
but our future financial performance potential is the real prize. our first-quarter results are a preview of what we are aiming for. over the coming years, we expect reinvesting in our current inventory of high-return wells will continue to lower the corporate decline rate and compound the value of our low-cost operating structure. the result leads to higher margins and generates even more free cash flow, providing us tremendous opportunity to create long-term shareholder value.
we believe when we look back in a few years, it will be viewed as the catalyst for another step-change improvement in eog's financial performance. our fundamental strategy of returns-driven capital allocation remains consistent, and consistency is key. prioritizing reinvestment in high-return projects is the driver behind the steady improvements we've made year after year. as a result, we are now in a position to follow through on our commitment to return additional free cash flow to shareholders.
looking ahead, you can expect our priorities to remain consistent. investing in high returns, generating significant free cash flow to support a sustainable and growing dividend while maintaining a strong balance sheet, followed by opportunistic return of additional free cash flow to investors, and bolt-on acquisitions. now, here's billy.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
thanks, ezra. the first quarter of the year was about execution. we exceeded our oil target, producing more than the high end of our guidance range because wells that were offline due to the winter storm uri recovered a bit faster than expected. as a result, our first-quarter daily production declined just 3% compared to the fourth quarter last year.
our capital for the quarter came in under our forecasted target by 6%, mainly due to improvements in well costs across the company. the savings realized during the first quarter are in addition to the tremendous 15% reduction last year. eog is on track to reduce well costs another 5% this year despite some potential inflationary pressure as industry activity resumes. similar to previous quarters, these results are driven through innovation and efficiency gains in each phase of our operation.
a closer look at our operations will help explain why we are confident we can once again lower well costs. our drilling teams are consistently achieving targeted depths faster with lower cost. the constant focus on daily performance and reliability of the tools and technical procedures is creating this continual drive toward lower cost. some of the benefits this year stem from larger groups of wells per pad simply requiring less rig move cost per well and increasing efficiencies like offline cementing.
the larger well pads also complement our completion operations through the increased ability to utilize the technique we call super zipper. we began our initial experiments with this technique back in 2019 and it has since advanced to consistently deliver the expected well results at lower cost. we have also learned that super zipper is particularly well-suited to optimize the efficiencies of our five electric frac fleets. however, conventional spreads gain efficiencies as well.
this practice involves using a single spread of pressure pumping equipment to complete four more wells on a single pad. we split the equipment's capacity in half, simultaneously pumping on two wells while conducting wireline operations on the remaining wells. we piloted and perfected as zip-a-zipper logistics in our eagle ford play, and the collaboration between operating areas has accelerated its adoption throughout the company. and in cases where a minimum of four wells cannot be physically be located on a single pad, the engineering teams are working to develop new techniques where we can still utilize this improved completion practice.
completion costs are also benefiting from reduced sand and water costs through our integrated self-sourcing efforts. the savings we realized by installing water-reuse pipelines and facilities saves about 7% of well costs compared to third-party sourcing and disposal. longer term, we expect water reuse and disposal infrastructure will continue to lower lease operating expense in each area as well. lease operating expenses also benefited from lessons learned through the pandemic this last year.
the number of wells one lease operator can maintain has increased by as much as 80% by optimizing the use of innovative software designed and built by eog. the software prioritized lease operator activity throughout the day using our mobile and real-time software infrastructure. our experience last year inspired a number of new ideas to further high-grade the lease operator's work activity throughout the day, which we believe may continue to expand productivity in a -- in day-to-day field operations. slide 35 of our investor presentation illustrates the consistent progress we have made year after year on productivity, all powered by innovative ideas, generated bottom-up by employees.
each of our operating -- active operating areas functions as an individual incubator to test out new ideas, many of which have -- are a homegrown innovation from eog employees and rolled out companywide if successful. that's one of the primary reasons our well-cost improvements every year are never one silver bullet, but a list of small to medium-sized individual improvements across all elements of total well costs that result in sustainable cost reduction. as a result of the innovation spreading throughout the company to reduce capital and operating costs, i have strong confidence that the cost structure and capital efficiency of the company will continue to improve. here's tim to review our financial position.
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
thanks, billy. yesterday's special dividend announcement marks another milestone in the growth of eog's profitability and cash flow. we achieved this milestone through the disciplined execution of a consistent, long-term, return-focused strategy for capital allocation, supported by a strong balance sheet. over time, this strategy has produced increasing amounts of free cash flow.
the top priorities for the allocation of that free cash flow remain sustainable dividend growth and debt reduction. the shift to premium in 2016 drove a significant improvement in returns, profit margins, and cost, enabling the significant increase in dividend over the last four years. since 2017, the dividend has grown from $0.67 per share to a $1.65 per share. now, an annual commitment of almost $1 billion.
going forward, our goal is to continue growing the regular dividend. we have never called for suspending the dividend and we remain committed to its sustainability. with the shift to double premium, we're now focused on making another step-change improvement, and the results of those efforts will guide future common dividend increases and the potential for special dividends. since the shift to premium, we have also retired bond maturities totaling about $2 billion with plans to retire another $1.25 billion in 2023 when the bond matures.
net debt to total capitalization was 8% at the end of the first quarter. a strong balance sheet with low debt has been at the heart of eog's strategy throughout our existence. it's not just conservatism, it's about creating a strategic advantage. our superior balance sheet enables us to acquire high-return assets at bottom-of-cycle prices where their exploration acreage like the eagle ford or for the new plays we're working on today, bolt-on acquisitions, our companies like the -- like yates acquisition five years ago.
a strong balance sheet also gives us the financial strength to be a partner of choice in our operations, whether it is with marketing or export agreements, service providers, or even other companies in other countries unlocking new plays. strong balance sheet extends to ensuring ample liquidity, which we have also secured with no near-term debt maturities, $3.4 billion of cash on hand, and a $2 billion unsecured line of credit. now, eog is positioned to address other free cash flow priorities by returning additional cash to shareholders. the $1 per share special dividend falls through -- these consistent long-tailed priorities.
at $600 million, the special dividend is a meaningful amount while also aligning with our other priorities. after paying the special dividend, we will have $2.8 billion of cash on hand, a full $800 million above our minimum cash target. this is a healthy down payment on the $1.25 billion bond maturing in two years. going forward, our free cash flow priorities remain unchanged.
we'll continue to monitor the cash position of the company, oil and gas prices, and of course, our own financial performance. as excess cash becomes available in the future, we will evaluate further special dividends, or at the right time, opportunistic share repurchases or low-cost bolt-on property acquisitions. i think it goes without saying you should expect us to avoid expensive corporate m&a. you can count on eog to continue following our consistent strategy to maximize long-term shareholder value.
now, here is bill to wrap up.
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, tim. in conclusion, i would like to note the following important takeaways. first, true to the eog culture, our employees have fully embraced doubling our investment hurdle rate. as we drill more double premium wells, we expect our performance will continue to improve.
our decline rate will flatten, our break-even oil price will decline, our margins will expand, and the potential for free cash flow will increase substantially. second, while our new double premium hurdle rate alone will drive significant improvement, it represents just one source: we never quit coming up with new ways to increase productivity and lower cost. innovative new ideas and improved technology are developing throughout the company at a rapid pace and will continue to result in even higher returns in the future. and finally, our special dividend this quarter, we are demonstrating our commitment to generating significant free cash flow and using that free cash to improve total shareholder returns.
we are more excited than ever about the future of eog and our ability to deliver and maximize long-term shareholder value. thanks for listening. and now, we'll go to q&a.

[operator instructions] the first question comes from leo mariani with keybanc. please go ahead.
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey, guys. you obviously highlighted some success on kind of the small bolt-on deals here. and i guess, just from my perspective, it seemed like those were very, very economic, just very cheap per acre cost at around $2,500 per acre. is a lot of this just a function of the fact that these are very small deals and sort of captive to eog existing acreage and infrastructure, which just gives you kind of the natural ability to kind of buy these without a lot of competition, and just want to get a sense of how repeatable these type of bolt-ons can be for you guys going forward?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, leo. i'm going to ask ezra to comment on that.
ezra yacob -- president
yeah, leo, you described that very, very well. these are smaller deals, as i highlighted, it's 25,000 acres across eight different deals that we've captured and put together over the -- over the past 12 months, and these are low-cost opportunities in our core positions within the delaware basin. and typically, these are things that are either contiguous with our preexisting acreage position or very, very close to our acreage position. and so, there's not a lot of outside competition.
a lot of times, we're just by all regards, we're the partner that makes sense to go ahead and get these deals because like i said, we have the surrounding wells, information, seismic. and oftentimes, some of these deals can go immediately right into our existing infrastructure. and these are typically -- we highlighted the last 12 months, but we wanted to give a sense of the type of scale and the impact that these low-cost opportunities can have when we're focused on them, and these deals are pretty continuous throughout all of our plays and throughout the year.
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and i guess i also wanted to ask about your comment around seeing a less than $7 per boe f&d year to date. clearly, you attributed some of the factors there, where you talked about how your well costs are coming down.
i know that's part of it and also the move to double premium. but maybe you can provide just a little bit more color. i mean, i guess that less than $7 seems like a very low number out there. are there any other just kind of key factors where maybe there's more of a mix shift to certain plays or perhaps your higher concentration of certain zones in the delaware this year? and now you guys are also drilling some gas wells in south texas might be helping.
just any color around kind of some of the key drivers that are getting you to under $7.
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, leo. billy helms will comment on that.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yeah. leo, it's strictly a function of moving to our double-premium strategy. we saw a similar change, if you remember back when we shifted to premium a few years ago, and we're seeing that same compounding effect as we shift to double premium. the quality of our wells improves and as you noted, we have a history of continuing to focus on lowering well costs and just our continued effort in those areas.
so it's not really attributable from -- to one basin or the other, it's just a function of the impact of shifting to double premium across our portfolio. and i might add as we look to add wells to the inventory of double-premium wells, they'll be in that same category to compete on both returns and finding cost.
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thanks, guys.
operator
the next question is from neal dingmann with truist securities. please go ahead.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
good morning, guys. nice quarter. my first question is really just around when you've talked about shareholder return, obviously, that seems to be the hot topic these days. bill, i'm glad you don't do this, but my thoughts about if you guys would ever -- there's been others out there that have sort of guaranteed type of return or an amount or something like that, you guys seem to want to stay more flexible.  but i just would just love to hear more color on -- again, obviously, you guys have a monster amount of free cash flow coming in.
that's not the issue. i'm just wondering how you think about if you put any sort of guarantees on the type or amount going forward?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, neal. we've outlined a very clear framework and we've consistently delivered on our priorities. and so, maybe the best way to think about the future is to look what we've done in the past. and i want to ask ezra to give more color on that.
ezra yacob -- president
yeah, neal. in our investor presentation there on slide 5 and 6, i think we can reference that. this year, we've been very successful executing on all of our cash flow priorities in the framework that we've kind of laid out. we've been able to increase the regular dividend by 10%, which we feel is our primary mode of capital return.
secondly, we were able to reduce our debt earlier this year by $750 million by retiring a bond. and then, third, we just paid a $600 million special dividend on july 30 of this year, which we had announced during the last earnings call. so our year-to-date free cash flow commitment is $2.3 billion, which is slightly more than the $2.1 billion we generated. and going forward, our framework and priorities have not changed.
lastly, we also highlighted in the opening remarks, as we just spoke about a little bit with leo, some of the small bolt-on acquisitions we've done, which is one of the avenues to growing our inventory. and that's really the -- where the entire process begins, is having the depth and quality of inventory to continually improve the business. and with our shift to drilling these double-premium wells, the free cash flow potential of the company continues to expand. and as it does and as we realize the cash, we're well positioned to continue executing on our priorities.
we're committed to creating the most shareholder value and our cash return strategy is really a reflection of that. so as the company continues to improve, we're excited about that potential.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
i agree guys. i really like the cash return strategy. and then, just one follow-up. exploration opportunities that really you guys continue to stick out there.
you obviously continue to be the leaders, mentioned a number of things that have you excited. could you just remind us, again, i think the last was it -- i forget, bill, was it maybe 13 or 15, was it unique projects here in the u.s.? i'm just wondering, could you -- again, could you tell us maybe or just talk about the upside potential you see for that business this year going into 2022 for the exploration upside?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, neal. i think what we've outlined is we've got about 15 exploration wells built into the capex this year, so in the u.s. so i'm going to ask ezra to give some more color on that.
ezra yacob -- president
yeah, neal. the exploration prospects are all moving forward. as we discussed on the last call, the prospects have all started to move at different phases, really kind of as a result of some of the slowdown during covid and during 2020. so we're -- as bill just mentioned, we're planning on drilling 15 wells outside of the publicly discussed assets.
some of these -- some of the prospects are initial exploration wells. some of them are more what we call appraisal wells, evaluating kind of the repeatability of these plays. we're still leasing across many of the plays as well. and as we've discussed, the opportunities are really targeting a higher quality rock than what's typically been drilled horizontally.
it's an outgrowth of a lot of technical work we've done across multiple basins to combine modern drilling and completions technologies and apply those to reservoirs that have been traditionally overlooked. and really, we're very happy with our progress to date, and we look forward to sharing additional information at an appropriate time.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst

the next question comes from doug leggate with bank of america. please go ahead.
douglas leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you, guys. i think this is the first time i've had a chance to say, bill, congratulations on your retirement. and ezra, excited to see what you -- how you move forward with the business. but i wonder, bill, if i could ask you just to maybe a little bit of a retrospective here as you walk out the door, so to speak.
there's been a lot of changes in the business model, growth transitioning to free cash flow and so on. so i'm just wondering if you can offer any thoughts as to how this business should look going forward, both at the sector level and at eog level as you kind of look back on your tenure and the changes that have taken place over that time.
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, doug. well, thank you very much. and you're right. i mean, the business has involved -- evolved over the last year since the shale business really started, and it's -- obviously, it's moving in an incredibly great positive direction right now, the focus on returns.
we've always been, i think, a leader in focus on returns, and we're like super excited about that. the capital discipline, spending well below cash flow and generating high returns and giving significant amount of cash back to shareholders, i think, is certainly all very positive. and so, i think really, we're entering a super new era, and i think it's more positive than it's ever been before. i think we, as an industry, are going to generate better returns and going to give more back to shareholders.
and i think we're in a more positive macro environment than we've been in since really the shale business started. i think opec+ is solid. i think the u.s. will remain disciplined.
and so, i think the industry is in for a long run of really good results.
douglas leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
we've enjoyed butting heads with you over the years, bill. so congratulations again, good luck. ezra, this is my follow-up maybe for you. eog has obviously been an organic story for many, many years.
and you've touched on exploration again today, but yates was one of the, i guess, the step-out acquisitions that you did. and if we look at your portfolio position today, there's clearly a large asset potentially for sale right in your backyard in a very high-quality acreage position, you could argue. why would m&a not be a feature of the business at some point? and maybe i go so far as to say, would you rule yourself out of being interested in that shale package? and i'll leave it there.
ezra yacob -- president
yeah, doug. no, we're not evaluating any large acquisition packages at this time. we're focused on these small, high-return bolt-on acquisitions. and as discussed in the opening remarks, the larger expensive m&a deals, the opportunity struggle to compete with the existing return profile that we have within the company due to either high pdp cost, the high acreage costs or both.
oftentimes, acreage being marketed, it might be additive to the quantity of our inventory but not additive to the quality. and as we've discussed, as you know, we're always working to improve the quality of our assets. we're having a great success with the small bolt-on acquisitions. we're feeling very confident with our ability to increase the quality of our deep inventory through our organic exploration program.
and so, we're excited about our prospects there.
douglas leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
very clear. thanks.
operator
the next question comes from paul cheng with scotiabank. please go ahead.
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
thank you. good morning, gentlemen. two questions, please. the first one, maybe that, bill, you can help us to frame it to understand the decision a little bit better.
if we look at the last quarter, when you announced the special dividend, i think you set a number of preconditions, and that's all being met, such as you generate substantial free cash flow. you don't have much of the debt maturity in the near term and your cash is already in excess of what you think is a reasonable level, which is $2 billion. if we look in this quarter, basically, all those conditions are still being match, but you decided not to declare another special dividend. so we're just trying to understand that what is the additional consideration in that decision.
and also, if you can talk about between buyback and special dividend at this point of the cycle, which is more preferable for you or how do you look at the differences? so that's the first question. the second question is related to i think that you guys clearly is one of the unquestioned leaders in many of the basins. you are not interested in large scale m&a, which understandable. does it make sense, however, that to work with some of your peers to pull together the asset to form a really large joint venture? so everyone still have their own equity ownership.
you don't pay any premium, but you will be able to allow to use your technical know-how to apply to even a larger scale asset and drive even better efficiency gains. do you think that it makes sense for eog for that kind of structure?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, paul. so on the first question, i think it's super important. and i think we've already shared this. we've got a very clear framework and we've consistently delivered, as you pointed out, on that framework and significantly given -- in that framework, significantly given a lot of money back to shareholders.
and going forward, our framework and priorities are not changed at all. so as we generate additional free cash flow, we're committed to returning cash to shareholders in a very meaningful way. it's really all about doing the right thing at the right time. as the company continues to improve, we're excited about our potential to increase total shareholder return, and in the framework, we do have the option for opportunistic buybacks as long as -- along with special dividends.
and so, we look at opportunistic buybacks as being able to have the opportunity to consider buying back shares and countercyclic environments where the market is not well and our stock price is significantly undervalued. well, that would be an opportunity to consider buybacks. in good times, we think the special dividend is the way to go, and that's what we're executing on now, and that's what we're hopeful to continue to execute in the future. on the second part of your question on the large-scale m&a, i'm going to ask billy to kind of think through that question and give his feelings on that.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yeah. thanks, bill. on the large-scale m&a, as ezra just talked about a minute ago, certainly, we're not interested in adding quantity to our inventory, but it's more about the quality of the assets we have. and as we think about forming maybe a potential larger jv, that same approach needs to apply as we look across the fence.
if our -- if our assets are in what we consider the core acreage position in the play, adding in acreage outside of that ring fence would dilute our efforts. we've also taken -- as you know, taken a lot of effort to build out the infrastructure to make our -- to lower our unit cost and continue to improve our returns. and we build out that infrastructure to meet the volume expectations that we have for developing our acreage that may or may not apply as you add in additional acreage outside of that. so i think each operator looks at how to make the most efficient use of the acreage and their capital as they can and forming jvs doesn't necessarily improve overall company metrics.
so i think while we've looked at bolt-ons as a way to shore up a lot of our core area acreage, i think that is a very applicable part of maybe thinking about jv expansions, continuing to core up in your base areas where it adds the same quality, doesn't dilute your quality of the assets, but just expanding in a basin may or may not do that.
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
thank you.
operator
the next question comes from arun jayaram with jpmorgan. please go ahead.
arun jayaram -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
yeah. good morning. tim, maybe starting with you. i just wanted to get maybe some of the order of operations around a potential incremental cash return beyond the dividend.
last quarter, you mentioned that eog like to keep a $2 billion minimum cash balance plus fund the $1.25 billion bond maturity. so that suggests that you'd like to get to $3.25 billion of cash and anything beyond that is available for cash return beyond the dividend?
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
certainly, you can do that math, but it's more than that. as ezra and bill talked about further, we have to look at all of our priorities and the timing of those priorities to determine when and if there's another special dividend or share repurchases or bolt-on acquisitions. all those things are in play at all times, and the $2 billion is not an end-of-the-month number. it's during the cycle.
so cash can vary tremendously during the month. so the $2 billion is the low point during the month, not necessarily at the end of a month. so you have to keep that in mind as well. but yes, you can do that math, but that's not all there is to it.
we have to look at all of our priorities and where we're at in the cycle. and as has been pointed out on slide 6, we've already distributed more cash than we brought in, in the first half of the year. so we're well on our way to achieving that. so as we move through the second half of the year, we'll look at what other cash is generated, and we'll evaluate how to use that cash at that time.
arun jayaram -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
great. and maybe just a follow-up to paul's question. could you give us maybe some feedback you've gotten from some of the shareholders on the special dividend? and your thoughts on the pros and con of moving to a formulaic type of approach around cash return and either special dividends or buyback.
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, arun. this is bill. we've got enormously positive responses from every shareholder on the special dividend. that was a super hit, and they like our framework.
when you really think through it, it's not really a complicated framework. it's a framework where we want to be in a position to maximize total shareholder returns. and as we said, i said, be able to do the right thing at the right time. if you look at the history of what we've been doing, really, over the last several years, we have been -- we've increased the regular dividend by 146%.
and now, we're working on a special dividend. so as we go forward, it is certainly our goal to continue to return meaningful cash back to the shareholders through the process. so really, it's a pretty straightforward process if you kind of think through it and the framework is pretty, pretty simple, and it's just a matter of giving us the ability to have the options to do the right thing to maximize total shareholder return.
arun jayaram -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
great. thanks a lot.
operator
the next question is from michael scialla with stifel. please go ahead.
michael scialla -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
good morning, everybody. and bill, i'd like to offer my congratulations on a great career as well. i know it's too early to give details on 2022 but wanted to see if you could speak to at least at a high level, given your outlook for flat to lower well costs next year. if you still see barrels held off the market by opec+, would you just look to hold production flattish? and could you do that with kind of equal to lower capital than you spent this year?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, mike. well, thank you very much again. we appreciate your comments. it's a team effort in eog.
i'd tell you what, we've got a lot of great employees and a super management team. so it's a team effort, and it's been an honor to be able to work with all the -- everybody. about 2022, it's really too early to talk about growth. we need to watch the pace of demand and recovery and the spare capacity drawdown.
so we don't want to really speculate on anything specific for 2022. but i'm going to ask ezra to make some additional color on that.
ezra yacob -- president
yeah, michael. as bill said, it's pretty early on 2022. it's still pretty early to discuss any type of growth. eog is -- we're committed.
we're not going to grow until the market clearly needs the barrels, and we've outlined what we're looking for, we're committed to staying disciplined. and currently, we want to see demand return to pre-covid levels, low spare capacity and we want to see inventories at or below the five-year average. every year, market factors are going to determine the plan for that year, and we're going to remain flexible and modify our plans to fit the market conditions. as you said, we have made great progress this year on our total well cost reductions.
and going forward, that's strengthening the underlying capital efficiency of the company and continuing to lower the cost base of the company. and so, as we move forward, regardless of any type of growth rates, we've set the company up with this double-premium investment plan to continue to expand the free cash flow generation potential of eog.
michael scialla -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
ok. and i guess really just my question there was if you were to hold the production flat, it looks like the capital required to do that is not going up at least over the next 12 to 18 months as you see the world now. is that fair to say?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, mike, that's certainly fair to say. i mean, we're reducing costs all the time and improving well productivity. so we're hopeful that our maintenance cost in the future will be lower than it is today, and that's certainly directionally what we've done in the past, and that's hopefully what we're going to do in the future.
michael scialla -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
ok. great. and then, i just want to follow up with ken on you mentioned the ccs pilot you have there. is there any more detail you can offer ken in terms of -- it sounds like it's eog specific, at least at this point? can you talk about what the source of emissions are, where you're focused within your footprint? and are you looking at storing co2 in depleted fields or aquifers? just any more detail you can give us there.
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
sure. thanks for that question. at this point in time, we really don't anticipate any partners on our pilot project, but with our geologic and operational expertise, we'll evaluate partnering on future projects on a case-by-case basis. this project is really part of our broader strategy of reduced capture and offset, and it's focused on capturing our co2 emissions in an area where we can generate a return via some tax incentives and have a concentrated stream of co2 that can be aggregated to an injection well for permanent and secure geologic storage in an interval thousands of feet below the surface.
and that's pretty much what we're giving out at this time.
michael scialla -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
very good. thank you.
operator
the next question comes from bob brackett with sanford c. bernstein. please go ahead.
bob brackett -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
good morning. to put you on the spot a little bit. you highlighted the various well cost categories. tubular sticks out as being both significant and also exposed to inflation.
you tackled the problem last year with prepurchasing. can you throw out some ideas that the organization has come up with to sort of attack that cost category?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
billy, do you want to comment on that?
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yeah. bob, obviously, yeah, steel costs are going up, which is affecting tubular costs. this last year, we were very fortunate to take advantage of pre-purchasing the tubulars we needed for this year's program and benefited greatly from that. as costs go up in the future, we use the same approach and try to take an opportunistic look at when to secure tubulars for the next coming drilling program, and so, we'll continue to look at that.
undoubtedly, it's likely that the cost for tubulars will be higher next year than they are this year, which is why in that slide no. 10 we tried to give you some color on other ways we're trying to keep our well cost flat to down going into next year. and those come from the efficiencies we're seeing across the operation from drilling time to the implementation of our super-zipper technology on the completion side to newer contracts at a lower rate for some of the services we have. so it's a mixture of things we use to offset those inflationary pressures we see in the different parts of our business.
bob brackett -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
ok. that's clear. and just as a quick follow-up, could you contrast super zippers the way you think about them versus, say, a traditional zipper frac that we might think of or even a dual frac?
billy helms -- chief operating officer
sure. so our super-zipper technique is very similar to what the industry calls a simo-frac. the differences would be in how we actually implement it on a well-to-well basis. we keep very close control over the injection rates and pressures of individual wells within the super-zipper operation.
so it's a very scripted and very detailed procedure that allows us to control the rates and pressures just like we were doing a conventional frac with any other fleet. but the advantages, of course, has been able to double the amount of stages you get in a particular day by attacking the locations two at a time, and we really are advancing that technology quite a bit. last year, we probably did less than 10% of our wells across the company benefited from super-zipper. this year, it's probably directionally closer to one third of the wells, and we expect that percentage to increase going into next year.
so we think it's going to give us a tremendous cost advantage next year as we go into the program.
bob brackett -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
thanks for that.
operator
the next question comes from scott hanold with rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
scott hanold -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks. and, bill, again, i also want to congratulate -- give you congratulations on your tenure. obviously, you all navigated a lot of ups and downs over the past few years fairly successfully. so congrats for that.
i just have one question, and you all seem to be doing better than expected. i mean, certainly, it seems like production, especially oil production on the upper end of your range, and can you just give us some general thoughts. i know you're not in a position where you're going to talk to 2022, and how you think about growth. but if you are running a little bit ahead based on outperformance of your wells, would you think about tapering as you get into 2022 a little bit just to maintain the flattish kind of production you all expected this year?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, scott. again, thank you so much for your comments. and i'm going to ask billy to comment on the remainder of this year and particularly the fourth quarter.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
scott, so certainly, we're very pleased with the progress we've made on both reducing our well cost and the performance we're seeing from the wells we are bringing to production this year. it's a testament to the strategy of shifting the double-premium standard again. so as we go into the rest of the year, we started out the year a little -- with a little bit higher activity level. we had a little bit higher rig count at the start of the year.
and then, this tapered off. and we're running at a pretty consistent rate now and expect that to continue through the end of the year. and then, next year, as bill elaborated, it's kind of hard to anticipate what we'll need this year. but i think the performance that we're seeing this year will continue into next year, certainly.
and the pace of activity will be dictated by what we see in the market conditions. so that's kind of the color i could give you, but our performance will continue to at least stay flat or improve.
scott hanold -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
understood. thanks for that.
operator
the next question comes from neil mehta with goldman sachs and company. please go ahead.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning, and congratulations, ezra. congratulations, bill. bill, last quarter, you talked a little bit about the analytics that you were building around monitoring the oil macro. i'd love your latest real-time thoughts.
a lot of moving pieces here, opec, demand uncertainty, iranian barrels, u.s. supply, how are each of those parameters evolving here as you guys are evaluating?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, neil. as we've all seen, we're definitely -- demand is on a strong recovery. it's a bit lumpy, obviously, due to the virus resurgence in a few areas, but we expect -- even with that, we expect pre-covid demand to be reached by early '22. inventories are already below the five-year average really in the u.s.
and in the world. so that has already been checked. and on the supply side, as i said before, we believe that the u.s. will stay disciplined and there'll be a small growth in the u.s.
next year, but not much growth. and we see opec+, they look to be very solid. so they'll continue to bring back on their shut-in volumes and spare capacity as needed gradually, and we see that spare capacity. if the recovery continues like we expect, we see spare capacity could be very low by the second quarter or by the middle of next year.
so we'll just have to watch and see how it goes. but overall, we see a very positive macro environment.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
and then the follow-up is just as you think about the u.s. production profile, maybe you can get a little bit more granular in terms of how you're thinking about those volumes. but the question we continue to get asked is where are we in terms of resource maturity? have the best of efficiency has been driven out of the shales? and maybe you talk about the permian, the eagle ford and the bakken. what are you seeing in each of those plays? where are we in terms of efficiencies? and then is the slowdown in u.s.
production being driven by resource maturity, or is it really being driven by capital at this point?
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. we see -- we run the numbers on all the different groups from the private to the public to the majors. and then, generally, particularly in the private, we see definitely well productivity is going down, not up. so it takes a lot more wells for that group to maintain production or even think about growing it.
and overall, in the other groups, not specific to eog, but we generally see well productive -- well production to be flat, to not improving over time. and so, i think that is a function of resource maturity. i think when you get in down spacing and spacing and in timing and all that, i think it's going to subdue the productivity. and so, literally, the biggest factor, of course, is in the capital discipline where you're spending tremendously amount of less cash flow than we've been spending in the previous year.
so when you put all that together, we do not see -- we think the discipline will remain with the group. we do not see the u.s. growing significantly next year. so that's a very positive, i think, for shareholders and positive for the macro.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks, bill.

good day, everyone, and welcome to eog resources second-quarter 2021 earnings results conference call. as a reminder this call is being recorded. at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, i would like to turn the call over to chief financial officer of eog resources, mr. tim driggers.
please go ahead, sir.
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
good morning, and thanks for joining us. we hope everyone has seen the press release announcing second-quarter 2021 earnings and operational results. this conference call includes forward-looking statements. the risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and eog's sec filings, and we incorporate those by reference for this call.
this conference call also contains certain non-gaap financial measures. definitions, as well as reconciliation schedules for these non-gaap measures to comparable gaap measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. some of the reserve estimates on this conference call or in the accompanying investor presentation slides may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the sec's reserve reporting guidelines. we incorporate by reference the cautionary note to u.s.
investors that appears at the bottom of our earnings release issued yesterday. participating on the call this morning are bill thomas, chairman and ceo; and billy helms, chief operating officer; ezra yacob, president; ken boedeker, evp, exploration and production; jeff leitzell, evp, exploration and production; lance terveen, senior vp marketing; and david streit, vp, investor and public relations. here's bill thomas. 
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, tim, and good morning, everyone. eog is focused on improving returns. results from the first half of the year are already reflecting the power of eog shift to our double-premium investment standard. once again, we posted outstanding results in the second quarter.
we delivered adjusted earnings of $1.73 per share and nearly $1.1 billion of free cash flow, repeating the record level of free cash flow we generated last quarter. our outstanding operational performance included another beat of the high end of our oil production guidance, while capital expenditures and total per-unit operating costs were below expectations. we are delivering exceptional well productivity that continues to improve. in addition, even though the industry is in an inflationary environment, eog continues to demonstrate the company's unique ability to sustainably lower cost.
our performance clearly proves the power of doubling our reinvestment hurdle rate, double premium requires investments to earn a minimum of 60% direct after-tax rate of return using flat commodity prices of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. i'm confident our reinvestment hurdle is one of the most stringent in the industry and a powerful catalyst to drive future outperformance across key financial metrics, including a return on capital employed and free cash flow. as double premium improves our potential to generate free cash flow, we remain committed to using that cash to maximize shareholder value. the regular dividend, debt reduction, special dividends, opportunistic buybacks and small high-return bolt-on acquisitions are our priorities.
in the first half of this year, we reduced our long-term debt by $750 million and demonstrated our priority to returning cash, significant cash to shareholders with a commitment of $1.5 billion in regular and special dividends. we also closed on several low-cost, high potential bolt-on acquisitions in the delaware basin over the last 12 months. year-to-date, we have committed $2.3 billion to debt reduction in dividends, which is slightly more than the $2.1 billion of free cash flow we've generated. looking ahead to the second half of the year and beyond, our free cash flow priorities and framework have not changed.
as we generate additional free cash, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders in a meaningful way. we are focused on doing the right thing at the right time in order to maximize shareholder returns. over the last four years, we've made huge progress reducing our ghg and methane intensity rates, nearly eliminating routine flaring and increasing the use of recycled water in our operations. we are focused on continued progress toward reducing our ghg emissions in line with our targets and ambitions.
this quarter, we announced a carbon capture and storage pilot project, which we believe will be our next step forward in the process of reaching our net-zero ambition. ken will provide more color on this and other emission reduction projects in a few moments. driven by eog's innovative culture, our goal is to be one of the lowest costs, highest return and lowest emission producers playing a significant role in the long-term future of energy. now, here's ezra to talk more about how our returns continue to improve.
ezra yacob -- president
thanks, bill. while we announced our shift to the double-premium investment standard at the start of this year, the shift has been underway since 2016 when we first established our premium investment standard of 30% minimum direct after-tax rate of return using a conservative price deck of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas for the life of the well. in the three years that followed, our premium drilling program drove a 45% increase in earnings per share, a 40% increase in roce in an oil price environment nearly 40% lower compared to the three-year period prior to premium. this comparative financial performance can be reviewed on slide 15 of our investor presentation.
in addition, premium enabled this remarkable step change in our financial performance, while reinvesting just 78% of our discretionary cash flow on average, resulting in $4.6 billion of cumulative free cash flow. the impact from doubling our investment hurdle rate from 30% to 60% using the same conservative premium price deck is now positioning eog for a similar step change to our well productivity and costs, boosting returns, capital efficiency, and cash flow. double premium wells offer shallower production declines and significantly lower finding and development costs, resulting in well payouts of approximately six months at current strip prices. the increase in capital efficiency resulting from reinvesting in these high-return projects is increasing our potential to generate significant free cash flow.
this year, we are averaging less than $7 per barrel of oil equivalent finding cost. adding these lower-cost reserves is continuing to drive down the cost basis of the company, and when combined with eog's operating cost reductions is driving higher full-cycle returns. looking back over the last four quarters, eog has earned a 12% return on capital employed with oil averaging $52. we are well on our way to earning double-digit roce at less than $50 oil, and it begins with disciplined reinvestment in high-return double-premium drilling.
while eog has 11,500 premium locations, approximately 5,700 are double-premium wells located across each of our core assets. we are confident we can continue to grow our double-premium inventory through organic exploration, improving well cost and well productivity and small bolt-on acquisitions, just like we did with the premium over the last five years. in the past 12 months, through eight deals, we have added over 25,000 acres in the delaware basin through opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions at an approximate cost of $2,500 per acre. these are low-cost opportunities within our core asset positions, which, in some cases, receive immediate benefit from our existing infrastructure.
premium and now double premium established a new higher threshold for adding inventory. exploration and bolt-on acquisitions are focused on improving the quality of the inventory by targeting returns in excess of the 60% after-tax rate of return hurdle. eog's record for adding high-quality, low-cost inventory predominantly through organic exploration is why we do not need to pursue expensive large m&a deals. 2021 is turning into an outstanding year for eog.
our exceptional well level returns are translating into double-digit corporate returns and our employees continue to position eog for long-term shareholder value creation. here's billy with an update on our operational performance.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
thanks, ezra. our operating teams continue to deliver strong results. once again, we exceeded our oil production target, producing slightly more than the high end of our guidance, driven by strong well results. in addition, capital came in below the low end of our guidance as a result of sustainable well cost reductions.
we have already exceeded our targeted 5% well cost reduction in the first half of 2021. we now expect that our average well cost will be more than 7% lower than last year. as a reminder, this is in addition to the 15% well cost savings achieved in 2020. we continue to see operational improvements outpace the inflationary pressure in the service sector.
average drilling days are down 11%, and the feet of lateral completed in a single day increased more than 15%. we are utilizing our recently discussed super-zipper completions on about one third our well packages this year and expect that percentage to increase next year. in addition, our sand costs are flat to slightly down year-to-date. we have line of sight to reduce the cost of sand sourcing and processing and expect to start realizing savings in the second half of 2021 and into 2022.
water reuse is another source of significant savings, and we continue to expand reuse infrastructure throughout our development areas. finally, we have renegotiated several of the expiring higher-priced contracts for drilling rigs and expect to see additional savings the remainder of this year and next. we also use the strength of our balance sheet to take advantage of opportunities to reduce future costs in several areas. as an example, last summer, we prepurchased the tubulars needed for our 2021 drilling program when prices were at their lowest point.
eog is not immune to the inflationary pressures we're seeing across our industry. but this forward-looking approach helps eog mitigate anticipated cost increases. as a reminder, 65% of our well costs are locked in for the year, and the remaining costs we are actively working down through operational efficiencies. as usual, we have begun to secure services and products ahead of next year's activity, with the goal of keeping well cost at least flat in 2022.
but as you can rest assured that with our talented and focused operational teams, our ultimate goal is to always push well cost down each year. the same amount of air freight is being placed on reducing our per-unit operating cost, with the results showing up in reduced loe, driven mainly by lower workover expense, reduced water handling expense and lower maintenance expenses. savings are also being realized from our new technology being developed internally to optimize our artificial lift. we have several new tools that help us reduce the amount of gas lift volumes required to produce wells without reducing the overall production rate.
these optimizing tools not only reduce costs, but also help reduce the amount of compression horsepower needed, which ultimately reduces our greenhouse gas footprint as well. these and other continual improvements are a great testament to our pleased but not satisfied culture. this quarter, we can also update you on our final esg performance results from last year. we reduced our greenhouse gas intensity rate 8% in 2020, driven by sustainable reductions to our flaring intensity.
operational performance in the first half of this year indicates promise for future -- further improvements to our emissions performance in 2021, putting us comfortably ahead of pace to meet our 2025 intensity targets for ghg and methane and our goal to eliminate routine flaring. achieving these targets is the first step on the path toward our ambition of net-zero emissions by 2040. water infrastructure investments also continue to pay off. nearly all water used in our powder river basin operations last year was sourced from reuse.
for companywide operations in the u.s., water supplied by reuse sources last year increased to 46%, reducing freshwater to less than one-fifth of the total water used. these achievements and other, along with the insight into ongoing efforts to improve future performance will be detailed in our sustainability report to be published in october. we are starting to fill in the pieces on the road map to get to net-zero by 2040. here's ken with the details.
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
thanks, billy. earlier this year, we announced our net-zero ambition for our scope 1 and scope 2 ghg emissions by 2040. our ambition is aggressive but achievable and we expect it will be an iterative process requiring trial and error. this approach mirrors how we develop an oil and gas asset.
we pilot creative applications of existing and new technologies to determine the most effective solutions to optimize efficiencies by minimizing costs and maximizing recoveries of oil and natural gas. here, we are aiming to maximize emissions reductions. we then apply the successful technologies and solutions across our operations where feasible. our net-zero strategy generally falls into three categories: reduce, capture or offset.
that is, we are focused on directly reducing emissions from our operations, capturing emissions from sources that can be concentrated for storage and offsetting any remaining emissions. reducing emissions intensity from our operations is a direct and immediate path to reducing our carbon footprint. our approach is to invest with returns in mind and seek achievable and scalable results. we made excellent progress in the last four years through initiatives to upgrade equipment in the field, invest in pilots using existing and new technologies and leverage our extensive big data platform to automate and redesign processes to improve emissions efficiencies.
as a result, since 2017, we have reduced our ghg intensity rate 20%, our methane emissions percentage by 80% and our flaring intensity rate by more than 50%. we recently obtained permits to expand the successful pilot of our closed-loop gas capture project, which prevents flaring in the event of a downstream interruption. we designed an automated system that redirects natural gas back into our infrastructure system and injects the gas temporarily back into existing wells. the project requires a modest investment to capture a resource that would have otherwise been flared and stores it for further -- for future production and beneficial use.
the result is a double-premium return investment that reduces flaring emissions. our wellhead gas capture rate was 99.6% in 2020 and roll-out of additional closed-loop gas capture systems will help capture more of the remaining 0.4%. turning to our efforts to capture co2. we are launching a project that will capture carbon emissions from our operations for long-term storage.
this project is designed to capture and store a concentrated source of eog's direct co2 emissions. we believe we can design solutions to generate returns from carbon capture and storage by leveraging our competitive advantages in geology, well and facility design and field operations. our ccs efforts are directed at emissions from our operations, and we are not currently looking to expand those efforts into another line of business. we will provide updates on our pilot ccs project as it progresses.
eog is also exploring other innovative solutions for ghg emissions reductions. over the past 18 months, we have deployed capital into several fuel substitution projects to power compressors used for natural gas pipeline operations and natural gas artificial lift. compressors are the largest source of eog's stationary combustion emissions. by replacing ngl-rich field gas with lean residue gas, eog can reduce the carbon intensity of the fuel which lowers co2 emissions and improves engine efficiency.
using lean residue gas also earns a very favorable financial return by recovering the full value of the natural gas liquids versus using those components as fuel. another fuel substitution test we conducted recently was blending hydrogen with natural gas. while it is still in the early stages, we are analyzing the test data to evaluate the emissions reductions that would be possible from this blended fuel at an operational and economic scale. we're very excited about this part of the business, just like cost reductions, well improvements or exploration success.
this is a bottom-up-driven initiative. eog employees thrive on this type of challenge. we create innovative solutions and apply technology to solve problems, improve processes and optimize efficiencies while generating industry-leading returns. the eog culture has embraced our 2040 net zero ambition, and we are focusing our efforts to minimize our carbon footprint as quickly as possible.
now, here is bill to wrap up.
bill thomas -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, ken. in conclusion, i'd like to note the following important takeaways. first, by doubling our reinvestment standard, the future potential of our earnings and cash flow performance are the best they've ever been. results from the first half of this year demonstrate the power of double premium and the beginning of another step change in performance.
second, eog is not satisfied. we are committed to getting better. sustainable cost reduction and improving well performance are driving returns and free cash flow potential to another level. at the same time, the same innovative culture that is driving higher returns is also improving our environmental performance.
third, our commitment to returning cash to shareholders has not changed. as we have already demonstrated, returning meaningful cash to shareholders remains a priority. and finally, as ezra transitions into the ceo role, i could not be more excited about the future of the company. the quality of our assets and the quality of this leadership team are the best in company history, all supported by eog's talented employees and unique culture that continues to fire on all cylinders.
the company is incredibly strong and our ability to get stronger has never been better. the future of eog is in great hands. thanks for listening. now, we'll go to q&a.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question will come from paul cheng with scotiabank. please go ahead.
paul cheng -- scotiabank-- analyst
thank you. good morning. two questions, please, ezra. first, you have the authorization for the buyback.
but quite frankly, i don't recall eog ever done any buyback for the past 20 years. so can you talk about what is the conditional criteria for you to actually act on it? and in theory that if you're going to budget when the market is suffering the downturn, does that mean that you should have a really strong balance sheet going into the downturn maybe at a net cash position in order for you to be able to afford it? like last year that in the -- at the top of the pandemic, your share price was really attractive, but i'm not sure that you have the balance sheet or that will to do the buyback at that point? so that's the first question. the second question is on the hedging. you have been quite aggressive putting in a lot of natural gas hedges.
two is that, i mean, with your low breakeven requirement and a very strong balance sheet, why put on the hedges so aggressively. and to some degree, even though you have the physical barrel or mcf to support it. but is that -- the fundamental basic is that you become a speculation on the direction of the commodity prices when you're doing in that way. thank you.
ezra yacob -- chief executive officer
yes, this is ezra, paul. thanks for the question. let me start by just outlining a little bit on the buyback, and then i'll hand it to tim driggers for a little more detail on it. you're right, buyback authorization we've had one previously, and we haven't exercised that in quite some time.
what we've done right now is we've refreshed it to a size that's a little more commensurate with the scale of our company today. and we plan to exercise the buybacks in more of an opportunistic way rather than something programmatic, is how we expect to be able to use it. and i'm going to ask tim to provide you a little more details on exercising it. 
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
sure. my microphone, i'm sorry. first of all, we will evaluate buybacks like any other investment decision, how does it create long-term shareholder value. so that will be the first thing we'll have to look at every time we make this decision.
specifically, to answer your question about could we have started during the pandemic, but didn't have the financial wherewithal to do that. you're exactly right. at that point in time, oil was negative. the price of oil was negative.
we had two bonds coming due totaling $1 billion. so had we been in the shape we're in today, that would have been a perfect time to buy shares, but we weren't in that same position we are today. that's why continuing to work on the balance sheet and positioning ourselves for the future has been so important to eog. so we should not ever have that situation again.
we have positioned the company to be able to opportunistically take advantage of these situations. 
ezra yacob -- chief executive officer
and paul, on the second question regarding our hedges, specifically gas, but really, in general, our hedging strategy hasn't changed at all. as you know, we invest on a very, very stringent hurdle rate, our premium and not double premium rate. that's based on a $40 oil price, but it's also based on a $2.50 natural gas price for the life of the well. and so, when we can opportunistically look to lock in some hedges north of $3, we feel very good about the returns that we're generating going forward on the gas price.
in general, we like to have a bit of hedges put on; whether oil or gas, it just give us a little bit of line of sight into our budgeting process as we enter into a new year. and so, really, that's the commentary on both the gas and the oil hedges. 
operator
the next question will come from arun jayaram. please go ahead.
arun jayaram -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
yeah, good morning. ezra, the 2021 cash return to equity holders has tallied just under 30% of cfo. if you add in debt, it's around 36% of your cfo. i know there's no formal framework in place, but how should investors be thinking about cash returns on a go-forward basis? and could this 30% be viewed at some sort of benchmark?
ezra yacob -- chief executive officer
yes, arun, this is ezra. no, i won't -- i would not take that as any type of benchmark. i think, we've been very clear for the last couple of years in talking about our framework for cash return, really just our free cash flow priorities. the emphasis, the priority really is on a sustainable growing regular dividend.
we think that's the hallmark. it's forward-looking. that's a hallmark of a very strong company. it hopefully sends a signal to everybody that -- of our confidence in the growing capital efficiency of our company.
obviously, we've talked about some low-cost property bolt-on acquisitions. we've highlighted those on the last call and in the slide deck today. we, obviously, covered a very strong, not just strong but really a pristine balance sheet. and then, to the last part of -- really the other part of your question is our other cash return options for excess free cash flow, which are the special dividends, and then as tim was just mentioning some of the share repurchases.
and as we've said, we're very committed to returning excess free cash flow. we have stayed away from a specific formula because we like to be able to -- we try not to run the company on a quarter-to-quarter basis. we try to take a longer view of things. we realize that there are times when potentially the cash on hand may need to move up or down, but regardless of it over the long term, i think, we've demonstrated, especially this year that we're very committed to returning that excess free cash flow. 
arun jayaram -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
great. and my follow-up, was the dividend increase to $3 on an annualized basis, ezra that will represent just over $1.75 billion in annual outlays to equity holders for the dividend. how should investors be thinking about future growth? does this temper? how we should think about longer-term production growth given the higher mix of dividend payments? 
ezra yacob -- chief executive officer
yes, arun, the step-up this year in the regular dividend is really a reflection of what we've been doing for the last five years and reinvesting this in the premium wells. we've been seeing it slowly but surely show up in our financial performance, as we've lowered the cost basis of the company. and the confidence going forward really is what we're seeing with our change in focus over the past 18 months to these double premium wells. we feel that it's providing another step change in operational performance that should filter through to a step change in financial performance, as we've witnessed with that change to premium.
and then, our inventory, of course, is spread across multiple basins. we have 5,800 of these double premium locations and over 11,000 of the premium locations, and we're adding to that every day. our employees are working through either identifying low-cost bolt-on acquisition opportunities, sustainable well cost reductions. as we've highlighted this quarter, stronger well productivity.
and then, of course, our low-cost entry into organic exploration opportunities to further expand both the quantity and the quality of that inventory. so i think, as we continue moving forward and sticking to our game plan of investing in double premium, it has the potential to continue to expand the free cash flow potential of eog and thereby continue to provide an opportunity for us to remain committed to sustainably growing our dividend.
operator
our next question will come from jeanine wai with barclays. please go ahead.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
good morning, everyone. thanks for taking our questions. our first question is on special dividend. in terms of the timing and the process for that, when you look at the potential to announce one what did you see this time around that perhaps you didn't see last quarter when you decided to forgo a special dividend? 
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
jeanine, this is tim. so as already been stated, we are committed to our free cash flow priorities, and that has not changed. so we look at all the factors every quarter to determine when is the right time to do either a special dividend or now the share buybacks or increase the regular dividend. so when we looked at our cash balance at september 30, it was sitting at $4.3 billion.
that gives us -- that leaves us well-positioned to pay off our bond in 2023, and provide this $2 special dividend. so it's a combination of all those factors. and we felt this was a meaningful amount of cash to return at this time. 
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
ok, great. and then, my second question, maybe following up on arun's question on the base dividend. so the large increase in the base. it seems like it's a catch up to close the gap between what the business can support given the premium and double-premium wells like you just said and what was actually getting paid out.
so i guess, in terms of the timing also on the base, we're just curious how much of a factor the potential that you now see in your exploration plays factored into the decision to increase the base?
ezra yacob -- chief executive officer
yes, jeanine, this is ezra again. it's not just the exploration plays. it's really just our confidence in being able to expand the overall inventory, the quality of the inventory into that double premium. and some of it comes from the announcements that you saw in this quarterly on the quarter results, the stronger well productivity supporting better than guidance volumes, the better-than-guidance capex, driven by sustainable well cost reductions.
so when i think about that, i think about our existing inventory increasing in performance and quality. and then, i think about converting some of our premium wells into double-premium status. and then, of course, we have identified small bolt-on acquisitions where we can continue to grow and expand that inventory level for us. and then, as you highlighted, we've got the organic exploration mix.
we're drilling 15 wells this year that we've talked about that are not in the publicly disclosed plays. those plays are at various states of either initial drilling, collecting of data or kind of evaluating, as we've talked about on other calls, repeatability, production performance of those plays. and so, we're very excited and confident in our ability to continue to expand. and as i said, increase the quality of our double premium inventory.
and ultimately, that's what gives us the confidence to be able to see that we can continue to lower the cost base of the company, increase the capital efficiency of eog and continue to support a sustainably growing base dividend, which is our commitment. 
operator
our next question will come from scott gruber with citigroup. please go ahead.
scott gruber -- citi -- analyst
yes, good morning. so in your deck, you mentioned a carbon capture pilot project, which is interesting. ezra, can you speak to your early ambitions in carbon capture? are you looking strictly at eor? you investigating pure storage and what level of resources have you committed internally to the initiatives? 
ezra yacob -- chief executive officer
yes, scott. i appreciate the question. i'm going to ask ken boedeker to address it. 
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
yes, scott. we're continuing to make good progress on that initial carbon capture project that we've talked about. we've finalized many of the below-ground geologic studies and we're currently working on the engineering and regulatory portions of the project. as we work our way through these steps, we'll get more clarity on timing.
but right now, we hope to initiate co2 injection in late 2022. in terms of capital that we're allocating toward it, it's roughly 2% to 3% of our budget. it's gonna be allocated toward all of our esg projects, is what we see. 
scott gruber -- citi -- analyst
got it. and as you investigate the opportunity, how are you thinking about participating in the value chain? would you be interested in entering transport. obviously, it's an exciting opportunity, but get more capital intensive as you kind of broaden participation. so just how are you thinking about the broader opportunity in participating across the value chain?
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
yes, scott, we're really not going to change the business that we're in. we're looking at carbon capture right now to significantly reduce our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions at this point. that business is a much lower-return business than what we see with our well development that we have. so we'll keep an eye on that, but our real goal for carbon capture is just reducing our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, which we've made significant progress on it in the last several years.
operator
our next question will come from leo mariani with keybanc. please go ahead.
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey, guys. just looking at the guidance here for fourth quarter, we can certainly see some pretty significant growth in u.s. gas. obviously, looking at gas prices right now, we're at multiyear highs at this point in time.
should we see that as a bit of a signal that eog is perhaps flexing up a little bit on the natural gas side to try to capture what are probably some fantastic returns at the current prices here?
billy helms -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, leo, this is billy helms. so on the capex side, certainly, part of our program, as we laid out earlier this year, was just advance some of our dorado prospect in south texas, as you know, it's a very competitive gas play with the rest of the plays in the u.s. and we've been very pleased with the results there. but we remain disciplined to only complete the 15 wells we targeted and laid out at the start of this year.
and it's really a little bit early to be talking about what we're going to look like next year. but obviously, with the results we're seeing, we're very pleased with the results being -- meeting or exceeding the type curves we have laid out. that certainly gives us an option to look at increasing activity there. so it's a little bit early yet to be saying what we're going to do next year, but we're very pleased with what we've seen. 
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok, that's helpful. and i guess, obviously, in your prepared comments, you still spoke about the fact that probably be challenging to kind of meet all the necessary conditions at year-end '21. and that you all have laid out to put any type of real oil growth back in the market at this point in time. but i guess, i've certainly heard some rumblings lately that perhaps we might already be at kind of pre-pandemic demand levels here as we work our way into november.
i think, opec+ has a plan to reduce its spare capacity pretty dramatically by mid-'22. just wanted to get a sense if you think perhaps in the mid- to second-half part of '22, there's a good shot at kind of hitting the conditions that eog has laid out to potentially put a little growth back in the market. 
ezra yacob -- chief executive officer
yes, leo, this is ezra. as billy said, typically, we don't provide guidance for the following year on this call. but in general, our focus on 2022 the potential for that and us, as you highlighted, the things that we're looking at, we're focused on remaining disciplined and that hasn't changed. as we look into 2022, there are the three items that you referenced that should signal a bit of a balanced market.
at first, is demand, which has probably surprised to the upside a bit with just how quickly we've approached pre-covid levels. the second is gonna be the inventory numbers, which for us, we'd like to see at or below the five-year average, which they're currently there right now, but that brings up kind of that third item that you spoke to, which is the spare capacity. and we'd like to see that spare capacity back to low levels more in line with historic trends. so as we sit here today, 2022 is looking like a year of transition.
spare capacity is going to come back online at the scheduled rate that should translate into rising inventory levels. and if things move forward, we could be looking at a balanced market sometime in the first half of '22. for us, for eog in a scenario like that, we could probably return to maybe our pre-covid levels of oil production around that 465,000 barrels a day mark. that would represent no more than 5% growth next year.
but again, that's as we're sitting here today, we'll be officially firming up that 2022 plan and watching how the market develops over the next couple of months. but as we're witnessing, bringing spare capacity back online has hit some snags. so we're watching to see if is that more routine start-up challenges or is that more structural in nature due to underinvestment. and those two factors are going to be just as important as seeing how the continued demand recovery from covid really develops with any potential future lockdowns, so on and so forth.
so ultimately, we continue to remain to be disciplined going forward.

our next question will come from charles meade with johnson rice. please go ahead.
charles meade -- johnson rice -- analyst
good morning to you and the whole eog team there. you actually anticipated -- large part of my question with your answer to the last one, but maybe just to dial in on it a little more closely. how far out do you think your view holds or your ability to look at the balance or unbalance in the oil market? and then, once you did see a call to increase your oil activity, how long would it be before we actually saw it in the public markets in your quarterly financials?
ezra yacob -- chief executive officer
yes, charles, thanks for the question. i'll answer the first part of it and then ask billy to provide a little bit more color also. how far out we can see the balance or the imbalance? to be perfectly honest, we're watching a lot of the same things that all of you are, those three things that we highlighted. demand has recovered pretty aggressively, i would say.
i think, it's surprised to everybody. and then, the inventory numbers in concert with the spare capacity coming back online. and the spare capacity, again, if you simply look at the schedules that have been laid out and everybody sticks to the schedules and the supply actually comes back online, that would contemplate some time in the front half of the year. but as i highlighted and everyone's been seeing, there are some challenges or hurdles to getting all that spare capacity back online.
as far as the color on what we would be looking at, perhaps billy can speak to it.
billy helms -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, charles, as far as how long it would take before we'd see any response, especially showing up in our financials, if you just simply look at when we see the signal and then the time we deploy rigs and get the wells completed and on production, takes usually three to four months. so you'd start seeing it no earlier than that, but probably some time a quarter or two after, so to have a meaningful difference in financial performance. 
charles meade -- johnson rice -- analyst
got it. so if i'm understanding you correctly, it would be two quarters, maybe you start to see it nearly three quarters before there was a real delta.
billy helms -- president and chief operating officer
that's correct.
charles meade -- johnson rice -- analyst
great. and then, just one quick follow-up for tim. and i think, you partly addressed this in your earlier comment. in the past, i recall you guys have talked about a target of $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet.
with this new $5 billion share authorization in a slightly different posture about wanting to have some dry powder, does that mean that your target for $2 billion of cash? and i recognize you're not always going to be at the target, but does that mean that the target has gone north of that? and if so, has it gone to $3 billion or $4 billion? or what's your thinking? 
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
no, we haven't changed our target. we will continue to monitor that through the cycle and see there's all sorts of factors we have to take into consideration for the cash balance, as you know, working capital changes, for example, as prices swing up and down. so that's a big consideration. but no, it has not changed.
the authorization has not changed our philosophy on the cash balance. 
operator
our next question will come from neal dingmann with truist securities. please go ahead.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
good morning. i don't want to belabor this just on the growth in reinvestment. but i just want to make sure i'm clear on this, you guys have been quite clear about returns. i just want to make sure that i'm certain around the priority about the moderating reinvestment rate in order to drive the cash returns.
is that what i'm hearing over growth? 
ezra yacob -- chief executive officer
yes, neal, when we think about moving forward, we've done a lot on reinvesting and building this company to take a bit of a step away from the commodity price cycles by focusing in on the premium wells and now double premium strategy. the growth for us has always been an output of our ability to reinvest at high rates of return. through 2017 to 2019, during a period of rapid growth for the industry. in fact, we are reinvesting only at a rate of about 78% and still generating free cash flow every year and putting that toward an aggressively growing base dividend.
so the strategy for us hasn't really changed. i think we've talked about potentially watching the macro environment a little bit more to help formulate our plans year to year. and that's where it falls in line with what we've been discussing over the last couple of questions. we still remain very committed to that.
we don't want to push barrels into a market that's oversupplied or doesn't need the barrels. and so, we'll be looking for the right time to see if the market needs our barrels before contemplating any return to growth.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
very good. very clear. and then, just to follow up on -- i asked earlier about -- it looks like you all had been adding a little bit of gas hedges. is that in relation to -- does that mean that you've been increasing the focus on the dorado play, given what natural gas prices are doing? so i guess, i'm just wondering are the two correlated? or are you adding to that activity in the dorado?
billy helms -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, neal, this is billy helms. so as far as the volume of gas hedges and what we've been doing there, it really is not focused strictly on dorado. it's simply -- it goes back to our premium strategy as we displayed out. it's based on a $40 oil and a $2.50 gas price.
we saw the opportunity to lock in gas prices above $3. so it gave us encouragement of locking in returns over the next several years at those prices. we have gas production quite a bit, as you know, in dorado, but also quite a bit in other plays as well. so it just helps ensure locking in returns over a multiyear period. 
operator
our next question will come from scott hanold with rbc. please go ahead.
scott hanold -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yeah, thanks. i'm going to try, as i know you'll probably give me the answer, that you'll talk about the budget next year. but if i could talk about it more big picture, if we all think of just a base maintenance spending levels into 2022. has the capital changed too much from what you all did this year? like what would be the puts and takes from that? because it seems like your well costs are going to hold pretty steadily.
so is sort of your maintenance capex case this year somewhat similar to what it would be next year, all as being equal? or is there anything else to consider? 
ezra yacob -- chief executive officer
yes, scott, this is ezra. and we'll talk about next year's budget next year. i'd say that a little bit facetiously for you. but quite frankly, i think we haven't updated our maintenance capital number yet.
we'll provide that number commensurate with our plans laid out next year. but i think, what you can see is that our team continues to make great progress in sustainable well cost reductions through their efficiency gains and applying innovation and technology. and i think, billy highlighted pretty well that we feel very confident that we achieved our first initial goal, i should say, a 5% well cost reduction, and we're in line to reduce our cost 7% this year. and we feel that a lot of those costs are what's going to insulate us against some of the inflationary pressures out there. 
scott hanold -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
and how about like just on -- was there anything unusual you'd say this year that we should think about next year in terms of like exploration play or esg spending? is there any reason for us to think about that any differently? 
ezra yacob -- chief executive officer
no, scott, really, over the last few years, a lot of our percentage dedicated toward exploration and esg have been pretty consistent. 
operator
our next question will come from doug leggate with bank of america. please go ahead.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
oh, thanks. good morning, everybody. ezra, i think your share price reaction today, i think you can see the market's response to the greater cash returns. i'm wondering why is it reluctant seemingly still from eog to provide a framework around the proportion of cash returns? it seems to be a persistent barrier perhaps to recognition of sustainable free cash flow, which at the end of the day is what defines the value.
i'm just wondering why there's a reluctance not to commit to or at least lay out some kind of framework as to how you think about the go-forward cash returns as opposed to one-off special dividends. 
ezra yacob -- chief executive officer
yes, doug. it's a question that we've been answering. and we feel that we have provided a framework for our free cash flow priorities. it's as you mentioned, the sustainable growing base dividend, to strengthen the balance sheet, these low-cost property acquisitions.
and then, more on point with your question, the other cash return options, which are special dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. and in a lot of ways, when we look back, i think we've shown our commitment to that, not only this year, with committing to $2.7 billion return in dividends over year-to-date free cash flow generation of about $3.5 billion. but i think, we added a slide into the deck that shows longer term what we've been able to do in providing just over $5 billion of free cash flow return since 2016 on about $10.9 billion of free cash flow generated. and so, i think, we've laid out a framework.
i think our two announcements this year on special dividends totaling $3 per share on the specials really demonstrates our commitment to it. and as far as having the ability for our investors to see through and capitalize on that number, i think we've demonstrated our commitment to the point where the investors can capitalize on some of our excess free cash flow. to us, we still remain committed to delivering on those free cash flow priorities. we do want to continue to make decisions based on what we think.
we will create the most significant long-term shareholder value. and that means sometimes not necessarily running the business on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but really taking a longer-term approach. and so, locking ourselves into a formula that might have to change as conditions change is really at the heart of our reluctance to do that. 
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah, i understand that. i guess, it's a moving piece. maybe my follow-up is related then. i want to talk specifically about the buyback.
there's been a lot of reference to the '16, '19 period. and you know the history. it was a subsidized environment. you doubled production.
saudi was taking oil off the market, and we all see how that ended. so we know what the response to the industry has been. but i want to get specifically to your view of mid-cycle and how you think then about the relative priorities around mid cycle. what is your definition of mid cycle? and how should we think about growth versus growth per share given the buyback announcement?
ezra yacob -- chief executive officer
well, doug, i don't think i'm comfortable getting into mid-cycle metrics on here. but what i would tell you is we continue to think of this buyback as opportunistic. we think, again, with our authorization in place, we want to use it in a way that we feel confident we're gonna be generating long-term shareholder value. more often than not, for us, that's going to tend toward special dividends and we're going to reserve our buyback authorizations to be used really just in times of dislocations and you use it opportunistically rather than a more programmatic method.

our next question will come from bob brackett with bernstein research. please go ahead.
bob brackett -- bernstein research -- analyst
good morning. it looks like you turned a couple of pads on in dorado in the third quarter. any color or commentary there, hitting expectations, exceeding?
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
yeah, bob, this is ken. as billy said earlier, we have turned on several wells in the last few months. and the color is, as all of them are at or above our type curve and what our plans were going into the year. we do have one drilling rig active in the play right now, and we're really moving rapidly up the learning curve.
again, just to reiterate, this play is really double premium returns and it's competitive for capital with our oil plays. 
bob brackett -- bernstein research -- analyst
great. thanks for that.
operator
our next question will come from neil mehta with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning. good morning, team. as every new ceo has an opportunity to put their own thumbprint on the business and recognize that you're a part of the prior leadership team as well. but just talk about your early observations as the new leader of the organization, any subtle changes that you're making? and talking about your messages to your internal and external stakeholders that you want the market to be aware of.
ezra yacob -- chief executive officer
yes, neil, i appreciate the question and the opportunity. i think, the biggest thing for our investors, our employees, everyone who's listening to the call is that eog has got a proven track record. our strategy works. the shift to premium strategy has put us on a different trajectory and the shift to double premium is going to do that as well.
the culture of eog, the people at eog has always been our competitive advantage, and that will continue to be that way. honestly, neil, the most important thing we can do as a leadership team is put our employees in a position to succeed where they can really contribute to the best of their abilities. and that's what we try to do every day. and that's going to translate into, not only our operational performance that would you see the results of this quarter, but to our financial performance as well. 
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks, ezra. the follow-up is that i appreciate the slide that shows the breakdown of the well costs and how you guys are ahead of your competition in terms of managing and mitigating some of these inflationary pressures. as you step back and think about the u.s. oil industry broadly, do you think this is ultimately going to be a challenge? these inflationary pressures to restart the shale machine and -- in which of these bottlenecks do you worry about the most in terms of being a constraint on the ability to -- for the industry to grow again? 
billy helms -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, neil, this is billy helms. certainly, as an industry is seeing, we're seeing quite a bit of inflationary pressure, mainly in three areas, i would say, steel prices, so tubulars; labor, which is certainly affects all industries and then fuel. those are probably the three inflationary pressures that are throughout our industry and really throughout all industries. the one thing that i think is going to be -- or maybe two things, two top priorities would be probably steel.
i think, availability of tubulars is something that i think most companies are struggling with or dealing with, i guess. and then, the other one would be labor and is getting enough people to manage the activity levels. just to maybe give you a little bit color then on where eog sits. each year, we try to get ahead of the curve and lock in a certain amount of our services to secure activity, but in this case, also protect us from inflation.
so for instance, in 2021, we protected about 65% of our well cost going into the year. and as a result of that, plus the improving efficiencies, we were able to reduce our average well cost by about 7% as ezra stated earlier. so during the year, though, we also took advantage and renegotiated many of our services at lower rates and lock them through -- in through the end of next year. so going into 2022, we expect to have about 50% of our well costs secured.
and with over 90% of our drilling rigs secured at lower rates and also 50% of our frack fleets secured. so we expect to see inflation certainly in items such as steel, labor and fuel, just like everybody else. but by doing that, we've given ourselves visibility into areas of also improving efficiencies that we expect to offset much of this inflation. so we're still confident we can keep well cost at least flat going into next year. 
operator
our next question will come from michael scialla with stifel. please go ahead. 
michael scialla -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yeah, hi, good morning. it's not a high-level question. ezra, on your long-term outlook, as you think about the energy transition, how are you thinking about oil versus natural gas? is there any preference there? and are any of the exploration plays focused on gas? are they all on oil? 
ezra yacob -- chief executive officer
yeah, thank you, michael. long term, we believe that hydrocarbons are going to have -- be a significant part of the energy solution long term. obviously, we need to do, as an industry, a better job with our emissions profile. but when you think about oil and natural gas, they both go to different markets, dominantly.
your natural gas essentially is more on your power side and potentially in direct competition with things such as coal and your renewables. and then, your oil transportation -- your oil, obviously, is a little more focused on transportation. in general, when i think longer term, i think the energy transition is gonna be significantly slower than oftentimes you hear about, and we're very bullish on the prospects for both. as far as the exploration plays go, as we've said in the past, dominantly, the exploration plays are all oil focused. 
michael scialla -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok, thanks for that. and ken, you had said on your co2 pilot -- or excuse me, your ccs pilot, i think you said you plan to inject in late '22. that seems to suggest you would not need a class vi permit. so i'm wondering, is it fair to say you're reinjecting co2 into an eor project? and when you say it's not really economically competitive with your upstream business.
are you planning on capturing 45 tax credits with any of your projects? 
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
yes, michael, this is ken. to answer your question on the tax credit side, we are planning on capturing 45q tax credits. our goal in terms of what class a permit that we would secure. we believe that we will initially secure a class ii permit that can be converted.
we'll go through all of the regulatory requirements to be able to convert it to a class vi later in its life. but that's what the plan is for our ccs project at this point. 
operator
our next question will come from paul sankey with sankey research. please go ahead.
paul sankey -- sankey research -- analyst
hi, guys. just very quickly on -- can you talk about your lng or downstream natural gas strategy?
lance terveen -- senior vice president, marketing
thanks, paul. hi, good morning, this is lance. hey, thanks for your question, and good morning. yes, we're -- the team is definitely executing.
you've seen several of our slides that we've put back talking a lot about our transportation position, is so incredibly valuable. we can move gas from all our different basins from the permian basin, from the eagle ford. we talked a lot about dorado earlier. and then, with that, it gets access as you look along the gulf coast and you look at the lng demand, especially that's growing over time.
obviously, we've got a position there that we started and just really speaks to being a first-mover, especially when you think about lng. we went through a whole bd effort kind of '17 and '18. we got the contracts finalized in 2020. and in 2021, obviously, we're definitely seeing the value of that contract.
so being a first-mover, it is absolutely important. and yes, we're going to continue to look at new opportunities from an lng standpoint and very well-positioned. again, it gets back to our transport, our export capacities and just having that ability to transact, we can definitely be very nimble as we even think about new opportunities.
paul sankey -- sankey research -- analyst
got it. and then, a follow-up on the buyback. i'm not clear. are you saying that it's a shelf ability to buyback shares when you want? or are you actually going to try and get through this amount in, let's say, the next 12 months? 
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
paul, this is tim. we do not have a time line on when we plan to buyback the $5 billion. when the opportunity presents itself, we will be in the market.

this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to ezra yacob for any closing remarks. 
ezra yacob -- chief executive officer
yes. we just want to thank each of you for participating in our call this morning, and thank our shareholders for their support. as i highlighted at the start of the call, eog's competitive advantage is our employees, and they deserve all the credit for delivering another outstanding quarter. so thank you, and enjoy the weekend.

good day, everyone, and welcome to eog resources third quarter 2021 earnings results conference call. as a reminder, this call is being recorded. at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, i would like to turn the call over to chief financial officer of eog resources, mr. tim driggers.
please go ahead, sir.
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
good morning, and thanks for joining us. this conference call includes forward-looking statements. factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and eog's sec filings. this conference call also contains certain non-gaap financial measures.
definitions and reconciliation schedules for these non-gaap measures can be found on eog's website. participating on the call this morning are ezra yacob, chief executive officer; billy helms, president and chief operating officer; ken boedeker, evp, exploration and production; jeff leitzell evp, exploration and production; lance terveen, senior vp, marketing; and david streit, vp, investor and public relations. here's ezra yacob.
ezra yacob -- chief executive officer
thank you, tim. good morning, everyone. eog is delivering on our free cash flow priorities. yesterday, we announced an 82% increase to our regular dividend to an annual rate of $3 per share, a $2 per share special dividend and an update to our share buyback authorization to $5 billion.
these cash return announcements reflect eog's consistent outstanding performance and are the direct result of our disciplined approach to high-return investment. during the third quarter, we set new quarterly earnings and cash flow records. adjusted net income of $1.3 billion or $2.16 per share and free cash flow of $1.4 billion. the strength of our current and future earnings and cash flow that supports both dividend announcements can be traced back to 2016.
amid a potentially prolonged low commodity price environment, we made a permanent upgrade to our investment criteria. our premium hurdle rate was established not only to protect the company's profitability in 2016, but all future commodity cycles. the discipline to only invest in new wells that earn a minimum 30% direct after-tax rate of return, assuming a $40 oil price for the life of the well continues to improve our capital efficiency, profitability and cash flow. our employees immediately embraced the challenge of this new investment hurdle.
and by the second half of 2016, eog was reinvesting capital and paying the dividend within cash flow. we have generated free cash flow every year since. from 2017 to 2019, we generated enough free cash flow to significantly reduce net debt by $2.2 billion, while also increasing the dividend rate 72%. we also expanded our inventory of premium wells by more than three times.
while adding inventory that meets the minimum premium threshold increases quantity, our goal through technical innovation and organic exploration is to add higher quality inventory. our employees, empowered by eog's unique culture applied innovation and efficiencies to raise the return of much of the existing inventory while adding higher rate of return wells through exploration. the premium standard established in 2016 and the momentum that followed provided a step change in operational and by extension financial performance, which set the stage for the second upgrade to our reinvestment hurdle rate, double premium. double premium, which is a minimum return hurdle of 60% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil was initiated during the depth of last year's unprecedented down cycle.
that capital discipline enabled eog to deliver extraordinary results in a $39 oil price environment last year. using such stringent hurdle rates prepared the company not only for 2020 but for our stellar results this year. there is no clear indication of the impact premium and now double premium has had on our confidence in eog's future profitability than the 82% increase to our regular dividend announced yesterday. combined with the 10% increase made in february of this year, we have doubled our annual dividend rate from $1.50 per share to $3 per share.
after weathering two downturns during which we did not cut nor to spend the dividend -- suspend the dividend, the new annual rate of $3 per share reflects the significant improvement in eog's capital efficiency since the transition to premium drilling. going forward, we are confident that double-premium will continue to improve the financial performance just like premium did five years ago. we are also confident in our ability to continue adding to our double-premium inventory without any need for expensive m&a by improving our existing assets and adding new plays from our deep pipeline of organic exploration prospects, developing high-return, low-cost reserves that meet our stringent double premium hurdle rate, expands our future free cash flow potential and supports eog's commitment to sustainably growing our regular dividend. eog's focus on returns, disciplined growth, strong free cash flow generation and sustainability remain constant.
just as our free cash flow priorities are consistent, so remains our broader strategy and culture, eog's competitive advantage is our people and today's announcements are a reflection of our culture of innovation and execution. looking toward 2022, oil market supply and demand fundamentals are improving but remain dynamic. while it's unlikely the market will be fully balanced by the end of 2021, we will continue to monitor macro fundamentals, as we plan for next year. we are committed to maintaining production until the oil market needs additional barrels.
under any scenario, we remain focused on driving sustainable efficiency improvements. we are well-positioned to offset inflationary price pressures to help keep our well costs flat next year. to summarize this quarter's earnings release in three points: first, our fundamental strategy of investing in high-return projects consistently executed year after year is delivering outstanding financial results. second, we are still getting better.
as we continue to expand our opportunity set to add double-premium inventory through sustainable well cost reductions and organic exploration, eog is set up to improve performance even further. and third, we are well-positioned to execute our high-return reinvestment program in 2022 to deliver another year of outstanding returns. here's tim to review our capital allocation strategy and our free cash flow priorities. 
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
thanks, ezra. as we have been progressing premium in the last five years, our capital allocation decisions have been guided by a set of long-standing, consistent priorities. first is high-return, disciplined reinvestment. our returns on capital investment have never been higher.
however, market fundamentals remain the no. 1 determinant of when to grow. second is the regular dividend, which we believe is the best way to return cash to shareholders. we have paid a dividend for 22 years without suspending or cutting it.
at the new level of $3 per year, we can comfortably fund both the dividend and maintenance capex at $40 wti. the combination of our low-cost structure, high returns and strong financial position will sustain this higher regular dividend. this resilient financial position is backstopped by our third priority, a pristine balance sheet with almost zero net debt. we remain firmly committed to a strong balance sheet.
it's not conservatism. it's a competitive advantage. fourth, we regularly review other cash return options, specifically special dividends and share buybacks. yesterday, we declared a special dividend for the second time in 2021 and updated our share buyback authorization.
share buybacks have always been part of our playbook and will remain an opportunistic cash return alternative. we are cognizant of the challenges of successfully executing a share buyback in a cyclical industry. we know and expect there will be periods in the future when the stock will be impacted by macro factors such as the commodity cycle, geopolitical events and other unforeseen events like the covid pandemic in 2020. the updated $5 billion authorization provides the flexibility to act and take advantage when the right opportunity presents itself.
we believe our strategy for the use of other cash return options is well designed to deliver value through the cycle. finally, we are not in the market for expensive m&a. it is simply a low return proposition. we can create much more value through organic reinvestment and our shareholders can do better with their excess cash.
our premium strategy generates back in their hands. since our shift to premium in 2016, eog has generated nearly $10 billion of free cash flow. with that cash flow, eog has reduced debt $1.5 billion increased the cash balance by $3.6 billion and will have returned more than $5 billion to shareholders by the end of 2021. this is a significant amount of shareholder value driven by premium.
today, eog is positioned to translate that value creation into even more cash returns to shareholders. in the third quarter, we generated a record $1.4 billion of free cash flow bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to $3.5 billion, which is equal to the total return of capital paid and committed this year to our regular dividend to special dividends and debt repayment. you can expect us to continue returning cash going forward. there might be times when we strategically increase or decrease the cash balance, but over time, the cash will go back to our shareholders.
here's billy.
billy helms -- president and chief operating officer
thanks, tim. as a result of the -- to the consistency of our operating performance, we delivered another quarter of outstanding results. i couldn't be more proud of the engagement of our employees and their culture of continuous improvement. their execution of our 2021 plan has been near perfect.
for the third quarter in a row, we produced more oil for less capital. that is we exceeded our production targets while spending less than our forecast for capital expenditures. well productivity, driven by our double premium hurdle rate, continues to outperform, while our drilling and completion teams pushed the envelope on new sustainable cost savings and expand those efficiencies throughout our active operating areas. examples include in-sourcing and redesigning drilling equipment, adopting innovative techniques to reduce nonproductive time, expanding super zipper completion operations and reducing sand and water sourcing cost.
our ability to continue to lower cost and deliver reliable execution quarter after quarter is tied to a common set of operating practices that together form a sustainable competitive advantage for eog. first, we are a multi-play company with activity spread across four different basins in the u.s. as conditions change, we have the flexibility to shift capital between plays to optimize returns. second, we are organized under a decentralized structure.
decisions are made by discrete focused teams closer to the operation rather than dictated by headquarters. our culture is non-bureaucratic and entrepreneurial. we empower our frontline employees to make decisions, bringing them to drive innovation and efficiency improvements. third, we have established strategic vendor relationships with our preferred service providers.
we are typically -- we are not typically the biggest beneficiary of price reductions during downturns, but we also tend to not be on the leading edge of price increases during the inflationary periods. fourth, we have taken ownership of the value-added parts of the drilling, completions and production supply chain by applying our operational expertise and proprietary technology to improve efficiency and lower cost. examples include sand, water, chemicals, drilling fluids, completion design, drilling motors, the marketing of our products and much more. as a result, our operating teams have complete ownership of driving improvements in every step.
and finally, we apply world-class information technology to every part of our operation. our data gathering and analysis capabilities continue to improve, which we leverage to better manage day-to-day field operations for more efficient use of resources, as well as discovering new innovations. as a result of these strategic advantages, we are confident in achieving our target of 7% well cost savings this year. this is an incredible accomplishment given the state of inflation.
and as we move into next year, we are on track to lock in 50% of our total well cost by the end of this year. we have locked in 90%-plus of our drilling rigs at rates that are flat to lower than 2020 and 2021. we've also secured more than 50% of our completion crews at favorable rates. while it's still early, the savings from these initiatives and other improvement efforts will continue to be realized next year, helping us offset the risk of additional inflation.
and thus, we remain confident that we will be able to keep well cost at least flat in 2022. now, here's ken. 
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
thanks, billy. last month, we published our 2020 sustainability report. as detailed in this report, we are focused on reducing emissions in the field. our flaring intensity rate decreased 43% in 2020 compared to 2019, which drove an overall 9% reduction in greenhouse gas intensity.
we continue to make progress toward our goal of zero routine-flaring across all our operations by 2025 with our more immediate goal of 99.8% wellhead gas capture this year. we also made significant progress on methane last year, reducing our methane emissions percentage by one-third to less than one-tenth of 1% of our natural gas production. since 2017, we've reduced our methane emission intensity percentage by 80%. our sustainability report profiles the technology and innovation that contributed to these improvements and illustrates why we are optimistic about future performance on our path to net zero by 2040.
examples of how we are addressing emissions in the field include closed-loop gas capture, which helps us continue to reduce flaring. we're leveraging information technology and our extensive data analysis capabilities from both mobile platforms and our central control rooms to better manage day-to-day operations. in addition, we are piloting technology in the field such as sensors and control devices that complement our already robust leak detection program. these are just a few examples of the initiatives we have underway.
like all efforts at eog, our sustainability strides are bottom-up-driven. creative ideas to improve our esg performance come from employees working in our operating areas every day. we have a long list of solutions we expect to pilot and profile in the future. our record of significantly reducing our ghg intensity over the last several years speaks for itself.
and we are committed to continuing to improve our emissions performance. now, here's ezra to wrap things up. 
ezra yacob -- chief executive officer
thank you, ken. our record-breaking operational and financial results throughout this year and the cash return announcements we made yesterday deserved to grab some headlines. however, the real story behind our performance is consistency of strategy supported by our unique culture. at the start of the call, i said there is no clear indication of the impact premium and now double premium has had on our confidence in eog's future profitability than the annual $3 per share regular dividend.
and while establishing the premium standard back in 2016 shifted us into a different gear culminating in the magnitude of our cash return this year, our fundamental strategy executed year after year by employees united by unique culture, dates back to the founding of the company. that's ultimately what gives me confidence that eog's best days are ahead. we are a return-focused organic exploration company that leverages technology and innovation to always get better, decentralized, non-bureaucratic. every employee is a business person first focused on creating value in the field at the asset level.
our financial strategy has always been and remains conservative, not just to offset the inherent risks in a cyclical business, but to take advantage of them. we are committed to the regular dividend and believe it is the best way to create consistent and dependable long-term value for shareholders. we have a proven track record that our strategy works and going forward, investors can expect more of the same, consistent execution year after year. thanks for listening.
we'll now go to q&a.

[operator instructions] our first question today comes from paul cheng from scotiabank. please go ahead. the line is yours.
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
hi, thank you. good morning, guys. first, we have been asked by many clients that with your capex plan and your production profile, if the current commodity price falls by mid-year, will you change the plan? or that under what circumstances that that plan may get revised? that's the first question. the second question is that in your future capital allocation, is 2022 the way how you allocate will be a reasonable proxy in the future? or will we see the percent in the new domestic drilling, which is about 10% this year, and also that the facility and the gathering and processing of those percentage will go up as a total percent of your capex as you're trying to prove up more new resource area? thank you.
ezra yacob -- president
yeah. paul, this is ezra. i'll answer the first question, and then i'll hand the second question over here to billy to answer for you. with regards to our plan this year, as we've talked about, the way we're approaching our planning is not based on the oil price that we're seeing.
we're really looking to see the broad market fundamentals that are underlying and supporting that oil price and other macroeconomic indicators. so when we look at our '22 plan, we think we've designed a very high-return capital program. it balances our free cash flow this year with increased free cash flow in future years. and it really starts with investing in the double premium wells.
when we bring those low-cost reserves into the company's financials, it helps drive down the cost basis of the company and it continues to expand the margins. it's what allows us to continue delivering high corporate level returns, as well as increase the cash flow potential of the company, and that further supports our free cash flow priorities. so the program this year is at a pace that allowed us to capture and incorporate technical learnings to continue to improve each of our assets. and that's the most important thing that we look to do every year, not only in 2022, but to go forward into future years as well.
and i'll turn it over to billy to answer the second part of the question.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yeah, paul. good morning. on the second part of the question, going forward beyond 2022 and the percent we have allocated to new domestic drilling potential are really our exploration plays and infrastructure spend, it's been fairly consistent in the past and i expect it to be fairly consistent going forward. the largest amount of our capex spend will always be dedicated to our more developing -- development plays like the delaware basin play.
and then, going forward, we remain excited about the exploration potential we see in many of our new emerging plays. and we'll continue to fund those at a pace where we can continue to learn and get better just as ezra mentioned. the infrastructure spend has always been about the same percentage each year, and i expect that will continue to be managed in the same way. we want to make sure that we don't get too far out in front with the infrastructure spending, but it's done at a pace commensurate with the development activity in a given area.
so i expect that will continue to be the case.
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question today comes from arun jayaram from j.p. morgan securities. please go ahead.
your line is now open.
arun jayaram -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good morning. global gas is clearly in focus right now. so i wanted to get your thoughts on the revamped agreement with cheniere, which will provide you more linkage to jkm. i think today, you're selling about 140,000 mmbtu, and that increases to 420 over time.
so i was wondering if you could give us a sense of timing and shed some light on the type of realizations you get from marketing the gas to lng? and how is the economic rent shared among you and cheniere.
lance terveen -- senior vice president, marketing
arun, hey, good morning. this is lance. thanks for taking my question. how are you today?
arun jayaram -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
doing well.
lance terveen -- senior vice president, marketing
well, hey. just saying good morning but hey, we're very excited about the new amendment that we have with cheniere. and you're exactly right, i mean, we've got 140,000 mmbtu today that started in 2020. and i think that just really speaks to being really a first mover too, because as you can see right now, you can look at the price realizations, you can see jkm spot prices are near $40, having that first-mover capability, moving quickly there to get that exposure is exactly right.
as you mentioned in your question, it's been very impactful in a positive way as we think about our price realizations. we're very excited about the commitment. you're right, it ramps up. so we've got the 140 today that will ramp to 420 as they go into service.
that's estimated to be probably with the first train here for stage three in 2026. but if you remember there, we ramp up. we kind of go to the 140 today we started into the 420 as stage three goes into service. and we still will maintain, and we extended the 300,000 mmbtu a day sale that we have that's linked to henry hub.
so we're excited about it. it's a brownfield facility. they've demonstrated being early on many of their projects. so we're excited to see our relationship grow from that standpoint and expect to see the price realizations materialize as well.
arun jayaram -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. and my follow-up is just on the 2022 program. ezra, you guided to 570 net wells, we want to get a bit more color on the decision to allocate more capital to the delaware versus eagle ford? it looks like your eagle ford activity will be down, call it, more than 50% year over year, while your delaware will be up 30% more, including a little bit more second bone activity. so i was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color there.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yeah. arun, this is billy helms. so yes, we're allocating a little bit more money to the delaware basin. and it's really just a function of the maturity of the eagle ford at this point.
the eagle ford has been an active play for more than, i guess, 12 years and certainly has been a highly economic play for the company and continues to be. i would remind everybody that last year was the single best returns we've ever generated in the eagle ford play since its inception 12 years ago. and so, it's still a very valuable play, but it is more mature. the delaware basin on the other hand is still a lot earlier in its maturity in this life cycle and still has a lot of opportunity to grow and test new horizons and expand our development capabilities over time.
so it's just a lot younger in its maturity phase. so i think it naturally will command a little bit more activity on that side.
arun jayaram -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok, great. thanks a lot.
operator
thank you. our next question today comes from doug leggate from bank of america. please go ahead. the line is yours.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning, ezra. good morning, team. guys, last time i spoke to you, you were talking about the mix of the double premium wells in the production profile and of course the impact on sustaining capital and breakeven oil prices. so i wonder if you could just walk us through how you see that? the 32 breakeven you've given us today obviously comes with a, i guess, some element of growth in the capital.
so how do you see the sustaining capital? how do you see that breakeven trending? that's my first question.
ezra yacob -- president
yeah. doug, this is ezra. thanks for the question. our maintenance capital on the back of a 7% well cost reduction last year and then additional well improvement, combined with increasing the percentage of double premium wells.
and what i mean by that is a lower cost of the reserves, bringing those into the company's financials. our maintenance capital continues to decrease, which is fantastic for us. you're right, the $32 breakeven that we provided today is actually with our -- commensurate with the capex program that we have for this year. but the double premium wells, we can't stress enough.
not only is it -- does the impact show out on very rapid payout and a high rate of return, but really by bringing those lower-cost reserves and a lower decline into the base of the company, over time, it really does start to show up an impact the full cycle returns and free cash flow generation potential of the company in the future.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
so where do you think those two numbers are today, the sustaining capital and the ex-growth breakeven?
ezra yacob -- president
yeah. so we didn't release a maintenance capital this earnings call due to the fact that we've started to allocate some additional capital into the dorado play. and so, it starts to get a little bit messy as you start going from oil into a boe equivalent as we are starting to see the phenomenal results there with the dorado play as we dedicate additional capital to it. nevertheless, i think what we've outlined is with the 7% well cost reduction and slight improvements on the well mix year over year, we've continued to drive down that breakeven.
and for the full cycle return, we have a slide in our deck that shows the one way that we like to present it is the price required for a 10% return on capital employed. and you can see we made a big step change last year as we drove that price down to $44.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. thank you for that. my follow-up is a capital allocation question, and it's really -- maybe it's for tim. the free cash flow you're showing in your slide deck of north of $4 billion a year after the special, could essentially wipe out the majority of your share buyback authorization.
i'm just wondering why you still feel no need to offer some kind of capital return framework. because clearly, with the transparency of that breakeven level with the duration of your inventory and so on, valuation becomes a little bit more transparent. therefore, buybacks could perhaps be more justifiable. so i'm just curious why you've been reluctant now to go down that route? i'll leave it there.
thanks.
ezra yacob -- president
yeah, doug. this is ezra again. just to reiterate our free cash flow priorities. now, first, the commitment begins with the sustainable dividend growth of our regular dividend.
in '21, we doubled that regular dividend. and to us, that regular dividend is really indicative of what we're trying to accomplish. it reflects the continuing increase in the go-forward capital efficiency of the company. and it's also focused on creating through-the-cycle value and free cash flow, and that's ultimately what we're trying to do.
again, going back to what we were just talking about with the investment in the double premium wells and lowering the cost base of the company, trying to take at least a small step away from the inevitable commodity price cycles of our industry. the second free cash flow priority for us is a pristine balance sheet, which obviously provides tremendous competitive advantage in a cyclical industry. and then, the third, what we're talking about right now is the additional cash return in the form of specials or opportunistic repurchases. and as we talked about, last year, we demonstrated the commitment with $2.7 billion in cash return through the form of $3 per share special dividends and are regular.
and then, we also retired that $750 million bond early in the year. in general, what we've talked about is we're going to use our -- reserve our repurchase opportunities to be more opportunistic than programmatic. so in times one way to think is that in times of rising share or oil price, you can expect us to prefer to do special dividends. and really, the way that we think about the share repurchase is, we measure it as an investment the same as we measure any investments across our business.
so we want to make sure that it competes on a returns basis. and that's why we still prefer in an environment like this to stick with the special dividend as the priority for additional cash return.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i'll keep pressing on it. thanks, ezra.
ezra yacob -- president
thank you, doug.

thank you. our next question today comes from scott gruber from citigroup. please go ahead. your line is open.
scott gruber -- citi -- analyst
hi. good morning. just following on that line of questioning, given that your net debt negative here at the start of the year, should we think about the cash build as largely being over?
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
this is tim. no. first of all, we are excited to have to be in a position where we are to have a cash balance going -- our net cash balance going forward. so we will continue -- as i said in my opening remarks, we'll continue to build cash on the balance sheet during these high oil price scenarios and look to -- for opportunities in the countercyclical times to deploy that cash in a meaningful way in the form of more specials or stock buybacks or just opportunistic things that come along in the countercyclical environment.
so the answer, again, is no, we will be -- in these high price environment, we will be building more cash on the balance sheet.
scott gruber -- citi -- analyst
got you. appreciate the clarification. and then, congrats on the expanded export agreement. just thinking about the broader backdrop here, there's likely another round of lng project sanctioning along the gulf coast.
it seems like the industry is in an advantaged position there. how aggressive eog be on entering additional agreements, thinking kind of similar terms? do you guys foresee and expanded jkm to henry hub spread that you'd want to capture? do you think that's sustainable and you want to capture that spread? or do you kind of look at additional agreements more through traditional diversification lens?
lance terveen -- senior vice president, marketing
yeah, scott. hey. thanks for your question. this is lance.
i think what i can really point you to is like you think about each of our operating areas and you think about our transportation positions that we have, it really puts us, one, we're in close proximity, but two, we have the capability that we can transact very quickly. so i think first, i would point you to that. and then, i'd say secondly, yes, we're always interested in new opportunities. so we'll be continuing to look at that from like a business development standpoint.
and it's really going to be commensurate like you heard from billy as you talk about -- as you think about growth, our volumes. and then, as we move forward, we'll be looking at new opportunities, but that will be definitely commensurate with our plans on a go forward as we look at our plan.
scott gruber -- citi -- analyst
that's it. appreciate the color. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question today comes from neal dingmann from truist securities. please go ahead. the line is yours.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
good morning. appreciate the details so far. maybe for you or tim, maybe just ask one more on the shareholder return. i know most popular question.
but you guys continue now to pay out over 50% of your free cash flow. and i'm just wondering on a go forward, i know there were some estimates out there thinking you all would even have potentially a higher payout. is that something that you're targeting? i know you're not going to have the exact metrics on how you want to pay out up to a certain amount. but is that something internally you're always continuing to sort of look at paying out over 50% or 60% or something like that on a go-forward, given your strong free cash flow?
ezra yacob -- president
yeah. thanks for the question. this is ezra. we continue to evaluate our cash position with respect to dividends on a quarterly basis.
and what i would say is that, you're correct, we're thrilled to be in the position where we are, where we can offer to the shareholders such a competitive regular base dividend that, again, i think, is our no. 1 priority as a way to create value through the cycles. but on top of that, we are in a great position to offer continued strength of our balance sheet to support that dividend and then continue to offer cash return -- additional cash return of excess free cash flow in the form of these specials and buybacks. we don't have a specific target that we do.
we stay away from providing a formula because we want to be able to have the flexibility to do the right thing at the right time to really maximize the shareholder value in a way that is protected through the cycles. said another way, i think we've demonstrated that over the past year. we've taken the opportunity to both strengthen the balance sheet last year. and again, last year pay out a significant amount, $2.7 billion in cash returns.
and we've doubled down on that basically with this first quarter announcement with the $1.75 per share cash return this quarter. and essentially, that reflects the evaluation, the positive commodity price environment that we were experiencing in and the strength of the underlying business and our confidence in it going forward.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
can't help but notice a nice bump on the ngl guide. maybe could you talk about it? can you -- [inaudible] wells up in the sort of liquids utica area, is that what's driving the growth there? or if you could talk about sort of plans in the marcellus type area, or the appalachian area if you see it feasible?
ezra yacob -- president
yeah. we actually divested of our marcellus position a couple of years ago that was in a dry gas part of the marcellus acreage there in pennsylvania. with respect to some of the other opportunities that we haven't really discussed publicly, that's really exploration, as you guys know. first and foremost, we're an exploration company.
we're always striving to be a first mover and organically improve the quality of our inventory. so i will provide you a little bit of color on that. domestically, we continue to explore across the u.s. our exploration program that we've talked about for the last year or so has been progressing.
we finished last year drilling 12 wells across multiple opportunities, all dominantly oil-focused and we'll be slightly increasing that number this year to about 20 as we're encouraged with some of the results that we had last year. in general, though, like i said, we don't discuss the details of the exploration other than just to say that the opportunities are low-cost entry, they're oil-focused, there are reservoirs that we think can exploit with our horizontal drilling and completions expertise. and this year, we look forward to doing some more delineation and appraisal drilling. and as we've said in the past, the goal of our exploration program is not just to find oil or find reserves.
it's really to add to the quality of our inventory from a lower finding cost and higher returns perspective. and so, it takes time to be able to evaluate that we can actually discover these opportunities and bring them into the mix where they're really going to help lower the cost basis of the company and be a significant contributor to our portfolio going forward.
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
and i guess just a follow-up on that. as far as the ngl guide going up, that's simply a function of the fact that we have opportunity to make an election as to how much we recover or reject going forward on several of our processing contracts -- and with the strength of much of the ngl pricing, we're simply assuming we'll be in recovery mode more than rejection mode in several of those contracts this year.
operator
thank you. our next question today comes from scott hanold from rbc capital markets. please go ahead.  the line is yours.
scott hanold -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks. and maybe just since you talked a little bit about the exploration opportunities in the u.s. can you give us a sense of how you think about international exploration opportunities? i know you all were doing some work in oman in offshore australia. is there any update there? and how do you think about international versus onshore or u.s.
opportunities?
ezra yacob -- president
yeah. scott, in general, as we've talked about, the international opportunities have -- they have a higher hurdle to really be considered additive to the quality of our inventory simply because we need to have access to services there. we need to have access to contracts, and we need to find the subsurface geology that actually makes it, not just competitive, but really superior to much of what we're drilling here. in australia, to start with that one, we still have that opportunity.
we plan -- we're in the permitting phase currently, and we plan to initiate drilling in that one early next year. and then, in oman, we did announce, as you recall, we had a low cost of entry into oman. it included a two-well commitment. and during the second half of '21, we drilled those two exploratory wells, one of which was a short horizontal.
we completed that horizontal, made a natural gas discovery there. but ultimately, as i was just saying the prospect, we decided is not going to compete with our existing portfolio. so we won't be moving forward with that project. in general, we do feel encouraged with the international opportunities out there because we see really kind of a lack of exploration competition out there.
and we see that many times, national oil companies or ministries, the owners of those lands have really started to realize that they can't rely on traditional conventional term contracts to be able to get some unconventional type prospects drilled. and so, we're seeing a little bit more flexibility on the negotiation side, which gives us some encouragement.
scott hanold -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for that. and i'm going to hit on the shareholder returns too because obviously, you all are in a very enviable position. but ezra and tim, you guys talk about being opportunistic and countercyclical ways with your balance sheet then -- during the fourth quarter, i guess, post thanksgiving there was a little bit of a disconnect there.
your stock was a lot lower than it is today. why not take that opportunity then to buy back stock? can you -- so just trying to frame for us like when you think the right opportunities to buy back stock are.
ezra yacob -- president
yeah. in general, scott, we didn't see that as one of the opportunities that we're looking for there in the fourth quarter. when we talk about the significant dislocation, we're talking about something more so than that. like i said, we consider share repurchase in the same way that we do any investment decision.
it's how does it create the most long-term shareholder value. and we're in a cyclical industry, and that's why we prefer to use it opportunistically with a significant opportunity. the challenge, of course, as we recognize that being in a position to execute during the market dislocation is a challenging thing to do. however, we feel with the strength of our balance sheet and the low cash operating cost that we have, we'll be well positioned when we see the opportunity.
operator
thank you. our next question today comes from leo mariani from keybanc. please go ahead. the line is yours.
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey, guys. i wanted to see if there's any update on the prb. certainly noticed in the slide deck that activity there is going to be down a little bit in terms of a few less wells in '22 versus what you did in '21. so perhaps you could kind of speak to how well costs have trended and kind of where that opportunity is on your list among the different plays? clearly, you described a significant increase in delaware activity this year.
so how does the prb rank?
jeff leitzell -- executive vice president, exploration and production
hey. leo, this is jeff leitzell. the prb, we're really excited about where it's going. in 2021, we had a record year, both from a well performance and an economic standpoint.
last year, our team, they continue to really delineate our core areas. they completed about 50 wells, and half of those exceeded our double premium threshold. so we're really encouraged by that. on top of that, we also brought on multiple record wells in the basin, both in the niobrara and the mowry formations, all doing this while reducing our cost year over year by about 10%.
so the one thing that we really look at with the powder river basin is it's a little bit more geologically complex compared to our other basins. so it's really important that we operate at the right pace, and we don't outrun our learnings. so looking forward kind of to 2022, we plan on maintaining a similar amount of activity. and as our team up there really high grades our acreage, refines our well spacing and strategically builds out our infrastructure, we really expect the powder river basin asset to be able to increase activity in 2023 and beyond.
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. no, that's helpful for sure. and then, if i can just take another crack at the kind of exploration. so i certainly noticed that you guys are spending about, if my numbers are right, about $100 million more on some of these u.s.
plays here in '22, and you clearly talked about drilling more wells. i guess a common question i hear from investors out there is it's been a number of years since eog has kind of announced the strategy, and i guess we'd kind of get to see a new significant u.s. oil play for the company. i know these things are hard to predict, but if i had to just kind of look at a high-level time line, i mean, do you think that's likely in '22 or maybe '23? i mean anything you can kind of say from a high level to get people some assurance that maybe these are progressing?
ezra yacob -- president
yeah. leo, what i'd say is it's just really hard to predict, and i'd hate to commit to something to lead you down the wrong path. i might point to historically, we did some early drilling in the powder river basin, and it was a number of years before we felt comfortable. we've gotten that to a point where we want to talk about it publicly in a big way.
and then, the same with dorado. i know there was a lot of speculation as to our austin chalk exploration program for a number of years. and as you can see, we waited until we had some long-term production and felt confident as to what we had there before we started really talking about it publicly. the current exploration program was definitely slowed down, even maybe a little bit more than we anticipated during the pandemic.
it was just a little more difficult even to get leasing done and things of that nature. as we talked about in 2021, the plays coming out of the pandemic had really started to move it kind of various paces or various rates. some of the wells last year that we drilled were the initial wells in these plays. in other prospects, some of the wells, we're really testing a little more delineation, repeatability, more appraisal.
because again, like i said, almost more than an exploration program, what we're trying to find is not just oil. that's not necessarily the most difficult thing anymore. it's really, as you guys can appreciate, trying to find low-cost barrels, barrels that are additive to what not only we have already discovered but what the industry has really discovered. what the world wants is access to lower-cost barrels, and that's what we're searching for.
and so, it takes a little bit longer to be able to really get the appraisal on these and make sure that these opportunities are really going to be additive, again, to the quality of our inventory.
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question today comes from jeanine wai from barclays. please go ahead. your line is open.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
hi, good morning, everyone. thanks for taking my question. our first question is maybe just back to the double premium. you added 700 new net double premium locations in 2021.
and were these additions spread out across your plays? or are they concentrated in, maybe one or two of them? and where do you see the most runway for future conversions?
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
yeah, jeanine. thanks for the question. this is ken. we added double premium locations over a number of our active premium plays, really in line with where we drilled our wells last year, mainly in the permian and the eagle ford.
and this is really just an example of our culture where we're working to get better, continuing to lower well costs while focusing on increasing the recovery is what leads to significant increases in returns and really allows us to convert wells to premium and double premium through time. and our goal is to always replace at least as many double premium locations as we drill every year.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
ok, great. thank you. maybe our second question, maybe one for tim or ezra. in the past, i think if memory serves me correctly, i think you've commented that after you pay off the 2023 notes that you don't really have a desire to pay down any further debt.
i just wanted to check in if that was still the thinking? and i think we're just really looking for a little bit more color on how you decided that $1 per share for the special this time around was the optimal level? thank you.
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
yeah. this is tim. no, we have not announced any intention of paying off more bonds as they become due. we'll continue to evaluate that as we go forward, but we -- that did not figure into the dollar.
the dollar was a way of giving back just meaningful amount of cash to the shareholders in this period. and as we said, that's a backward-looking thing, not a forward-looking thing.
operator
thank you. our final question today comes from neil mehta from goldman sachs. please go ahead. the line is yours.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you very much. i know eog has developed some more internal macro forecasting capability. and i'd just be curious on your views on u.s. shale production in the united states.
how are you guys thinking about it, entry to exit u.s. oil growth? and talk about the moving pieces ranging from what you're seeing from your competitors in the private market to services constraints such as pressure pumping, your thoughts on u.s. growth would be valuable.
ezra yacob -- president
yeah. neil, i'll add a bit of an overview, and then maybe i'll hand it off to billy for some more details for you on the activity side. but in general, when we think about the growth forecasts that are out there and have been publicly discussed, we're probably a bit more on the lower end in general on the crude and condensate side. and the reason for that is i think you're seeing commitment from the north american e&p space to remain disciplined and then you couple that with some of the inflationary and supply chain pressures.
and we think the u.s. is definitely going to face some headwinds in growth on this year. and i think billy can provide a bit more details on it.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yeah. neil, this is billy. i'm sure you've heard the same comments from many of our peers about the supply chain constraints in the industry is seeing across all the sectors, certainly on the drilling rig side, there's certainly most of the active super-spec rigs are being -- are deployed and active today. there's not a lot of new pieces of equipment that can come into the market.
the same is true on the frac side of the business, most of the good equipment is already under employment today. and then, bringing in new fleets, both on the drilling side and on the frac side, is challenged also from the standpoint of attracting labor to the market. so there's a lot of headwinds to try to -- for the industry to try to ramp up activity and grow production this year. so it will be probably viewed as maybe a transition year also in that light.
and hopefully, the industry can strengthen and get better on a go-forward basis. but this year is going to be a challenging year from that side.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
and then the follow-up is around natural gas, both u.s. and global. a lot of moving pieces, obviously, right now from a geopolitical standpoint, but the most of the industry has been of a lower-for-longer u.s. natural gas view.
do you see that evolving as we have more lng linkage into the global market? if you think about global gas, especially in light of your announcement with cheniere, do you see a structural change in this market until qatari supply comes on mid decade?
ezra yacob -- president
yeah. neil, this is ezra. in general, what i would say is the u.s. has discovered a very vast supply of natural gas and it's important that we get that gas offshore and into the global market for some of the reasons that you talked about now, not only geopolitical, but just developing nations, so on and so forth.
and that's one of the reasons where we're so glad to partner and continue to take out some of our lng. for us, the way we think about the natural gas globally is really it's going to be a cost of supply. and we say that we want to be the low-cost producer, and that might sound like we're talking about oil dominantly, but that goes for gas as well. and it's one reason we're very excited about our dorado prospect.
we think it competes in north america, it's basically the lowest cost of supply, especially because of its geographic location, close to so many marketing centers, including the gulf coast. so we're very excited and very fortunate to have it. and i think the u.s. is going to continue to be, in the long term, a significant player in the global gas supply.
operator
thank you. this concludes today's q&a session. so i'll now hand the call back to mr. yacob.
ezra yacob -- president
yeah. we want to thank everyone for participating on the call this morning, and we want to thank our shareholders for their support. as we said, eog had an outstanding performance in 2021, and we're poised for an up great year in 2022. and it really comes down to our employees.
our employees are the keys to our success, and it's why i'm convinced are to being one of the lowest cost, highest return and lowest emissions energy suppliers that can play a significant role in the long-term future of energy. thank you.

good day, everyone, and welcome to the eog resources fourth quarter and full year 2021 annual results conference call. as a reminder, this call is being recorded. at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, i would like to turn the call over to chief financial officer of eog resources, mr. tim driggers.
please go ahead, sir.
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
good morning, and thanks for joining us. this conference call includes forward-looking statements. factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and eog's sec filings. this conference call also contains certain non-gaap financial measures.
definitions and reconciliations schedules for those non-gaap measures can be found on the eog's website. some of the reserve estimates on this conference call may include estimated potential reserves and estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the sec's reserve reporting guidelines. participating on the call this morning are ezra yacob, chief executive officer; billy helms, president and chief operating officer; ken boedeker, evp, exploration and production; jeff leitzell, evp, exploration and production; lance terveen, senior vp, marketing; and david streit, vp, investor and public relations. here's ezra.
ezra yacob -- president
thanks, tim. good morning, everyone. 2021 was a record-setting year for eog. we earned record net income of $4.7 billion, generated a record $5.5 billion of free cash flow, which funded record cash return of $2.7 billion to shareholders.
we doubled our regular dividend rate and paid two special dividends, paying out about 30% of cash from operations. and we are continuing to deliver on our free cash flow priorities this year with an additional special dividend announced yesterday of $1 per share. the last time we set an earnings record was in 2014. we earned $5.32 per share while oil averaged $93.
last year, we shattered that record earning $7.09 per share with $68 oil. that's 50% higher earnings with a 27% lower oil price. the catalyst for that improvement was our shift to premium six years ago. premium is our internal investment hurdle rate that uses low fixed commodity prices to calculate the returns that drive our capital allocation decisions, $40 and $2.50 natural gas for the life of the well.
while our premium strategy ensures high well-level returns and quick payouts in any given year, the more significant and durable impact is to our full-cycle development cost. the benefit of making investment decisions using fixed low commodity prices has the enduring impact of steadily improving corporate level operating and cash margins over time. that impact is now directly observable on the face of our financial statements. and last year, we raised the bar again to double premium.
our hurdle rate increased from 30% to a minimum of 60% direct after-tax rate of return using the same low fixed prices of $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. the switch promises to further improve financial performance in the years ahead and is what gives us great confidence in our ability to continue delivering shareholder value through commodity price cycles. we expect to look back on 2021 like we do on 2016 as the year we made a permanent increase to our return hurdle that drove another step change in the financial performance of eog. we also delivered as we promised operationally in 2021 with production volumes, capex and operating costs in line or better than target set at the beginning of the year.
we were able to successfully offset emerging inflationary pressures during the year to lower well costs by 7%. 2021 was also a big year for esg performance. we reduced our methane emissions percentage and injury rates and increased water reuse. we announced our 2040 net-zero ambition and added our goal to eliminate routine flaring by 2025 to our existing near-term targets for greenhouse gas and methane emissions rates.
we continue to develop creative solutions, leveraging existing technology to make progress on our path toward our net-zero ambition. there's growing recognition that oil and gas will have a role to play in the long-term energy solution. we know that to be part of that solution, we not only have to produce low-cost, high-return barrels, we also have to do it with one of the lowest environmental footprints. as we look into 2022, the global oil market is in a position to rebalance during the year.
our disciplined capital plan aims to increase long-term shareholder value through high-return reinvestment that optimizes both near-term and long-term free cash flow. the plan also funds exploration and infrastructure projects to improve the future cost structure of the business. with the improvements we made in the business last year, combined with a higher commodity price environment, eog is positioned to once again generate significant free cash flow. we continue to follow through on our free cash flow priorities.
our stellar fourth quarter performance allowed us to further strengthen the balance sheet, and we are returning cash to shareholders with the $1 per share special dividend declared yesterday. combined with our $3 per share regular dividend, we have already committed to return $2.3 billion of cash to shareholders in 2022. we remain firmly committed to our long-standing free cash flow and cash return priorities, and you can expect eog to continue to deliver on them as the year unfolds. eog has exited the downturn a much better company than when we entered it.
higher returns with the shift to double premium, a lower cost structure, more free cash flow, a smaller environmental footprint and a culture strengthened by the challenges we have overcome together. our culture is the no. 1 value driver of eog's success. by remaining humble and intellectually honest, we sustained the cycle of constant improvement that drives our technology leadership.
of all the fundamentals that consistently create long-term value, none of them matter without the commitment, resiliency and execution from our employees. now, here's tim to review our financial position.
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
thanks, ezra. eog generated record financial results in the fourth quarter with adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion and free cash flow of $2 billion. capital expenditures of $1.1 billion were right in line with our forecast while production volumes finished above target. for the full year, adjusted earnings were a record $5 billion or $8.61 per share.
this yielded return on capital employed of 23%, while oil prices for the year averaged $68 per barrel. perhaps most important than setting records is what drove our outperformance. 2021 illustrated eog's success at driving down our cost structure. roce would have been 10% or better at oil prices as low as $44.
keep in mind that back in 2016, when the premium investment standard was introduced, the oil price required for 10% roce was in excess of $80 per barrel. the dramatic improvements we have made to the profitability of our business reflect the benefits of using the highest investment threshold in the industry. the bottom line financial impact of double premium is just beginning to show up. but like our original switch to premium, it will grow over the coming years.
our goal is to position the company to earn economic returns at the bottom of the cycle, less than $40 oil and generate returns that are better than the broader market on a full cycle basis. free cash flow in 2021 was a record $5.5 billion, and we deployed this cash consistent with our long-standing free cash flow priorities. we doubled the regular dividend rate, which now stands at an annual $3 per share and represents a 2.7% yield at the current share price. we are confident in the sustainability of our high-return low-cost business model to support a dividend that has never been cut or suspended in its more than 20-year history.
we solidified our financial position, finishing the year with effectively zero net debt. we were also able to address additional cash return priorities. we paid two special dividends for a combined $3 per share. we also refreshed our buyback authorization, which now stands at $5 billion.
we will look to utilize this on an opportunistic basis. in total, eog returned $2.7 billion of cash to shareholders in 2021. this represents 28% of discretionary cash flow and 49% of free cash flow, putting eog among e&p industry leaders for cash returned in 2021. looking ahead to 2022, our disciplined capital plan and regular dividend can be funded at $44 oil.
at $80 oil, we expect to generate about $11 billion of cash flow from operations before working capital. the $4.5 billion capital plan represents about a 40% reinvestment ratio, resulting in more than $6 billion in free cash flow. this, of course, is on an after-tax basis, as we expect to be a nearly full cash taxpayer in 2022 as we were last year. we are in an excellent position to continue to deliver on our free cash flow priorities in 2022.
eog declared a $0.75 regular dividend yesterday, which is our highest priority for returning cash to shareholders. the size of the regular dividend is evaluated every quarter. as the financial performance and cost structure of eog continues to improve, we expect that will be reflected in continued growth of the dividend. turning to our second priority.
this period of high oil prices allows us to further bolster the balance sheet. to support our renewed $5 billion buyback authorization and prepare to take advantage of other countercyclical opportunities, we plan to build and carry a higher cash balance going forward. we expect there will be opportunities in the future to create significant shareholder value by deploying a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity at the right time. finally, we also announced an additional cash return to shareholders yesterday with a $1 per share special dividend to be paid in march.
along with the regular dividend, eog has already committed to return $2.3 billion of cash to shareholders in 2022. we are fully committed to continuing to deliver on all of our free cash flow priorities. here's billy.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
thanks, tim. first, i want to thank all of our employees for their outstanding accomplishments and stellar execution last year. i'm especially proud of their safety performance. in addition to outstanding operations and financial improvements, we achieved a record low injury rate.
2021 was another year of execution. throughout the year, we consistently exceeded our oil production targets, primarily due to strong well results. our operations teams continue to innovate and find opportunities to increase efficiencies and lowered the average well cost by 7%, beating the 5% target we set at the start of the year. our drilling teams are achieving targeted depths faster with lower cost by focusing on reliability of the tools and technical procedures that drive daily performance.
for example, in our delaware basin wolfcamp play, our teams have improved days to drill by 42% since 2018. in our eagle ford oil play, after drilling several thousand wells, our teams continue to refine the drilling operation to drive consistent performance from our rig fleet, resulting in a 21% reduction in the drilling costs since 2018. and with our decentralized organization and collaborative teamwork across operational areas, we continue to generate ideas for improvement through our innovative approach to areas such as improved bit design and drilling motor performance and share them throughout the company. on the completion side, we made great starts to expand the use of our super zipper or simo-frac technique to about one-third of our wells completed last year.
completion costs also benefited from reduced sand and water cost through our integrated self-sourcing efforts and water reuse infrastructure. utilizing local sand and water pipelines includes the added benefit of removing trucks from the row of contributing to a safer oilfield with lower emissions. cash operating costs were in line with forecast. and while delivering a higher level of total production, they were nearly equivalent to our cash operating cost pre-pandemic in 2019.
the savings are a result of a focus on reducing workover expenses and improvements in produced water management. these efforts will expand in 2022 to help offset additional inflationary pressure. we also had another great year improving our esg performance metrics. preliminary calculations indicate that we reduced our methane emissions percentage by about 25% and our total recordable incident rate by 10%.
we also achieved a 99.8% target for wellhead gas capture and increased water resource from reuse to 55%. again, these are preliminary results as our final metrics will be published in our sustainability report later this year. as we enter 2022, eog is not immune to the inflation that we're seeing across our industry. but we have line of sight to offset these inflationary pressures through innovation and technical advances, contracting for services, supply chain management and self-sourcing and materials.
over 90% of our drilling fleet and over 50% of our frac fleets needed to execute this year's program are covered under existing term agreements with multiple providers. our vendor partnerships provide eog the ability to secure longer-term high-performing teams at favorable prices while providing the vendors a predictable and reliable source of activity to run their business. eog's technical teams take ownership of various aspects of the drilling and completion operations to drive performance, improvements and eliminate downtime. as a result, we will -- we still see opportunities to sustainably improve our performance.
some of the largest efficiency gains will be in our completion operations this year. for example, we expect to utilize our super zipper technique on about 60% of our wells, increasing the amount of treated lateral per day. we're also enhancing our self-sourced local sand efforts, which we expect to not only secure the material needed for the year, but also offset the effects of inflation. we continue to expand our water reuse capabilities that will assist in offsetting inflation in both our capital program and lease operating expense.
we remain confident that we'll be able to keep well cost at least flat in 2022. eog's capital efficiency continues to improve as a result of eog's culture of continuous improvement. 2022 looks to be a year of challenges and inflationary headwinds. and i'm excited about the opportunity to bring our talented employees to further improve our business through innovation and improved operational execution.
here's ken to review the year-end reserves and provide an inventory update.
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
thanks, billy. last year, we replaced more than two times what we produced and reduced our finding and development costs by 17%. our permanent shift to premium drilling and focus on efficiencies driven by innovation and our unique culture keys as to why our capital efficiency continues to improve, and our corporate finding costs and dd&a rate continue to decline. our 2021 reserve replacement was 208% for a finding and development cost of just $5.81 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding revisions due to commodity price changes.
since 2014, prior to the last downturn and the implementation of our premium strategy, we have reduced finding and development cost by more than 55%. with our double premium standard and the high grading of our future development schedule, we grew our reserve base in 2021 by over 500 million barrels of oil equivalent for total booked reserves of over 3.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent. this represents a 16% increase in reserves year over year. in terms of future well locations, we added over 700 net double premium locations across multiple basins to our inventory in 2021, replacing the 410 drilled last year by 170%.
our double premium inventory is growing faster than we drill it and the quality of the locations we are adding to the inventory is improving. innovation continues to drive sustainable cost improvements and operational efficiencies. and when you combine that with our focus on developing higher quality rock, we further improve the median return of the portfolio. we don't need more inventory.
we are focused on improving our inventory quality. with this in mind, our double premium inventory now accounts for 6,000 of the 11,500 total premium locations in our inventory, representing more than 11 years of drilling at the current pace. now, let me turn the call back to ezra.
ezra yacob -- president
thanks, ken. in conclusion, i'd like to note the following important takeaways. first, investment decisions based on a low commodity price puts the emphasis on full cycle cost of development and demands efficient use of capital. while the benefits of such discipline are realized immediately, the larger impact builds over time.
the seed to our stellar results in 2021 was the premium strategy established six years ago, and we have set the stage for the next step change in financial performance by instituting double premium last year. second, we are confident eog's innovative and technology-driven culture can offset inflationary pressures this year. our disciplined capital plan is focused on high return reinvestment to continue improving our margins in not only 2022 but in future years as well. third, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders.
we demonstrated this through the return of nearly 50% of free cash flow last year, and this quarter's special dividend, our third in less than a year, doubling our regular dividend rate indicates our confidence in the durability of our future performance. the regular dividend is our preferred method to return cash to shareholders and as we continue to increase the capital efficiency of eog through low-cost operations and improved well performance, growth of the regular dividend will remain a priority. we truly believe the best is yet to come. going forward as a company and an industry with a financial profile more competitive than ever with the broader market and a growing recognition of the value we bring to society, eog has never been better positioned to generate significant long-term shareholder value.
thanks for listening. now, we'll go to q&a.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question today comes from the line of doug leggate with bank of america. doug, your line is open.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
well, thank you. good morning, everybody. ezra, i think i would speak for everybody in saying we're delighted to see the framework you've introduced for cash returns. i do have a question around this, however.
i'm just curious what's changed to move you in that direction? and i wonder if i could ask you to -- you're obviously talking about a percentage of free cash flow. so i wonder if you could frame some similar parameters around how you think about reinvestment rates or the planning assumptions that go around that so we can get some kind of idea as to what free cash flow ultimately looks like versus the level of spending, if you see my point.
ezra yacob -- president
yes, doug. i sure do. so let me start with the what is now -- why now. and simply, we feel that this is the right time for our business to come out with the additional guidance.
we've got the regular dividend increased to be competitive with the broad market. we've got the balance sheet in a very strong position. and we're basically emerging stronger from the downturn and confident that we can deliver this minimum amount of cash return going forward. it's consistent with our long-term free cash flow priorities.
so it's not really a change in strategy. in fact, in 2021, we returned about 49% of free cash flow, and we paid off a $750 million bond. so when you combine those, that was about 60%. and so it's a range internally we've discussed and the announcement really just provides a bit of transparency.
now on the second part of your question with regards to how do you think about -- how are we thinking about the reinvestment growth and to get to free cash flow, one thing -- one reason we have given this guidance as a minimum of 60% return on free cash flow is because it's a guide that can be consistent and long term in nature through the cycle, like how we manage the business. basing the guide off of a free cash flow puts us in what we feel is the best overall position to create shareholder value through the cycle. so nothing's really changed in the reinvestment strategy. it's first always based on returns and our ability to get better each year.
there's -- as we've said in the past, there's no reason to invest in growth if you're not generating high returns and you're not doing it with an ability to improve the underlying business year after year. and what that means is not chasing free cash flow just because the high prices if you're investing in something that's eroding the business long term. you can take today, for example. we could increase activity today into these high prices, but in the inflationary environment, that's going to erode our capital efficiency.
and then the second piece that we've talked about as far as reinvestment or growth is based on the macro environment and market fundamentals. does the market really need the barrels? what's supporting the global supply and demand fundamentals? ultimately, investing in premium and double premium, as you know, has made us somewhat price agnostic basing those decisions on $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas. and so it's really -- the capital discipline comes down to what can we do and are we investing at a pace where each of our assets can get better year after year and ultimately, improve the overall returns and company profile.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i appreciate the answer, ezra, on that. as i said, we all welcome what you've done. my follow-up is hopefully a quick one. so some years ago, you guys pivoted away from natural gas.
dorado obviously is the exception today, but you also took a write-off of a lot of your legacy gas assets. the world has obviously changed. so i'm just wondering within the company, is there any effort or i guess, initiatives to pivot back to some of those legacy. some of the legacy gas assets that are obviously still in your portfolio in light of what's going on as it relates to lng expansion longer term, how we get there? thank you.
ezra yacob -- president
yes, doug. as you said, the world's changed a lot and the company has changed quite a bit. the biggest thing for us is that introduction of the premium and now double premium reinvestment hurdle rate. so all of our gas assets now are judged at $2.50, a flat natural gas price for the life of the well.
and that really high grades our reinvestment opportunities into any of our assets, but especially the natural gas ones that we're talking about right now. ultimately, what we see with dorado is that we've captured a very significant resource, geographically in the best spot we think onshore u.s. with access to multiple markets. and we're very excited about being able to focus in on really that asset that we have.
we think it's going to be the premier asset in north american natural gas.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
impressive for sure. thanks for taking my question. thank you.

our next question comes from charles meade with johnson rice. charles, your line is open.
charles meade -- johnson rice -- analyst
good morning, ezra, and to the whole eog team there. kind of picking up on the point you just made, i'm curious, i get that you evaluate all your projects at $40 and $2.50 and that service is the best oil projects and best gas projects. but is there any concern or discussion inside eog that maybe evaluating projects that something so far below the strip is actually giving you a suboptimal relative ranking across oil and gas assets?
ezra yacob -- president
yes, charles. the way we look at it is we've been fortunate. we've been in unconventional north american exploration here for nearly two decades, honestly. and what that's allowed us to do is put together a multi-basin portfolio of what we think is really the deepest and highest quality asset inventory.
when we switched to premium, it was really taking a long-term look at that $40 price, $2.50 natural gas price to not only help the immediate returns, the rate of return, the irrs upfront, but really thinking about longer term through the cycles, what does it mean to really build a company where based on a commodity price, you can still be successful and create value through the cycles. ratcheting that up to double premium in 2020 was really a reflection of our ability to have grown our premium inventory three and a half times through organic exploration since 2016. so actually, i think the focus on double premium drilling and that reinvestment hurdle rate, actually provides us with an optimal way to rank our assets.
charles meade -- johnson rice -- analyst
thank you for that, that insight. ok, and perhaps going back to dorado, it was -- i caught during the prepared comments that i think that the two-year cume is 80% higher than your 2018 case. and part of that is longer laterals. and i think the base was -- the 2018 case was 9,000 for the latera.
so am i making -- am i in the right ballpark to thinking that if 80% higher two-year cume, some of that's longer laterals. so we're looking at maybe 40% or 50% higher productivity per lateral foot in the dorado play versus the earlier case?
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
yeah, charles, this is ken. we haven't really given out a number on how much higher the productivity is. if we look back to those 2018 wells, they were shorter laterals in the 6,000 to 7,000 foot range. we've now have some extended laterals even past our original 9,000 foot range that we thought we'd get.
and those things both the improved performance and the lower costs have really driven that finding cost down to almost the $0.40 target that we're showing on slide 11 there.
charles meade -- johnson rice -- analyst
but no -- don't care to offer any comments on the productivity per lateral foot, i guess, that's fine. thank you.
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
i guess, charles, just what i would say is it is -- our wells are beating our type curves that we have, and those type curves do have a fairly low decline over the first several months of production. so we are seeing them beating our type curves. and if you look at it, we've really only drilled 30 of our 1,250 wells in that place, so we're continuing to learn.
charles meade -- johnson rice -- analyst
thank you, ken.

our next question comes from arun jayaram with j.p. morgan. your line is open.
arun jayaram -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. good morning. my first question is just on the supply chain. you guys are holding the line on capex.
a number of your peers have raised capex expectations. so i was wondering if you could comment what's unique about the way you're managing the supply chain to give you confidence on delivering the $4.5 billion capex budget. and do some of these supply chain headwinds we're seeing within the industry, how does that influence your thoughts about 2023, given shortages of ofs equipment, labor and just broader -- just challenges on things like octg?
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yeah, arun. this is billy. let me start by providing maybe an overview of how we're managing the year's capital program, then i'd like to get jeff to add some color, and then i'll circle back to 2023. but let me first start by saying that we kind of look at each year the same way.
as you know, we would -- i would tend to bucket this in maybe three or four different areas. one, we self-source a lot of materials that insulates us from a lot of the supply chain issues. we also do a lot of innovation and efficiency gains. the third bucket might be the pace of the adoption of these new efficiencies across the company.
and then maybe finally, flexibility with our multi-basin approach. so just to elaborate on that a little bit more. at the beginning of the year, we constructed our plan certainly recognizing the inflation that we saw from the recovery of post covid. and we were confident in looking at that, that we could offset inflation and maintain flat well cost.
what we didn't anticipate was the war in ukraine and that additional pressure and the increased inflation we saw in commodities, such as fuel and steel. but we're still working to offset this additional inflation through our efficiencies and new innovations. these improvements and efficiency gains are certainly happening largely in the areas where we have most activities, such as the delaware basin and the eagle ford. but i would also say that the pace of the adoption of these new technologies, the rapid adoption of the super zipper technology across the company is happening faster than we expected.
so we also had the advantage of being in multiple basins. so that gives us a lot of flexibility to shift activity between areas. so we're very comfortable that we can maintain our plan and delivering our original volumes within our stated capex goals that we laid out at the start of the year. so with that, maybe i'll turn it over to jeff to give you some more details.
jeff leitzell -- executive vice president, exploration and production
yeah. good morning, arun. this is jeff leitzell. so as billy stated, our ability to counter these inflationary pressures and some of the supply chain constraints that you talked about.
it's really just a huge credit to our team's operational execution, their innovative culture and really continuing to improve on the efficiencies. so just to give you a little bit of color and some examples, start off with our drilling operations. our teams continue to increase their efficiencies. and that's primarily with eog's in-house motor program and our proprietary bit cutter development, which we can kind of design both of these uniquely around all the formations we drill in each of our plays.
and our eagle ford operations, they're just a perfect example of this. we've increased the drilled footage per day by over 17% this year. and this is one of our more mature plays that we've been drilling in for 13 years. so really to eog, no matter how far along we are in development, there's always improvements that can be made.
and then on the same topic there with the eagle ford, they've just done an outstanding job of reducing their drilling fluid costs also, even as diesel prices have risen, and that's primary base in those fluids. we've done this by optimizing the density and the additives in the drilling fluid in each area really to try to reduce those fluid losses, which has resulted in a per barrel savings of about 20% so far in 2022. and then just a couple more basic examples in completions. our field team, they continue to see really good improvements there, and they've increased their overall completed lateral per foot day by 10% compared to 2021 for the total company.
and as we've talked about in the past, one of the main drivers in this is really our continued implementation of super zipper operations. so we've talked about last year, we're about a third of our activity with super zipper. and this year, we had a goal of trying to get 60%, and we're just about there right now. so this is really significant because pretty much every additional well that we super zipper, we realized of up to $300,000 per well or that equates to about 5% of the total well cost.
another kind of new process on the innovation side that we've been implementing in testing is something called continuous frac pumping operations. so just a little bit of a rundown. typically, in any completion operations, you have some unplanned maintenance. and in order to be proactive, our field teams have started planning some of that scheduled maintenance periods of about three to four hours every three days.
and what this has helped us do is really minimize any of that unplanned maintenance and really greatly increase our overall efficiency. so in the past quarter, really primarily in the eagle ford, we've started some testing in the delaware basin, but we've been able to increase our completed lateral foot per day by roughly 30%. so that's really just a huge time and cost savings there. and what we plan on doing is as we optimize this process, we'll continue to roll it out to all of our operating areas.
and then lastly, more on the supply chain and material side of things. i just wanted to touch on a couple of our savings from the water and the sand cost side of things. in the delaware basin, our team continues to reduce their water costs by optimizing the reuse process, which right now is approximately 90% of all their source water. and they're really doing this just through increasing the automation of all of our infrastructure and reducing the overall treatment cost per barrel, which we realized about a 9% reduction in each barrel of reused water for 2022.
and this is pretty significant, not just for capex, but also on the operating expense because every barrel we're allowed to reuse is one less that we have to dispose of. and then finally here over on the sand logistics side, eog, we've been in the sand business in self-sourcing for about 15 years now, and we continue to reduce those costs across the company. for example, out in the delaware basin, we continue to advance our abilities to get that sand closer to the wellhead and ultimately reduce the amount of trucking needed. and plans are we're going to open up a second plant in the second half of next year, and we really anticipate to see some pretty good savings from q1 through the rest of the year of about 20% per pound.
so these are just a few of the many examples of how our operations team is just performing and really giving us great confidence that we'll be able to counter a lot of these inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints through 2022 and, as billy will talk about here, 2023.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yeah, arun, just to summarize, maybe, i know that's a lot of detail for you. but obviously, we're very proud of the efforts of our employees to continue to fight against the rising well cost in this period of inflation. as we move into 2023, it's really early to talk about specifics about next year, but let me just kind of give you an overall impression of how we think about going into any year. certainly, we have a long history of managing through inflation to maintain our lower well cost that gives us confidence to be able to meet our goals.
and we have two fundamental things that we think about. one is our contracting strategy and how we approach that. as for example, this year, just a reminder, we have about 50% of our well costs secured with contracts with service providers that provide about 90% of our drilling fleet and about 60% of our frac fleet locked up under existing contracts. not all of those service contracts are set to expire at the end of this year.
so we try to stagger those as we go through a year to make sure that we have some continuity going into the preceding year. and then the lastly would be, as jeff mentioned there, innovation and efficiency improvements. so we are already confident we're seeing ideas that we can continue to push and explore to continue to reduce cost and offset inflation going into next year. so we're always chasing those kind of things.
i know that's a lot of color, but it's certainly something that we're very proud of our employees and their efforts, and i just want to make sure you fully understand it.
arun jayaram -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. i appreciate the detail, billy. my follow-up is maybe for ezra or tim, you guys have now committed to a 60% minimum return of free cash flow kind of framework. i wanted to get your thoughts on the other 40% bucket and what the priorities are between the balance sheet, additional cash return and the bolt-ons.
i know last quarter, tim did message eog's intention to build more cash on the balance sheet for countercyclical opportunities at other points in the cycle. so i wondering if you could give us some updated thoughts on that.
ezra yacob -- president
yes, arun, this is ezra. i can start right there with where you left off. let me say that we're just thrilled to be in a unique position here to be able to strengthen the balance sheet and return $2.4 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2022. but ultimately, with the remaining 40%, it comes back to the fact that we're committed to delivering on our free cash flow priorities and doing the right thing at the right time to maximize long-term shareholder value and it does include that balance sheet.
and some of the things with the balance sheet we've discussed in the past is to have cash available just for running the business for operations to have cash for the small bolt-on acquisitions, as you mentioned, to have cash available for the $5 billion stock repurchase authorization, which we've said we prefer to look at that as an opportunistic repurchase rather than something more programmatic. and then the last thing with regards to our balance sheet and cash on hand would also be our commitment there to retiring a bond, a $1.2 billion bond that's coming due here in the first quarter of 2023. so really, as we started off with the guide of returning a minimum of 60% of free cash flow, it's really not a change in strategy by any means. it's just to provide a little more transparency, a little more clarity.
we've heard some of our shareholders who have asked for a bit more transparency and clarity on the cash returns, and that's really what the change in messaging is, but our strategy remains very consistent.
arun jayaram -- j.p. morgan -- analyst

our next question comes from the line of jeanine wai with barclays. jeanine, your line is open.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone. thanks for taking our questions. our first question, maybe if we can just hit back to dorado, nice update on that.
in the slides, you highlight potential export markets. can you talk about how much midstream capacity eog has currently or maybe what you see down the line in order to get dorado gas to the sales points?
lance terveen -- senior vice president, marketing
yeah, jeanine. good morning. this is lance. yes, as you think about dorado and takeaway there, we're very well connected.
i mean, you can see that on slide 11. obviously, you can see the proximity to market. but as we talk about capacity, we have sufficient capacity there, plenty of running room as we look forward. and just really want to highlight too, as you think about the proximity to those markets, and especially the demand growth that's expected to see in the potential that's equally important, and what we're excited about as you think about the proximity, less than 100 miles to get to the agua dulce market and then the connectivity that we have even to get up into the katy houston ship channel market.
as you look forward on over the next 5 years, you have the potential to see an additional potential of like 5 bcf a day of new demand growth. so the proximity, the connectivity that we have and obviously, as you've seen, as evidence to our other plays, as we think about capacity, we're always very forward looking and making sure that we have enough ongoing capacity as we think about our program.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
ok, great. thank you. and then maybe just following up on arun's question. ezra, we appreciate all the details you just provided about the cash build up there.
i guess just generally speaking, and i know it's never the simple about back solving to a cash number, but is net cash -- or is that like a suboptimal place for the business? or would you be perfectly fine with the balance sheet getting to that point? thank you.
ezra yacob -- president
yes, jeanine. no, we don't believe that's a suboptimal place in an industry like ours that's proven to be cyclical in nature, obviously, and at times very volatile. even our current cash position, i'd say the cash on hand as a percent of market cap places us roughly in the upper half of that s&p 500. and we think that's a fantastic position to be in, especially when you think about a cyclical industry like ours.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
thank you.

our next question is from leo mariani with keybanc. leo, please go ahead with your question.
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
i guess, wanted to follow up a little bit on the gas macro here. obviously, very topical these days. in the past, i know eog has spoken about kind of longer-term oil growth target, kind of 8% to 10% per annum. do you guys feel that at this point in time, just given the changes in the world that u.s.
gas is really just going to be higher for longer, and you think it would be appropriate to maybe do something similar on the gas side as well. and obviously, you kind of talked about the accessibility of your gas to lng markets down there as well. so just wanted to get a sense if you guys are actively working on perhaps expanding activity over the next few years at dorado in trying to get that gas to international markets.
ezra yacob -- president
yes, leo, this is ezra. let me maybe make a few comments and then lance can follow up on some more detailed lng perspectives. in general, what i would say from the macro perspective, i know this will sound a little bit repetitive, but we base our decisions on investment in gas, the same as we do on investment in oil, and that's on the premium price deck. so for us, it really comes down to the first question is returns, how quickly can we invest in an asset and still generate high returns year over year still continue to improve upon the asset.
and what that means is lowering the finding and development cost every year and bringing -- adding lower-cost reserves to the base of our company. that's how we dropped the cost base of the company and basically expand the margins going forward. with regards to global supply and demand, that comes in second, same as on the oil side. i wanted to say that we have an optimal level growth because, obviously, there's associated gas, but then we've got these pure dry gas plays.
so we look at them a little bit agnostically. long term, how we do feel going out longer and thinking about the long-term global energy solution, we do feel that gas is going to play a significant role in that. and that's why we're very committed to the $2.50 price that we evaluate the reinvestment on because we think that's globally going to be a very competitive and compelling price to be able to base the investments on. lance?
lance terveen -- senior vice president, marketing
yeah. no, ezra. leo, good morning. maybe just add a little bit more color too, as you think about just lng and kind of lng offtake, but i mean, it's an exciting time.
and it's been excellent having some exposure, especially as you think about our jkm exposure and the first mover advantage that we have because the pendulum, like you're saying, you're seeing in the environment today that pendulum is swinging and you're seeing more of a demand pool. and so as we think about that, especially from a customer standpoint, i mean, we're very well positioned. i mean the way we think about it, there's really three important components of it. and one of them that's critical is investment-grade status and the pristine balance sheet that we have that absolutely puts us and differentiates us.
and then as you think about the control that we have with our firm transportation when we think about lng offtake, it's not just from dorado, but we have firm offtake that can get us from each of our major plays. and then also, when you think about supply flexibility, too, i mean, we have a lot of scale and a lot of flexibility. and so we're excited about it. obviously, you saw the deal that we've done with cheniere, that's expanding and increasing our sales that we have there.
we feel that, that's very strategic that helped commercialize stage 3, which we're anticipating hopefully by the end of '25, i think expected maybe in early '26, all kind of in line with what we've been talking about for a long time. we've been working lng since 2017 and entered into our first agreement in '19 and then just recently expanded that again. so yes, we definitely have a constructive view as we think about lng and all those components that i just talked about earlier, we feel puts us very advantaged because we can transact quickly, and we can move with scale because we have the supply flexibility as well.
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. definitely sounds like you guys are looking at more deals. also just wanted to ask about the earlier target that put out kind of pre-ukraine flat well costs year over year.
i'm certainly aware that you guys have efficiencies and working really hard on this. but at this point, and you think that's still a realistic goal, just given inflation, i think i heard you say that you got about 50% of the well costs locked up in 2022.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yeah, leo, this is billy helms. yeah, we tried to address that certainly in the last answer we had, but i guess the bottom line is we're very confident we're going to be able to keep our well costs flat this year, and we're going to work hard to do it next year. so it's early to say what next year is going to be, but we just have line of sight on so many improvements we can continue to make in our business to fundamentally offset inflation. so we're very confident in this year's capex and volume targets.
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. appreciate. thanks.
operator
our next question is from neal dingmann with truist securities. neal, please go ahead.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
yes, thank you. my first question, ezra, maybe on exploration. i'm just wondering, what would it take -- would it take initial success maybe on a large acreage position, such as wet gas or whatever for you to announce another play or really just a broad question, what generally do you all like to see before publicly rolling out and talking about the next, next best opportunity you'll have?
ezra yacob -- president
yes, neal. we like to have confidence in what we're talking about and bringing out to the public. and what that means for us these days, and we've talked about it a little bit before, is these days, it's not just a matter of trying to find oil or gas, that has become relatively not too difficult. the challenge for us is to make sure that it's additive to the quality of our inventory.
like i said earlier, we believe we've got really the highest quality and deepest inventory across a multi-basin portfolio as far as north american e&p companies go. and so trying to add to that, trying to add to the double premium rates of return program is challenging. and what it takes is long -- some longer-term production results before we going back to dorado and the powder river basin before we announced those basins to the public, we had some pretty significantly long production results to really make sure that we had captured what we had anticipated capturing. the last thing we want to do is mislead anybody.
and so especially looking at some of the new players that we're talking about with these hybrid reservoirs. these things are relatively new in nature to the industry. and so gathering some longer-term production results and appraisal wells to really define the extent of this place is very important and critical before we'd be comfortable talking about them.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. great details. and then my follow-up, either for you or billy, just on ofs inflation and maybe logistics. you all continue to do a great job of mitigating even better than most ofs inflation.
i'm just wondering on when you look out the remainder of this year into '23, if things sort of stay like they are now. we've heard some issues of sand and different things in the permian, maybe bring it up now northern white from wisconsin, could you talk about are you all -- i guess, two questions here. one, are you all locking in and continue to do sort of longer term, whether that be on the sand, pipe or other side? and then number two, just wondering, would you -- when you think about -- would you have -- if you have opportunities like you did like a year or two ago about drill pipe, if those persist, i assume you'll continue to go after and do some opportunities like that.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yeah, neal. this is billy. certainly, it's a very dynamic situation that we're dealing with here. but part of the reason we have so much confidence in being able to offset inflation, especially the inflation that the industry is seeing today really goes back to the involvement or engagement of our employees and how committed they are to achieving the goals that are set out.
and you might, for example, talk about sand, especially sand in the permian, and jeff kind of went through some of this in detail earlier. the big overlying reason that we have so much confidence is we took ownership. we took control of that many, many years ago, i want to say, about 15 years ago. and certainly, through that taking ownership, we've learned a lot in the past.
and we continue to look for ways to reduce that cost. and lately, it's been by getting sand closer to the wellhead. as we move to locate near, near wellhead, so kind of close to the end user sources of supply, we can move closer and closer and continue to reduce our cost, both on the cost of the sand itself, but also transportation to the wellhead, all the logistics that you see are diminished. we take trucks off the road.
it's just good in many, many different ways. we also stay very engaged on the material side, tubulars and those kind of things, who work with mills really across the globe directly. we don't really go through distributors per se. we work directly with the mills.
and that way, we are able to establish the relationships and capture opportunities at the right time. so it's just that further engagement in all aspects of our business that allows us to do that and the creativity of our employees that allows us that opportunity. so that's why we still remain so confident.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
very good. thank you, billy, for the details.
operator
our next question comes from the line of neil mehta with goldman sachs. please go ahead, neil.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you. tim, i have one micro question and then one macro question. the micro question is, as you think about your growth assets, the delaware, the prb and dorado, how do you think about the relative capital allocation? and how would you prioritize them based on returns and cost of supply?
ezra yacob -- president
yes, neil, this is ezra. it's great to have such high-quality inventory across multiple basins. it makes our job with capital allocation, portfolio management exciting. the way we approach each of them is looking at where they're individually at in the life cycle of the play and basing it off on returns.
and so even throw the eagle ford in there, certainly not a growth asset anymore. but by rightsizing that program last year, and i think we highlighted this in february. last year, we turned in the highest rate of return drilling program we ever had in that play. when you think about a play like the eagle ford, that's really a trailblazing type of asset for the entire industry to see how to continue to make one of these resource plays, long-life resource plays even better year after year after 12 or 13 years of drilling it.
so when we think about the delaware basin, the powder river basin and dorado, just at the high level, we would say the delaware basin is kind of in the sweet spot as far as drilling activity, our knowledge-based infrastructure, and the prb and dorado are a little bit behind that. we definitely slowed down, as ken had mentioned. we paused drilling in dorado during 2020, and we did the same in the powder river basin. and so we're early in the life on those plays.
and so the capital allocation of those two really progresses with the build-out of infrastructure and at the pace at which we can incorporate our learnings and continue to make the wells better.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that makes a lot of sense. the second, ezra, is a big picture question. you guys are doing a lot of work on the oil macro, and it's obviously a very dynamic environment, but there are two questions associated with it. one is what do you think the long-term implications of potentially structurally lower russian production capacity will be for the u.s.
producers and for global oil producers? and the second is, how are you thinking about exit-to-exit u.s. oil production this year given some of the constraints that you talked about earlier on the call?
ezra yacob -- president
yes, neil. i'll start with the second one and reiterate our position on exit-to-exit u.s. oil hasn't really changed since february. when you look at kind of the range of forecasts that are out there, we're on the lower end is the way that we said it in february, and that's what we would stick to today.
we think the supply chain constraints and the inflationary issues, the discipline that you're seeing in north american e&p sector, we think that the u.s. exit-to-exit oil production growth is going to be on the lower end of most of the forecasts. longer term, with the structural implications for russian capacity for u.s. and global and how that plays in, we're watching that the same as everyone else.
we have -- it's a volatile situation. there are things developing as we speak, including the sanctions that are being discussed. and how are those russian barrels actually continuing to flow? and how are they getting discounted and where are they showing up? and what is that doing? ultimately, i'd take a bigger step back and just say for the last few years, neil, we've been pretty consistent with our model that chronic underinvestment in exploration and in our industry is really going to lead to generally lower supply -- undersupplied for the global supply and demand market longer term. that's why we continue to explore, and we continue to explore for lower cost, higher return assets.
and we think that really, as we've said in the past, there's only a handful of north american e&p companies that have the asset quality, the size, the scale to compete on a global scale with that cost of supply and on top of that, deliver the barrels with a lower environmental footprint. and in the future, those are the companies that the world is going to want to fill in additional barrels. and especially with our operational results in this first quarter, we think we know we feel that eog is a leader of that group of north american e&ps.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
the underinvestment point is definitely playing out. we appreciate that answer.
ezra yacob -- president
thank you, neil.
operator
we have time for one more question today. and our next question comes from paul cheng with scotiabank. paul, your line is open.
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
thank you. good morning. first, two quick questions. one, i think you sort of follow-up to neil's question.
so does the russian invasion in any shape or form change the way how you look at the global market and perhaps that your production outlook or a development plan for the company. i think you've been saying that you guys will be ready to grow if you think there's a need from the market, and you will be growing at maybe in the future, 8% to 10% annual kind of growth rate on the maximum. so wondering if those kind of views have been changed in any shape or form because of the recent events. the second question that you talked about powder river basin.
so what will it take for that development pace to accelerate?
ezra yacob -- president
yes, paul. this is ezra. i think i can answer both of those questions almost in the same manner. when we came out with the 8% to 10% growth, which was gosh, maybe close to 20 months ago now, that was -- and i think we said at that time, that it's dynamic.
at that time, that 8% to 10% model was reflective of what we could do to optimize near-term and long-term free cash flow with the current inventory and our current knowledge base. and as you can see, things continue to change for the better for us. we continue to drive down costs. we continue to drive forward each of our, let's call them emerging plays with the powder river basin and dorado.
and so when we talk about what's a good growth rate going forward, it comes back to those two things that i started off the call with doug with. the first is optimizing our returns, investing at a pace where we can really create long-term shareholder value. and you do that through adding lower cost reserves to the base of the company, so driving down the cost base of the company while also reinvesting so that you can turn your cash over quickly. our wells this year at strip price since we based it on a $40 investment, what that really translates to are wells that pay out on average in two to three months right now in the strip price.
so it's a fantastic place to be, and it's really strengthening the base of the business and the company going forward. with regards to the prb, it falls under the same type of line. it all depends on how we build out our infrastructure in that basin and moving at a pace to be able to incorporate our learnings to drive down the well costs. last quarter, i think we highlighted we had dropped the niobrara well cost pretty significantly over the past year, 2021, which was just tremendous results.
and as we continue to see progress like that, we feel more confident to go ahead and allocate more capital to that portfolio, to that basin.
operator
that is all the time we have for questions today. so i will now hand the call back to mr. yacob to conclude.
ezra yacob -- president
we'd like to thank everyone for participating on the call this morning. and thanks to our shareholders for your support. we especially want to recognize each of our employees for their commitment to excellence and on delivering such an outstanding start to the year for eog.

operator
good day, everyone, and welcome to the eog resources first quarter 2022 earnings results conference call. as a reminder, this call is being recorded. at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, i would like to turn the call over to the chief financial officer of eog resources, mr. tim driggers.
please go ahead, sir.
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
good morning, and thanks for joining us. this conference call includes forward-looking statements. factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and eog's sec filings. this conference call also contains certain non-gaap financial measures.
definitions and reconciliation schedules for these non-gaap measures can be found on eog's website. this conference call also include estimated resource potential, not necessarily calculated in accordance with the sec's reserve reporting guidelines. participating on the call this morning are ezra yacob, chief executive officer; billy helms, president and chief operating officer; ken boedeker, evp, exploration and production; jeff leitzell, evp, exploration and production; lance terveen, senior vp, marketing; and david streit, vp, investor and public relations. here is ezra.
ezra yacob -- president
thanks, tim. good morning, everyone. eog's cash return strategy demonstrates our commitment to deliver long-term shareholder value. yesterday, we declared a second special dividend for the year of $1.80 per share following last quarter's $1 per share.
combined with our peer-leading annualized regular dividend of $3 per share year-to-date, we have announced $3.4 billion in cash returned to shareholders in 2022. eog has a strong history of cash return. since we began trading as an independent company in 1999, we have delivered a sustainable growing regular dividend. it has never been cut or suspended, and its 23-year compound annual growth rate is 22%.
since the transition of premium drilling in 2016, our dividend compound annual growth rate has been even higher at 28%, including doubling our dividend last year. today, our regular dividend not only leads our e&p peer group, it is more than competitive across all sectors of the market. more recently, we have supplemented our regular dividend with significant special dividends, reflecting our commitment to both capital discipline and returning cash to shareholders. while we are proud of our cash return track record, we acknowledge shareholders' desire for more transparency and predictability.
to provide both, we recently formalized and yesterday announced our cash return commitment of returning a minimum of 60% of annual free cash flow. going forward, our intention is to evaluate and pay the regular dividend and consider options for additional cash return every quarter. the addition of quantitative guidance to our cash return framework reflects our confidence in our business. the pandemic-driven volatility in the oil and gas market is stabilizing.
however, the macro environment continues to evolve with the war in ukraine and other geopolitical events. we have proven to ourselves over the last several years that our business is resilient through the cycle, including unprecedented shocks to the industry. credit for eog's resilience for the steady improvement in our ability to generate free cash flow in any environment and the ability to make this free cash flow commitment to our shareholders goes to our employees, who embraced our premium return hurdle rate six years ago, which requires that all investments earn a minimum of 30% direct after-tax rate of return using a $40 flat oil and $2.50 flat natural gas price. last year, we doubled the minimum return to 60%.
both the premium and now double premium hurdle rates have positioned the company to have an outstanding year in 2022. in spite of the ongoing inflationary and supply chain issues facing our industry, our employees outperformed during the first quarter and are positioned to deliver on our annual capital and volumes plan. we have decades of low-cost, high-return inventory that support the consistent financial performance that our shareholders have come to expect and that drives long-term value. our inventory spans multiple assets across oil, combo and dry natural gas basins throughout the country, which enables us to pursue the highest netbacks by diversifying both our investment and sales market options.
we also continue to explore. a year and a half ago, we announced dorado, a premium dry natural gas play, where we've captured 21 tcf of resource potential net to eog. in a moment, ken will update you on the progress we've made on well performance and well costs in what we believe is the lowest cost and lowest emission source of natural gas onshore u.s. our organic exploration program has grown our premium inventory by more than three and a half times since the premium metric was introduced in 2016.
so our exploration program isn't focused on adding more. we are looking for better inventory. new players, like dorado, and the potential we see in our current exploration pipeline gives us confidence we will continue to grow and improve our double premium inventory in the future as we have done in the past. while we have earmarked and committed to return a minimum of 60% of annual free cash flow, our long-standing framework and priorities for total free cash flow are unchanged.
a sustainable growing regular dividend, a pristine balance sheet, additional cash returned to shareholders through special dividends and opportunistic stock buybacks and low-cost property bolt-ons. sustaining and growing the regular dividend remains our highest priority and reflects our confidence in the long-term performance of the company. a pristine balance sheet is a strategic advantage functioning as a shock absorber that also provides the flexibility to exercise a buyback when the opportunity arises and to take advantage of other countercyclical investments. additional cash returns through special dividends and buybacks complement our other priorities.
and together with our free cash flow minimum return guidance, support our goal to create significant long-term shareholder value. now, here's tim to review our financial position.
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
thanks, ezra. our ability to refine our long-standing cash return framework by providing quantitative guidance is made possible by eog's outstanding operational and financial performance. in the first quarter, eog earned $2.3 billion after adjusting items or $4 per share. we generated $2.3 billion of free cash flow.
capital expenditures of $1 billion were near the low end of the guidance range, while production volumes and total per unit cash operating cost finished better than targets. our confidence is further bolstered because we finished the quarter in an incredibly strong financial position. total debt on march 31 was $5.1 billion. this includes the current portion of debt of $1.25 billion reflecting a bond that matures in march 2023 that we intend to pay off with cash on hand.
cash on march 31 was $4 billion for a net debt of $1.1 billion. this yields a debt to total capitalization ratio of 4.8%. the $4 billion cash balance excludes $2.4 billion of collateral for hedges held by our counterparties. the amount of collateral fluctuates with oil and natural gas prices.
these short-term timing differences in cash flows are not considered in our calculation of free cash flow and do not influence our decision on the timing or amount of cash return to shareholders. to that end, eog has declared special dividends so far this year totaling $2.80 per share on top of the regular dividend of $3 per share on an annual basis, totaling $3.4 billion. our objective in establishing our cash return guidance was to make it simple, yet dynamic so that it is easily communicated and understood, while remaining suitable under a range of commodity price scenarios. the actual amount of cash returned each year is a product of our long-standing free cash flow priorities.
these have not changed. the size of our regular dividend is now the largest of our e&p peers and the strength of our balance sheet supports our ability to return a large portion of free cash flow back to shareholders going forward under a range of scenarios. the $1.80 special dividend declared yesterday along with the $0.75 regular quarterly dividend demonstrates significant progress toward our commitment to returning at least 60% of our 2022 free cash flow to our shareholders. subject to commodity prices, the amount of free cash flow available and the board's discretion, our intention is to return cash through special dividends or stock buybacks on a quarterly basis going forward.
here's billy.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
thanks, tim. we've had a great start to the year. our first quarter volume, capital expenditure and total per unit cash operating cost performance exceeded our forecasted targets. we're also pleased with our progress to date offsetting inflation and managing well costs.
our drilling teams continue to reduce drilling days and generate consistent performance improvements. use of self-sourced downhole tools as well as minimizing downtime and mud losses remain areas of focus to improve performance. for example, drilling times in our eagle ford oil play continue to improve, decreasing 28% in the last 5 years. the average well is now drilled in less than 5 days.
on the completion side, we have increased the amount of treated lateral per day by about 10% over the last year as we further deploy the super zipper technique. we are now using this technique on more than half of the wells completed in the company and expect to increase its use further as we progress through the year. in addition, our self-sourced sand program is providing a tremendous advantage that we expect to further offset additional inflation throughout the year. when we established our plan at the beginning of the year, we knew the unusually tight supply constraints initially sparked by the economic recovery from the pandemic would present a unique challenge.
taking these headwinds into account, this year's plan was devised with known efficiency improvements that would maintain well costs flat with last year. while we have since seen increased steel and fuel prices directly associated with the war in ukraine, we are confident we can still deliver on the capex and volume targets in our original plan. rather than accept inflation as a given, our employees remain proactive. we have a track record of lowering cost and developing efficiencies through periods of economic expansion and other drivers of inflation.
our operating teams are ever more diligent in their quest to identify new areas of performance enhancements that will lower well cost. eog's advantage lies with our people and our culture. today's challenges are met with innovation and value creation in the field through our multiple basin decentralized approach. this period of inflationary fuel prices is the primary driver of the 2% increase in our full year per unit cash operating costs versus our previous guidance.
however, higher commodity prices also presented an opportune time to enhance our workover program, which will be reflected in loe expense. these additional workovers bring on low-cost production, they pay out within weeks and increase the long-term performance of our assets. all in all, we are thoughtfully managing our assets to offset a small effect from inflation. while we have flexibility to adjust our plan in any given year to respond to unique or extreme marketing conditions, such as the pandemic in 2020, our capital plan is thoughtfully planned across all our assets to support the pace of operations that is optimal for each individual asset to continue to improve.
we believe we have the best people, assets and plan to mitigate any headwinds and continue to improve the company for the long term. here's ken to discuss the incredible improvements we made in our premium gas play, dorado.
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
thanks, billy. a year and a half ago, we announced a major new natural gas discovery in south texas, we named dorado. it's a dry gas play with 21 tcf of resource potential net to eog across stacked pays in the austin chalk and eagle ford formations. our breakeven cost in dorado is less than $1.25 per mcf, which we believe represents the lowest cost of supply of natural gas in the united states.
dorado is the most recent double premium play to emerge from our organic exploration program. we began technical work on dorado back in 2016, captured a large acreage position in the core of the play as a first mover during 2017 and 2018 and drilled test wells in late 2018 and 2019. after pausing during the downturn in 2020, we moved dorado into active development last year and completed 11 net wells. this year, we anticipate completing 30 net wells, nearly tripling activity.
since last year, we have doubled our production rate out of dorado, producing 140 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter of 2022. we are leveraging our proprietary knowledge built from prior plays to move quickly down the cost curve as we increase activity at a pace that allows us to incorporate learnings and savings. we completed seven net wells during the first quarter of 2022 while keeping well costs flat compared to similar designs in the first quarter of last year, successfully offsetting inflation. since our first wells drilled in 2018, we have reduced well costs over 35% and are approaching our target well costs faster than we anticipated.
in addition, well performance is improving. productivity from recent wells is significantly beating our initial forecast. refined completion techniques and a focus on targeting have increased our performance projections on a per foot basis. this year, we have also moved to longer lateral switch, combined with the improvements to per foot productivity have resulted in an 80% higher two year cumulative production volume than our 2018 wells, compounding our capital efficiency.
our preliminary plan for the play was to focus initial development on the austin chalk formation and then follow that with development of the eagle ford so it would benefit from well cost reductions as well as water and gas gathering infrastructure installed for the austin chalk. with the dramatic improvements to our eagle ford formation well results, we now expect to codevelop it with the austin chalk, which will provide additional opportunities to lower costs through scale and simultaneous operations. as a dry gas play in close proximity to multiple markets, we expect dorado's gas will have a lower emissions footprint compared to other onshore gas supplies in the u.s. in addition, we continue to leverage companywide expertise to build out an operationally efficient and low emissions field.
as we expand development of dorado into a core asset, it will contribute to lowering eog's companywide emissions intensity rate. combined with eog's low operating costs and advantaged market position located close to several major sales hubs in south texas, including access to pipelines to mexico and several lng export terminals, dorado is in an ideal position to supply low-cost, low emissions, natural gas into markets with long-term growth potential. now, next up is ezra for concluding remarks.
ezra yacob -- president
thanks, ken. i'd like to note the following important takeaways from the call today. first, formalizing our cash return strategy demonstrates our commitment to our free cash flow priorities that, along with high return, disciplined reinvestment, offers significant long-term shareholder value. second, eog is realizing another tremendous year of improvement.
we are set to deliver outstanding returns while demonstrating capital discipline within an inflationary environment, delivering on both volumes and capital as announced at the beginning of 2022. third, our most recent organic exploration announcement, dorado, has positioned us with over 20 tcf of low-cost natural gas with access to multiple markets. our progress in dorado is on pace to make this north america's lowest cost of supply. thanks for listening.
now we'll go to q&a.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from leo mariani, mkm partners. leo, please go ahead.
leo mariani -- mkm partners -- analyst
hey, guys. totally realize that it's obviously way too early for '23 guidance at this point. you guys did have some prepared comments, which kind of said as things stand today. you would look to grow oil kind of low single digits next year.
i guess it feels like a bit of a pivot from what you all had said in the past, which was kind of this 8% to 10% oil growth would kind of be optimal sort of operating speed for eog as kind of something changed in terms of how you look at kind of optimizing the operations versus the growth of the company.
ezra yacob -- president
yes, leo. this is ezra. i appreciate your question. really, what we've always talked about is that our growth is really the output of our ability to generate high returns from a disciplined reinvestment strategy.
and that's really what we've tried to describe today is as you pointed out, first of all, it is early to talk about 2023. but ultimately, we're committed to remaining disciplined. we want to focus investment in each of our assets at a level where they can continue to improve every year. directionally, as we see it today, how the supply and demand balances look, the constraints on services, the associated inflationary pressures, oil growth will likely be similar to this year.
and as billy highlighted, we'd expect to direct additional investment toward our dorado natural gas play based on the positive results that we're seeing there.
leo mariani -- mkm partners -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and i just wanted to ask on the capital. obviously, you're one of the few companies did not raise the capex budget thus far here in '22.
you described a lot of the ways that you're able to kind of keep costs lower and some of the innovation that you've sort of had. i did notice that you did pull some of the wells out of the schedule this year. it's not big numbers, just talking a few on the margin. just wanted to get a sense, is there any thought that you're maybe doing a little bit less to kind of stay within the budget and just kind of looking at where you were in the first half and third quarter guidance.
is it fair to say you're probably kind of in the upper half of the capex for the year?
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yes. leo, this is billy helms. yes. the small change in well count is really just a result of two things: one is timing.
some of the wells that were scheduled to complete at year-end are going to slip into the next year. it's just a timing thing. the other factor that plays into that is a change in working interest in some of our plays. we've had slightly lower working interest in some of our delaware basin wells in the second half of the year.
just to illustrate how minimal that is, that's only about a 2% average change in working interest across the year. so it's a very minuscule amount, but that explains the change in the well count. as far as the capex, we're very pleased, as you can tell from the comments we made about the ability of our teams to continue to innovate and drive efficiencies in our business to offset inflation. inflation turns out to be just a little bit higher than we anticipated this year, so we are going to see a slight increase in our well cost as we go through especially the second half of the year, but we're still confident we're going to stay within our guidance and don't expect to face additional costs that will increase our budget.
leo mariani -- mkm partners -- analyst
great. thanks, guys.

our next question comes from arun jayaram from jpmorgan chase. arun, please go ahead.
arun jayaram -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. good morning. i appreciate the color on the powder river basin, but i guess my first question is just thinking about capital allocation between the basins as we think about next year. today, ezra, i think 22 of 24 of your rig lines are either in the delaware or eagle ford.
you have one rig in the powder river basin. you mentioned in your comments you plan to lean a little bit on dorado next year and significantly increase perhaps the mix of activity in the powder river basin. just wondering if you can give us a sense of how your activity could shift as we think about next year and how many rig lines you may have in the powder.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yes, arun. this is billy. as far as capital allocation, as we see it today, there's a lot of factors play into that, of course, and it's early to say where we're going to be still well have quite a bit of activity in the delaware basin going forward. it is a premier play in the company, and certainly, that will continue to command quite a bit of capital.
eagle ford has been, as you know, a performance engine for the company for the last decade or longer. and that will -- and they're generating outstanding results. so that will still command capital. as we compare -- we allocate capital based on returns and certainly, the encouragement we're seeing from dorado and the activity there is showing us the ability to be able to continue to fund that program going forward.
and then the confidence we have in the new emerging powder river basin gives us a sense that, that will also come in quite a bit of activity. so the ratios, i would say, are going to stay similar. as far as the powder river basin and our overall capital plan, that will depend on the outlook for commodities at that time, but the -- what we're going to see in the powder, just to be clear, is a shift of activity from some of their older traditional plays, the turner and the parkman to some of the deeper, more emerging plays in the mowry more specifically in the nio. so you'll see that shift.
the amount of capital allocated to that play will also depend on just the commodity price outlook that we see for the year once we get closer to that. but overall, we're -- the takeaway from that, i would think, would be that the flexibility we have with the multiple plays we have to change to continue to add value long term to the shareholders.
arun jayaram -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. my follow-up is just maybe one for tim. just maybe a housekeeping question. tim, in the 10-q, you have $1.8 billion of collateral postings associated with hedge activity.
i was wondering if you could help us think about the potential runoff of those collateral postings as well as maybe the timing of when you plan to pay off the $1.25 billion of bonds. is that later this year or in '23?
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
yes. this is tim. as far as the bond, that is '23. it's in the first quarter of 2023 is when that will mature.
we have no plans to pay it off early. as far as the collateral they run off kind of like the hedges that we've given you the timing of when those hedges are in our 10-q. so it kind of runs off as that timing comes off. it all depends, of course, on where the strip goes, how that comes off.
but right now, it's based on the strip, and that would be how it would come off as just as those run off.
arun jayaram -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
all right. great. thanks.
operator
our next question comes from scott hanold from rbc capital markets. scott, please go ahead.
scott hanold -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yes. thanks. and if i could ask a question, one more question maybe on the prb. you all highlight some good commodity price realizations that you're all seeing there.
is that something that you think can persist going forward? and is it a function of what's happening in the basin overall? or is it specifically something eog's got in place that allows you to kind of benefit there a little bit more.
lance terveen -- senior vice president, marketing
scott, this is lance terveen. thanks for your question. yes, when you think about the price realizations, i think the broader message is just you can really just see how competitive the powder is with all our other plays. i mean, operationally, i mean, you heard jeff kind of outline a lot of things in the opening comments, but even for our products, we continue to just really see it being in high demand.
for example, like even on the crude, you have to remember one of the important attributes up in the powder, especially related to eog, is just think about the crude quality. i mean today, we're kind of seeing right around 44, 45. we expect that to kind of be a 44, 47 kind of over time. and so we really want to protect that quality.
we've secured 500,000 barrels of storage is kind of in the field. we've got firm capacity to both guernsey and the cushing market. so having that multiple flexibility where we can show that kind of high demand barrel and the api quality that we have keep it kind of segregated with that api quality, it's really a value when we sell direct to our refiners. and so just being able to have that value and have that quality and consistency is key, and so we draw a lot of that experience from what we've done in the eagle ford and also in the powder -- i mean, i'm sorry, in the delaware basin.
but yes, that's -- it's -- the quality is what you're seeing on the price realizations. and then as you think about the ngls, you're seeing mostly ethane rejection that's happening there. so most of that, you're seeing the ethane that's going to be going more toward like an mmbtu or selling that as a gas. and so that is a heavier barrel that you're seeing that we kind of show.
but again, we have the market flexibility. we can show that barrel in conway. we can also show that barrel in mont belvieu. so we can kind of are that flexibility to and look at those spreads.
so getting kind of back to your question, i mean, really the quality and then the flexibility that we have with the multiple markets and it's in an area that's absolutely in demand as we --
scott hanold -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. and as my follow-up, i want to ask a question on trinidad. and it looks like you're guiding down a fair amount for gas production in trinidad. and i know you've had some exploration success there, and i think you're drilling and development or you have or you're going to be drilling a development well this year.
so can you give us a sense of like what to expect from trended at? and is it more of the relative pricing dynamic there versus dorado in terms of like which play is going to get sort of more capital investment?
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yes, scott. this is billy helms. so for trinidad, we've had, as you know, a long successful history of really maintaining pretty much flat production with minimal investment, and it generates quite a bit of cash flow for the company. so it's been a very successful project for multiple decades now.
we still see exploration opportunities and are still counting on exploration success going forward just based on the things we see today. the small guide down in gas production, especially in the next, say, the rest of this year, is based on some turnaround projects we have on some of the compressor stations and platforms in the field. so it's just an operational issue really in the manifest in the third quarter mainly. but as we start to drill some of these exploration wells, we still have confidence that production base will continue.
scott hanold -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. ok. so it should turn around back to sort of normal levels by early '23. is that right?
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yes. that's right.
scott hanold -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from scott gruber from citigroup. scott, please go ahead.
scott gruber -- citi -- analyst
yes. good morning. just coming back to the inflation question, i know you guys have previously commented that you don't see an outsized inflationary impact on eog next year from contract role or any other factors. but have you engaged in these earlier than normal discussions for services and consumables, etc., are you still confident that the inflation that you experienced next year will not be any worse than the industry trends?
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yes, scott. this is billy helms, again. on the inflation question, i think i would distinguish a little bit there. i think we're recognizing the inflation that everybody else in the industry is seeing.
we're able to combat that really through a lot of the efficiencies we drive through our business. and that's really a result of the culture we have of continuous improvement and the quality of the staff we have in each of our operating divisions. so now the contracting strategy has always been a long-term thing for eog. we worked with our vendors, our partners on the service side.
and our contracts are always a little bit staggered so that all the contracts don't roll off at the same time. that gives us a lot of flexibility to also manage the commodity cycles to make sure we have a consistent operating performance level going into the year. we always start about this time of year. so i wouldn't say we're starting any earlier than we typically do.
i think we always started sometime here in the middle part of the year to start securing services for the next year as we see things play out. we take opportunities as we see those emerge to make arrangements with vendors and our service partners to secure those services in the upcoming year and that determines the level of services that we secure for next year's well cost. we typically like to think about securing about 50% to 60% of the well cost ahead of any given year. and that range depends on the opportunities we see with service partners to lock in those services.
this year, we expect to be somewhat the same as we go into next year, but it -- we'll see as we get closer to the year-end, but that's how we see the inflation. obviously, we expect with the tightness in the market, we're going to see some additional inflationary pressure going into next year. so just anticipating that, we could see another uptick in our well cost going into next year, but we expect to, again, moderate a lot of that with our efficiency gains.
scott gruber -- citi -- analyst
got it. and then a follow-up here on the 60% distribution threshold really in light of the early hedge settlement payments you made this quarter, so if you include those payments which you guys are doing your reporting, then you guys are running ahead of the threshold. but if you assume those are more of a onetime hit to free cash, then you're running a little bit behind that threshold. and i know you look at the threshold on an annual basis.
so i guess the question is, what's your appetite to approach the 60% payout for the year removing the impact of the $1.3 billion in early head settlement payments?
ezra yacob -- president
yes, scott. this is ezra. just a little bit of color on that. obviously, the board decides the dividend each quarter.
they review our business needs, the macro environment, the cash position, so on and so forth. and as you said, the $1.50 per share special this quarter, which brings the total dividend commitment to right at $7.30 per share is on pace to achieve the minimum of a 60% free cash flow return. and i think that's the emphasis on there is that the 60% is a minimum. ultimately, it's up to the board, like i said, to return additional cash in 2022.
the way to think about those early terminations of the hedges is really a reflection, i think, of our confidence in improving the financial profile of the company. our ability to navigate inflationary pressures this year flexibility to allocate capital across multiple resource plays, which are each delivering exceptional returns and really our ability to continue to lower the cost base of the company. these are all things that deliver expanded free cash flow opportunities for eog.
scott gruber -- citi -- analyst
great. appreciate the color, ezra. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from neal dingmann from truist securities. neal, please go ahead.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
good morning. my first question is maybe for you or tim, on a little bit different capital allocation. specifically, i'm trying to get a sense of what you all would need to see either quantitative and qualitatively need to see to start potentially look at more or, i guess, as guys calling out there leading into buybacks. do you have an understand you all have bought back shares for years and we did see a decent decline a month or so from the highs.
so i'm just wondering when you guys think about buybacks, what -- when you say opportunistic, what really goes into that?
ezra yacob -- president
yes, neal. this is ezra. thank you for the question. basically, we evaluate a buyback just like any other investment decision.
and really, what we do is we look to see how it's going to create long-term shareholder value. and as you highlighted and as we've discussed previously, the $5 billion share repurchase authorization that we have in place, we've talked about using it opportunistically. and what that means for us is using it during times of what we would say are significant dislocations in the market. and that's as opposed to a more programmatic system.
and quite frankly, this year, during q2, we didn't really see a what we would say was a significant dislocation. we definitely witnessed a lot of volatility, i think, rather than a dislocation. the volatility was due -- is driven by changes to the oil inventories that we saw that was really due to the spr releases. we saw some concern over demand destruction associated with the inflationary pressures across the broad market.
we saw some potential for weaker demand associated with the uptick of covid cases. but ultimately, in our view, these are all kind of short-term events that really don't change the fundamental supply and demand picture.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
i like how you all thinking about that, ezra. and then my second or follow-up likely for billy, just on vertical integrations, specifically. you all have other areas -- other oilfield service areas besides you mentioned the self-sourced sand. and i'm just wondering do you have other areas that, i guess, you would call it more vertically integrated or that you would think about doing that.
and i'm just wondering that also on that self-source sand, how much capacity do you have on that side?
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yes, neal, this is billy. certainly, on the self-source sand, you named one of the primary ones. it's a big part of our program. we've been doing that, as you might remember, for more than a decade.
and what we've been able to do is find ways to get the source of the sand closer and closer to the wellhead minimizing not only the cost of the product, but also the transportation involved in getting it to the wellhead. we are expanding that through the rest of the year such that we'll be able to continue to supply greater and greater amounts from our own self-sourced mines, so we're excited about the growth in that. other areas that we self-source, there's a number of them. i mentioned briefly in the prepared comments, a note to our efforts to take control of the drilling motors that we use in our drilling operation.
that's a small thing maybe, but it's a big driver of performance when it comes to that part of the business. and we recognized that a couple of years ago, built up some expertise in our staff to address that. we worked specifically to not only design, but also and oversee the maintenance of those motors that ultimately drives the improved performance and we're seeing great results from that program. and that's another differentiator in our drilling performance that allows us to continue to offset inflation.
some of the other things, as you know, we've been managing our tubular inventory for many, many years as well. we deal directly with the steel mills, which gives us a lot of advantages in the sense of having some clarity or some certainty on the market and kind of what that's indicating to get ahead of issues where we see it, take advantage of opportunities to secure those at lower cost and make sure that we have pipe for our programs on a go-forward basis. so those are maybe a couple of other things that would give you some color on what we're doing.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
that's great details, billy. thank you, guys, for the time.
operator
our next question comes from doug leggate from bank of america. doug, please go ahead. doug leggate, your line is now open. you can proceed with your question.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning, everyone. thanks for letting me on. ezra, slide 5, your latest assessment of cash flow doesn't give any numbers around it in terms of breakeven. i wonder if i could just ask you to look into 2023 and give us an update of where you see your sustaining capital and the breakeven oil and gas prices that go along with that, the assumptions behind that, if you don't mind.
ezra yacob -- president
yes, doug. we haven't released that and we did remove the breakeven slide from earlier this year because of the significant change in gas prices that have gone on in the first six months of the year. the best thing i can point to is the fact that we continue to bring on lower-cost reserves, basically focused on the premium and double premium wells into the cost base of the company. you can look at a reduction unit costs and the reduction in our dd&a rate year over year to kind of infer the reduction in our breakevens.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. i'll push david on this and see if we can get him to put it back in a pretty critical input to, obviously, the market's perception of free cash flow, but i appreciate the answer. my follow-up is, i apologize in advance if you're not going to like this, but just a follow-up on the share buyback question. dislocations in your stock is subjected obviously.
but if i look at your share performance in both absolute terms and in relative terms in particular for the last four or five years, it's really struggled to against the rest of the sector. and one could interpret from your comments about dislocations and perhaps to buy back that you don't see value in your stock. so i wonder if you could address that versus the transitory nature of a special dividend, why you wouldn't want to step in because just about everyone of your peers is doing something on buybacks and their share performance is quite different from yours on a relative basis. so any thoughts around that would be appreciated.
ezra yacob -- president
yes, doug. the first thing i would say is that that's right. i think it's stating the obvious that i feel that our stock is undervalued right now. but again, we look at that buyback and investment in that buyback, we compare it against other opportunities in the business to create shareholder value -- long-term shareholder value.
and when we do that, when we compare it versus reinvesting in the business, drilling these double premium -- these premium wells at a 30% and a 60% direct after-tax rate of return based on $40 oil and $2.50 natural gas, it's a very, very high hurdle. so when we think about what can create longer-term value for the shareholder, we see the benefit of reinvesting in the business, driving down our long-term well costs, lowering the breakevens as we talked about, as a very, very competitive portion of allocation. now with regards on the transitory nature -- comparison with the transitory nature of a special dividend, i think, again, it goes back to the way that we look at the buyback with regard to our shareholders. buying, repurchasing shares during a volatile movement in the stock price.
i think our shareholders prefer to have the assurity of special dividends coming back to them as opposed to us trying to time the volatility in the markets. now that's different from, again, i would go back to what we call a significant market dislocation where i think you'd have an opportunity there that would compete very favorably to create long-term shareholder value.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
is that a tricky one, i guess, a special dividend isn't reinvesting? and if you think your stock is undervalued, then one could argue that the volatility is something you've got to live with that you think -- i guess we're never going to -- we're probably not going to agree on this, but it seems to me the special dividend is -- yes, it's the lesser permanent impact from the share price, i guess, is what i was getting at. but anyway, i appreciate your answer, as i always appreciate your perspective. thank you.
ezra yacob -- president

our next question comes from paul cheng from scotiabank. paul, please go ahead.
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
thank you. good morning. two questions, please. also, could you comment on the a&d market.
in, for example, in eagle ford, i think you gentlemen have said the asset is getting a little bit higher. so do you see opportunity to make maybe more sizable bolt-on acquisition that to beef up the operation there? and secondly, that just wondering that have you guys got a chance to review the new standard proposal on the tax law changes? and how that -- what will be any major impact to eog? thank you.
ezra yacob -- president
thank you, paul. this is ezra. let me attack that first question on the eagle ford, and then i'll hand it over to tim driggers to give some feedback on the tax law proposals. so on the a&d market there in the eagle ford, yes, let me clarify how we're viewing the eagle ford right now.
we're on pace to deliver for the second year in a row, basically record rates of return and record finding costs in our drilling program there. and the big thing that it comes to is it kind of fits back into some of my opening comments, talking about the right investment rate for plays at different life cycles. so clearly, our eagle ford position has reached a point where it's not a main focus area for growth anymore. but what we see is a very, very long runway of exceptional returns on those wells as you reinvest in them, assuming that we're moving at the right pace where our team has the ability to execute on lowering costs, increasing incrementally the well productivity.
as far as expanding our footprint there, we still have a very robust eagle ford inventory position. when i think about the eagle ford position, we've talked about 7,000 locations and being approximately halfway drilled through those locations. so still well over 10 years' worth of inventory to drill on. the other thing about looking to do a&d in an established basin like that is just going to be the cost of acquisition.
we primarily focus our exploration efforts, and we always have for the two decades that we've been involved in unconventional resources on organic or greenfield lease acquisitions because that low cost of entry is critically important to providing through-cycle value to the shareholders. those -- the pdp value that you would have to pay for in an established area or just established acreage prices, those things stay with you on your books forever. it raises the cost base of the company and is really antithesis to what we've been trying to do over the last few years by shifting to premium and now double premium drilling. tim, would you like to please comment on the tax proposals?
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
paul, as far as the proposal, we're in the process of reviewing that as is everyone else currently, but specifically looking at the minimum tax proposal. we do not see that as having any detriment to eog. we are a full taxpayer already. so as we model it currently, it will have no impact on eog.
operator
our next question comes from jeanine wai from barclays. jeanine, please go ahead.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking our questions. maybe just following up on paul's question there. low-cost bolt-ons have always been part of your capital allocation strategy.
and we noticed the cash flow statement had about $350 million of that in there. any color on whether that was primarily blocking and tackling in your active areas? or is that more on the exploration front?
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yes. jeanine, this is billy helms. that particular acquisition is really just an opportunity we found to bolt on some largely primarily acreage in some of our exploration plays, very little lift, no production on those plays. and it just is another way that we continue to add and grow at a low cost, our exploration opportunity set that we see in the future of the company.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
ok. great. and then maybe just a quick 1 on marketing. you talked about -- you've got optionality for up to 250,000 barrels a day of brent exposure.
you're not electing that much right now, but we're looking at your production levels out of the permian and the eagle ford. and so what's the capacity to increase beyond that 250 or maybe to get to that 250? and if you were to take on some more exposure on that, is this really looking at things more on the contract side? or are you also securing to -- or are you also open to securing more docks based on your own?
lance terveen -- senior vice president, marketing
jeanine, thanks for the question. good question, too, is timely. the exports, especially for crude oil has been an important component of our marketing strategy. but when you really look just from an industry standpoint, too, i mean, refiners in the u.s.
are not expanding. i mean, if anything, it's degrading, right? i mean we're seeing our market share. you're seeing refineries shutting down. you're seeing refineries that are being repurposed.
and so we had a view going all the way back to 2018 that we wanted to have a significant export position that we could access from multiple plays. and i know one of your questions there was just how do we think about the delaware basin? or how do we think about the eagle ford? and you're exactly right. that was all in our contracting that we wanted to be able to have a large position that we could access from both of those plays. so if you think about it today, we have that 250 and yes that facility is expandable, but we have 5 million barrels of storage.
i mean we can segregate wtl, wti. we can segregate our eagle ford. i mean, we're in a premier position as we think about from a low cost and being in early with our tankage position and then also with the capacity that we have out of the delaware basin from a transport position and also from the eagle ford. so what i would say is we can transact very quickly we have tankage that's in place.
and so if we feel the need that we needed to push more across, that's absolutely something that we could do.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you.

our next question comes from neil mehta from goldman sachs. neil, please go ahead.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey. good morning, ezra and team. just one question for me. it's just -- can you give us the lay of the land of how the dorado program is shaping up? how do you think about the net asset as we go into next year from a planning perspective, but as we continue to see the gas curve has firmed up here, how do you think dorado could fit into the overall u.s.
gas picture?
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
yes, neil, this is ken. at this time, we really have two drilling reactive in the dorado play. and just to give you a little bit of a background on it, since 2018, we've drilled and completed over 30 of our 1,250 premium locations, both in the austin chalk and the eagle ford, and we've really made excellent progress on reducing well cost and enhancing our geologic understanding and increasing our well performance. we're -- we've increased our lateral length and we're really operationally being able to execute.
as far as how 2023 goes, it's a little early to talk about the 2023 program yet. obviously, we'll remain disciplined with our investment there, first, to make sure that the market needs the gas and second, to make sure we're operationally getting better. we -- one thing to keep in mind is really don't need a lot of wells there to grow production significantly given the performance of the wells and their shallow decline rates.
operator
in the interest of time, that is the end of the q&a session today. so i'll now hand you over to mr. yacob for closing remarks.
ezra yacob -- president
yes. and we want to thank everyone for participating in the call this morning, and thanks to our shareholders for their continued support. we especially want to recognize our employees for their performance this quarter. our discussion today highlights their focus on making eog a low-cost operator, generating high returns and lowering our environmental footprint each and every year.

good day, everyone, and welcome to the eog resources second quarter 2020 earnings results conference call. as a reminder, this call is being recorded. at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, i would like to turn the call over to the chief financial officer of eog resources, mr. tim driggers.
please go ahead, sir.
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
good morning, and thanks for joining us. this conference call includes forward-looking statements. factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and eog's sec filings. this conference call also contains certain non-gaap financial measures.
definitions and reconciliation schedules for these non-gaap measures can be found on eog's website. this conference call may also include estimated resource potential not necessarily calculated in accordance with the sec's reserve reporting guidelines. participating on the call this morning are ezra yacob, chief executive officer; billy helms, president and chief operating officer; ken boedeker, evp, exploration and production; jeff leitzell, evp, exploration and production; lance terveen, senior vp, marketing; and david streit, vp, investor relations. here's ezra.
ezra yacob -- president
thanks, tim. good morning, everyone. yesterday, we declared a third special dividend for the year, demonstrating our commitment to deliver long-term shareholder value through our cash return strategy. the $1.50 dividend is supported by another outstanding quarter.
we posted adjusted earnings of $2.74 per share and nearly $1.3 billion of free cash flow. so far this year, we have declared $4.30 per share of special dividends. combined with our peer-leading annualized regular dividend of $3 per share, we are on pace to pay out a minimum of 60% of annual free cash flow. we'll continue to differentiate eog as our people and our assets.
we've cultivated an inventory of premium and double premium wells that provide a 20-year runway for the company through our focus on organic exploration supported by a decentralized organizational structure. our multi-basin portfolio is predominantly the result of having seven north american and one international cross-functional exploration teams that work independently, but collaborate on shared learnings. our role here in houston beyond capital allocation is to facilitate those shared learnings across all eight teams. the result is a robust exploration pipeline that continues to both improve the quality of and expand our more than 20-year inventory of premium and double premium wells.
our portfolio includes the delaware basin, which remains the largest area of activity in the company and is delivering exceptional returns. after more than a decade of high-return drilling, our eagle ford asset continues to deliver top-tier results while operating at a steady pace. in our emerging south texas dorado dry natural gas play and powder river basin, mowry and niobrara combo plays are contributing to eog's success today and laying the groundwork for years of future high-return investment. in addition, we have tested our mowry and niobrara plays in the northern powder river basin.
our initial results have demonstrated the untapped potential of this oilier part of the basin as a complement to the outstanding performance in the southern part of the basin. eog's current multi-basin portfolio, offering exposure to both geographic and product diversity, alongside several other prospects in our exploration pipeline, will continue to expand eog's premium inventory and provide through-the-cycle value creation. disciplined reinvestment within any given play depends on where we are in the development life cycle of that play. our multi-basin portfolio of high-return assets all competitive against our premium hurdle rate provides invaluable flexibility to invest at the pace that allows each play to get better.
it also allows us to plan around basin-level market dynamics impacting services and infrastructure to minimize inflation and bottlenecks. we are able to optimize reinvestment across our total portfolio to add reserves at lower finding costs, lower the overall cost base of the company and continue to improve eog's companywide capital efficiency. this quarter, we are highlighting isense, our continuous methane monitoring system that we piloted in the delaware basin and are now deploying in our most active development areas. isense is yet another example of how eog's decentralized model not only fosters innovation across eight teams, but also compounds the impact of innovation by taking ideas born in one operating area and expanding them across multiple basins.
from the latest in information technology-driven solutions to reduce emissions, to innovation focused on drilling and completions operations, to procurement of casing and sand, eog is unique in its ability to leverage its culture and operating structure to get incrementally better every year. the tremendous inventory and cost improvements we've made over the last several years provides high confidence in the low breakevens and operational flexibility of our business. this confidence in our business, along with the strength of our industry-leading balance sheet -- this quarter to terminate a significant portion of our oil and natural gas hedges. going forward, we expect to hedge significantly less than the 20% to 30% of volumes we typically hedge in prior years.
the current operating environment is challenging given the volatility of commodity prices and inflation headwinds. through it all, our employees have remained focused on execution and have improved the business. our second-quarter performance is proof of that. we delivered more oil for less capital.
and in the face of a unique inflationary environment, our forecast for capital expenditure this year remains unchanged. eog's consistent execution, low-cost structure, reduced hedge position and transparent cash return strategy based on a regular dividend that we have never suspended or cut that has grown 21 of the last 24 years and is now competitive with the broader market, puts eog in its strongest position ever to deliver significant value to shareholders through the cycle. here's billy with an operational update and early look at 2023.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
thanks, ezra. we posted outstanding results in the second quarter. our performance included exceeding the midpoints of our production guidance, while capital expenditures and total per unit operating cost beat forecasted targets. so once again, more oil for less capital.
i'd like to thank our employees for their dedication and persistence to execute and deliver such outstanding results. as we have guided to all year, our oil growth year over year will be about 4% to return our production to pre-covid levels. halfway through the year, we're on track to deliver that objective and have done so against a challenging supply chain backdrop. the upper price pressure on steel, fuel and labor continues due to ongoing supply constraints initiated by covid and extended by the war in ukraine.
the impact of this has resulted in inflationary headwinds that have meaningfully exceeded our initial expectations earlier this year, making it increasingly challenging to maintain flat well cost. however, our employees continue to innovate and deliver efficiencies that offset a significant portion of this inflationary pressure. for example, in our delaware basin drilling operation, our downhole drilling motor program is providing solid performance improvements, generating a 13% year-over-year increase in the footage drilled per motor run. the motor program and other improvements are reducing drilling times versus last year.
in the eagle ford, our drilling teams have improved the footage drilled per day by 11% versus last year, while also managing drilling parameters to reduce the cost of drilling fluids by 10%. in our completion operations, we had previously discussed the company's plans to increase the use of super zipper completions, which are 40% faster than normal zipper operations. we have now utilized this technique on about 65% of eog's completed wells year to date, which is yielding an 11% improvement in the lateral footage completed per day. super zipper completions, combined with our focus on more efficient operational practices, has increased the amount of pumping hours per day by 24%.
in addition, we continue to progress our self-sourced sand program and expect to further reduce sand cost in the second half of the year and extend those savings into 2023. all in all, we now expect our well cost to see a modest single-digit increase over last year, and most of this increase will be seen in the second half of the year. however, we're able to leverage our operational flexibility within our multi-basin portfolio such that our capital and volume plan remains unchanged. now turning to the macro backdrop.
oilfield service capacity remains extremely tight and is further constrained by the limited availability of materials and experienced labor, driving uncertainty in the cost of services not only for this year, but also for 2023. these constraints are more concentrated in areas with the highest activities such as the permian basin. eog's multi-basin portfolio provides us the flexibility to manage these constraints by optimizing activity between our multiple plays to maximize our return on investment. just as in the past, eog will play to its strengths to mitigate where possible, the inflationary pressure and operational constraints facing us.
we are currently taking steps to secure services for next year and we'll know more about the 2023 outlook next quarter. regarding production growth, it's too early to discuss next year's plans with any degree of precision. however, it is important to recognize we will maintain our discipline. and as we see things today, would expect low single-digit oil growth similar to this year.
on the natural gas side, we're excited about the results of our south texas dorado play and its ability to play an increasing role in supplying the growing demand of petrochemical and lng markets along the gulf coast. as we allocate future capital based on returns, this play will command additional investment, not only to meet the growing demand, but also for infrastructure needed to capture the value chain from the well head to the market center. these investments not only generate healthy returns, but, ultimately, lead to lower well cost and lower long-term unit operating cost. we also expect to fund our emerging and promising exploration plays as we improve the company for the future.
now here's ken to give you an update on our emissions reductions effort.
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
thanks, billy. this quarter, we are providing details on our continuous methane monitoring project, which is an example of the progress we're making in our emission reduction efforts. over the last several years, our leak detection and repair program, or ldar, has advanced from sound site smell surveys to surveys using more accurate optical gas imaging, to today's deployment of scalable solutions of the latest technology, continuous methane monitoring. this technology detects potential leaks and provides real-time alerts to help accelerate repairs and will provide data and trend analysis to potentially prevent future methane releases.
we've been evaluating continuous methane monitoring technology for a few years. there are several third-party systems and technologies available to monitor and detect potential methane leaks, which use intermittent or continuous monitoring technology. about 18 months ago, we began a pilot project using a solution we built in-house named isense, which is a fence line monitoring solution that uses methane sensing technology to continuously monitor facilities and provide real-time alerts of potential leaks to a central control room. we tested isense against monitoring solutions in use and available in the market today and confirm that our sensor detected methane release events consistent with these third-party systems.
the results from these tests confirm that isense is the most effective solution for eog to use to detect and accelerate leak repairs while also being scalable and economic. like so many of our innovations, this technology is being spearheaded by our employees across the company. since the pilot, our employees are rapidly deploying isense in the field, prioritizing areas of highest potential impact. the initial installations are focused in the delaware basin and currently cover about 60% of our production.
we expect that most of the remaining delaware basin production will be monitored by isense by year end. we'll continue to roll out isense in other operating areas next year. using our proprietary system allows us to own the data creation, flow and storage, which is a priority with all our information systems. owning the isense data and retaining direct control of its collection provides invaluable flexibility to improve both data quality as well as the tools to analyze and integrate isense data with existing operational data from our production facilities.
this data, along with our ability to monitor our operations for many of our four control rooms, will enhance the 24/7 capability to continuously identify, prioritize and repair leaks. in the future, when data from isense is paired with other real-time production data, we expect to be able to make improvements in the design of facilities to minimize releases. we're also optimistic that we will be able to more readily predict the likely size and source of a methane release. leveraging technology to enhance our methane leak detection and repair program is another great example of eog's culture of continuous improvement throughout all our operations.
our employees have embraced the company's emission reduction efforts, and i'm excited to see how eog's culture of innovation and technology will continue to drive creative solutions. now here's jeff to discuss the progress we've made in our premium combo play in the southern powder river basin.
jeff leitzell -- executive vice president, exploration and production
thanks, ken. our emerging mowry and niobrara plays in the southern powder river basin have made significant progress recently. the powder returned to steady development last year after a pullback in 2020 driven by the pandemic. results in 2021 were stellar with respect to both well performance and well cost reduction.
strong results to date, combined with the benefit of infrastructure investments have positioned the mowry and niobrara plays to command more capital in 2023 and beyond. the powder river basin is an established operating area for both eog and the industry, that has experienced several chapters of development over its history. the latest chapter for eog kicked off in 2018 when we moved the mowry and niobrara plays into commercial development. we identified nearly 1,500 net premium locations between both targets over our 130,000 net acre position in the southern part of the basin.
since 2018, we have made great strides in fine-tuning our technical model to improve the predictability and performance of the wells. we've delineated the different parts of the basin, high-grading the specific landing zones. the basin has stacked potential similar to the permian, with two widespread, well-known, very robust source rocks in the mowry and niobrara. amongst those two source rocks are hybrid opportunities, such as silt zones and sand zones, a whole section of reservoir that really lends itself to horizontal drilling and completions.
we have also made targeted infrastructure investments in recent years, which have helped lower the cost structure in each play. we have added nearly 40 miles of water pipeline and 2.5 million barrels of water storage capacity. our water infrastructure investment in the prb has allowed us to source about 90% of our water used in our operations from reuse, reducing costs for both water sourcing and disposal. we have also invested in infrastructure to enable local sand sourcing.
the installation of a high-pressure gas gathering system has been instrumental in achieving a 99.8% gas capture rate. the infrastructure is also benefiting our operating costs. per unit lease operating expense in the powder is among the lowest in the company. the prb is farther from market than some of our other premium plays.
however, the mowry and niobrara have several advantages that more than make up for it. first and foremost, the wells have some of the largest per well reserves in the company on a barrel of oil equivalent basis. in the southern prb, the niobrara and mowry formations are more combo that is they produce a mix of oil and natural gas. while the laterals are also longer at 9,500 feet, which contributes to the higher recoveries, well performance is mostly due to the quality of the reservoir and composition of the products with a large component of natural gas that supports higher recoveries.
to date, eog has completed about 40 net mowry niobrara wells in the southern prb. this year, we anticipate completing 15 net mowry and niobrara wells and expect to significantly increase that activity next year. as a result of our exploration work on the entire powder river basin hydrocarbon system over the last few years, we have also built an additional 110 net acre block in the north, extending our acreage in the productive fairway to 90 miles. the northern area is a historically underexplored part of the basin.
and after recognizing the potential in the area, we cored up acreage adjacent to our legacy acreage through a series of trades and small bolt-on transactions. utilizing reservoir data from multiple plays, we identified landing zones in the mowry and niobrara formation with favorable petrophysical and geomechanical properties and began testing. we drilled four successful delineation wells, which we believe are industry first in the area. while it is still early in the delineation, we've confirmed the development potential of our northern powder river basin acreage to add to our future premium inventory.
the mowry and the niobrara combo plays in the southern powder river basin stand today well positioned to compete for capital within the portfolio and combined with our position to the north, the basin has significant investment potential for years to come. next up is lance to provide some color on our marketing position in the powder.
lance terveen -- senior vice president, marketing
thanks, jeff. as we look further downstream, the investment in infrastructure that has lowered the cost structure in the southern powder river basin also allows us to apply our time-tested marketing strategy of establishing multiple connections to provide market pricing diversification. today, we hold sufficient processing, transportation and fractionation capacity for natural gas liquids out of the prb. we have access to both the mid-continent at conway, kansas and the gulf coast at mont belvieu, texas, an underappreciated aspect of the mowry and niobrara wells is their prolific ngl production and the heavier post-processing mix of ngls they produce.
after processing to minimize ethane extraction, our powder river basin ngl barrel contains approximately 10% ethane, 45% propane and the remainder being butanes and more of a heavier ngls, resulting in an ngl to wti price ratio of over 50%. in the first half of this year, our ngl price realization was 53.01 which is a $7.17 premium to the mont belvieu typical barrel. in addition, the quality of the power river basin oil has an average api gravity of 44 to 47 and remains in high demand. during the first half of this year, realized prices for oil production out of the prb or wti plus $1.63 with access to both guernsey, wyoming and cushing, oklahoma markets.
stepping back, i'd like to review our marketing strategy for the company as a whole. on all our active development areas, we want to retain control of our products and establish multiple sales points, which adds significant value. for example, in the first half of this year, we transported an average of 188,000 barrels of oil per day for export, which represents about 30% of gross production with optionality to sell based on a wti or a brand index. with the widening of the brent-wti spread, we have the opportunity to take advantage of our capacity to deliver up to 250,000 barrels of oil per day for export.
for propane, we have delivered 19,000 barrels per day for export at premium prices to mont belvieu. we also continue to see strong uplift in our natural gas price realizations due to our early mover advantage of securing 140,000 mmbtus per day linked to jkm through cheniere's lng facility in corpus christi. cheniere recently announced fid or final investment decision on stage 3 in corpus christi. once stage 3 goes in service, eog will triple its exposure to jkm to 420,000 mmbtus per day.
we continue to see constructive long-term demand for all our products, both domestically, along the gulf coast and internationally. to unlock that value, you need control of your products, transportation capacity and an early mover advantage to capture spreads quickly. as we look down the road, eog is well positioned to capture the strength of prices in these export markets to generate additional cash flow and value to shareholders. next up is ezra for concluding remarks.
ezra yacob -- president
thanks, lance. we believe eog is differentiated for the following reasons. we have a diverse portfolio of assets across multiple basins, providing geographic and product diversity. we are a reliable and consistent, high-performing operator.
we have among the lowest cost structures. we are committed to sustainability. we maintain an exceptional balance sheet. our cash return strategy is transparent.
our regular dividend is competitive with the broader market. and finally, the eog culture is one of a kind, and it's at the core of our differentiated performance. we believe there are only a handful of north american e&p companies that have the asset quality, the size, the scale to compete globally on oil and gas cost of supply. and on top of that, produce the barrels with a lower environmental footprint.
in the future, those are the companies that the world is going to want to deliver additional barrels. and we firmly believe that eog is a leader in that group of north american e&ps. thanks for listening. we'll now go to q&a.

thank you. [operator instructions] the first question comes from the line of neal dingmann. you may proceed.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
good morning, ezra and team. and congratulations on a nice result. as my first question is on jump right to it the utica combo play specifically looking at that slide 10 of yours, it appears and you've talked about this, some of you guys talked about this already that the primary focus looks like it's on that about oil section or window. i'm just wondering if you all identified this is how the economics look at this window and sort of why focus here? secondly, maybe just talk about the takeaway situation for you all there.
ezra yacob -- president
yeah. neal, this is ezra. thanks for the question. i'll maybe make a couple of comments and then hand it to ken to shed a little more light on the economics.
and then, lance will provide a little more commentary on it on the takeaway. when you think about this basin, it's been a bit of a sleepy basin. everyone knew that there is a liquids window there, obviously, and it hasn't really been revisited in a number of years as part of our recent exploration efforts, we went back in and really applied as ken said some of our data from outside from other basin and some of the things that we've learned in the past few years. we really evaluated it from a geologic level, looking at the way that the process manifests itself between the north and the south, the mechanical stratigraphy that we've talked about before how our completions interact with the rock.
we had better data to better define the gor and the phase across this area. and then, really we made a lot of progress modeling the overpressure across the play. and when you combine that obviously with technology on the operational side, that's what gets us so excited about the opportunity here. and it's really almost reminiscent of what we saw nearly a decade ago happening in the delaware basin, where it's a bit of a sleepy basin with a lot of shale wells.
it really required some industry and eog technology and knowledge kind of brought in from the outside to really make things work. ken do you want to, you want to talk a little more about the wells?
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
sure. as ezra mentioned where we are in the vault oil window and we do expect, oil, gas, and ngl production will vary some across that window. both from north to south, but more so from the east, which will have a higher gas cut to the west, which is oilier. on an ultimate recovery basis, we expect that there will be 25% to 35% oil and similar percentages for natural gas, liquids, and residue gas.
so, when you think about that this play is really focused on 60% to 70% liquid development. and from that, as far as the economics go, it gives us premium and double premium numbers. that's $40 oil, $16 ngl, and $2.50 gas. the other thing to note on these wells is it's early, but we are expecting depending on where we're at in the play, 2 to 3 million barrels of oil equivalent for a eur with a 3-mile lateral.
so that type of performance really leads us to a low finding cost and it'll definitely be additive to our cost basis.
lance terveen -- senior vice president, marketing
and -- hey, neal, good morning. this is lance. so i'll comment a little bit for you. i'll start at a high level, too, and maybe kind of drill down for you just as you think about kind of infrastructure and also takeaway.
but really, when we think about our plan, it's going to follow the same strategy that we've done in all of our plays. and i mean, one marketing is always aligned and integrated upfront and all of our exploration efforts. you've heard us many times talk about just multiple connections as critical. we want to have controlled the market and then firm offtake.
we're always disciplined in that matter that is going to be very commensurate with our plans. but when you think about the nat gas and especially like evacuating the nat gas, you got to remember like ken just highlighted, the utica wells will have less gas volumes in the oil window. as the liquids-rich play like ken highlighted, 60% to 70% liquids. so when we look out here, we looked up front there is a significant available capacity that's just adjacent to our play.
and also, if you remember, it's been built out for a long time. much of it has been overbuilt, i would say, like in the last 10 years. so this also allows for opportunities. so we've really aligned ourselves with the current midstream operators that are in the area very strong.
we have great relationships with those. we've developed strategic relationships into the interstate pipelines to the plant tailgates. and i can tell you the liquidity is very strong in this area. it's much different and you can look into the marcellus, but when you get into this area, liquidity is very strong.
and so we don't see any issues at this time with sales on a go-forward basis.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
good. fantastic details, guys, and great people. see you coming back there. my second question.
maybe just a bit on capital allocation specifically, i realize you won't have detailed '23 guides for three more months. i'm just wondering if you all have talked a bit -- i think on the plan talk today about maybe a bit more activity next year. i'm just wondering, is that just to keep production stable? or are you still kind of considering a maintenance plan next year? and i'm wondering if you would consider a bit more growth if prices continue to be as strong and maybe cost would back off a little bit? thank you.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yeah. neal, this is billy helms. like we had said in the prepared remarks there, it's still early to talk about what we think 2023 actual specifics will be. but the prepared comments also mention the fact that we will have more activity.
we do anticipate growing our oil production somewhere in the similar this year, somewhere in the low single digits. and on the equivalent growth, it'll be probably in the low double digits. so that's kind of how we see the plan shaping up as we as today with the macro environment, we see today that one company, that would entail probably adding two or three rigs over and above this year's activity level, in general, would probably another 1 to 2 frac fleets. so it kind of gives you an outlook of what that might look like.
so i guess, maybe just to scale it up on the capex side, where we kind of gave you some guidance this quarter for what we think our capex burn rate will be. and if you, kind of normalize that through next year and then add the cost of a little bit more activity and some infrastructure costs to kind of get you directionally where we're thinking.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks, billy. thanks, team.
operator
thank you, mr. dingmann. the next question comes from leo mariani. you may proceed.
leo mariani -- mkm partners -- analyst
all right. why don't you dig a little bit more into utica? y'all talked about a well that had a 2,500 barrel-a-day rate. i guess it was 3,500 on an equivalent basis to the south. i just wanted to clarify, is that like a 24-hour rate? is that more of a 30-day rate? and then also, i guess that's one of the four wells, can you perhaps provide a little bit of color around the other three, in the basin there as well? and, you talked about kind of 2 to 3 million boes recoverable on a 3-mile lateral.
can you also help us out with maybe what you think the eventual targeted well cost would be there, the 3-mile lateral?
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
yeah. leo, this is ken. as far as that 2,500 barrel-a-day rate that we highlighted there. we produced that for a couple of weeks.
so we're very comfortable with that rate. as far as the other four wells go, they had varying lateral lengths. we can move those to a 3-mile -- when we move those to a 3-mile development plan, they're definitely double premium type economics. that 2,500 barrels a day well that's got the 12,000-foot lateral is the longest lateral we've drilled to date.
the others do have a shorter lateral as we drilled them. one thing i really wanted to highlight on the 12,000-foot lateral well is the operations team that we have in oklahoma city. it was the longest well that we've drilled. and once they got into the lateral, they drilled that 12,000 feet in a little over 6 days and stayed 99% in an 8-foot target.
so just outstanding operational performance there. as far as well costs go, we've really just highlighted that we anticipate being less than $5 a barrel on the f&d cost.
leo mariani -- mkm partners -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. i wanted to follow up a little bit on dorado. so you all mentioned that you're constructing a 36-inch pipe.
that's obviously a pretty good-sized pipe. so it sounds like you've got some pretty grand plans for that play. and it sounds like it's driving a lot of growth in 2023. i'm just curious as to when you think that pipe is going to be ready and imagine could take a little while to get constructed.
and perhaps there is an even kind of larger wave of growth out of dorado as we get toward mid-decade. and i'm assuming that maybe there are some lng-type ambitions associated with that. so any color would be great.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yeah. leo, this is billy helms. let me maybe start with an answer, and then maybe lance can give some more color to it. so the 36-inch pipeline, yes it's an effort to try to not only get that gas to market but also make sure we continued our focus on keeping our cost as an operator low.
so that's part of our longer-term plan. we've recognized that the value of installing infrastructure is really helping lower the long-term cost basis of the company. and so this is just another step in that vein. the 36-inch pipe will be constructed over a couple of years.
so it's not all being done in one single year. it's important to be taking it to the market center where we are. and then, the lng, we're starting to recognize the value of having the gas in these areas. since south texas is where all the lng demand is.
so it's advantageous from that standpoint. so that's kind of how this kind of works into the overall market dynamics with this play. so i'll let lance maybe add a little bit more color to the pipeline itself in the market.
lance terveen -- senior vice president, marketing
yeah, sure. hey, leo, good morning. it's lance. i think rides out onto what billy talked about as well.
it's just it is very complementary and it's an integration of our operations. but again, like you heard in one of my answers earlier, controlling the market is very important. and so as we build out this infrastructure into the agua dulce market, we will have we're anticipating four downstream market connections. and i know you kind of asked a little bit about lng, but i think the bigger point is just the demand pool that's anticipated out of south texas.
there could be up to 5 bcf a day just from kind of the south texas region. when you think about the power gen industrial load and also mexico and the demand pool is really real, right? you've heard us talk about corpus christi stage 3, we're going to have a 720,000 mmbtu per day sale. once that's kind of in service. we've got 140,000 that's today.
but you also have golden pass that's under construction and several other facilities that are getting very, very close to [inaudible], which is excellent. and so maybe one other thing to add is that we've also contracted for a large transport position on an interstate pipeline expansion. allowing us to reach essentially all the lng demand pool along the gulf coast from south texas to louisiana. and that will have a direct connection off of our 36-inch.
so we're thinking very tactically, and strategically and setting up dorado for the long term.
leo mariani -- mkm partners -- analyst
that sounds great. thank you.
operator
thank you, mr. mariani. the next question comes from the line of doug leggate. you may proceed.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everybody. guys, i wonder if i could jump on the utica as well. i'm just curious about -- i guess the back story as to how you accumulated this position because there are clearly a lot of players, i guess a little east of you guys, some of which might characterize their acreage as non-core.
i know m&a is not your bailiwick typically, but a little background as to how you established this position and whether you'd be looking to continue to expand it. and i've got a follow-up on that, please.
ezra yacob -- president
yeah. doug, this is ezra. thanks for the question. like anything, we allowed our geologic model to kind of drive where we're interested in acquiring acreage.
we were able to get in there and put it together in a variety of different ways. probably the most noticeable one is that we were able to purchase the minerals down to the south that kind of highlighted earlier. it's about 135,000 acres of minerals that we purchased as part of a transaction. but in general, i'd say it fell right in line with our strategy of identifying where we want to be in the basin, trying to capture tier 1 and tier 2 acreage countercyclical, if you will, so we can continue to have a low cost of entry, which of course is critical is not only as you get out and delineate the place.
but also obviously as you really think about full cycle economics and in these resource plays.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks, ezra. i know -- you guys have typically been organic in the way, of course, these things. but my follow-up is really about capital allocation and i guess to follow up to leo's question about the dorado, or the pipeline you're building, now you've obviously taken out -- i guess you could say, another step back to gas with utica. what is your thinking in terms of -- is this pivot back to gas in terms of how we should think of capital allocation? i know you're typically agnostic on that.
i'm just curious if we're seeing a bit of a pivot back here.
ezra yacob -- president
yeah. doug. the short answer is that we're agnostic based on our premium prices at the $40 and $2.50 natural gas pricing that we use to measure our investments. but in general, i'd say we do have a bullish view, long term on natural gas and ngl.
obviously, on oil as well, but specific to dorado, and some of these combo plays we're seeing natural gas, we think will continue to see increased demand from power gen, some of the coal switching that we've seen this year. and also it's going to have, in the upcoming years continued exposure to the international markets with lng development there along the gulf coast. ngl obviously, span the entire broad spectrum of the economy from plastics and rubber to heating to fuel blending and so on. and that's not to say those two won't experience volatility at times when supply is potentially outpacing demand.
and, likewise, demand has to be outpacing supply. but that comes back to our approach as a disciplined operator. first, we evaluate like we just talked about based on the premium price deck that we use internally, and that means that we're investing based on returns first and foremost. second, we evaluate the macro supply and demand fundamentals for short, medium, and long-term signals.
and, i'd say it's one reason we are excited about the way we enter some of these positions, especially the utica by owning the 135,000 acres with the minerals, we can control the pace of development and the remaining leasehold, and that play is dominantly held by production. and so that again is another lever that allows us to really optimize our pace of development and investment.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
we'll look for news at the end of the month. thanks. thanks, ezra. appreciate it.
operator
thank you, mr. leggate. the next question comes from the line of scott gruber. you may proceed.
scott gruber -- citi -- analyst
yeah, it's a good morning, and congrats on the organic resource play addition. generally, what's the rough split of the utica acreage that's perspective for a double premium versus a single premium? and generally what spacing assumption are you guys using across the acreage?
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
yeah. scott, this is ken. as far as the split, it's really early in the development of utica. we have four wells in it.
we want to do some additional drilling and testing across the acreage before we really come up with some kind of a resource, a well count, or a wells spacing estimate. as far as premium versus double premium, we actually think that we have double premium potential across the entire acreage position. so we're really just excited about the play and look forward to developing it next year.
scott gruber -- citi -- analyst
got it. just back on the capital allocation question, just, over the medium to longer term, how are you thinking about, ramping the utica? it's a little bit further down on your kind of development curve and obviously of optionality in dorado and prb. but it is just relative to the younger players, you'll be ramping up. how do you think utica fits in?
billy helms -- chief operating officer
well, as ken -- this is billy. as ken just mentioned, the utica, we're very excited about the potential of the play to be double premium. and so it definitely competes from a capital allocation standpoint, but we are early in the play. so as we see things today, we'll plan on drilling some more in the order of 20 wells next year.
and then from that, determine how what the go-forward plan looks like. as far as capital allocation for next year we're still early and still developing our plans, but as we see things today, the benefit of having these multiple basins is it gives us a lot of flexibility to move capital between the different basins. we don't have to leverage all of our activity in one basin. in particular, we're going to try to keep from seeing a lot of activity increases in areas where we're seeing the most inflation and supply chain constraints that exist mostly in the permian basin today.
so i would expect our activity levels there to remain pretty consistent with what we're seeing -- what we're doing today. we can pull levers in the other plays to meet whatever objectives we set forth as we move toward the end of the year.
scott gruber -- citi -- analyst
got it. appreciate the color. thank you.
operator
thank you, mr. gruber. the next question comes from the line of charles meade. you may proceed.
charles meade -- johnson rice and company -- analyst
good morning, ezra, to you, and the whole team there. i'd like to ask about these four wells that you drilled in utica. can you talk about what you did differently, perhaps from previous operators, whether it's up you're targeting a zone or your completion designing? and also perhaps, did you test different concepts across those four wells?
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
yeah. charles, this is ken. as far as what we've done differently in this area really has to do with having, a number of years of experience in all of the other basins that we can bring to bear here in utica. if you think about it, it boils down to four main things.
one of them is targeting being able to identify the target across the acreage position. the other one is understanding the phase, looking at that phase, not getting into the gas window, and not getting too far into the black oil window. the third one is pressure and how that pressure varies across our acreage position. and then the other is the operational execution that we can bring.
that's both the drilling and the completions design that we see. that all roll into what i would call the geo mechanics. and when you're all that together, it really gives us confidence in that in that area that we'll be able to develop that, with that low finding cost and double premium returns basis.
charles meade -- johnson rice and company -- analyst
got it. got it. that's helpful detail. and 20 wells next year.
that looks like it's -- maybe, should we be thinking about two rigs with the -- since it might take a while to drill these 3-mile laterals in an overpressure setting?
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
yeah, charles. really? right now, these wells aren't taking that long, the 20-well program would really be done with one rig at this point in time. we may end up having two rigs if they're available at some point and then not at another time. but the average would be one rig for next year.
charles meade -- johnson rice and company -- analyst
got it. thanks for the added detail.
operator
thank you, mr. meade. the next question comes from the line of bob brackett. you may proceed.
bob brackett -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
good morning. i had a higher-level question, and then, i'll get some nitty gritty on the utica. the higher-level question is you all, versus your peers, have run a fairly aggressive exploration budget this year, call it $450 million or so. what are your thoughts for 2023 and beyond and keeping the scale of that exploration budget, given that it's yielding results?
ezra yacob -- president
good morning, bob. this is ezra. yeah, this year -- you're right. we've -- as we talked at the beginning of this year, we had a number of different exploration plays that a number of different places and evaluations.
this year we're drilling some initial wells, kind of wild cats in the play. some of the plays are a bit further along and we're trying to delineate because remember our exploration program, it's not really about producers and dry holes. it's really about how or if these prospects are going to be additive to the quality of our existing inventory. that's what we're really looking for here.
depending on how you bucket size, the 20 wells we're talking about here in point pleasant are probably the most important thing. it'll basically be another delineation type of year for us across the 400,000-acre position that we've put together. outside of those 20 wells that'll be the biggest part of next year's kind of exploration delineation type program if i put it there. we have some ongoing prospects in other areas we've talked about in the past some of those other ones, again, extents similar types of areas, places that have been sleeping in the past, places that are in known oil and natural gas producing areas, places where we're trying to bring modern technology.
our advancement of horizontal drilling and completions technologies and combining them with our rock, the understanding of the geologic environment, and seeing if we can turn those into premium and double premium types of plays that would be additive to us. and we'll just continue to evaluate as they go. to give you a hard number, right now though, it's just a little bit early, as billy said, but we'll break that out in february.
bob brackett -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
very clear. and then, kind of a bit nitty gritty. you mentioned the importance of targeting. you mentioned staying in an 8-foot zone.
is it a stretch to say the secret sauce here is staying in point pleasant?
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
no, i mean -- bob, this is, ken. we do stay in that point pleasant. i think the secret sauce here is really a combination of everything. it's a combination of what we've learned in our other plays and then being able to operationally perform on that.
so getting the right petrophysical model to understand that targeting and understand how that targeting varies across the area. and then looking at the 8-foot window that we've kept it in really speaks to being able to perform, where this really goes back to just our culture. it really is about the people. and it's about our ability to always, attempt to get better, to work on getting better, and try to make the next roll better than the last.
so you put all that together. and that really is the secret sauce for our entire company, let alone our exploration effort.
bob brackett -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
it's clear. and i'll just sneak in a third one and i apologize. you mentioned the importance of pressure. in the old days, reservoir energy in utica was always something that was a challenge.
how have you overcome that? and is there may be a different artificial lift strategy out there to keep that tail-producing?
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
yeah, bob, i think that's why we're in the volatile oil window. we have enough gas in the volatile oil window to help us lift our wells. at this point in time, we don't see that we'll need much artificial lift through the life of these wells. it's being right on that -- the right portion of that phase window.
bob brackett -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
perfect. very clear. thanks so much.
operator
thank you, mr. brackett. the next question comes from the line of jeanine wai. you may proceed.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone. excuse me. thank you for taking our questions.
our first question. maybe just following up on bob's question here. you've disclosed 7 premium operating basins, which is fantastic. the decentralized model has worked very well for eog, so far.
but from an organizational perspective, how many basins would be considered too many basins because you're clearly still evaluating other opportunities? thank you.
ezra yacob -- president
yeah, jeanine. this is ezra. that's a fantastic question. and here it really speaks to what we think is one of our core competitive advantages.
and that's the fact that we run a decentralized organization. that's what allows us to kind of cross-pollinate ideas between divisions. in any industry, the success of running a decentralized organization is being able to push decision-making and accountability down to the employees who are kind of touching the wells and closest to the value creation every single day. when you break it up that way and you think about it that way, we have eight operating teams, and each of those has operated as kind of a fully functioning oil company in a lot of ways if you will.
they have a full complement of geologists, engineers, accountants, land mines, marketing people, and so on, and so forth. each of these individuals and asset teams can really handle working across multiple basins and in fact, to a different type of scale, you see the same type of leverage and benefits that we see at the corporate level that exploring different basins really adds to kind of their understanding. i go back to how ken started this, the point pleasant or the utica play is actually being looked at currently by members of our oklahoma city team who are quite familiar with the woodford. the overpressure, the oil window, and the woodford play and that play really landed a lot of expertise to our understanding of mechanical stratigraphy.
again, to reference what ken was talking about and how the rocks actually break and interact with our completion strategy. and that's -- some of the key characteristics that have helped unlock a number of our unconventional plays.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you. and then for our second question, in terms of operational momentum, are you able to provide any color on what activity looks like heading into year-end and early '23? we noticed that for q oil guidance is flat at the midpoint quarter over quarter, capex is up, but that sounds like it could be timing related.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
yeah. janine, this is billy helms. you're exactly right. it's just the timing factor.
we're currently running all the rigs that we plan to carry into next year. we'll start looking at adding rigs in different places to go into next year. based on our outlook for the '23 budget, which will firm up as we get closer to that time. the quarter-over-quarter volume growth is pretty flat, and that's just a function of completing wells late in the quarter that will really roll into next year and that's going to happen in several different plays.
the permian probably, the dorado play, and a little bit in the eagle ford as well. so that's just a function of the timing of those completions.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
thank you, ms. wai. the next question comes from the line of kevin maccurdy. you may proceed.
kevin maccurdy -- pickering energy partners -- analyst
good morning. and just getting back to utica, trying to do some back-of-the-envelope math on spending there next year. would a 3-mile lateral cost in the ballpark of around $15 million? and i guess if you did 20 wells, that would kind of put you at around a $300 million spend rate in utica next year. is that kind of the right assumption for a rig next year?
ken boedeker -- executive vice president, exploration and production
yeah. kevin, this is, ken. what we're talking about now? those are two 2 to 3-million-barrel wells that we've talked about and less than a $5 f&d cost. we really haven't given out a number as far as what our development costs will be because we have some additional testing and we really do want to drill some of our wells on pads and drill them in packages to see what that ultimate development cost will be.
so, you can use the $5 f&d and the 2 to 3 million barrels to get a reasonable estimate for well cost.
kevin maccurdy -- pickering energy partners -- analyst
great. and digging into the marketing strategy a little bit in utica. i mean, you mentioned that you had plenty of gas takeaway locally, but do you guys have a plan to get that gas out of the basin? and just kind of thinking about the knock-on effect of if the utica grows, that might have an impact on southwest pa basis. and is that a concern for your returns?
lance terveen -- senior vice president, marketing
yeah. kevin. this is lance, too. good morning and thanks for your question.
i'd say, even -- like i talked about earlier, like the marketing component of it is integrated very early on. so i mean, we recognize then that gas-like realizations are weaker. but still, when we look at our overall portfolio and then how the utica combo competes, it's very competitive. and so your earlier question was just as it relates, when you think about just kind of downstream takeaway in that, again, it comes to just the liquids focus that we have anticipation, i think there's some misconception on kind of the gas race that things are going to look very similar to like the dry gas wells to the east and other competitors that are in the region.
when we're going to see lower gas rates that are going to come out of our development. and so when we look at that on a go forward and with the relationships that we have, with the capacity that we see on the processing side, the gas sales, and the takeaway, we're not foreseeing an issue right now.
kevin maccurdy -- pickering energy partners -- analyst
great. thank you for taking my question.
operator
thank you, mr. maccurdy. the next question comes from the line of anon narayanan. you may proceed.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. this is neil mehta. can you hear me ok?
ezra yacob -- president
yeah. neil, we've got you.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. i'm sorry about that. yeah, it's neil mehta here from goldman sachs. so, ezra, i had more of a macro question here, which is we haven't seen us oil production, at least in the weekly move since april of 2022.
they've been kind of hanging around this plus or minus 12 million barrels a day range. and are you surprised that we haven't seen the pickup in us production that a lot of people are anticipating? and i want to tie that into slide 9 of your deck, which is showing relative maturity of some of the oil plays like the bakken, increasingly the eagle ford, and even the delaware. are we getting to the point where shale is going to have a tougher time growing and we should be thinking about peak shale production in the united states in the foreseeable future?
ezra yacob -- president
yeah, neil, it's a good question. let me take it one piece at a time here. since early in the year, we've been talking about how we were anticipating a little bit less us growth this year than what many people were forecasting. the reason for that, is clearly there's a little bit of inventory exhaustion going on.
these basins have been drilled for a number of years. but the biggest thing we based our models on this year was really what we're seeing with, again, what's turned into, inflationary pressures throughout the year. it's the rig counts, the frac spreads, and really the people side of it. there's definitely north american discipline in the e&p sector out here.
but there are also supply chain constraints that have continued to kind of be felt throughout the entire year this year. i do think coming out of the pandemic, we've had a consolidation across the industry. what we've been left and this is something we've talked about quite a bit too, are you've been left with less companies, and those companies that have the size, the scale, balance sheets, things of that nature to be able to continue to drill and operate. and the majority of those companies are drilling and investing in a way that's more disciplined than what was in favor prior to the pandemic.
so i think it's really three or four different things that are that have kind of come together to limit us growth. and quite frankly, a lot of those things that i've talked about are not necessarily transitory in nature. some of these things will really continue into 2023 as well. and so that's why i'd say, entering 2023 again, i suspect our forecast on the oil side will probably be a little bit to the low end of many of the numbers that you're seeing out there.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah, that's helpful. and it helps if it's on the balance sheet. you guys clearly have a fortress balance sheet position in a net cash position now, let's talk remind us again how you're thinking about minimum cash balances and what is the parade optimal capital structure. if you think about your leverage profile.
ezra yacob -- president
yes. neil, thank you for bringing that up. it's something that we're we're exceptionally proud of. and we've always said that in a cyclical industry such as ours, the best thing you can have is not just a strong but a real pristine balance sheet.
there's never really been a cash target for us and there's not one now. we're thrilled to be, as you, kind of said, in a unique position where we're able to strengthen the balance sheet this year, but at the same time return just over $5 billion, $5.1 billion to our shareholders. we've -- as far as the ultimate balance sheet, we have a couple of strategic things. we do have a $5 billion buyback authorization.
we've talked about using that opportunistically. that's a compelling strategy to go ahead and carry a little more cash on the balance sheet than what we've done historically. but really the strategy, overall for the company is aimed at creating value in the long run, and managing the balance sheet to make the countercyclical investment is a big piece of that. we've talked about having operational in reserve cash just to stay out of commercial paper, but at the end of the day, when we think about a cyclical industry like i said, the balance sheet provides a lot of optionalities to create value.
we're committed to delivering on our free cash flow priorities and that's -- it's founded and growing and it is a sustainable regular dividend. but it also contemplates the minimum commitment of 60% of free cash flow. and both of those are supported by having a very strong balance sheet and, just in general, being focused on doing the right thing at the right time to maximize long-term shareholder returns.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
makes sense. thank you, ezra.
operator
thank you for your question. that concludes the question-and-answer session. i will now pass the call back over to mr. yacob for final remarks.
ezra yacob -- president
thank you. we want to thank everyone for participating in the call this morning. and we especially want to thank our employees. they've delivered another outstanding quarter for all of eog's shareholders.

operator
good day, everyone, and welcome to eog resources' third quarter 2022 earnings results conference call. as a reminder, this call is being recorded. at this time for opening remarks and introductions, i would like to turn the call over to the chief financial officer of eog resources, mr. tim driggers.
please, go ahead, sir.
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
good morning and thanks for joining us. this conference call includes forward-looking statements. factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release in eog's sec filings. this conference call also contains certain non-gaap financial measures.
definitions and reconciliation schedules for these non-gaap measures can be found on eog's website. this conference call also may include estimated resource potential, not necessarily calculated in accordance with the sec reserve reporting guidelines. participating on the call this morning are ezra yacob, chairman, and chief executive officer; billy helms, president, and chief operating officer; ken boedeker, evp exploration, and production; jeff leitzell, evp exploration, and production; lance terveen, senior vp marketing; and david streit vp investor relations. here's ezra.
ezra yacob -- president
thanks, tim. good morning, everyone. the quality of eog's diverse, multi-basin, and portfolio high-return assets continue to grow and improve. yesterday's announcement of the large position we captured in the utica combo play demonstrates yet again that eog's robust exploration pipeline delivers results.
over the last two years, our organic exploration efforts have brought forth dorado, our premium dry natural gas plant in south texas, the emerging northern powder river basin oil player in wyoming, and now the emerging utica combo play in ohio. the value of our multi-basin portfolio can't be overstated. with the addition of the utica combo, we are now positioned to operate seven premium resource basins, which reinforces several of eog's competitive advantages. first, our decentralized cross-functional operating teams innovate independently but collaborate to compound the impact of learnings and efficiencies across the company.
second, our flexibility to allocate capital optimizes reinvestment across our portfolio, enabling us to develop each asset at the right pace to maximize returns. and third, our geographic and product diversity gives us the ability to plan around base and level market dynamics. our goal is to expand and improve the overall quality of our portfolio by identifying higher-return inventory. our approach is to build a diverse portfolio of premium assets predominantly through low-cost organic exploration, which adds reserves at lower finding and development costs and lowers the overall cost basis of the company.
the end result is continuous improvement to eog's companywide capital efficiency. our track record of successful exploration, coupled with strong operational execution, is how eog has continued to improve over time and position the company to create shareholder value through industry cycles. we demonstrated our confidence in eog's improving cost structure yesterday by increasing the regular dividend by 10%. our peer-leading annualized dividend is now $3.30 per share competitive with the broad market.
we also delivered on our commitment to return at least 60% of annual free cash flow to shareholders with our fourth special dividend of the year. by year-end, we will have returned $5.80 per share special dividends. combined with the regular dividend, we will return 8.80 cents per share or $5.1 billion in cash to shareholders, which exceeds our 60% cash return commitment using current forecasts. looking forward, we expect 2023 will remain dynamic with respect to the supply chain, oil and gas prices, and other global macro drivers.
our diverse low-cost asset base puts us in an excellent position to capitalize on opportunities no matter the environment. eog continues to consistently execute, lower our cost structures through innovation and efficiencies, and grow the quality of our portfolio to improve capital efficiency and free cash flow potential. our transparent cash return strategy is anchored to a sustainable, growing regular dividend and backstopped by an impeccable balance sheet. eog is in a better position than ever to deliver value for our shareholders through industry cycles and play a leading role in the long-term future of energy.
next up is billy with an early look at our 2023 plan, followed by tim, who will review our financial performance. ken will then provide background and details on the utica combo play. here's billy.
billy helms -- chief operating officer
thanks, ezra. once again, eog delivered outstanding results in the third quarter. we exceeded midpoints of production guidance while capital expenditures beat forecasted targets. i'd like to thank our employees for their perseverance and execution to beat expectations, realized oil and natural gas prices also beat their target benchmarks in the third quarter.
our marketing teams are doing an excellent job executing our long-term strategy of diversifying across multiple transportation outlets and sales points. this strategy is also enabling the company to navigate the recent bottlenecks in transporting natural gas out of the permian. we all have significant transport positions with the ability to move up to a bcf a day out of the basin. in total, less than 5% of our domestic gas production is exposed to waha pricing in the permian.
in fact, we anticipate fourth quarter realized prices to remain strong for both natural gas and crude oil sales overall. our crude oil and natural gas export capacity is serving us well in this regard. in the fourth quarter, we expect to sell over 250,000 barrels of crude oil per day at brent-linked prices and 140,000 mmbtu per day of natural gas at jkm-linked prices both on a gross basis. year-to-date through september, export-based pricing of crude oil and natural gas has added nearly $700 million of revenue uplift compared to the alternative domestic sales.
one of the major topics of the year continues to be the inflation story. the price pressure we are seeing on steel, fuel, and labor continues to be persistent. our employees are maintaining their focus on finding ways to mitigate inflation through innovation and efficiencies in our operations. through their efforts, we now expect our average will cost to increase by a modest 7% as compared to last year.
as a result, we have narrowed our full year capital guidance from $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion. given the elevated and persistent inflation pressures, we have experienced this year, i am proud of our employees' efforts to mitigate a majority of this impact on our capital plan. we continue to evaluate and shape our plans for 2023. production growth and infrastructure investments will remain guided by capital discipline.
we expect low single-digit oil growth similar to this year. we currently forecast oil equivalent growth, including gas and liquids at a low double-digit rate, somewhat higher than this year, largely driven by increased activity in our highly productive dorado gas dry gas play. once again, we plan to leverage our activity across multiple basins to secure services and manage cost pressures. our initial plan includes a modest increase in activity utilizing the order of 28 to 30 drilling rigs, including one offshore rig in trinidad.
this would be accompanied by 8 to 10 frac fleets. this would represent a slight increase of 2 to 3 rigs and 1 to 2 frac fleets over 2022 activity levels. we are seeing opportunities in different basins to lock in services at favorable rates for next year and currently expect to secure 50% to 60% of our wealth cost by the start of the year. this is within our typical range and compares with 50% of the cost secured for the start of 2022.
all in all, we expect higher capex in 2023, driven by four key factors. first, we are assuming the persistent inflation pressure continues with the cost of materials and services increasing, our initial 2023 budget is likely to reflect another 10% well cost increase on top of the 7% increase we expect this year. we will continue to work to identify additional savings and efficiency improvements to offset the impact of inflation, just as we did this year. second, we see several opportunities to advance the development of particular assets in our portfolio in areas that are less exposed to the most severe inflation and supply chain pressures.
the increase in activity in emerging plays like dorado, the powder river basin, and the utica combo are examples. third, we expect to accelerate some infrastructure projects to take advantage of market opportunities. in dorado, we've begun construction of a new 36-inch gas pipeline from the field to the agua dulce sales point near corpus christi, texas. this will ensure long-term takeaway, fully captures the value chain from the wellhead to the market center, and aligns with our focus on being a low-cost operator.
fourth. we plan to continue to progress our investments in environmental projects, including the expansion of our carbon capture and storage or ccs projects. our first ccs project is progressing and we expect to begin injecting co2 early next year. this is yet another step toward our goal of being among the lowest cost, high return, and lowest emission producers of oil and natural gas.
we recently released our latest sustainability report for 2021, which highlights our progress. we achieved our near-term 2025 methane emissions percentage target of 0.06% last year, an 85% reduction from 2017 levels. we captured 99.8% of natural gas produced at the wellhead meeting our 2021 gas capture target. we discussed our latest initiative to further reduce methane emissions through our continuous leak detection system named isense.
we improved our safety performance with lower total recordable and lost time incident rates, and we reduced our freshwater intensity rate by 55% since 2020. we are proud of our employees, and progress on our sustainability goals, but we still see tremendous opportunities for continued improvements. altogether, infrastructure spending, including environmental projects, typically amounts to 15% to 20% of our capex budget. this year is running right about the midpoint of that range, whereas next year we expect it to be toward the higher end of that range.
we continue to develop our 2023 plans as we approach the new year and provide a more detailed, complete outlook in february. now here's tim to discuss our financials.
tim driggers -- chief financial officer
thanks, billy. we were very pleased to increase the regular dividend by 10% to $3.30 per share annual rate. this increase reflects two things. first, the improvements we've made to the cost structure, efficiencies, and technology continue to sustainably improve eog's capital efficiency.
furthermore, we expect the advantages of operating in multiple basins will drive additional improvements to eog's cost structure and returns in the year ahead, lower the cost of supply and lower the break-even oil price to fund the dividend. second, this dividend increase reflects our confidence in eog's expanding portfolio of premium plays to grow the company's future income and free cash flow potential. over the last several years, our success in organic exploration continues to add low-cost reserves and consistently drive down our dd&a rate, enabling eog to create value through industry cycles. we also remain committed to returning at least 60% of free cash flow to shareholders each year.
as a reminder, we look at this on an annual basis, not quarter to quarter. based on current commodity prices, we estimate the $1.50 special dividend declared yesterday, will bring free cash flow returned to shareholders to about 67% for 2022. we will start 2023 in an exceptionally strong financial position. we ended the third quarter with $5.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet against $5.1 billion of debt.
we generated $2.3 billion of free cash flow during the quarter. along with inflows of another $1.3 billion of cash from working capital, primarily from the drawdown of hedge collateral. now, here's ken.

thanks, tim. we're excited to announce our new oil and natural gas combo acreage position in ohio's utica shale. we've accumulated 395,000 acres in this play, predominantly in the volatile oil window across a 140-mile trend running north to south. our cost of entry was less than $600 per net acre for leasehold, demonstrating the benefit of organic exploration.
one of our most distinct competitive advantages. capturing highly productive rock through our organic exploration and leasing efforts is the primary way of improving the quality of our premium inventory at low cost, which leads to a lower companywide cost basis. the utica is a well-known and prolific gas resource to the east of our acreage. several years ago, our exploration team operating out of the oklahoma city office took a fresh look at the basin from a petroleum system perspective.
we knew there was an oil rim with varying gas-to-oil ratios present. using our experience in other basins and our technical workflows and proprietary reservoir engineering modeling tools, we anticipated that this could be an area that would be additive to our inventory when we considered our advancements in precision targeting and simulation technology, along with our low-cost drilling and completion operations. it became clear that this area had the potential to compete with our premium and double premium plays across the company. through leasing and acquisitions, we acquired 18 legacy wells with varying geologic and production data, which supported our assessment of the area.
over the last 12 months, we've confirmed our model and the economic viability of this prospect by drilling three delineation wells in the northern part of our acreage and one in the south. these first four wells already earn premium and double premium returns when normalized to our development plan, which assumes 3-mile laterals. as a reminder, our premium hurdle rate assumes $40 oil, $16 ngl, and $2.50 natural gas. these exceptional results are due primarily to the high productivity of the interval and a large amount of liquids in the product mix from the volatile oil window.
in addition to the well performance, we also want to highlight our embedded mineral interest in the southern portion of the acreage. we've acquired 100% of the mineral rights across 135,000 acres of our leasehold for about $1,800 per acre, which is in addition to the $600 per net acre for the leases. this mineral interest significantly enhances the value of this play by adding 25% to our production and reserves stream for no additional well costs or operating expenses. this area is also where we've drilled our most prolific well, which initially produced over 2,500 barrels of oil per day and 3,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a 12,000-foot lateral.
the total value of this mineral interest across our southern development area is significant, especially since eog will dictate the pace of development as an operator. next year, we plan to drill approximately 20 wells in the northern and southern areas and utilize our multi-basin experience to climb the learning curve faster by leaning on the best targeting, drilling, and completion techniques that apply to this area. we expect our 2023 utica combo plan will accomplish two goals. first, to deliver double premium returns, while second further delineating the play to help asses resources and inventory.
we will invest in incremental gathering infrastructure to be to prepare for a larger development program and anticipate being able to take advantage of existing processing infrastructure in the area for the foreseeable future. this is the advantage of the timing and economic efficiency of successfully unlocking potential in an existing basin. eog's entry into the utica combo play is a textbook example of why our decentralized organization that operates in multiple basins with wide-ranging geology lends itself to successful additions to the upper end of our premium and double premium inventory. we applied what we learned over the past decade in developing our portfolio to identify and unlock this overlooked resource.
now, here's ezra to wrap things up.

thanks, ken. the takeaway from today's call is centered on eog's fundamental value proposition. first, eog's multi-basin organic exploration focus continues to improve the quality of our inventory. capturing tier 1 acreage across multiple high-return opportunities provides geographic diversity, product diversity, and the flexibility to allocate capital across each asset at the correct pace to optimize returns.
second, eog is a low-cost operator. we use technology to increase operational efficiency and capture select pieces of the value chain to keep both capital and operating costs low, thereby helping to reduce our breakevens and increase our free cash flow and income-generating potential. third, tim highlighted our financial performance and commitment to financial discipline that results in a 10% increase to our peer-leading regular dividend, a commitment to additional cash return with our announced special dividends, and a best-in-class balance sheet. fourth, our recently published sustainability report illustrates our progress to reaching near-term greenhouse gas and methane emissions intensity goals and our commitment to developing new technologies and piloting new projects such as our ccs project to help reduce our environmental footprint.
and fifth, it is eog's employees and unique culture that continue to drive our success. thanks for listening. we'll now go to q&a.
