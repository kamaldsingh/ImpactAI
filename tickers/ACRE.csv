(operator instructions) the first question is from steven delaney of jmp securities. please go ahead.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
good morning. and thank you for taking my questions. i noted on page three of your deck that of the four loans closed in the first quarter that the funded amount only represented 52% of the total commitment. could you comment on the nature of those loans. because it would suggest to me that there may be a construction loan in there or may be a couple loans that are just heavy transitional or heavy rebuilds? thanks. okay.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. good morning, steve. and thanks for your question. so the one loan in particular and if you look at page nine of the same deck. and it's really loan number 25 under office loans. this is one of the loans that we closed and literally closed right at the end of the month, right at the end of the quarter. you can see that the commitment is $84 million and the outstanding principal is zero. it is a transitional asset, but it is not a construction loan. so we didn't fund anything at closing, but you know, we will rapidly do so. but at closing there was nothing funded day one. so that's the majority of the difference between a commitment amount and the funded amount.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
got it. i apologize for not checking out page nine in the deck, but that and that makes a lot of sense tae-sik . and i also notice on that same page that you did a student housing project and that you have-it's not a great percent, but 10% of the portfolio.
earlier today we heard another commercial real estate lender report that they had taken-had to take a loss provision on a student housing property that was on a loan service for fannie mae. just curious when you look at that sector are there specific parts of the country locations or types of schools that you prefer? i understand this particular property was located, the loan that went bad in a state that we would consider subpar from just an economic and demographic standard. just curious about the student housing focus?
jamie henderson -- director; chief executive officer of ares commercial real estate; partner of ares real estate group
hey, steve. it's jamie henderson. good morning.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
hi, jamie.
jamie henderson -- director; chief executive officer of ares commercial real estate; partner of ares real estate group
so we're really picky. it is less then 10% of our portfolio and the attributes that we look for in student housing obviously proximity of the campus, growing enrollment you need to be alert to whether or not the university is adding inventory that can compete against you, new supply. these are high-quality properties in really good locations at name-brand universities. and the students really seek a level of amenities that was inconceivable when we were in college. so we're...
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
got you. i understand.
jamie henderson -- director; chief executive officer of ares commercial real estate; partner of ares real estate group
...with our portfolio and also with our ability to underwrite this type asset.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
got it. thank you, jamie and tae-sik the last thing for me. thank you for the explanation on the low prepays and sort of the reason to step down to $0.32 from an average of $0.37 in the prior two quarters makes me feel a little bit better about my $0.35 that was up on the board.
having said that, in the light repays in the first quarter, can give us some idea of what you would expect over the balance of 2019 to repay as a percentage of the $1.6 billion portfolio with march 31?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. great question, steve. so, you know, i think in the past we've had repayments as low as $400 million, repayments as high as $700 million, again i'm rounding here a little bit. and it's a bit again as we've always said episodic because when you have a portfolio of 45 loans, it is a loan-by-loan analysis. this is not a statistical analysis, unlike residential mortgages where it is quivering (ph) between interest rates and other macroeconomic factors and you can sort of predict cprs and other types of repayment rates. so it is very episodic.
i would say after having higher than average repayment in 2018, we do expect to have what i would say is lower than average prepayment in 2019. we think you know, a chunk of that will come in the second quarter, may be early part of the third quarter. that is sort of our you know, our best estimate. so i think for the year i think we're in the lower end of that range that i've mentioned between $400 million and $700 million.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. thank you both for your comments.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
absolutely. thank you, steve.
jamie henderson -- director; chief executive officer of ares commercial real estate; partner of ares real estate group
thanks, steve.
operator
the next question is from doug harter of credit suisse. please go ahead.
doug harter -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks. i guess, could you comment on where you are versus fully deployed today, just kind of, i guess kind of what to put that in context of kind of on the last call of saying you expected to be fully deployed to kind of within 30 days of that call?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. good morning, doug. this is tae-sik. so you know, again, i think with a relatively granular portfolio, we put in p lace the ares warehouse facility to help us manage through different liquidity needs that we have. and so as we mentioned, the primary purposes of the ares warehouse line is to put in so-called storage loans that we can pull down at acre when capital becomes available and its going to be a very, very effective tool for us.
you know, you see that we did put in one loan $40.5 million loan into the ares warehouse lines, so you can take from that, that during the quarter, during the third quarter we had a time in which the cash flow that we had or cash available that we had at acre wasn't sufficient to fund this $40.5 million loan.
so there will be different, i would say it moments in time where we're more fully invested, there will still to be moment in time where we're less fully invested and what we're really driving toward is to be more consistently fully invested at all times.
i would tell you that we're not quite there yet but, we're making tremendous progress toward that goal. and i think even before we put in the ares warehouse line, you know, a few months ago, you can see our 2018 performance a lot of that improvement in performance in 2018 was the fact that we are keeping our capital more fully deployed.
we think with this ares warehouse line we'll continue to build upon that success even more so, but i would tell you that in the first quarter as i mentioned in my remarks, we were under deployed overall for the quarter versus where we want to get to, but it's significant progress that we've made versus 12 months ago versus prior years. and i think we'll keep driving toward that goal.
so as i mentioned, maybe just to directly answer your question, yes, so there was a period in time in the first quarter where we didn't have the liquidity to fund this $40.5 million loan, so we put it on the ares warehouse line, with some prepayments coming up we do expect cash to be made available, as well as financing some assets that we mentioned that we have, cash will be available to pull that $40.5 million loan into the acre balance sheet. and then i think going forward from there, again we'll push toward having a much more fully deployed balance sheet at acre and putting the excess deal flow into ares warehouse line.
doug harter -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. and then tae-sik on your comment theory that kind of once you get leverage on this-on the owned hotel you know, that the returns should be comparable to exceed. can you just talk about you know, is there volatility? should we expect more volatility seasonality to-you know, to that return kind of over-you know, kind of over the holding period that you would expect to hold it?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. great question. so clearly as a lender you know, we are-we are somewhat protected you know, with the volatility of cash flows from different types of properties in a particularly in hotel properties which do rent you know, day by day and do not have the benefit of long-term leases here. but you know when you look at the westchester marriott you know, obviously this is the hotels we've mentioned has always been current on its-on its principal and interest payments on the loan itself.
so it has never been late on interest payments, it always had positive cash flow even when it took a bit of a downturn right after the renovations we talked about, it was still able to meet its interest payments and you know and funded the required capex reserves within the hotel itself.
so there has been volatility some of it planned because of the room renovations or common area renovations, some of it is not pre-planned in terms of market disruptions, but you know, this is a hotel that's been around since 1981 as we mentioned. it's always been branded and managed as a marriott and that has brought some stability to the hotel.
so while there clearly is going to be volatility in any hotel assets and really any real estate asset overall, we think we have a decent amount of cushion. we will get attractive financing on those assets. as i mentioned statement that we will you know, either get to or even exceed the returns that we've earned as a lender against this property is based upon you know, the trailing 12 months income, the last full amount of income in 2018, particular that can change of course.
but again, you know, we think we're on a good path toward continue to increase the cash flow of this asset. we've certainly experienced that over the past 24 months and you know, the plans that we have for this hotel we think will contribute to even a little bit of further growth in the operating income of the hotel.
jamie henderson -- director; chief executive officer of ares commercial real estate; partner of ares real estate group
and doug, it's jamie. i'll just build upon that, just a little bit. so as tae-sik mentioned, you know, really good trajectory for cash flows. and i think it's really important to kind of put this in the context of our portfolio. once we lever the asset, our exposure here is pretty small. so even if there is a little bit of vol it's-we don't consider it meaningful.
doug harter -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
the next question is from jade rahmani of kbw. please go ahead.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
thanks very much. the financials that you showed for the hotel. is that from march 8 through the end of the month. so we don't have a full quarter of numbers?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
correct. correct. so that really represents that stub period for the third quarter starting march 8 through the end of the quarter.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
so i think that the yield based on your prior presentation was about 7. 25%. so multiplying that by your basis $38.6 million should imply about $2.8 million of noi from the property. is that what we should think about?
jamie henderson -- director; chief executive officer of ares commercial real estate; partner of ares real estate group
well, i think you know, again it's hard to extrapolate any, you know any short periods because there is seasonality week-by-week, month-by-month and certainly season-by-season. so you know, i would say 2018 the net income for the property was significant above that number, it was really no-it was really right around $4 million of net income before ff&e reserve, again, that's 2018. but again there is seasonality involved quarter-to-quarter.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
okay. and in terms of the renovation plan, i mean, i believe that normandy had put in significant renovations over the past four years. i've actually been to the hotel because my wife works for a company nearby and they have their annual holiday party there. but what kind of renovations are you planning to do and how much do you expect to spend on a per room basis or you know in other areas?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. so, you know, again when we made this loan back in the summer of 2015. this was really a loan to help renovate the asset. so, while it was made by the prior owner, you know it was all-much of that was done during our period of. being a lender on this property. so and you know, what we've said in the past obviously is that, the timing that we think it's taken for the hotel to benefit from those renovations is taking longer than what we all expected.
i think going forward you know, the type of renovations that we're planning on doing primarily relates to the ballroom areas. so if you-if you're familiar with the property and it's 26,000 square feet, very flexible, there's a you know, a number of rooms that make up to 26,000 square feet. but it's really that ballroom in terms of. carpet, walls, ceiling treatment that we'll be spending some significant dollars on.
and again, this is all in a capex reserve that we've already built up. we being us and the prior owner have been building up. so the majority of the cash, in fact i think, almost all of the cash necessary for that ballroom innovation is already in a ff&e reserve account.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
okay. i was going to say what's the estimated holding period?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
so i think the only estimated holding period that we have at this point to really say is, you know, we don't expect to put this on a market in next 12 months. we think the hotel is continuing to grow and continue to benefit from the work that's been done and will be done going forward.
and so we think you know, its in our best interest to complete that work, continue to grow revpar, as well as noi and then look to sell the property. obviously, we're not a long, long term holder of this asset, but given that the performance is going well and is continuing to improve, we think we're best off not immediately signed this asset, but continuing to complete the business plan, complete the renovation plan and sell with higher noi in place.
jamie henderson -- director; chief executive officer of ares commercial real estate; partner of ares real estate group
so jade, and i'll build on that just a little bit. it's jamie henderson. so we look at this asset in the context of ares has extensive multi-decade experience as an owner-operator and investor in hotels as tae-sik mentioned. so we feel very qualified to analyze the property, the operations. cash flows are ramping. we think there is meat on the bone in terms of revenue and expenses.
so we think we're really well positioned to do what ares does really well, which is improve real estate and improve cash flows. but i also think its a great opportunity for me to introduce david roth who is the head of our u.s. equity business. david's an industry veteran. he's been on the equity side of the business for more than 30 years and was recently a senior managing director at blackstone, where i think he did in excess of $20 billion worth of real estate equity transaction. so i'd like to give david a minute to just articulate his thoughts on the asset and his perspectives on the way we can ramp cash flow.
david roth -- head of u.s. real estate private equity
yes. thanks, jamie. i think my mic was off, so i'm not sure you heard me there. thank you jamie and thanks jade and nice to meet you. thanks for the question. as as jamie mentioned, the ares team, including myself have very deep experience developing and owning marriott branded hotels, along with other hospitality brands in both the value added capacity and an opportunistic capacity. we've got very deep domain expertise in this area. having owned over 60 hotels and we have investments that are very close to this hotel. so we know the market fairly well.
i think it's really important to note that in recent past we've been one of the largest developers of marriott products, so we have a very, very close and good relationship with marriott. so as i think about the asset, i always think about you know, things like what is your basis, what are the things you can do to improve cash flow et cetera. this deal we really think the basis is at a good level at 87,000 a key, we like that basis. the team has reviewed the asset and we feel confident in our collective ability to improve profitability and the overall value of the asset over time. and basically that's through opportunity increased cash flow and the ways that have been talked about.
so you know, this is just to say that the acre team and we on the equity side plan to partner on this asset through the life of this assets and should we get the best execution on the strategic plan and ultimately on the future sale.
ryan tomasello -- keefe bruyette & woods -- analyst
okay great. thanks for all that color. this is actually ryan swapping in for jade. thanks, guys. and just one last quick one. you mentioned the libor floor is on the portfolio. i was wondering if you can give us what the average floor was across loans that have one?
david roth -- head of u.s. real estate private equity
sure. it's 1.48% and if you need to have more details we do have a little bit of a write up in our 10-q on that information, but it's 1. 48%. and as we mentioned 92% of our loans do have libor floors. and so what-and the reason it's at 1.48% is, if you look at our more current loans we will generally try to set libor floors at whatever the current libor is today. and so when we talk about 1.48% obviously we've had a you know, last 12 to 24 months we've had rising libor. so some have been set at lower libor floors, but that's when libor was lower. but overall right now as of march 31, 2019 it's 1.48%.
ryan tomasello -- keefe bruyette & woods -- analyst
got it. thanks.+
david roth -- head of u.s. real estate private equity
yeah.
operator
(operator instructions) the next question is from rick shane of jpmorgan. please go ahead.
richard shane -- jp morgan chase & co -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions this morning and again, look a lot of questions have been asked about the property. but i'd just like to understand sort of the game theory here both from the ares perspective and from the sponsor perspective of where you wound up. this loan was on repayment default back in june, it was cured in september and now you've taken title.
i'm curious why the sponsor would choose to let that happen given the investment they've made at this point and why from a relationship perspective you guys would seek that outcome and frankly even from a game theory perspective have to deal with all the questions you're getting from us this morning, if the property can be resolved in relatively short order.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. rick, thanks so much for the question and again, excellent question in terms of the reason why the borrower would pursue the course of action that it did. as we mentioned, you know, this was done in a negotiated transaction, so there was no foreclosure. so this was a, i don't know, if you want to call it a mutually agreed to transaction with the borrower itself.
so again, you know, it's hard for us to put ourselves exactly in the mindset of the borrower. i can tell you that i think based on our experience with them, this was an asset that was owned by multiple a group of borrowers and not just one manager or one investor, but multiple investors. i think those multiple investors may have had different interests in what they wanted to do with this hotel. they also had different priorities of cash flow associated with this-with this hotel. and the fact that they owned this hotel or were-had interest in this hotel for a relatively long time, you know, . in vehicles that were also in existence for a very long time.
so without getting into two particulars. now, as we've mentioned we did give them a six month extension from june to december and then when december came we all sort of met and you know we felt that it was in the best interests of everybody for us to take over, put in what we would say is the renewed interest and effort that we are going to be making in the hotel. and so you know, we felt we were in the best position to continue to complete the business plan for this hotel, complete the renovation of this hotel, continue to grow the cash flow and we felt we would be in a better position to do that than the former borrower.
but it is you know, as you implied, it is an unusual situation because the loan as we mentioned has always been current and in the majority of those kind situations as you would know, a lender would typically extend a loan, the borrowers would typically extend the loan and they would continue to work things out, particularly when you know the relationship is friendly and particularly when the property continues to show growth and the property most importantly continues to meet debt service.
so you know, we really appreciate the question, because you know, i understand from-you know, from your perspective it may be a bit of a head scratchier, but at the end the day you know, we did feel that we could have pursued the option of extending a loan further and not having to show this property as reo, but we still feel you know, the best decision for us was to take ownership and full control of this asset. go jamie i apologize.
+.look. thanks so for much for your question and the again excellent question in terms of the reason why the bar would pursue the course of action that it did. as we mentioned this was done in negotiated transactions was so there is no foreclosure. so this was a what to do would call it a mutually agreed to transaction with the borrower itself. so again talk about for itself exactly in the mindset of the borrower i can tell you that i think based on our experience with them this was an asset that was owned by multiple group of borrowers and that was just one manager or one investor but multiple investors.
i think those multiple investments may have had different interests in what they wanted to do with this hotel they also had different priorities and the cash flow associated with this hotel. and the fact that they've owned this hotel or were had interest in this hotel for a relatively long time. in vehicles that were also the existence very long time. so without getting into two particulars as we've mentioned we did give them a 6-month extension from june to december.
and then when december came w e all sort of net and we felt that it was in the best interest of everybody for us to take over put in what we would say a renewed interest and effort that we were going to be making in the hotel. and so we felt we were in the best judgment to continue to complete the business plan for this hotel complete the renovation of this hotel continuing over the cash flow and we felt we would be in a better position to do that than the former borrower.
but it is as you implied it is an unusual situation because the loan as we mentioned has always been current and in the majority of those type situations and you would now a lender would typically extend the loan to borrowers would typically extend the loan and they would continue to work things out particularly when the relationship is friendly and particularly when the property continues to show growth and the property most importantly continues to meet service.
so we really appreciate the question because i understand from your perspective it may be a bit of a head scratchier but at the end of the day we did feel that we kind of pursue the option of extending loan further and not having to show this property has already own. but we still feel the best decision for us was to take ownership and full control of this asset.
ryan tomasello -- keefe bruyette & woods -- analyst
go ahead jamie i apologize.
jamie henderson -- director; chief executive officer of ares commercial real estate; partner of ares real estate group
i'm sorry, i didn't meat to cut you off. yes. so when you find yourself in this situation as a lender, you know, you're really analyzing a variety of assets you can take with an asset and you know, we're here to maximize shareholder value and we're going to execute on the path and the plan that maximize shareholder value. and in this case it was a very amicable transaction, which makes it a little easier, but i'll come back to the fact that you know, we like the asset. we like the location. we really like our basis. it's cash flowing double digits to our-what we think will be our levered position and we think there's meat on the bone.
and the last little bit is just to reiterate, you know, ares has great in-house domain expertise, in particularly in marriott branded full service hotels. so i would kind of leave you with that thought, that you know we analyzed every path that we could take with the asset and we think this one is the best.
ryan tomasello -- keefe bruyette & woods -- analyst
got it. no it's interesting, i know, i don't think i'm in a position to assume it's a good or a bad outcome, but to tae-sik's point, it's a unusual outcome in the context of what we're all used to looking at and so that's why it's worth exploring sort of the background here. appreciate it guys. thank you.
jamie henderson -- director; chief executive officer of ares commercial real estate; partner of ares real estate group
and we've seen this and you know most of folks here have been in the industry for you know, 20 to 30 years. you you can't see a lot of idiosyncratic behavior at the end of a fund's life. i mean, there are moments in time particularly if there are more than one fund in an investment that they may be at odds with regard to you know, advancing fresh capital and sometimes it's just easier for them to give back the keys. so it's not always what we would perceive as purely rational economic behavior, there are a bunch of externalities that drive it.
ryan tomasello -- keefe bruyette & woods -- analyst
yeah, it's funny that comment, it totally makes sense, but at the same time it seems like a somewhat irrational decision and definitely makes you scratch your head a little bit.

i will now turn the call over to jamie henderson.
jamie henderson -- director; chief executive officer of ares commercial real estate; partner of ares real estate group
good morning. and thanks, veronica. we were off to a strong start this year generating gaap in core eps of $0. 30 and $0. 32 respectively. our strong earnings origination's and investment pipeline reflect the progress that we have made to generate and higher and more predictable earnings. we have multiple levers to pull to further improve our earnings throughout the year. these include the benefits from higher average deployment of capital and further cost savings on our liabilities and operating expenses.
one of the highlights for the quarter was a strong uptick in year-over-year origination activity, which is the result of the efforts that we have undertaken to expand our origination capabilities and to extend our national footprint.
in the first quarter, we originated five senior floating rate loans for $275 million in commitments, which includes $234 million in acre and $41 million in the ares warehouse. this is almost three times the volume of loan commitments originated in the first quarter of 2018.
the loan in the ares warehouse is designated for acre we expect will be transferred to acre's balance sheet in the second quarter. all of these loans are first mortgages, secured by high-quality commercial properties in growing markets and backed by strong sponsors. importantly, this investment activity coupled with a strong pipeline has set the foundation for a higher run rate of earnings in the second quarter and for the remainder of the year.
secondly, we closed our latest private securitization lowering the cost of funds by 15 basis points. this is a great example of how we continue to reduce our all-in spread on our liabilities. this is an important earnings driver and we are optimistic that we can further reduce the cost of our liabilities in 2019.
finally, we reduced our comparable g&a expenses on a year-over-year basis. these cost-cutting measures are firmly in place and we expect the earnings benefit to come through in coming quarters.
turning to the market and current investment activity. u.s. real estate fundamentals remain favorable. we continue to see strong relative value in the middle market lending to high-quality sponsors on attractive properties. given the size and repayment characteristics of our portfolio, we can be very nimble and selective with no requirement to buy the market. rather, we can pick the spots where we can leverage our direct origination advantages, repeat sponsor relationships and flexible capital.
since quarter end we have closed two additional loans secured by office properties in texas and north carolina totaling $59 million in new commitments. we are seeing attractive relative value with growth leveraged returns on all loans close to date in the low to mid-double-digits in the aggregate.
we remain focused on expanding our origination team and geographic footprint and closely integrating our equity and debt teams to broaden the number of opportunities that we source. by doing so, we are able to remain highly selective, while also achieving our goal to be more fully deployed continuously.
the size of our total pipeline has more than tripled versus this point a year ago. we are already seeing a significant increase in production in certain regions where we have added new originators and we expect this trend to continue as our platform continues to scale. by increasing the number of opportunities that we see, we can remain highly selective closing less than 5% of the transactions that we reviewed year-to-date.
finally, our board declared a second quarter dividend of $0.33 per share. on an annualized basis this represents an attractive 8.7% annualized dividend yield based on yesterday's closing price of $15.20 per share. as we've said in our last earnings call, we have fully covered our dividend from core earnings for the past three years and expect to cover our annual dividend again this year.
i will now turn the call over to tae-sik to discuss our first quarter results in further detail.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
great. thank you, jamie. and good morning, everybody. earlier today we reported gaap net income of $8.5 million or $0.30 per common share and core earnings of $9.1 million or $0.32 per common share for the first quarter of 2019. and while we are pleased with our results, i think it is worth noting that our earnings for this first quarter did not meaningfully benefit from acceleration of origination and exit fees normally associated with early repayment of loans.
we have mentioned in the past that on average we received approximately $0.02 per common share per quarter in such fees. but for this first quarter such accelerated fees were less than half a penny per share. in addition, while we have strong originators of $234 million in new commitments and funded, $121 million in unpaid principal balance in the first quarter, we were a bit under deployed due to significant repayments that we had in year-end 2018.
as jamie said however, we had a strong finish to the first quarter and continue to build our loan book with a strong pipeline to lean into, which means that we feel very positive about the remainder of 2019. we also believe that our earnings will benefit from more typical levels of accelerated fees, as well as reductions in our borrowing costs and g&a expenses.
as of march 31, 2019 our portfolio continues to remain primarily floating-rate with 98% of our loans as measured by unpaid principal balance index to one month libor. this has allowed us to benefit nearly step by step with the increase in short-term rates over the past few quarters.
at the same time however, should rates reverse direction and start to decline, we have embedded libor floors into 92% of our loans to provide us with some meaningful levels of protection.
credit quality also remained strong with no impairment to losses since the inception of our company more than seven years ago. as of march 31, 2019 the portfolio included 45 loans with an outstanding principal balance of $1.6 billion.
now let me provide some background on the property we converted to real estate owned on march 8, 2019. the property is a full-service marriott branded and managed hotel located in tarrytown new york known as the westchester marriott. for those of you who are not familiar with tarrytown it is an affluent suburb of new york city and located within westchester county.
the hotel itself is as full-service property with 444 rooms and offers 26 000 square feet of flexible meeting space. over the past four years approximately $12 million has been invested in the hotel, including room and common area renovations.
since acquiring the property about a month ago, our in-house asset management team has initiated a strategic plan to continue to improve operations, increased group sales and complete renovation of the ballrooms.
as we have mentioned in the past at ares we have significant hospitality expertise, having owned interest in more than 60 hotels comprising over 39,000 rooms. and our team has worked with many of the major brands and management companies, including marriott, hilton, hyatt among others.
at the time we took ownership of the hotel, we recognized the property as a real estate owned at an initial fair value of $38.6 million, including working capital. this represents about $80,000 per key. this fair value is approximately equal to the carrying value of our prior senior loan and as a result we did not recognize any gain or loss upon taking ownership of the hotel. in addition to aggressively managing the property to further improve cash flows, we are seeking to finance the hotel.
today we have received multiple term sheets from third-party lenders. upon successfully refinancing the property and based upon trailing 12 months of cash flows generated by the hotel, we expect our returns on our equity will be at or higher than what we are earning on our prior senior loan on the hotel.
we are comfortable with our business case for owning this property and we're very encouraged by the hotel's improving net income and other key metrics over the past 12 months, as well as at hotels positive outlook going forward.
and with that, i will now turn the call back over to jamie for some closing remarks.
jamie henderson -- director; chief executive officer of ares commercial real estate; partner of ares real estate group
thanks, tae-sik in closing, we are off to a very good start and our enhanced origination activities have laid a strong foundation for improved earnings throughout the year. we continue to have multiple levers to further improve earnings, including our goal of staying fully deployed, which will be aided by the use of the ares warehouse, along with potential further reductions in our cost of capital and g&a expenses.
we feel very good about our portfolio and the momentum that we have with our growing market presence and productive team. as always, we appreciate your support for our company.
with that, i would now like to ask the operator to please open the line for ",2019-Q1,ACRE

thank you [operator instructions]. the first question today will come from steve delaney with jmp securities. please go ahead.
steven c. delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
good morning, everyone, and congratulations on the nice quarter. boy, you guys give such thorough info in terms of repayments, etc. that it's -- that it's hard to have too many questions, but i'm going to take a shot at it. jamie, you mentioned the pipeline is building and it's above. i think i heard you say it was double where it was last year and when combining that with tae-sik's comments about something in the $600 million to $700 million range of annual repayments. i'm looking back to the portfolio one year ago, in june of 2018 and it was $1.75 billion, if my model's correct and now we've slipped below 1.5, i guess the question is, this -- the pipeline that you see in the momentum, can we get back to something like a $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion portfolio given the repayments here over the next 6 months? how long is that going to take to reach your prior peak level? so, i'll stop there and see where we go.
tae-sik yoon -- partner, chief financial officer and treasurer of ares commercial real estate
sure, steve, this is a tae-sik. maybe, i'll start off and then -- jamie can more specifically address. i just wanted to start off with the one comment that obviously, you know, any balance that we give at the end of the quarter really reflects that one pin-point in time. and clearly, you know, we have periods where we will end the quarter higher and there were periods where we end the quarter lower. i would tell you that in terms of the repayments that we had just in the second quarter of this year, much of that happened right at the end of the quarter. so, even though it ended with a little bit of a lower balance, you know, the earning power that we had during the quarter was, you know, was higher than the $1.5 billion that you see reflected. so, you know, it will vary.
i'll let jamie sort of cover what the future pipeline looks like. but, you know, i think the important number to focus on during any quarter is really the average that existed. and that's, you know, that's in our supplemental earnings deck that you'll see. but again, with that, i'm going to [phonetic] turn to jamie for some additional color.
jamie henderson -- director; chief executive officer of ares commercial real estate; partner of ares real estate group
thanks, tae-sik. good morning, steve. so, the pipeline feels great. typically at this point in the summer, it can get a little quiet. but, you know, we've got 6 or 7 executed term sheets and a really strong volume right behind that. so, we feel really good about where we sit going into the second half of the year. if you look historically, our strongest quarter has always been q4 and i think the way we're positioned this year heading into the second half is -- is really, really good. i'll also say that our selectivity is higher than it's ever been, and the returns on the deals that we've closed through the end of the second quarter are actually higher than last year. so, despite a lot of chatter about spread compression, we're still seeing really, really good deals. as i mentioned, we've expanded our geographic footprint and getting these originators in place, on the ground, in the markets where some of the competition just doesn't have a true ground game, has allowed us to be more selective, put in good -- high-quality credits at really attractive spreads. so, feel really well-positioned for the rest year.
steven c. delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
and that perform -- that return profile seems to be a little at odds about what we're seeing. we are hearing that some of the spread compression we saw over the last 12 months to eight months, especially with rates coming down, has subsided somewhat. but, you're describing, not just level returns but higher returns. and it -- is it that you're being select -- really filtering down instead of it being a real volume game, you're filtering it down to where the risk-adjusted return on the loan -- it's where your selectivity really comes in? is that why we're seeing this kind of counter-trend to the group, i guess is, what i'm saying.
jamie henderson -- director; chief executive officer of ares commercial real estate; partner of ares real estate group
well, i would look at in two parts. you know, we've always had a very high degree of selectivity, so it's always been less than 5%. and it still is less than 5%, but we more than doubled the top of the funnel. so rather than, electing to, just kind of, buy the market so to speak, we're just picking our spots carefully and really pressing for that kind of incremental risk-adjusted return.
steven c. delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
got it. hey, well, thank you both for your comments. that's all i have.
tae-sik yoon -- partner, chief financial officer and treasurer of ares commercial real estate
great. thank you, steve.
operator
the next question comes from doug harter of credit suisse. please go ahead.
douglas harter -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks. just wanted to get your updated thoughts on the holding of your rel[phonetic] loan. as you said, you kind of validated the fair market value with your loan, the performance was good, kind of just the thoughts around, kind of, monetizing that and, kind of, moving on and redeploying back into loans versus, continuing to hold it. and, you are generating a strong return, but could be more volatile and just kind of how you think about those dynamics?
jamie henderson -- director; chief executive officer of ares commercial real estate; partner of ares real estate group
so, hey, doug, it's jamie. so i'd start by saying that we really like the asset. it's a good asset and it's definitely a outperforming. you know, budget -- in kind of our initial projections. we've stepped down our exposure in the asset quite significantly through the financing that tae-sik mentioned and generating really attractive cash-on-cash returns. so, feel very good about where we sit at the moment, hospitality assets are interesting. you know, there's an operating company component to them, there is a good time to sell them and there's, you know, there's obviously bad times to sell them. we think that there is some work to be done at the asset level that can enhance the returns to optimize a sale. so we're going through some of that work as we speak and we think that can drive incremental noi and facilitate a better sale.
and tae-sik, do you have any thoughts on the asset that you want to share?
tae-sik yoon -- partner, chief financial officer and treasurer of ares commercial real estate
sure, no absolutely, i think that's very accurate. i mean, doug, i think one thing to make very clear is, you know, this is not intended as a long term investment. however, we believe we have the skills and the experience and the people here at ares to really add the value that we think we can add to this hotel. we do think this is, as we said, more-than-a-year-hold that we'll -- want to make sure that we fully stabilize the property, we fully maximize the operations. as jamie said, we are doing some of the common area renovations right now. we want to make sure that we see the cash flow benefits from the prior renovations as well as the new renovations that we're completing today.
and so really given ares' experience, and what we see for the future of this hotel, while we're not a long term holder of this investment, we do want to maximize the value here. i think we've taken all the right steps so far, including the financing, but more importantly on the operations of the hotel. and we feel very good about its prospects. but you're right, there is seasonality, there is more volatility in owning an asset like this than a loan. so we're not in the business of owning hotels, we're not in the business of operating hotels, so we will convert this to cash and then redeployed into loans. but we don't feel compelled to do it immediately. we think we can maximize value here.
douglas harter -- credit suisse -- analyst
and then, away from this asset. but obviously, ares has the expertise to kind of own real estate. in the past, you've talked about, kind of, wanting to add duration to the portfolio. just i guess, what are your current thoughts on potentially adding some owned real estate to the portfolio as a long term kind of core holding?
jamie henderson -- director; chief executive officer of ares commercial real estate; partner of ares real estate group
that's a good question, doug and the good news is, we see the flow in all the asset classes. so definitely see it in, you know, in the -- pure real estate equity side, seeing in the security side. also seeing our core business, we think that the relative returns in the levered first mortgage model are still really compelling and offer great relative value. there will be a moment in time where we think adding duration is appropriate. and we're always engaged in that kind of hourly, daily, weekly relative value exercise.
douglas harter -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. thank you jamie.
operator
the next question comes from jade rahmani with kbw. please go ahead.
jade j. rahmani -- kbw, inc. -- analyst
thanks very much. with the stock, i believe modestly above book value, i think that there is at least some potential for common equity issuance. how do you think about that, given the magnitude of repayments that you're experiencing running in excess of originations? and secondly, are there any portfolio acquisitions in the market that could be attractive that you've seen? for example, i cover two companies. one is colony and yesterday they announced a strategic shift focusing on digital so they could potentially be a seller of a lot of assets. and also another company, istar has pivoted to solely focus on ground lease, they have a high yielding $1 billion portfolio. so just wondering if there's any potential for growing the company through acquisitions?
jamie henderson -- director; chief executive officer of ares commercial real estate; partner of ares real estate group
thanks, jade. so i guess i'll take that in a couple of parts. with regards to common equity issuance, we've -- we stated previously that it's a two-part test. number one, it has to be non-dilutive. so, we're clearly passing that test. number two, we said that we need a kind of, clear near-term opportunity to reinvest that capital at attractive returns, that because of volumes of repayments, we haven't met that test just yet. there will be a moment in time where we think we'll meet that test. and at that point, we would evaluate, you know, issuing equity.
as it pertains to portfolios in the marketplace. i think ares is blessed by the fact that we see pretty much every transaction out there, many of the ones that you cite and also many that aren't public, so we get a good look at everything. and it comes down to pricing and credit quality. so that's always the -- the intention is to find a really attractive book with high credit quality that's reasonably priced. so when and if we see that we'll.
jade j. rahmani -- kbw, inc. -- analyst
and what about distressed assets? i think. i've noticed an increase in capital raising -- capital formation around anticipation of other idiosyncratic assets that require some kind of workout capability. could that be interesting to you at this point in the cycle?
jamie henderson -- director; chief executive officer of ares commercial real estate; partner of ares real estate group
sure, so i think, to play in that space, you need to be good at a couple of things. number one, you need to be a good, structured credit shop, so you can understand what you're buying. number two, you need to be able to, own, operate and fix real estate. so we clearly qualify on both fronts. part of the reason, david's on the team and we're happy to have him is to enhance the integration of our two platforms and to be ready when and if those opportunities present themselves.
jade j. rahmani -- kbw, inc. -- analyst
okay. that's interesting to hear. just on the outlook for originations and also repayments. it's been some time since you exceeded about $200 million in annual originations. do you see -- i mean, in quarterly originations, do you see the potential for that in the next two quarters? and on the repayment side, could you clarify? i thought the range tae-sik's comment was that you'd be at the higher end of $400 million to $700 million. but i believe steve said $600 million to $700 million. so, just want to clarify that.
tae-sik yoon -- partner, chief financial officer and treasurer of ares commercial real estate
sure, jade, why don't i take that repayment question first? so i think what we said is the higher end of that $400 million to $700 million range and i guess, i interpreted steve's comment as that higher range being the $600 million to $700 million of that $400 million to $700 million original range. and so i think that's right. i guess, i would sort of say the range i think we have is more in the $550 million to $700 million range. so we are just trying to kind of narrow that range to provide you guys with a better viewpoint. again, as we've always said, the caveat here is that we have 45 loans. they're all very bespoke situations. there's really no statistical way to predict repayments, unlike a large single-family home loan portfolio, right -- this doesn't really react specifically to interest [phonetic] rate movements or spread movements even. i think it's really based upon when our sponsors complete their business plans, stabilize the assets and therefore are ready to either refinance or sell the assets. that's really what drives repayment activity.
having said that, we obviously carefully monitor all of our loans, speak with the borrowers in a very -- frequent occasions. so we have a pretty good sense. but again, we have a relatively wide range because they are lumpy, they are very bespoke. so i would tell you that right now, we would tell you the best range we have is on the upper half of that $400 million to $700 million, meaning $550 million to $700 million.
one clarification i didn't want to make is i think you mentioned at the outset your question to jamie. you know that repayments exceeded origination and again, i would always caution people not to look at our statistics out of a quarter[phonetic] but really look at it annually or at least look at it year-to-date. so, for example, year-to-date our originations and our repayments were almost the same. right around $250 million in terms of fundings as well as repayments for the year. if you look at the balance sheet, it looks like our loan is little bit less than year-end activity. and i would tell you, the adjustment you have to make is we didn't own the westchester marriott in the year-end, that was a $38.6 million loan. so if you adjust for that, you can see that our total balance is almost identical, year-end through june 30th. and so maybe going back to steve's original question about why our loan balance also seems lower is, because with the rel[phonetic] we took $38.6 million of loans and is now in a real estate owned asset and therefore will have naturally $38.6 million less in loan balance. so that's a small adjustment, but i think an important adjustment to make.
jade j. rahmani -- kbw, inc. -- analyst
and just on the potential for originations to exceed $400 million in the back half?
jamie henderson -- director; chief executive officer of ares commercial real estate; partner of ares real estate group
yes. so as i mentioned, we have six deals with term sheets executed. that's a principal balance that's close to $200 million. and behind that, we have good visibility and into also a significant number of loans. so as i mentioned, feel really good about the second half. timing in this business moves around a lot. so this is just, a bit of a guess as to when this closes, be it q3 or q4, but full-year, feel very good about where we're sitting.
jade j. rahmani -- kbw, inc. -- analyst
thank you.
jamie henderson -- director; chief executive officer of ares commercial real estate; partner of ares real estate group

our next question comes from rick shane with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
richard shane -- j.p. morgan. -- analyst
hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions this morning. tae-sik, you had mentioned that the weighted average libor floor is 1.62% -- curious what the distribution is because as libor moves down, obviously that's the average. but i'm curious when we should start to see a little bit of floor income pick up. and i am curious, given sort of what has happened over the last couple years in terms of margin compression, if some of that was loss of floor income and whether or not this will actually enhance spread as we see rates drop.
tae-sik yoon -- partner, chief financial officer and treasurer of ares commercial real estate
sure. good morning, rick, and thanks for the question. so. that's right. so, we had mentioned that, more than 90% of our loans have libor floors and that the average floor for those loans with the floor is 1.6% just above 1.6% just more specifically, i'll just give you some example. so, we set our libor floors generally at-market, so the loans that were done a year ago obviously have a lower libor floors . loans that were done in the last three months to six months have higher libor floors. so, for example, 20% of our loans have floors that kick in right around, 2.25%[phonetic] . so with libor today at 2.40%[phonetic] we have 20% of our loans that are pretty close to the current market. we have another set of loans that kick in at about 2%. so we get about just under 29% of our loans kick in at around 2%. you can see we're well distributed and well protected from beakers[phonetic] in libor floor obviously the further it falls, more percent of our loans kick in. but just to address your questions about the more near-term impact, so 20% at 2.25% just under 29% -- 28.7% to be more exact, kick in at 2% libor.
and then in terms of your --
richard shane -- j.p. morgan. -- analyst
[indecipherable] oh go ahead tae-sik, i didn't mean to --
tae-sik yoon -- partner, chief financial officer and treasurer of ares commercial real estate
i'm sorry, go ahead rick.
richard shane -- j.p. morgan. -- analyst
no, i said i didn't mean to cut you off. you were going to answer the second part of my question. i apologize.
tae-sik yoon -- partner, chief financial officer and treasurer of ares commercial real estate
oh, yes. and then, on margin expansion or i guess, impact of borrowing margins when libor changes, certainly the reasonable estimate is what we saw as libor ticked up is that our spreads compressed a bit because, again, if you're a borrower, you certainly are focused on spread, but what you're really focused on is your all-in cost of financing, right. so again, if libor goes up, you can afford to pay a little less spread. what we're expecting and i think what we're seeing just a little bit of is, as libor comes down, or at least the indications are that it may likely come down. i do think we'll have to -- i think we'll get a little bit more pricing power. jamie might want to speak more specific about it, but that is certainly something we intend to see or expect to see.
jamie henderson -- director; chief executive officer of ares commercial real estate; partner of ares real estate group
yes, coupons tend to be a little bit sticky and -- thus the spreads tend to widen a little bit when the index moves.
richard shane -- j.p. morgan. -- analyst
great. thank you, guys.

once again, as a reminder, [operator instructions]. the next question comes from stephen laws with raymond james. please go ahead.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
hi, good morning. a couple of follow up questions, please. tae-sik, i think you've done a great job covering the prepayments in the second half of this year, but really want to get your thoughts on 2020, as i look through your portfolio loans, i think i only see three and they're fairly small that mature in the first half of 2020. but then you do have -- so basically the, 2020 scheduled repayments are very much back-end loaded to the second half of the year. you know, first off, can you confirm that's accurate as i think about how to look at my quarterly results through 2020? but time that into the new ares facility, i know you brought one loan down. can you talk about whether or not that's an objective? and how valuable that can be if you can get that ares facility, say, filled up by june, that way it's in place to pull those assets down in the second half when the repayments pick up next year?
tae-sik yoon -- partner, chief financial officer and treasurer of ares commercial real estate
sure. good morning, stephen, and again, thanks for your question. i think your question is, is a very insightful one. so certainly, when we look at our repayment schedule, we begin with the state of maturity on our loan and we certainly start from there and then we really look at each asset and say what's the likelihood that it prepays before the maturity? what's the likelihood that it may extend for whatever reason and we start to make significant adjustments. so, i think if you looked at our internal work instead[phonetic], what is the expected maturity schedule, it'll look quite different than the stated maturity schedule, because, i would say it's a minority of our investments that actually pay off on -- on stated maturity.
as you know, we have a very limited number of loans that extend typically for good reasons, but a very small number that extend beyond. but the vast majority, pay before the stated maturity. so i think if you look at 2020, at this point, our view is that that trend, that general pattern will remain consistent, that even though stated maturity may be more back-ended, my anticipation is that, you'll see maturities that's probably more spread out throughout the year. again, having said that, it's very loan by loan type analysis. so i would always start as you did with stated maturity, but we always made significant adjustments to our expected maturity based upon what we're seeing in the business plans of each asset.
i think the second point you made, which is, the ares warehouse, you're spot on. that is absolutely the reason that we put this ares facility in place is to help us through periods of higher [indecipherable]. and so we want to build up a storage of loans in the warehouse facility so that when we get a repayment, it doesn't take 30 days, 60 days, 90 days to redeploy that capital. but it's something that we can immediately draw down from the ares warehouse facility. obviously, the team is working very hard, incredibly hard, to not only put loans on balance sheet today but to put extra loans, if you want to call it, in the warehouse facility so that going forward, particularly 2020 and going forward, that we will be able to deal with loan repayments, much more efficiently than we have in the past.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
that's great. appreciate the color on that tae-sik. and on the hotel, i know you touched on it. you mentioned seasonality in your answer to doug's question. can you maybe. give us a little color around the seasonality of the revenue we should be modeling for that. you did say, you'll likely own it for more than a year, so we'll go through a full-year with it. so maybe two questions. one is the seasonality we should see on the revenue side of that. the second is on the expense space. how much of that is fixed versus variable tied to the revenue?
jamie henderson -- director; chief executive officer of ares commercial real estate; partner of ares real estate group
sure. excellent question. and you know, westchester marriott, experience is somewhat typical business, suburban business style behavior. meaning that in the summer months, when there's less business travel and more tourism, it's going to get less business. there's going to be less group business. there's going to be conferences, there's going to be less meetings. and that's generally true in the third quarter. that's a little less true but on a typical basis, first and third quarters tend to be the slowest, but particularly, third quarter. so, seasonally, second quarter and fourth quarter are generally the strongest for these type of hotels. and i think what we have budgeted because we haven't owned this hotel for the full-year cycle, but certainly as a lender, what we have seen and what we have budgeted for this hotel is that third quarter, will definitely be the slowest of the quarters. second-quarter was a very strong quarter. but third quarter, we do expect it to be a -- on a quarter-to-quarter basis, the weakest of the four quarters.
i was going to get to your second question about, fixed versus variable cost. full-service hotels, do have a substantial portion of their expenses as fixed costs. this hotel is a 444 room hotel. so it does have full staff, it does have full food and beverage, it does have full catering. so there is substantial fixed costs at this hotel. there are obviously some variable costs in terms of room costs. but being a full-service hotel, unlike some more limited-service hotels, there is a higher percentage of expenses that are fixed. so seasonally, what you'll see is that the operating margins of the hotel will be more impacted because of the higher percentages of fixed costs.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
i guess to try and tie all that together with the 3q being the seasonally lowest revenue, do you expect it to be profitable for just the third quarter alone? i know you look at it more on an annual basis, but when we're looking at our model for this coming quarter, you expect a positive margin there for the third quarter?
jamie henderson -- director; chief executive officer of ares commercial real estate; partner of ares real estate group
stephen, we have not provided specific guidance for the hotel, i think all we have said is, if you look at this historically, we expect 2019 to be in line with historical. that was our budget. i think it's performing. i would say slightly ahead of that at this point, and so i think if you were to kind of look at how much revenue this hotel has generated, how much noi this hotel has generated so far in the year, and kind of take that into consideration for the rest of the year, you might be able to get some sense. but i think directionally, i think you're correct. it'll be substantially lower. the budget is substantially lower in the third quarter than the second quarter for sure, but i prefer not to -- at this point give the exact specifics on whether it'll be positive, whether it'll be negative or that specific amount.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
fair enough. i'll make sure to ask again in three months so you can talk about the strongest quarter in q4[phonetic] and talk about [indecipherable] for the contribution then. so i'll let you get both sides of that next quarter. so thanks for taking my questions. really appreciate it.

our next question is follow up from jade rahmani with kbw. please go ahead.
jade j. rahmani -- kbw, inc. -- analyst
thanks very much. i was wondering if you could quantify the benefit from prepayment income that you generated in the quarter?
tae-sik yoon -- partner, chief financial officer and treasurer of ares commercial real estate
sure .no, happy to do so. so, again, i just want to put this in the proper context. and so, what we have said in the past is that on your typical if there is such a thing, your average quarter, we experience about $0.02 impact -- $0.02 per share impact from acceleration of deferred origination fees. first-quarter, we mentioned we had minimal accelerated fees in the first quarter. this second quarter was just about $0.03 per share. and so, as you can tell, first quarter, we were under average. second quarter, we were above average. and again, that's why again, i want to emphasize that rather than looking at this quarter-to-quarter, we think about this as a longer-term annual trend of about $0.08 per year, if you want to call that.

operator
good morning and welcome to the ares commercial real estate corporation's conference call to discuss the company's second quarter 2019 earnings results. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded on july 26th, 2019.
i will now turn the call over to veronica mendiola mayer from investor relations. please go ahead.
veronica mendiola mayer -- principal, public investor relations and communications
good morning and thank you for joining us on today's conference call. i am joined today by our ceo, jamie henderson; david roth, our new president; tae-sik yoon, our cfo, and carl drake and other members from our investor relations team.
in addition to our press release and the 10-q that we filed with the sec, we have posted an earnings presentation under the investor resources section of our website at www.arescre.com. before we begin, i want to remind everyone that comments made during the course of this conference call and webcast and the accompanying documents contain forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainty.

and with that, i will now turn the call over to jamie henderson.
jamie henderson -- director; chief executive officer of ares commercial real estate; partner of ares real estate group
thank you, veronica. this morning, we reported strong results for the quarter, as we continue to execute on our annual business plan and many of the financial objectives that we laid out earlier this year. we generated core earnings per share of $0.38, up 9% from the second quarter of 2018. our new loan commitments for the second quarter totaled $99 million and total loan fundings were $129 million. this brings our year-to-date commitments in fundings to $33 million -- $333 million and $250 million respectively, in line with our levels for the first half of 2018.
from a return perspective, we are seeing higher expected return profiles in closed loans for the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018. to date, all originated loans this year, have anticipated growth in levered returns[phonetic] in the low-double digits
turning to the market. we continue to believe that us real estate fundamentals remain healthy. supply, generally remains in check in most of our targeted markets and property demand is consistent. transaction activity has recently picked up for us, but we are remaining highly selective. as an example, we closed less than 5% of the transactions that we reviewed during the first half of 2019. our focus on broadening the number of opportunities that we source is putting us in a good position to redeploy our capital into attractive investments for our shareholders. as a result of our efforts to grow and broaden our pipeline, the amount of transactions that we are currently reviewing and have quoted or are in more advanced stages has doubled versus the same period in 2018.
as we have said in the past, we will not compromise on credit quality and we are focused on originating loans within our targeted return range. we are further expanding our geographic footprint to markets that have strong growth dynamics and that we believe are less efficiently covered by the competition. in the second quarter, we added a new origination professional in northern california, which will increase our west coast coverage.
as you may have seen from our press release this morning, we have named david roth as our new president. many of you heard from david on last quarter's conference call, as he discussed our us real estate equity platform's experience in the hospitality sector and how it supports acres investment activities. david runs our us real estate private equity business and is a member of our global real estate investment committee. david and i have been closely working together since he joined earlier this year and his impact has already been significant. i look forward to working more closely with david in his new role going forward. i will now turn the call over to david for a brief introduction.
david roth -- president of ares commercial real estate
thanks, jamie, and good morning, everyone. i'm very pleased to join acre as president and take on a more formal role with the company. i look forward to working with jamie, tae-sik and the team to help grow the business. i'll be happy to answer any questions and i look forward to meeting all of you in person in the future.
now i'm going to pass the call over to tae-sik, to walk you through our second-quarter financial results.
tae-sik yoon -- partner, chief financial officer and treasurer of ares commercial real estate
great. thank you, david and good morning, everybody. earlier today, we reported gaap net income of $9.8 million or $0.34 per common share and core earnings of $11 million or $0.38 per common share for the second quarter of 2019. our strong second-quarter results benefited from certain events, including above-average accelerated fees [phonetic] related to repayments, which was in contrast to the lower than average accelerated fees that we experienced in the first quarter of 2019.
in addition, for this second quarter, we benefited from strong performance at the westchester marriott hotel. as jamie mentioned, we closed a $99 million of new commitments across three senior floating rate loans during the second quarter. this included the transfer of a $41 million loan on an industrial property that was originated in the ares warehouse in the first quarter and then subsequently transferred to acre in the second quarter. total fundings for the second quarter were a $129 million, which includes initial fundings of $59 million and $70 million of fundings on prior existing commitments.
as of june 30th, the loan portfolio included 45 loans with an outstanding principal balance of $1.5 billion. credit quality continues to remain favorable, with no impairments and the portfolio weighted average -- unleveraged effective yield remains at 7.2%. at quarter-end, 92% of our floating rate loans have embedded libor floors, which provide us with meaningful levels of protection, should rates decrease. the weighted average libor floor for the 92% of loans with such floors is 1.6%.
now, turning to our balance sheet, our leverage remained consistent with a debt-to-equity ratio of 2.9 times. this is in line with our target, given our asset mix with 96% of our loan portfolio in senior loans.
during the quarter, we continued our efforts to further improve our financing facilities. a few weeks ago, we announced that we amended the terms of our $50 million secured revolving funding facility with city national bank or cnb, which is an attractive source of flexible financing for us we added an accordion feature, for example, that provides an additional $25 million of capital for limited periods on an if and as-needed basis. lowered the costs by 35 basis points and further added an extension option to extend the maturity for 2 additional years through 2 additional 12-month extensions. in june, we also obtained a $28.3 million non-recourse first mortgage loan on the marriott westchester hotel, this effectively reduces our equity in the investment to just over $10 million. in our view, the $28.3 million loan proceeds represent 73% of our $38.6 million carrying value, further substantiating our views on the fair value of the property.
based on trailing 12-months of cash flows generated by the hotel, we expect that the return on our equity will be in the mid-teens or well above the return we were earning on our prior senior loan in the hotel on unlevered[phonetic] basis. going forward, this $28.3 million loan may be increased to up to $30 million subject to certain conditions.
finally, on repayments. in the second quarter, we had a $190 million of loans that repaid, bringing repayments for the first half of the year to just under $250 million. we currently expect a pickup in repayment activity in the second half of this year with aggregate repayments for 2019 to be -- to likely be at the higher end of our original $400 million to $700 million range that we previously provided.
we believe that we remain on track to fully cover our full-year dividends for 2019 through core earnings. as a result, our board declared a third-quarter dividend of $0.33 per share. on an annualized basis, this represents an attractive 8.8% percent annualized dividend yield based on yesterday's closing price of $14.94 per share.
and with that, i will turn the call now back over to jamie for some closing remarks.
jamie henderson -- director; chief executive officer of ares commercial real estate; partner of ares real estate group
thank you, tae-sik. in closing, we are very pleased with our strong second-quarter results and where we stand going into the second half of the year. we've been very selective in transacting on investments with attractive, risk-adjusted returns, our pipeline is strong and marriott westchester is performing well. looking ahead, we continue to seek opportunities to grow our earnings through capital deployment and by reducing the costs of our liabilities and operating expenses. with that, i would like to ask the operator, please open the line for questions and answer.

[operators instructions] our first question comes from stephen laws with raymond james.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
hi, good morning,i guess first jamie good luck with the -- what you pursue after this and congratulations on a good job you've done at acre over the last couple of years. moving to questions i guess first tae-sik if i can follow up on your repayment comments maybe specifically -- or the q4 increase in repayments are those some of the loans we've seen you breakout that are scheduled to mature early next year? and then specifically if you could talk to the -- it looks like february through april you've got 3 of your 4 residential condo loans scheduled to mature. could you touch on those and whether you expect those to pay off at maturity or extend? it looks like a couple of them might be at pretty high interest rates as well. so i'd appreciate your comments around that.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. thanks for your question. so with respect to repayments as i mentioned we do expect a pickup of repayment activity in the fourth quarter. i think we said something very similar on our last conference call. so without giving you an exact estimate we've had a little more than $100 million payoffs so far in the quarter. and i think for the total for the quarter we expect somewhere between call it $250 million and $300 million for fourth quarter in the aggregate inclusive of the $100 million plus that's paid off so far. more specifically with respect to the residential condominium loans that you're referring to. one of the 3 that you're referring to this is identified as the $17.5 million senior loan in florida. that has already paid off and that is part of the slightly more than $100 million that is so far paid off in the fourth quarter. the other 2 loans that you're referring to one is the maturity coming up in february 2020 and then the third has a maturity in march of 2020. again i think both of those situations we do expect there to be a payoff right around the maturity date. we don't have a specific time line for those 2. but the objective is to have both the loans pay off on or about the maturity date.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
great. and can you touch on the ares financing facility? has you -- has the company utilized that at all? what are your thoughts as far as excess or utilization especially if we see repayments slow? if you could talk a little bit about the -- any update on utilization of that facility?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. so first of all we have not utilized the facility this past quarter. i would tell you that it's still extremely helpful to us knowing that we have this so-called excess capacity behind us at any point. so it gives all of our originators for example the confidence that the capital will always be available to make sure that loans that we commit to have no risk of not being funded. so while it's not been specifically drawn i think it continues to be very very additive to our origination activities in terms of again having that extra capacity always on hand to make sure that our originations never slow down. we would certainly anticipate utilizing the warehouse facility. our primary goal of course is to keep the existing balance sheet and the existing capital as full as possible. and i think we've done a very good job of making sure first and foremost that any repayment of capital is fully redeployed. we are obviously working toward then getting even more deployed and then eventually we'll get to growing capital and utilizing the warehouse as it really was fully -- really maximize its full potential. but to answer your question specifically to date in the third quarter and so far in the fourth quarter we have not drawn upon the warehouse line because we have been keeping our existing capital and balance sheet as fully invested as possible.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
great. and last question. jamie could you talk about the competitive market out there or discussions with borrowers? are they pushing back more on libor floors? are there other -- are competitors bending in other places on underwriting? if you could maybe give us an update on the competitive landscape and what you're seeing in the marketplace. thank you.
jamie henderson -- chief executive officer chief investment officer and director
sure. thank you stephen. i think it feels really good. there is a little blip in q3 i think the industry was adjusting to the decrease in treasury yields. fourth quarter as i mentioned in my prepared remarks the pipeline feels great. overall pipeline year-over-year is better than it ever has been. a lot of that has been the result of us effectuating our strategy of building out a broader regional presence and partnering more closely with david roth's equity team. so team flow feels really good i think the team has done an exceptional job of building in libor floors during a time when nobody really felt like they needed that structure and that's showing up demonstrably in our earnings and i think that's just a testament to kind of our credit-first approach and the rigor whereby we approach lending. borrowers are more alert to it now. we're still getting them. and i think overall structure feels really good. don't really see kind of masked situation on structure returns. so i think it feels pretty good. i think real estate fundamentals still feel darn good given the long expansion.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
right. thanks for the commentary there. appreciate it.
jamie henderson -- chief executive officer chief investment officer and director
thanks to you.
operator
our next question comes from steve delaney with jmp securities.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
good morning everyone, and jamie i would echo steven's comments about congrats to you. probably no better way to step aside then with the stock up 18% this year. and bryan look forward to having the opportunity to meet you soon. so turning to q&a. tae-sik the new slide or the new presentation on libor sensitivity was very welcomed. so as you mentioned i think we're sitting here today $176 million. so i know numbers and the way floors weighted averages and all move but would it be reasonable to think that of the down -- the $0.08 benefit from down $0.50 that essentially we are -- approximately have already with libor today we're realizing roughly half of that benefit. so for us and annually maybe $0.01 per quarter. and is the libor forecast part of why you and jamie are suggesting that fourth quarter is going to be improved over third quarter?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thanks for your question, that's exactly right. i think i mentioned in our comments that we do expect fourth quarter earnings to exceed those of third quarter. and i think part of the reason for that is the impact of libor that we've already experienced. so the chart that we show on page five of the earnings presentation you can see that that really shows the changes from libor from the september 30 spot rate which was around 2%. so we've already experienced plus or minus 25 basis point change in libor. so part of our fourth quarter estimate is based upon the drop in libor and the positive impact that we get from our libor floors.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
got it, and then turning to the dividend. i appreciate the comparison of dividends paid to cumulative core just assuming -- you've already declared your fourth quarter dividend flat. if -- well one we ask you this do you assume that do you -- at this point that you will have met with your dividends through the fourth quarter of what $1.20 $1.32 whatever. would you assume that you have met your requirement with respect to distributing taxable income? and maybe -- and if not there's a couple of ways to deal with that obviously because you've got some time before your final return is filed. but given where the -- the dividend is at a nice healthy level and i think the worst thing a mortgage reit can do is raise their dividend too much and then be in a position they have to cut it. as we look to next year i mean would you prefer to do -- if you had an additional distribution at this point would you consider a special dividend? or would you just be as kind of patient as possible in raising the dividend rate from where we are now given the increases over the past year?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure, as you know there is a number of inputs that the board and management in its recommendation will take into consideration in terms of setting the dividend. certainly as you mentioned stability and growth of the dividend is a key factor. tax requirements being a reit is also another important factor. future forecast of our earnings and our ability to deliver returns is certainly a factor. and then there's obviously a myriad of other considerations to consider as well. so to answer really your question for right now i think from a tax perspective we're in good shape. as you said this is not a year-by-year test there are other ways to manage the reit distribution requirements and we have obviously fully met them. i think we also had previously described the fact that we do have if you want to call it some undistributed taxable earnings that we have not paid out in the form of dividends. some of that came about as for example the result of income that we derived when we sold a long time ago a few years ago our fannie mae freddie mac mortgage...
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
agency business yes.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
agency business, and we had a gain there. we're able to manage that we do pay some excise tax because of that and that is obviously one of the reasons we do have a tax expense line in our income statement. so we are able to manage that very well and we'll certainly take that in consideration. and then really -- finally your question about a special dividend certainly that's another consideration and another better option that we can follow. i know some of the other companies in our space and some of the other companies in the reit world have done that as well. and so certainly that's something else we can consider. i would say we have looked at this question very carefully the board has obviously looked at this question very carefully in setting this quarter's dividend as well as the prior dividends throughout the year. and we'll continue to closely monitor it. but right now i don't think i can really give you any sort of future outlook on what our dividends will hold -- be just given just a number of considerations that we need to think about.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
all right, well we'll watch core eps and to the extent that keeps going up i think that will give us comfort on the dividend.thanks for your comments. stacey.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from jade rahmani with kbw.
ryan tomasello -- kbw, inc -- analyst
good morning everyone, this is actually ryan tomasello on for jade. just was hoping you can talk about where you're seeing incremental levered returns currently across the pipeline and on a go-forward basis, just trying to understand how you're thinking about the confluence of factors of these recent rate cuts potential additional rate cuts coupled with what seems to be still ongoing spread compression the libor floor as you laid out. just in general if you think that low double-digit irrs are still achievable on a go-forward basis for this business particularly as the libor floors inevitably roll off with repayments?
jamie henderson -- chief executive officer chief investment officer and director
ryan this is jamie, i guess i'd start by saying we've been really deliberate in creating a business model that's focused on the mid-market, and a lot of that has to do with infrastructure and having people on the ground all over the country. and it gives us a much broader top of the funnel and we operate in kind of that medium-sized loan space plus or minus $40 million to $50 million, we did see a little bit of spread compression in the midst of -- kind of at the outset of q3. but i've been very happy to see that that feels like it's slowed down and even has widened a little bit. so feel pretty good about where spreads are. not terribly concerned about the index to tell you the truth. i think the team has done a great job of structuring around that. the -- as we've stated many times kind of current levered roes are still in the low double digits. so feel good about where the business sits today we feel good about our balance sheet and feel good about the loans that we're able to source in the mid-market space. i think the large loan space is experiencing a lot of pressure or more pressure on spreads. so really happy about the business model that we've adopted.
ryan tomasello -- kbw, inc -- analyst
that's really helpful, and then i guess on the overall pipeline of loans that you're seeing and what's already closed. can you give us some color on what types of loans those are in terms of geography property type spreads? i guess just wondering how that fits in the period with your prior comments on leverage returns.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure, ryan this is tae-sik. in terms of characteristics of the loans that we've closed so far again i think they're very consistent with our history and our portfolio. so if you look at page four of our earnings deck we don't expect those types of metrics to materially change from what we have, i think the other good news is that as jamie mentioned the loans that we closed so far again in terms of their expected roes on a levered basis again continue to be very consistent with our overall returns. and again based upon what we've seen so far i think one of the benefits that we've always talked about before is because we have a relatively smaller balance sheet that we want to obviously keep as fully invested as possible we don't need to go out and chase market rate deals and we can be a little bit more selective in the type of deals that we do. and so i think that selectivity both in terms of credit as well as portfolio construction as well as returns remain very consistent with our existing portfolio.
ryan tomasello -- kbw, inc -- analyst
and just lastly it looks like there were 2 loan modifications in the quarter on 2 of your condo mezzanine loans 1 in new york and 1 in hawaii, so i just was hoping you can give us some color on what's going on there how are those borrower business plans performing. are you expecting a full payoff? or is it possible we should -- we could see some sort of impairment on those loans pending their performance?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
well again we certainly don't expect any impairments on any of our loans including the 2 that you mentioned. the hawaii loan we did extend out the maturity on that loan as you could probably tell. i think that is -- we feel a very good loan, we wanted to give the borrower a little bit more time to execute the refinancing of that asset. that is in process. and so as i mentioned i think stephen laws asked a question about what we expect on the repayments of some of the loans that are coming up in the first half of 2020. and so we do expect that hawaii loan to repay so that's on or about the now new stated maturity date of march 2020. with respect to the new york loan, this was really in relation to a bit of a change in the mix of units that the developer is building. we felt it was the right decision to make to really meet the different needs of the market than what was originally envisioned. so that was really the primary reason for the change in that loan itself. that loan doesn't mature until may 2021. so it's much too early to give any sort of insight as to whether that loan will pay on or about its maturity. but certainly we don't see impairment on either of those events.
ryan tomasello -- kbw, inc -- analyst
that's really helpful color tae-sik. i may be pushing a bit too much here but can you say what the underwritten sell off value per square footage of that new york condo loan and perhaps for the overall book?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
again i think we're careful not to give too specifics on the business lines of these units. we do want to be very respectful of our borrowers and their business plans. certainly we do a very in-depth analysis of the market itself. we do a very in-depth analysis of our ltv. jamie did you want to add some comments?
jamie henderson -- chief executive officer chief investment officer and director
sure, ryan that's actually -- that's a very good question, and i think the way i'll answer that is we've been very systematic in avoiding some of the major metros luxury and ultra-lux condo projects, we think there is a material risk in that sector. and there is probably the opportunity for a pretty material reset. at which point maybe we'll be interested. so i can tell you what we haven't done. and i'll also tell you that in a lot of these markets there is very very significant demand for kind of middle of the road product as i'd say, so we've been really systematic in avoiding the high end and feel really good about every project that we've elected to loan on.
ryan tomasello -- kbw, inc -- analyst
thanks for all that color
operator
our next question comes from rick shane with jpmorgan.
richard shane -- j.p. morgan. -- analyst
guys, thanks for taking my questions in and jamie we wish you the very best as you move on to what's next in your career. it's been a pleasure getting to know you over the years. just interesting context you had a peer company report last night and i would describe that company took a more cautious defensive outlook, i'm curious where you guys are seeing relative value and opportunity. and i do notice that if you compare sort of the portfolio originations this quarter versus the overall mix it seems like you guys are shifting to more defensive asset classes as well. is that just a one quarter thing? or is that something that's really more tactical?
jamie henderson -- chief executive officer chief investment officer and director
so rick thank you for your kind words., and i guess i'll start to address your question on the portfolio mix portfolio composition. so one of the tremendous strengths of acre is the fact that every deal goes to a global investment committee and has over 300 years of professional real estate experience on it. that's both debt and equity and credit. so it is not an easy hurdle to clear it, there's -- every one of us on that committee have transacted many billions of dollars and pretty much every asset class in most major markets. so there's a lot of very granular street-level knowledge and asset class knowledge on that committee. i'll say we have been really deliberate in even kind of increasing the level of rigor over the past several quarters. and i think our portfolio composition reflects that. we've been pretty conservative throughout our history and i would say we've gotten slightly more conservative over the last several quarters. so i'm not saying that every single deal has been like a scientific add to the portfolio but i think the level of rigor is extremely high.
richard shane -- j.p. morgan. -- analyst
okay, thank you.

thank you veronica. good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. as you may have seen this morning we announced that i will be stepping down as ceo of acre on december 5. but i am continuing in my position as a director on the board. in addition i will remain at ares through the end of this year. this is a bittersweet decision for me but one that is in the best interest of my family. in addition i feel that i'm leaving the company in an outstanding position with a board with extensive experience led by bill benjamin and a deep and highly capable management team led by our president david roth tae-sik yoon; and j.b gerber our head of originations. i also think very highly of bryan donohoe our new ceo and i can say with great conviction that he will do an excellent job leading acre in this next chapter of growth. i'm very proud of all that our team has accomplished together over the last several years. we have executed on our strategic plan to expand our platform across the u.s. with new offices augment our talent improve our origination capabilities and broaden our product offering. these initiatives have enabled us to remain more fully invested with loans that generate attractive risk-adjusted returns.
as a result we have collectively improved our profitability and materially increased shareholder value. in addition we have increased our quarterly dividend 4x since the beginning of 2018 for a total increase of 22%. and we are very well positioned to exceed 100% core earnings coverage of our dividend for the fourth consecutive year. i would like to express my gratitude to the entire team and to all of our shareholders and constituents for their support and i look forward to continuing to contribute to the future success of acre as a director for the foreseeable future. let me now turn to our third quarter results. as you can see from our earnings results this morning the company continues to generate strong earnings with healthy investment activity and a well-positioned balance sheet. during the third quarter we generated gaap and core earnings of $0.31 and $0.34 per share respectively. and as tae-sik will describe the fourth quarter looks potentially better from an earnings standpoint. during the third quarter we originated 5 new loan commitments totaling $193 million. since quarter end we have closed an additional $126 million with 3 loans which brings our year-to-date commitments to $652 million a 38% increase from the same period in 2018.
consistent with our current portfolio the new loans were all senior floating rate diversified across sectors and regions with anticipated gross levered returns in the low double digits. we're continuing to broaden our funnel of new investment opportunities. the amount that we are currently reviewing and have quoted or are in more advanced stages has increased over 30% versus the same period in 2018. at the same time we are remaining highly selective closing less than 5% of the transactions that we reviewed year-to-date. looking ahead our forward pipeline reflects our focus on finding the best relative value across property types and products. we have executed term sheets on approximately $300 million of additional commitments that are expected to close in the fourth quarter and the pipeline behind those loans is deep. as a result of our strong deployment activity in the third and fourth quarters to date we currently expect our fourth quarter eps to be higher than our third quarter.
let me now turn the call over to tae-sik to discuss our third quarter results and forward outlook in more detail.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
terrific. thank you jamie and good morning everyone. earlier today we reported gaap net income of $9 million or $0.31 per common share and core earnings of $9.7 million or $0.34 per common share for the third quarter of 2019. so this brings us -- our total core earnings for the first nine months of the year to $1.04 per common share in excess of the $0.99 per common share that we have paid in dividends for the comparable period. as jamie mentioned in the third quarter we closed 5 new senior floating rate loans totaling $193 million in new commitments. total fundings for the quarter were $169 million. as of september 30 the loan portfolio included 47 loans with an outstanding principal balance of $1.5 billion up 3% from the second quarter of 2019. credit quality continues to remain stable with no impairments and our portfolio weighted average unlevered effective yield of 6.9%. turning to our balance sheet. our leverage remained consistent with a debt-to-equity ratio of 2.9x. this is in line with our target given that 96% of our loans are senior positions. let me now spend some time this morning discussing our unique portfolio positioning given the current decline in the interest rate environment. as we have noted in the past our portfolio has historically benefited from rising interest rates given that 97% of our loan portfolio is floating rate.
at the same time however we have leveraged our direct origination capabilities and deep sponsor relationships to structure loans that provides protection against declining interest rates. to this end we have purposely built-in libor floors on almost all of our loans. more precisely at the end of the third quarter 92% of our loan portfolio consisted of floating rate loans with built-in libor floors averaging about 1.7%. and in addition 3% of our loans are fixed rate. this means that overall 95% of our loans have some level of protection against declining libor. and in fact currently based on libor of 1.77% more than 50% of our loans have libor floors that are either in the money or are fixed rate. in contrast for our liabilities while we are careful to match on our interest rate risk utilizing 100% floating rate debt. so in other words all $1.2 billion of our debt shown on our balance sheet is floating rate and only $56 million or less than 5% of outstanding principal have we agreed to provide libor floors. overall what this means is that in a declining interest rate environment our interest income is well protected by the fact that 95% of our loans have libor floors or a fixed rate.
at the same time in a declining interest rate environment as 100% of our liabilities are floating rate but with less than 5% having libor floors we expect to realize 95% of the benefits of lower interest expense. as a result as you can see on page five of our third quarter 2019 earnings presentation on a pro forma basis of our balance sheet as of september 30 2019 including our assets and liabilities we believe that our net income would increase should libor either fall or rise. although it has changed over time particularly as our loans paid off. based on our current portfolio and balance sheet construction it's a unique heads we win tails we win situation with respect to changes in libor. now let me touch on repayment activity. in the third quarter $119 million of loans repaid bringing repayments for the first 3 quarters of the year to $367 million. however as we indicated in our last earnings call we are expecting a material increase in repayments in the fourth quarter. in conclusion as jamie mentioned based on improving investment activity early in the fourth quarter and our portfolio and balance sheet construction with respect to libor we currently expect that our fourth quarter earnings will exceed those of our third quarter. this clearly gives us confidence that we'll be more than cover our full year dividend for 2019 to the core earnings for the fourth consecutive year.
and with that i will now turn the call over to bill benjamin for some closing remarks.
bill benjamin -- director, chairman of the board

thank you. [operator instructions] the first question comes from doug harter with credit suisse. please go ahead.
doug harter -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks, brian. hey, i guess, now that you've been there in your seat a couple of months. can i guess, can you just talk about, kind of, what kind of drove you to take this role? and what kind of how you think you can leverage the ares platform better to kind of continue to achieve the results that you're looking for?
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
sure. in terms of the first part of your question, what attracted me to ares is, i think the overall platform really speaks for itself. the breadth of product offerings and the team members that do the work day-to-day is as impressive as you can find. i think specifically to the real estate space, having the synergies that exist between the debt and equity business position us very well, both to find unique opportunities and to execute on them judiciously. i think in terms of the growth path, and david roth and i speak about this on a daily basis, we think there's some low-hanging fruit in terms of the joint execution of the business plan between debt and equity. and i think that will specifically benefit the acre platform.
doug harter -- credit suisse -- analyst
i guess, on that, i mean, are you would you look to add equity to the acre business or anything that kind of has a longer duration than the current portfolio? or is that other ways to kind of leverage the equity business?
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
yes, i think it's more the mindset and the approach to the business. i think from an underwriting perspective, we focus a great deal on the basis of the assets that we're financing. there's no intent to get into the equity business. i think our colleagues there do a great job. and we're going to maintain a disciplined approach to the debt business itself. we do think that there may be some opportunity in the future to find longer-duration assets that should be attractive both from an roe perspective and otherwise. so really, i would think about it as specifically day-to-day underwriting help. specific examples, we're working on a transaction now that is two doors down from an asset that our equity fund has underwritten and provided a bit on. so that's the type of synergy that i'm referencing.
doug harter -- credit suisse -- analyst
right, thank you, brian.

the next question will come from steve delaney with jmp securities. please go ahead.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
good morning, and thank you for taking the question. we noticed that in the 4q originations that you had two industrial loans totaling $80 million and that four loans and in industrial for all of 2019. so you're now up to 7%. could you just comment on those opportunities? it looks like one was florida. one was california. and also, everybody's talked about industrial over the last several years, but they say, yes, we'd love it, but we can't find any. maybe comment on what ares did differently in 2019 to find some attractive industrial loans?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. good morning steve, this is tae. i'll tell you, clearly, industrial is a sector that we do focus quite heavily on. and as bryan mentioned, it is certainly something on the equity side of the business that we have a great deal of expertise, both in the u.s. and in europe. and it is a sector that we have focused on. i think it has taken us a little bit longer on the debt side to get more exposure because of what we discussed before. there's a bit of a binary nature to the business. it's either fully stabilized, very institutional, long-term debt, long-term lease situation or it's one where it's highly, highly transitional right at the very beginning stages or ground-up development. and so there are, i would say, a little bit more of a limited opportunity set. nonetheless, this is a sector that our overall real estate team is very focused on. and i think one of the benefits that we're seeing within the debt side is we're starting to see greater deal flow. and i think what you saw in 2019, in particular, fourth quarter, is a reflection of that.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. okay. well, that's helpful. and on the dividend policy, should we think about that? you guys have ramped up your earnings nicely contribute part of that we attribute to maybe the ares warehouse. but going forward, now that you're sort of at the level and the stock has responded, are you thinking about your dividend is more of an annual decision? or will it still be more ad-hoc as you go through the year?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. great question. i think it is a longer-term decision. we do evaluate it quarter-to-quarter. however, as we've talked about, we do think of our annual earnings target, our annual production, our annual objectives on a longer-term basis than quarter-to-quarter. but having said all that, the dividend is reviewed by the board and it's certainly reviewed by the management team as well on a quarter-to-quarter basis. i think, historically, we have, particularly in the first quarter, look to our dividend and make sure that we're very comfortable with it. i think our track record more or less speaks for itself. we've had four consecutive years where we have either earned or outearned our dividend in terms of core earnings, and that is certainly something we intend to continue. and so i don't think anyone should read too much into whether we did or did not raise the dividend this quarter. it will continue to be evaluated on, i would say, a rolling 12-month basis, not on a calendar 12 calender year 12-month basis. but we do take a longer-term approach to setting the dividend. obviously, we want to make sure our dividends are both growing and stable and consistent and that we continue to fully earn or meet our dividend.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
got it. that's helpful, especially your comment about rolling 12-month outlook.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer

the next question is from jade rahmani with kbw.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
thanks very much. with the weighted average remaining life of 1.6 years on the portfolio is that on a fully extended basis? and can the company redeploy capital at similar return levels, about 1.5 years from now and those loans have fully repaid?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure, good morning, jade. this is tae-sik. i think our remaining weighted average life has remained very consistent over the last couple of years. it's always been for the senior portfolio, in particular, anywhere from 1.5 to two years. so when we originate a loan, if you want to call it, the typical loan is a three-year loan with some extensions that are built in. and typically, those extensions have certain tests that need to be met. so when we talk about the weighted average life, we're talking to the initial maturity, not the extended maturity really for that reason. but again, this is nothing new for us. this is very purposeful in the type of loans that we're pursuing. as we mentioned, we really like the shorter-term florida loans because it allows us to sort of position our portfolio for a little bit more of a near-term outlook on the macro economy. so for example, you see, today, we have virtually no retail exposure. if we had a legacy portfolio that was five years or seven years older, you'd probably see a lot more retail than what you see today.
so i think that's a great real-time example of how a shorter-term floating rate portfolio allows us to continue to tailor our portfolio for more current market conditions. but to answer your question, no, i think we feel very comfortable that we'll continue to originate. we'll continue to out originate our repayments, and we're very cognizant of when repayments are coming up. we put in place that ares warehouse line to help better manage the timing of repayments and new originations, so we feel very comfortable that we will be able to manage the repayments that are coming up and be able to manage our returns and roes.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
okay. and do you feel that levered returns are currently consistent with the last couple of quarters?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
we think so. yes.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
yes, i think that they have been, i think, obviously, as we recognize in our at the beginning of the call, we recognize where the market is and the pressures that do exist. we've been able to find pockets of assets that hit our roes at similar risk profile to that, which we've targeted previously. and we're also benefiting from more efficient capital on our liability side of the balance sheet.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
okay, thanks very much. the in the repayments, you mentioned that maturity dates were pushed out each with specific reasons. first of all, on the schedule that you showed in the third quarter supplemental, there weren't any 2019 maturity date. so i assume that's the fully extended maturity date. but can you give color on what pushed out each maturity extension, loan modification? and i think in addition, the 10-k disclosed that in november, acre did modify an $11 million loan on residential property in california and increased the interest rate. so if you could comment on that as well.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure, absolutely. so jade, when you look at the business of acre, we're obviously focused on lending against quality assets that are generally undergoing some sort of business transition, where the owner, borrower, developer, manager is repositioning the asset so that they can enhance cash flow. they can enhance occupancy. they can grow rents. and so what we really like about our business plan is that over the course of exiting that business plan, they actually enhance cash flow and also enhance value so that we get delevered from our perspective over the execution of that business plan. noting all that, business plans do take sometimes different schedules than originally planned. so business plan sometimes get executed faster. sometimes business plans get executed longer. and generally, when we find ourselves in a situation where we're being asked to modify or extend a alone, again, we think of that as very ordinary course of business. again, as a transitional lender, this is what it's about, right? it's about underwriting business plan execution. and in some cases and again, relatively limited, but in some cases, we do expect, as part of our ordinary course of business to modify and extend loans.
specifically, with respect to the one loan that you pointed out, where we did modify the loan. i think that's a great example of one where not only are we modifying the loan and extending a loan, but those are situations where we can, for example, ask for fees, we can ask for higher rates of interest. so these modifications don't come for free, if you want to call it that. and in addition, and again, i won't speak specifically to any particular loans, just given the sensitivity and any specific loans itself, we do also seek to get, in some cases, additional collateral, additional deposits, additional escrows, additional protection mechanisms. so i think we're very conscious of buttressing and further buttressing] our security position in these type of situations where there are either extensions or modifications.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
and that california loan, it's characterized as residential? is it multi family? or is it something else?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
no. i think this is one loan that we've spoken of before, it is not multifamily. it is a single-family residential development. it's our only exposure to that sector. but i think we've talked about this before.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
it's for sale housing?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
correct.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
okay. so what's going on with the project?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
well, again, i what we generally don't do is talk specifically about any individual project on a public call like this. but as i said, projects do take longer. we don't think there is an impact on collateral value. we don't certainly think there's an impairment. as i mentioned, we think this is ordinary words of business to extend and modify certain loans. in this situation, in particular, we were able to get some better economics. and in particular, we were able to get additional collateral to, again, further buttress our collateral position.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
okay. also wanted to ask about you did mention potential other asset classes that would include longer duration. what are your thoughts about the freddie mac k series program and it's buying b pieces within that program could be attractive?
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
that specifically hasn't been a focus of ours recently. i think what i'd say is the yields around a lot of those types of securities have been compressed. and we find that our skill set and our yields that we're targeting are better matched up to bespoke originations on direct real estate rather than in a pooled format. we, obviously, given the breadth of the platform and the different asset classes that we either invest in or tangentially cover, we're aware of it. we pay attention to what goes on both in the k series type product and cmbs generally. right now, we don't find it all that compelling.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
okay. do are there questions in the queue afternoon. otherwise, i'll get back in the queue.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yes, there are a couple of other persons on the call? yes.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
okay. thanks.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, jade

the next question is from stephen laws with raymond james. please go ahead.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
good morning, i guess, to follow-up a little on jade's lot of questioning. but tae, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that no prepayments year-to-date. from the table in the supplement, it looks like i think five loans were february maturities this month, another, like a condo residential loan mesmo next month. can you talk about discussions with those borrowers? do you expect those prepayments to occur between now and quarter end? have they extended? or kind of how should we think about the repayments coming here in the next month or two as we build our model out?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. no, absolutely. i think you're right. i think there are two loans with a february 2020 maturity date and then three other loans with a march 2020 maturity date. again, i think each situation is pretty different and unique. there isn't any sort of commonality, if you want to call it that, with these upcoming maturities. i would certainly say that our expectation today is that most will pay off in accordance with the expected maturities that you see here. i would also tell you that we're working on some further extensions of some of the loans as well. and again, i think in connection with those further extensions, i think we view this again as pretty much ordinary course of business. but i think in connection with these further extensions, we will be seeking better economics and better structure to protect us during this extended period. but i do think we'll see some repayments, and we'll see some extensions, combination of the two.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
and can you maybe talk a little bit about that, just to pick on two random loans, your two largest multifamily loans. loan one matures this month. it's at l plus 4 75. loan two, you originated late few months ago at l plus 2 85. when you do an extension of one of these loans, do you keep the same terms they get better? is it negotiated somewhere between the existing rate and market rate? kind of can you give us any color on how that conversation goes and what adjustments to the interest income result from that?
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
yes, i don't think there's a general rule. obviously, wish there was. i think each of them is negotiated based on the outstanding principal balance of the loan relative to what we feel the collateral value is. obviously, we feel that we're well secured in each of the situations. and we do approach each of these situations opportunistically, right? as tae-sik mentioned, we from a credit standpoint, want to effectuate a deleveraging of our position, one way or the other, either through a pay down or through additional collateral. and then we're opportunistic with respect to economics as well. so we're going to capitalize on that with respect to fees. obviously, from an irr perspective, a paydown has a similar effect. and in certain instances, we will increase the rate. in most instances, this is a short-term extension. but across the board, we feel we're well secured and improving our position materially through the changes and through the extension.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
great. and to follow-up on an earlier question, i don't remember it was doug or steve joining that ask but from a capital standpoint, just did a secondary offering, you've got an atm, which i don't think you've been very active with, please correct me if i'm wrong. and then you've got a financing facility that sits at the parent that's at your disposable able if you need to fund loans ahead of putting them in your portfolio. so how much can you leverage the ares platform? what type of origination volume would you like to see? or how should we think about growing the portfolio over the course of the year as far as your access to additional capital as well as redeploying the repayments that come in?
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
i'll touch on it briefly, and then i'll let tae-sik expand upon it. but i think real estate credit is a natural extension of everything else that goes on within the ares business lines. and given david roth's arrival last year and the team members that we have in place, we feel we're well positioned to span the origination capacity in-house. and there's various levers we can pull to do that. the pipeline, obviously, what we've a record first quarter based on commitments to date. and we have, as we indicated in our prepared remarks, a strong pipeline behind those commitments. and we feel we have as much transparency into the offensive side of our business as we've had in quite some time. i think with respect to repayments, we manage them as best we can. but certain parts of that are outside of our control. we're, as we said, opportunistically working with borrowers to extend certain credits and reposition those assets in our favor. with respect to the rest of the year, i think we're going to continue to focus on expanding our origination footprint. as we indicated in our remarks as well, i think increasing our average loan size will be very beneficial to us as we scale the platform. we can do more with less in that regard. tae-sik, i don't know if you want to add anything further there?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. maybe just to add just a couple of things. so we did $777 million in 2019. stephen, as you said, we've raised more capital. we have atm. we have the ares warehouse line. we have more financing capacity as well. so i think we set ourselves up very well, we think, for a growing accretive business and we're hoping to take advantage of that. so in addition to those incremental liquidity mechanisms, as brian mentioned in his remarks, we continue to expand our team. we continue to add offices. we continue to further leverage the ares platform, thanks to david and everyone else on the team. so i think we're absolutely positioning ourselves for growing origination volume, but at the same time, fully maintaining our credit discipline. and that's why in response to the prior question of, do we expect repayments to be an issue going forward? i think we've been able to imagine in the past. i think it will be an increasing volume of repayments going forward, just given our higher our higher loan count today. but in addition to all that, with increased loan size, i do feel very comfortable that we'll be able to continue to out originate our deployment, our repayments and that we will continue to be able to make sure that we remain as fully invested as we can.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
great. appreciate it color. thanks tae-sik and bryan donohoe. appreciate it.

the next question is from rick shane with jpmorgan.
rick shane -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. this afternoon or this morning. first of all, we really do appreciate the granularity ation the floors. it's very helpful. tae-sik, i have one sort of technical question for you. when we look at the ares line and loans on that line, does that count as an unfunded commitment for the reit? and does it actually have a cecl reserve?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
good morning right now. thanks for your question. so when a loan is placed under the ares warehouse line, there's nothing recorded on acre's books. so it's not recorded as a commitment. it's not there's no cecl reserve because acre has the option, but not the obligation to purchase the loan from the ares vehicle. so because of that, there's no reflection on the acre balance sheet of any loans that are on the ares warehouse line until and unless, acre actually makes that purchase. and once acre does make that purchase, it will certainly be reflected both in terms of outstanding balance, carrying value, commitment as well as cecl reserve but only when it's brought on to acre's balance sheet.
rick shane -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. okay. that's helpful. and then, brian, i wanted to talk a little bit. your final comments were about the opportunity to scale this business. and for historical reason, acre has lacked access to the capital markets lack the ability to scale. and it is, in fact, substantially smaller than several of its peers, which were, i guess, incubated longer before going public. when you look at the opportunity, and the fact that acre has returned to the capital markets, what is the opportunity to enhance roe in terms of basis points? and how much larger do you think you need to be in order to realize that?
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
it's a good question. and i guess, i'd say i think there's not necessarily a true benchmark that we have to attain in order to increase our efficiency of capital. we do i think based on the raise in january and the positioning of the platform through the origination pipeline, we feel pretty comfortable that we're already benefiting from the scale, both from the ares name. and i think it becomes reflected in our borrowing cost, which we've managed down appropriately over the last quarter and before. there's not a target size for the platform. i think the disciplined approach that the firm has taken to capital raising in the past, reflected in the patience of trading above book for such a long period of time before going to the market. i think we're going to continue to employ that same discipline. but the more transparency we have vis-a-vis our origination pipeline, the more comfortable we'll be accessing various parts of the capital structure.
rick shane -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. and tae-sik, i'll put that same question to you. when we look at the p&l, is the opportunity for scale in the g&a expense and the professional fees, is that we're because again, obviously, one of the challenges for externally managed vehicles, as historically, there is less expense leverage. is that where we would see it? and how would you expect those expenses to grow in relation to portfolio growth?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. rich, it's a great question. and i think we've discussed this a bit before. and really, i think terrific part of our business model is that our g&a expenses are largely fixed in terms of the dollar amount. so our audit costs, our listing fees or dino insurance, some of those are the bigger line items. so with this recent $73 million equity offering, which increased our capital base by about 17% or so, we certainly wouldn't expect a 17% increase in those types of fixed expenses. in fact, i would tell you that we expect virtually no change in the fixed expenses that i just mentioned, so that really the net roe on this incremental $73 million is going to be higher than the roe that we were earning on the capital base prior to that. so i think that is going to be one of the big benefits of scale. so even if the spreads on our loans don't change, if nothing else changes other than having a bigger equity capital base, we will realize the benefits of spreading fixed expenses over a wider capital base and grow our roe and our earnings from there. the second part where i think we will benefit, again, without changing the spreads, without changing the gross revenues is that we believe we will get better financing costs with a larger portfolio, with a larger capital base. i think one of the reasons you could easily see this is we can do, for example, a larger, more diversified clo financings. we will get better rates, better structures. and i think that will, again, help our roe even if the spreads on our loans don't change.
rick shane -- jpmorgan -- analyst

so i think again, one of the big advantages of being part of the ares family is we continue to see, we think, just about all opportunities for m&a, whether it's in whether it's something brought to us or whether we see the inside track and approach potential partners and targets. and so m&a will continue to be a very viable and and very attractive opportunity for us to grow. but just like, as we mentioned, in terms of raising equity or growing the business. we're only going to do it for the right reasons, which is not simply to get bigger, but really to have an enhanced synergistic growing roe business. and so that may be a very high bar for us to hit in terms of m&a, but acquisitions and mergers is certainly something that we continue to evaluate. we continue to look at. and again, being part of the ares family, we have great access to.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
okay. just a couple of quick other ones. in terms of the reo portfolio, the hotel in westchester, the income stream has been somewhat volatile. it doesn't seem to follow a seasonal pattern. i was wondering if you could give some color on the earnings contribution we should expect? should we take the fourth quarter and annualize it? should we take the last three quarters annualize that? anything you could say on that?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. so one thing to keep in mind is that we took over ownership, sort of mid-first quarter 2019. so even 2019 itself doesn't reflect a full 12-month basis. and certainly, the first quarter of 2019 is a partial quarter. the second thing to mention in background is that hotels, where this one is located in westchester county, is a seasonal business. so third quarter, in particular, is a very slow quarter relative to second and fourth quarters, which tend to be the busier quarters because it's not a tourist hotel. this is more of a business class hotels. so there's going to be less business travel in the months of july and august, in particular. and therefore, you did see our earnings for the third quarter really be the lowest of the year. again, excluding first quarter because that was a partial quarter. so there's some seasonality. so it's hard to annualize any particular quarter. having said all that, we're very pleased with the performance of this hotel. what we saw in 2019 is that we exceeded budget. ebitda exceeded budget by about 5%. so we had shown nice year-over-year growth. we continue to outperform budget. we did finish our capex program on some of the common areas in the hotel.
and i think we saw some increased meeting traffic toward year-end because of that. and we'll continue to active manage actively manage this asset. we are not long term holders. as brian mentioned, we're not in the equity business. but i think this is a great demonstration of our capability to manage a situation like this where there was virtually no interruption between the time we were a lender versus an owner. and because we work very, very closely with and part of an integrated real estate team. we're able to take situations like this, mitigate any losses and manage this hotel. and when the right time comes to sell this asset, we will do so in a very orderly manner and hopefully be out of it.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
is the third quarter a decent proxy for the first quarter? or is 1q lighter than 3q?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
again, i would tell you that second and fourth quarters tend to be the stronger quarters. and third and first quarters tend to be the lighter quarters. i'm not trying to give you an exact comparison of first versus third. it's almost month-by-month, but it is a seasonal business.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
okay. and just lastly, on financial leverage. it was 3.1 times at year-end following the recent equity raise. we believe it's somewhere in the 2.7 times range. should we be modeling it, getting back to that three times range? and what's the long-term assumption for leverage?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
so i think we've talked about plus or minus three, so long as we maintain a strong ratio of senior loans is about our intended target and where we come out. we do vary our financing quite a bit loan-by-loan, portfolio-by-portfolio. so for example, the clo transaction that we did a couple of years ago, given the attractiveness of that type of financing being nonrecourse, being match funded and the overall terms of that structure, we did choose to go higher in leverage. i think that one was a little bit more than four to one. and in some situations, we go significantly less than three to one so it is a loan by loan determination. but really our overall business roe model is predicated upon maintaining about a 3:1 ratio. so being at 3:1 at year-end, we thought was a very good level for us.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
okay. thanks very much for taking the questions.

good morning, and welcome to the ares commercial real estate corporation's conference call to discuss the company's fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial results. as a reminder, this conference is being recorded on february 20, 2020.
i will now turn the call over to veroinca mayer from investor relations. please go ahead.
carl drake -- partner, head of public investor relations and communications
thank you, chad. good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call. i am joined today by our new ceo, bryan donohoe; david roth, our president; and tai-sik, our cfo. in addition to our press release and the 10-k that we filed with the sec we have posted an earnings presentation under the investor resources section of our website at www.arescre.com. before we begin, i want to remind everyone that comments made during the course of this conference call and webcast and the accompanying documents contain forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties. many of these forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as anticipates, believes, expects, intends, will, should, may and similar expressions. these forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations of market conditions and management's judgment.

and now i will turn the call over to bryan donohoe.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
thanks, veronica, and good morning, everyone. i'm happy to be speaking with you today, and i look forward to getting to know more of you in the weeks and months ahead. i want to start with a few highlights of 2019 and then walk through our strategic priorities for 2020. as you saw in our earnings release this morning, we ended a successful 2019 on a high note with a strong fourth quarter. gaap net income was $0.33 per share for the quarter and $1.28 per share for the full year. with respect to core earnings, we generated $0.37 per share for the fourth quarter and $1.41 per share for the full year. earnings benefited from strong investment activity throughout the year at attractive spreads. throughout 2019, we originated $777 million of commitments, a 28% increase year-over-year. we've increased our average loan size from $33 million in 2018 to $43 million in 2019, and we expect this trend to continue. by increasing our average loan size, we expect to be able to continue to generate our target roes and more efficiently deploy our capital. regarding the dividend, we paid out $1.32 per share, up $0.16 from 2018. and this marks the fourth consecutive year, we have fully covered our dividend from core earnings.
as we look forward, we see u.s. commercial real estate fundamentals remaining favorable, due in large part to the continued strength of the overall economy as well as measured supply and demand dynamics. we continue to see a tight labor market and a healthy consumer, while we are exercising appropriate caution due to the duration of the economic cycle as well as the possibility of certain event-driven risks. as a result of this, our portfolio is purposefully constructed to be diversified across asset classes and regions, with investments in 17 states. we recognize that competition for quality loans remains strong, but we continue to find attractive situational relative value in many markets and property segments. our national origination platform now includes offices in los angeles, san francisco, chicago, atlanta, denver and new york, providing us with a growing number of opportunities and allowing us to remain highly selective.
additionally, as the ares real estate platform has continued to scale, we've become a more attractive partner to our target borrowers and brokers who appreciate that we can provide a broader array of capital solutions. as the number of opportunities we review continues to grow, we're remaining very disciplined with a strong focus on credit quality and loan structure. since the first of the year, we've executed $238 million in commitments, a record for acre in the first quarter, with time still left on the calendar. we're pleased to have a strong and building pipeline of investment opportunities behind these commitments, and we're seeing robust activity in each of our target markets. based on this activity, along with our strong forward-looking investment pipeline, we elect to raise $73 million in common equity during the month of january at an accretive basis of 108% of book. this transaction increased our book value by $0.15 per share from $14.77 per share to $14.92. the performance of the existing portfolio remains sound with no impairments. the current composition of our portfolio reflects our continued emphasis on quality. 100% of the assets are investments we originated in 2019 were structured as senior mortgage loans.
and the total senior loan composition of our portfolio is 96%. in terms of our strategic initiatives for 2020, i just want to highlight a few items: first, we are going to continue to leverage the resources of the ares management platform and our partners on the real estate equity team to create more opportunities for origination. these same synergies also allow us to efficiently evaluate each prospective credit. we're going to maintain a rigorous diligence and underwriting process with specific attention paid to loan structure and real estate quality. we are going to continue to have a disciplined approach to capital efficiency in an effort to maintain high levels of invested capital and maximize profitability. we are focused on optimizing our borrowing costs and overall expense load. and lastly, we expect these initiatives will give us the opportunity to further scale our business accretively.
with that, i'm going to hand over the call to tae-sik to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results in more detail.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
great. thank you, bryan, and good morning, everyone. earlier today, we reported gaap net income of $9.7 million or $0.33 per share and core earnings of $10.7 million or $0.37 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019. for full year 2019, gaap net income was $37 million or $1.28 per share, and core earnings were $40.6 million or $1.41 per share. in the fourth quarter, we closed six new loans totaling $250 million in commitments. consistent with our current portfolio, all six new loans are senior positions that are floating rates of interest income and are diversified across sectors and regions. total fundings for the fourth quarter were $260 million, which includes initial fundings of $205 million on the six new loans and $55 million on the prior existing loans. for the year, we closed 18 new loans in 2019, totaling $777 million in commitments and made fundings, totaling $680 million. since year-end, we have closed four new loans, totaling $238 million in commitments so far in the first quarter of 2020. of these loans, a $132 million loan that was originated in the ares warehouse in the fourth quarter of 2019, was purchased by acre in the first quarter.
we continue to view that ares warehouse as a significant competitive advantage for us that provides acre with an attractive source of liquidity and allows us to better match the timing of new loan originations and loan repayments. as of december 31, our loan portfolio included 50 loans with outstanding loan commitments of $1.9 billion and an outstanding principal balance of $1.7 billion, up approximately 10% from the end of 2018. in the fourth quarter of 2019, our portfolio continued to benefit from libor floors, contributing more than $0.02 per share to our quarterly earnings. at the end of 2019, 93% of our loan portfolio consisted of floating rate loans with built-in libor floors that averaged about 1.76%. and in addition, 2% of our loans are fixed rate. this means that, overall, 95% of our loans have some level of protection against declining libor. based on libor of 1.76% at year-end 2019, 61% of our loans have libor floors that are either in the money or our fixed rate.
in contrast, at year-end 2019, although 100% of our liabilities are floating rate to match fund our assets, only about 5% of our outstanding debt were subject to libor floors. with respect to loan repayment activity in the fourth quarter, we had $115 million of loans repay, bringing total repayments for 2019 to $482 million. this was below our expectations as the maturity dates in certain loans were pushed out each for those specific reasons. with lower-than-expected repayments in 2019, we do expect higher-than-average repayment volume in the first half of 2020, although we have not received any repayments so far in the first quarter. turning to the liability side of our balance sheet. our debt-to-equity ratio was 3.1 times at year-end 2019, very much in line with our target, given that 96% of our loans are senior mortgages. since year-end, we closed a new $150 million repurchase facility with morgan stanley, which provides us an attractive financing source to further expand our product offering and this brings our total debt capacity to over $2 billion.
now let me touch upon an upcoming and an important new accounting standard, cecl, or current expected credit losses. in our 10-k filed earlier today, we disclosed an estimated range of current expected credit losses, or cecl reserve, of $4.8 million to $6.7 million, which represents approximately 25 to 35 basis points of our total loan commitments. we will continue to finalize our cecl analysis and we'll provide a more specific reserve number as well as further context and background in our subsequent filings and calls. lastly, before turning the call back over to bryan, i want to mention that our board declared a first quarter dividend of $0.33 per share, payable on april 15, 2020, to stockholders of record as of march 31, 2020.
and so with that, i will now turn the call back over to bryan.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
thanks, tae-sik. let me conclude by saying that since joining acre in december of last year, i have been incredibly impressed by our team, the strength of the platform at ares and i'm excited for where we're headed in the future. 2019 was a very good year for acre, one in which we demonstrated our ability to generate consistently strong profits and solid investment activity. going forward, we believe we have a significant opportunity to expand our market share and scale this business in a highly accretive manner for our shareholders.
with that, i'd like to ask the operator to open the line for questions. thank you.

[operator instructions] our first question today will come from steve delaney with jmp securities. please go ahead.
steven c. delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
thank you. hello everyone. nice to be on with you this afternoon. tae-sik, the four loans on non-accrual, i did not find that in the deck. i must have been -- i must have missed something. can i find it in the deck or is that something that's in the 10-q?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure, steve. thanks again for being on our earnings call. i think it is more detailed in the 10-q. however, in the deck, what you will see is in the appendix where we list all of our loans held for investment, you will see that there are four loans plus there is one senior loan under hotels that you will see that is identified with a dash effectively and a zero for unlevered effective yield. so, the reason we've [indecipherable] unlevered effective yield is because they are put on non-accrual status. and what you'll see is that it's basically made up of three loans that are backed by hotels, one backed by student housing, as i just had mentioned. and again, it's important to note that we actually did receive interest on these loans for the april payment date, but these are certainly loans that we expect to experience problems going forward on potentially meeting current debt service.
steven c. delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
got it. okay. yeah, i did glance at the list there for property types and i just -- i didn't pick up the zeros. but thank you for pointing me to that. okay. this -- obviously on the financing side, i think those of us on -- in our position as analysts, we've really gotten a crash course in the nuances of the different types of bank-provided financing, clos, or obvious as to the terms of the clo. but the concept of non-mark-to-market lending facilities versus revolving or other types of loan facilities, i'm just curious if there are only a limited number of lenders that will actually do non-mark-to-market, maybe such as your life co-lender. and when you are negotiating those types of facilities, is the cost materially higher and possibly the leverage lower on a non-mark-to-market facility?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. excellent question. and again, i think it's important to differentiate the different types of mark-to-market or non-mark-to-market types, so you're right. and i generally put them in two categories. one is that a lender can do a mark-to-market remargining of the facility based upon changes in borrowing spreads. probably, you have a loan financed with them and your loan pays l plus 350, but under different market conditions, maybe that market [indecipherable] for a similar type of loan has increased on l plus 350 to l plus 550. and in that situation, a warehouse lender could say, your loan is worth less than par and therefore we're going to remargin the loan. and our point is, we don't have that type of mark-to-market provisions in any of our facilities.
the second type of mark-to-market versions that we talk about is that if you have a deterioration in the credit of the underlying collateral -- so let's say, of a loan backed by an office building, an apartment building, and those assets in particular suffer an actual credit deterioration; so they lost a major tenant; there was a problem leasing those assets and there's a significant drop in cash flows. and so, if there's an actual credit deterioration and therefore the lender believes that the loan is worth less because the ltv has gone up, the dscr has gone down, whatever the right credit metrics are, they can then reassess the value of the loan and remargin loan in that situation. and those are common, i would say. and those are certainly the type of remargining mark-to-market provisions that we have under our various warehouse lines.
steven c. delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
right. well, it's good to know. it does not appear that all of your peers have avoided spread-based marks from the best we can tell. so, thanks for confirming that. and then, just lastly for me, things have changed, and i was wondering if you could give us an update on your repayment outlook. we used to use 30%, 35% a year, but i guess we should expect more extensions in this market. thank you.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. and maybe i can start with that, and bryan, certainly to the extent that you have other thoughts on this. but i would tell you that for our cash planning purposes, we have taken a pretty conservative viewpoint and assumed for cash planning purposes that little to know repayments will occur over the next, call it, six to eight months throughout the rest of 2020. obviously, we do have contractual maturities coming up and we are working very closely with each of the borrowers. but just given the challenges of the capital markets, we have assumed again for cash planning purposes that we do not receive any repayments. but again, i think the important thing is, we are working with each of our borrowers. we certainly expect a slowdown, but i think -- i don't think the reality is that there will be none. but i do think for cash planning purposes that it's the prudent assumption to make.
steven c. delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
okay. and i guess, if you have a multi -- yes, bryan, go ahead.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
steve, the only thing i'd add there is, with respect to -- we have a large portfolio of multi-family assets. and as -- one of the factors [phonetic] that will go into repayment velocity is the availability of replacement capital, obviously. and with respect to cash flowing multi-family assets, which comprises 25 plus percent of our portfolio, the attractiveness of the gse financings and the continued liquidity in that space may induce probably a higher repayment velocity than some other asset classes, so we'll be well served by that subset of our portfolio.
steven c. delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
i'm sure walker & dunlop would be glad to take the loan off your hands and give it to freddie or fannie. thank you both very much for your comments.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
great. thank you, steve.
operator
our next question today will come from doug harter of credit suisse. please go ahead.
douglas harter -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks. can you just help put that cash balance you have in context? what you might expect from future funding needs and just again just kind of what normal cash balances you would hold, just so we can frame that liquidity balance?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure, doug. thank you for your question. so, to maybe answer your second question first, clearly, prior to mid-march, we looked at cash as an important part of our balance sheet. however, having cash and a balance sheet meant that we weren't putting as many dollars to work in terms of our gaap earnings and our core earnings. so, our strategy was to maintain liquidity, but try to maintain as minimum of a cash balance as possible so that whenever we had cash balances, we would use to pay down our various revolving credit lines in our warehouse lines. so historically, we've tried to maintain as little cash as possible, i think like most of our peers. right now, clearly, cash is paramount and we want to make sure that we maintain a very, very sufficient level of liquidity in the form of immediate cash. at the same time, i think we want to make sure that we do maintain and we anticipate needs of cash, but that we don't overreact and put too much cash on the balance sheet and really strain both our earnings and other important aspects of the company.
so, what we have done is, we have put in place plans to raise additional liquidity on top of the $50 million of cash that we have to make sure that we will have the liquidity needs for things like future funding. and so, for future funding, for example, if you look at the total, there's about $275 million of future funding that we have. so, if you look at the difference between our commitment and our funded amount at march 31, there's about a $275 million difference. obviously, all of that is not going to become immediately called [phonetic] in the short term, plus there are different uses of that future funding. some is for continuing the progress of the investment. a lot of it is for what we call good news money in the sense that this is for tenant improvement dollars, this is for leasing commissions when new tenants -- new rent-paying tenants come on board. but we are managing both our cash position, the $50 million, additional source of liquidity. we mentioned the $20 million to $25 million that we could get from further leveraging our fl3 and our ares warehouse line. in addition to that, we have additional assets that we could look to monetize. so, we are balancing our cash position with the potential use of the capital, including what we think will be, call it, $55 million to $60 million of future funding over the course of 2020.
douglas harter -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. and then, tae-sik, if you could just talk about kind of how the four non-accrual loans kind of fit into the cecl reserves just in kind of how that was contemplated in the amount to arrive [phonetic] that?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. so, in terms of the cecl reserve, so even the four loans that were placed in non-accrual were part of our cecl reserve. just to clarify that non-accrual does not mean impairment or specific reserve, so that the four non-accrual loans were part of our overall cecl reserve. it's also important to again reiterate that the four non-accrual loans did in fact make their interest payment for the april 2020 payment date, but we believe that these four loans we identified as ones where we felt that the financial condition of the asset, the direct impact that covid-19 is having on these four borrowers and these four assets were particular, and we felt that it was the prudent thing to do to put them on non-accrual status, again despite us actually having received the cash. and so, i think that's really the genesis and background. so, again, they are included in our cecl reserve, but we thought in addition to a higher level of cecl reserve that putting it on non-accrual status was the prudent decision at this moment.
douglas harter -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks tae-sik.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, doug.

our next question today will come from rick shane of j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
richard shane -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions. and i basically have three different topics i'd like to cover. in the student lending portfolio, i'm curious how we think about the underlying equity. who are your counterparties generally? are these universities or are these more typical private sponsors?
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
in our portfolio, it's not directly on-campus affiliated with the university, so it's private owners with access to additional capital in most cases.
richard shane -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. and the non -- or, excuse me, the student loan that you have on non-accrual, is that really a function of the pending maturity?
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
that's correct. yes. there's a lot of factors, obviously, that go into that designation. what was unique about it was, obviously, some of the unknowns that we have with respect to student housing. many of our assets were performing very well year-over-year. but given the maturity of that specific asset, as tae-sik pointed out, we made the conservative and prudent decision to move it to nonaccrual.
richard shane -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. okay. that's helpful. and it certainly makes sense in light of what we're seeing. second topic, you do show in the multifamily portfolio two main maturities, they're significant. they are fully accruing. that's obviously a good sign. should we think of those two loans as a source of liquidity, given their status and the timing on them?
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
i'd say, i think overall, we view the multifamily portfolio, as i said earlier, as a potential source of liquidity. i can't comment specifically on that situation. but given the consistency of performance and the secular growth in the apartment subsector, i think we feel good about using that as a liquidity source in certain instances. but i can't really weigh in specifically on those two assets.
richard shane -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
understood. i appreciate that. i got to ask the question though.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
totally fair.
richard shane -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
last topic. on the three nonaccruals, i am curious because i think our view is that, we're moving through three stages. and the second stage is going to be largely about sponsors buffering properties for these short-term issues. on the three nonaccruals, what are the conversations you're having with the sponsors? and specifically, i'm curious, do you see these as either sponsor sort of a little bit of brinksmanship with you? do you see these as sponsors who are strategically willing to walk away because those particular properties are so underwater? or these sponsors who just may not be in a position in order to provide that buffer that i'm describing?
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
it's a good question. i think what i'd point to is, one, we've had very constructive dialogue with each of our sponsors, and we're trying to work as i think we've seen the edict from government or similar entities. i'm trying to just get through what we're seeing as the near-term liquidity crunch that we're seeing at a macro level, but specifically, as it relates to lodging and i guess, secondarily, retail assets. the conversations on these loans is no different. we've -- it's been constructive at the appropriate attachment points. we're seeing the ability of sponsors to reinvest in certain circumstances, and we're working through the unique attributes of each situation. but thematically, there's nothing that i could point to as uniform among the three assets that we're discussing here.
richard shane -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
okay, great. thank you for taking my questions and i really hope you and your families are all well.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
thank you rick.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer

our next question today will come from jade rahmani of kbw. please go ahead.
jade j. rahmani -- keefe , bruyette & woods , inc. -- analyst
thanks very much. nice to hear from all of you and hope you're all doing well. wanted to ask about the amount of cash that you are targeting to hold on the balance sheet.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. jade, thanks again for your participation and question. so as i mentioned, we want to be anticipatory of how much cash will be necessary to meet all of our uses, whether that's future funding, whether that's rebalancing any loans, whether it's for any other reason. right now, we feel we have that adequate amount of cash. having said that, we absolutely want to be anticipatory and so we have lined up a number of options to raise more additional cash, if and when necessary. obviously, we're not going to wait until the last moment in any way. but at the same time, we don't want to overreact and do things that longer-term, would not be beneficial to the company. so just to mention a few things. as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, we do have about $20 million to $25 million of additional cash that we're currently working on to free up in terms of utilizing capacity we have in fl3, which is very important, as well as our ares warehouse line.
in addition to that, as bryan mentioned, i think we have a very strong focus on senior multifamily loans. and if you look at our portfolio snapshot at march 31, you'll see that we have about 13 loans, totaling over $500 million of unpaid principal balance. and we do believe on a relative basis, senior multifamily loans probably do offer the most liquidity, if and should that time come to potentially monetize some of our assets. and to maybe add a little bit more color, of the 13 loans totaling a little more than $500 million, 10 of those, again, totaling a little more than $400 million of unpaid principal balances are not in our fl3 securitization. in other words, they're financed with different warehouse parties, and so they would be relatively easy to get out of those warehouse facilities. again, if we were to look to potentially monetize those loans in some way.
and then, also in addition to that, we have about nine loans, and they consist of eight mezzanine positions and one senior position that are not financed under either fl3 or on any of our warehouse lines. again, the balance on these eight positions is about $116 million. and again, they don't have any specific warehouse debt or fl3 financing associated with it. so that would, again, be another source of liquidity, if and should that need arise. so to answer your question, we have $50 million today. we're very focused on liquidity. we're very focused on anticipating capital needs. we want to make sure we have all of the options at the table if and when they are needed. but we don't feel that we want to pull the trigger too early if those needs don't arise. so we're very anticipatory. we're ready. but we're going to do it, if and when the right moment arises.
jade j. rahmani -- keefe , bruyette & woods , inc. -- analyst
thank you. turning to repayment expectations. what are you expecting as sort of minimum levels of repayments? are you expecting any repayments? what's a range to think about? and a related question would be, whether you are talking to any borrowers about any discounted payoffs.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. maybe i can start, and bryan, please chime in. so in terms of, again, anticipated repayments of loans, we certainly do have a number of loans that have maturity dates coming up in 2020, and those are loans in particular that we are working very closely with the borrowers to see what their specific situations are. i think as we mentioned, we do think that in the multi-family sector, without getting into any particular loan, we do have a number of loans that do have 2020 maturity dates. and we do believe those are loans that we will be working most closely with to see what their refinancing and/or sale process would be to meet the maturity dates of the loans. alternatively, we could, again, as we've talked about, sell any of these loans as well, again, as a way to monetize the value we have in these loans.
so again, i don't think i have a specific answer for you in terms of, is there a minimum pay down. as i mentioned before, for liquidity planning purposes, we're making the very conservative assumptions that essentially little to no repayments occur in 2020. that is obviously a very conservative viewpoint, but we think one that's prudent to take in this environment. so that when we plan our liquidity over the next eight months, that, that's the underlying assumption that we're making. but having said all that, we are working very closely with each of our borrowers to make sure that if they're able to refinance, even if it's not under ideal terms, but they're able to finance, that they produce -- that they pursue those strategies to make that happen.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
and the last thing i'd add there, jade and tae-sik, is this book is also comprised primarily of loans to bridge the improvement of the underlying assets. so as assets have gone through their life cycle and our borrowers and our capital has provided the cash in order to improve upon these assets. and that's, in many cases, resulted in improved leasing to either improve occupancy and multifamily assets or in certain instances, get credit tenancy with long duration leases, as was the original business plan. and so as that -- those investments come to the -- through the normal course of their life cycle and mature, those sponsors also want to realize on the value that they have created. and while capital markets may not be perfect across the board, we still see liquidity for credit tenancy, and we still see liquidity for multifamily assets. and while difficult to predict, we do believe in certain instances that will induce repayment.
jade j. rahmani -- keefe , bruyette & woods , inc. -- analyst
i wanted to ask one last question, sort of a high-level question. but just touching on acre's historical focus, do you expect, number one, secondary markets to come back faster than gateway cities, based on less density and being quicker to move beyond lockdown? secondly, what gives you the confidence that multifamily credit will hold up this cycle, where in the last cycle, we had the access homeownership that's spilled back into the apartment space and bolstered occupancy there?
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
with respect to your first question regarding gateway cities, i think you've got a little bit of a push and pull, right, in which capital flows have historically moved toward and been more consistent in those cities. but obviously, the population concentration, given what's occurring today could potentially run counter to that. i think that the thesis that we've always had at acre and will continue to have is that we don't expect to be an index of property values in any given market, or throughout the broader landscape. we think that we've selected and we'll continue to select assets that will outperform a given market, whether it's a gateway city or secondary.
if you've seen where we've invested over the previous quarters, it's largely been in areas that will benefit from tax migration, so lower cost areas. and that was a response to that secular shift in the population and the companies that are tracing that population movement, and also just the fact that those gateway cities were also priced to perfection in many instances. so we've been moving away from them historically, and we would expect that to continue.
jade j. rahmani -- keefe , bruyette & woods , inc. -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
of course.
operator
our next question today will come from stephen laws with raymond james. please go ahead.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. glad to hear from everybody. hope all are well. i want to start maybe with -- i think it was page 6 in the deck with the libor breakout. appreciate the color on the libor floors. can you maybe help me think about -- obviously, there's been a tremendous benefit there with the libor decline since quarter end. but on the opposite side, tae-sik, how do we think about the recurring, nonrecurring items, origination fees, the repayment fees? how much of q1 was from that? or how much of a decline do we expect with that largely go away? and how much, if any, will be offset by modification fees that you may charge on new modifications?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure, stephen. thanks for that question. i think, number one, i think our libor floors have served us well in a very volatile libor environment. and one that right now has been very beneficial to acre in terms of maintaining a very strong overall unlevered effective yield, again, despite very challenging conditions. in terms of origination fees, as you mentioned, clearly, that's been a nice part of our earnings stream in the past. and the way we recognize origination fees is that we amortize it over the expected life of the loan. so if we receive a one-point origination fee on a three-year loan, we're not going to recognize it upfront. we're not going to recognize the whole 1% upfront. we're going to recognize it and amortize it over the three years. and so you'll still see the benefit of origination fees of originations that we have done in the past come through our earnings.
similarly, i would say that if you look at our financing costs, our financing costs, when we borrow monies from our lenders, we also pay origination fees on those loans on those liabilities. and again, those are also amortized over the expected life of those financing facilities. so in many ways, from both a cash perspective, as well as from an earnings perspective, both gaap and core, those two tend to not exactly certainly by any means, but those tend to offset each other to a pretty good extent. and therefore, i don't think origination fees or origination expenses that we would have are going to be a meaningful differentiator between cash flow versus our earnings.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
great. appreciate the color on that. shifting to the hotels and looking at the ones that you're still accruing interest for so pretty unique locations across the four. so i guess a couple of questions here, just trying to get a gauge on this asset class and your exposure. what is your feedback from those four borrowers that are still paying, given their specific locations and what they're experiencing? any modification discussions you're having with them? and on the other side, i know in your prepared remarks, you talked about no one counterparty, i think, has more than one hotel loan. if you do need to modify one of these loans, do you already have approval from your counterparties to do so? if so, what are some examples of what does that encompasses? i'm trying to get an idea of where the ones you're slippering interest for are on a performance standpoint. and what your options are to address it if they're in a stressed environment?
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
sure. thanks, stephen. again, it's tough to point to any overarching theme other than, obviously, the economic downturn in lodging being somewhat tip of the spear for the risk that we're seeing. overall, though, as i pointed out in my prepared remarks, these are generally limited or select service hotels. and the reason that's important is the expense load in a full service hotel, specifically in some of the gateway cities we mentioned earlier, will have a very high expense with. so beyond just debt service, operating expenses will create a pretty significant hole in the income statement that will have to be filled somewhere. so the fact that we've invested one in certain portfolios. so that diversity, just within our specific investment, and the optionality in terms of the way you potentially restructure those types of transactions and the limited drag from ongoing expenses, i think, is an important factor to take into account.
with respect to your question regarding correspondence or how we then work with our senior lenders, not to speak about anything specifically, but to the extent that we're agreeing with a sponsor to a restructure in any way, then that's done in concert with our senior lenders. and as you know, we've got full capital markets team to manage that communication and the overall relationships that we have. and the fact that we're very forthcoming and communicate regularly with our partners on the finance side positions us very well there. but specifically, to the extent we were to extend the maturity date of a loan, for instance, that might be done in concert with a payment from the sponsor, right, a paydown of some kind and the like. and to the extent that was the case, then that would be pass on, in many instances to the senior lender to kind of go along with that restructure. but all of those conversations to date have been extremely constructive.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
great. and then to tie that back to the first question, if you were to do that and extend the duration, would you then slow down the amortization of the original origination fee because it's now over a longer period of time?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
we would, yes. yes. we thought the loan was going to extend. and in fact, particularly if we modify the loan so that it doesn't, in fact, extend, we would amortize the original remaining balances here over a longer time.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
great. and then my final question, appreciate the time. the prefunding facility, something unique that others don't have. can you maybe give us any details? i mean, i know it was there to help manage cash flow and availability. at what point do you see liquidity? or is there a leverage level? or do you get comfort around payoffs that you start to prefund loans on that facility? is there a maximum link you can leave them there? could you go out and do a bunch of l-plus 15 loans now and pull them down in 6 or 12 months? and then from a risk standpoint, could it go the other way? if you have financing problems in your portfolio, can you go backwards and move along back there temporarily? or is it simply for prefunding only? and anyway, any color around that would be great because i do think this is a unique feature of acre that others don't have.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. no, thanks for pointing that out, steve. and we do think that ares warehouse line is an incredibly important and advantageous tool that we have at acre. and certainly one of the huge benefits that we at acre get from being managed by ares management is the ares warehouse line. so we have -- traditionally and certainly, the primary purpose of the ares warehouse line was to do what you stated, stephen, which was to allow us to originate loans that exceeded the balance sheet capacity of acre at that moment, put that under the ares warehouse line so that when a loan paid off within acre or other liquidity was available in acre, there would be a readily stable of loans that we could pull down and not incur the drag of cash on the balance sheet that was not deployed.
having said all that, i do think we are looking to, if you want to call it, reverse engineer the use. so that if acre is looking for more liquidity rather than trying to invest its liquidity, trying to create more liquidity, there is a possibility of reversing the direction so that a balance sheet loan that acre holds directly today could be sold to the ares warehouse vehicle, and thereby free up capacity and free up liquidity within acre. so that is certainly a possibility and certainly something that we are absolutely looking into.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
well, that's great color. i've been wondering if that was potentially an option, and it sounds like it's something you guys have been working on or at least considering. so that's good to hear. and at some point, coming out of this, i feel it's going to be really attractive to shift to offense. i think that will allow you guys to do it faster than others, even if your stock valuation may be lagging that term. so, thank you for the comments and have a good weekend.

operator
good afternoon and welcome to the ares commercial real estate corporation's conference call to discuss the company's first quarter 2020 financial results. as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on may 8, 2020.
i'd now turn the call over to veronica mayer from investor relations.
veronica mendiola mayer -- principal of ares public investor relations and corporate communications group
good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call. we apologize for the short delays as we were experiencing a few technical difficulties. i am joined by today by our ceo, bryan donohoe; david roth, our president; tae-sik yoon, our cfo; and carl drake, our head of public company investor relations.
in addition to our press release and the 10-q that we filed with the sec, we have posted an earnings presentation under the investor resources section of our website at www.arescre.com.

during this conference call, we will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures. we use these as measures of operating performance and these measures should not be considered in isolation from or as substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. these measures may not be comparable to like-titled measures used by other companies.
and now, i will now turn the call over to bryan donohoe.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
thank you, veronica, and good afternoon, everyone. we wish everyone well during these difficult and challenging times, and we appreciate you joining us today. we hope you and your families are safe and healthy, and our thoughts are with our first line responders and all of those impacted by this virus. i also want to thanks the team at acre and the greater ares platform for seamlessly working from home and working so diligently to drive our company forward.
we issued our earnings release this morning, which showed relatively consistent quarterly core eps of $0.32 and a gaap eps loss of $0.54. our net gaap loss primarily reflects the adoption of the current expected credit losses, or cecl, accounting standard and does not reflect impairment to the loans in our portfolio. i'm going to put these results in context by walking you through our action since the outbreak of covid-19 and how our portfolio is currently positioned. after my comments, tae-sik will walk you through our earnings, liquidity position and impact of cecl on our earnings in more detail.
first, let's discuss what we accomplished during the first quarter prior to the outbreak. supported by favorable real estate fundamentals and sound leverage levels, we originated $356 million in loans during the first 2.5 months of the year. we also raised $73 million in net proceeds from an equity offering in late january, completed at a significant premium to book value per share.
when the impacts of the outbreak became clear, we curtailed new investment activity and worked to further enhance our liquidity position. we redeployed the team to underwrite each asset in our portfolio. through dynamic and constructive discussions with our borrowers, we focused on the near-term impacts on cash flows and the long-term impacts on property values. and we're pleased to say that we believe our portfolio is holding up relatively well with all of our loans paying their contractual interest in april.
as part of ares, we received great market insights from our investments in over 1,500 companies and approximate 250 property investments across north america and europe. these insights informed our already cautious view of certain segments during the first quarter. we consciously avoided investments and loans that were solely collateralized by hotels or retail properties throughout all of 2019 and the beginning of 2020. we strategically structured our portfolio to be comprised with 95% senior loans and highly diversified with 53 loans across 17 states. additionally, the majority of our portfolios in either multi-family, office or industrial properties.
that being said, no asset or portfolio is immune to the economic impact of a prolonged shelter-in-place order like we are experiencing today. our portfolio includes six senior loans on hotel properties that make up 14% of our outstanding principal balance. the majority of these loans are secured by limited or select service nationally branded properties or portfolios of properties. and we're optimistic that these types of hotels will recover faster than certain full-service hotels, do in part to lower expense loads.
in addition, we have a $10 million equity position in a marriott hotel in westchester, new york. this property performed ahead of plan in 2019 and is well positioned heading into 2020. since the outbreak, we've been actively managing and creating a cost containment plan that will minimize operating expenses for this hotel until the recovery. while we do not have any loans solely collateralized by shopping centers, some of our multi-use properties do have retail components and one has a hotel component.
we're working with each of our borrowers that have expressed concerns around their ability to execute on their business plans in a timely manner. we're evaluating each loan on a case by case basis and considering certain modifications, including extensions of maturity dates and deferral of interest payments.
while we continue to actively manage our existing portfolio, we're also prepared to take advantage of attractive financing opportunities at the appropriate time. we communicate on a daily basis with our real estate equity colleagues, as well as the greater ares platform to gain real-time insight into consumer and tenant behavior. as we look at a refreshed investment environment, we expect a continued focus on multi-family properties, offices with long term leases, self-storage assets, as well as an increasing opportunity set in the retail -- in the industrial sector.
with that, i'll turn it over to tae-sik.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
great. thank you, bryan, and good afternoon, everyone. earlier today, despite the many challenges of operating in this environment, we reported a consistent core earnings of $10.3 million or $0.32 per common share, as 100% of our loans were current on their debt service payments through the april 2020 payment date. our gaap net income, however, was significantly impacted by non-cash losses that we recognized due to the implementation of cecl, resulting in an overall quarterly loss for the first quarter of 2020 of $17.3 million or $0.54 per common share.
at march 31, 2020, we reported a book value of $13.95 per common share, down from $14.77 at year-end 2019, inclusive of a cumulative $0.96 per common share impact under cecl. i will discuss our implementation of cecl in greater detail in a few minutes.
prior to mid-march, when we started to see the economic impact of covid-19, we closed seven new loans totaling $356 million in new commitments. of these loans, a $132 million loan that was originated in the ares warehouse in the fourth quarter of 2019 was purchased by acre in january 2020. total fundings for the first quarter were $297 million, which included initial fundings of $284 million on the seven new loans and $13 million on prior existing loans.
with respect to repayments, four loans paid off in the first quarter totaling $107 million in principal balance, a number of which occurred in late march. as of march 31, our loan portfolio included 53 loans with total loan commitments of approximately $2.2 billion and an outstanding principal balance of approximately $1.9 billion.
turning to our liquidity. as of may 7, we had approximately $50 million in unrestricted cash. in addition, we have $131 million in unfunded capacity under our fl3 securitization and further capacity under the ares warehouse line, both of which are available subject to respective lender and third-party approvals. if we are able to fully utilize both capacities, we believe we would generate approximately $20 million to $25 million of additional unrestricted cash. furthermore, we believe that we could also monetize certain loans without significantly impacting future earnings and book value. in total, if all of these options were fully executed, our total cash position would be approximately $70 million to $75 million on a pro forma basis, plus any note -- any net proceeds from the sale of assets.
now, let me discuss our liabilities and financings. as we have consistently stated in the past, we have very purposely pursued a strategy of, first, diversifying both our sources of financing, as well as a composition of loans that we place with each of our lenders, and second, our focus on match funding our assets and liabilities.
with respect to diversification, our $1.6 billion in liabilities at quarter-end [technical issues] 10 different sources of capital. this means that we have six different warehouse lenders, a separate working capital line with city national bank, a term loan, asset level notes payable with three separate lenders and our fl3 securitization. this allows us to spread our counterparty risk and make sure that no single lender has concentrations of loans that we financed with them.
so, for example, as we mentioned in a recent announcement, of the six hotels that we have, three are financed within fl3 and the remaining three hotel loans are financed with three different warehouse lenders. in other words, no warehouse lender has more than one hotel loan among the many other loans that pay [phonetic] financing for us. also, we have ten different sources of financing. other than wells fargo and our fl3 securitization, no other single financing source represents more than 10% of our borrowings at march 31, 2020.
as far as our strategy of match funding our assets and liabilities, we think it is important to note that none of our six warehouse financing facilities contain mark-to-market remargining provisions that are based on changes in market borrowing spreads. instead, our warehouse lines have remargining provisions based only on the actual credit quality of our loans.
and finally, we can't emphasize enough the importance of our continuing strong relationships that we have with each of our warehouse lenders, both at the acre level as well as at the ares management level. we have been working closely with each of them, particularly over the past few weeks. since mid-march 2020, we have not been formally asked to make any margin calls under any of our six warehouse lines, and we are in compliance with all of our loan covenants. however, we did elect to voluntarily make assets asset-specific pay downs of less than $10 million in total during the past few weeks as part of our ongoing discussions and in light of our overall relationships with our lenders.
i would now like to provide an update of our implementation of cecl during and as of the first quarter of 2020. our adoption -- our initial adoption of the new cecl accounting standards resulted in an initial reserve of $5.1 million as of january 1, 2020, which was recorded on our balance sheet as a reduction of stockholders equity. it is important to note that this initial reserve amount did not take into account the impact of covid-19. however, as we all know, during the first quarter and most notably during the last two to three weeks of march 2020, the impact of covid-19 dramatically and adversely changed the economic outlook for the us economy.
in assessing estimated losses under cecl, we engaged a third-party economic forecasting company to provide us with macroeconomic metrics, which we incorporated into our cecl model. in general, the macroeconomic forecast assumes significant declines in gdp, libor rates and commercial real estate values, as well as sharp increases in unemployment. as a result, at march 31, 2020, we increased our cecl reserves significantly by $27.1 million or $0.85 per common share for the first quarter of 2020, which is included in our net income and resulted in our overall gaap net loss.
similarly, at march 31, 2020, our cecl reserve stands at $32.2 million or a $0.96 decrease in book value per share and represents approximately 1.5% of our loan commitment balance and 1.7% of the unpaid principal balance of our loans.
it is important to note that while cecl has a significant impact in our gaap earnings and book value per common share, cecl reserves are a non-cash item and cecl does not directly impact our actual cash flows or liquidity position. to note further, we have not incurred any actual losses or recognized any impairments in our loan portfolio. and in addition, as we mention at the outset, 100% of our loans were current and made debt service payments through the april 2020 payment date.
our four loans, although they too are current and we did receive interest till the april 2020 payment date, we made a prudent decision to place them on non-accrual status. these four loans total $105 million in unpaid principal balance and represents 6% of our total portfolio and includes three loans secured by hotel properties and one loan secured by student housing. we made this decision as we believe that the covid-19 pandemic may put particular pressure on these borrowers and property cash flows.
and with that, i will now turn the call back over to bryan for some closing remarks.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
thanks tae-sik. as you can see from our discussion today, we're incredibly focused on preserving liquidity during this period of disruption and the reopening of our economy. we recognize that dividends are important to our shareholders and we believe there is a strong alignment of interest with shareholders as executives and employees collectively own approximately 11% of the acre.
in order to have the most information available to us, we expect to announce our decision regarding our second quarter dividend by mid-june, following the meeting of our board of directors. this will allow us more time to evaluate cash and liquidity, market conditions and loan performance, among other factors.
importantly, the silver lining that we anticipate there will be an improved real estate market for investing as the economy starts to reopen and recover. while we remain focused on preserving capital at acre, we remain active through complimentary funds on the ares real estate debt platform, which we believe will lead to deal flow and future opportunities for acre over the long term.
at this point, i would like to ask the operator to open the line for questions.
",2020-Q1,ACRE
,,0.6829,0.6829,":
operator
[operator instructions] and our first question comes from stephen laws of raymond james. please proceed.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
hi, good morning. i guess to start, tae-sik, you talked a little bit about leverage in your prepared remarks and that it will -- you -- the company was going to continue to look for ways to reduce it from here. is there a target you have in mind? or what do you think about is the right leverage level to operate the business going forward? and how does that maybe target move around based on the mix of mark-to-market versus non-mark-to-market financing facilities that you have?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. good afternoon, stephen. thanks so much for your question. no. it's a -- that's a great question. while we don't have, i would say, a target per se, in the past, we had sort of mentioned 3.0 debt-to-equity as sort of the right balance between leverage and earnings. and i think we have been successful in staying within plus or minus that 3.0 debt-to-equity ratio. i would say right now, we're underneath that 3.0, if you want to call it, approximately 2.5 to 2.75 is sort of the target range overall.
but having said that, i think it's important to point out that, again, it will depend on the multitude of factors, i think you suggested one of them, which is really important, which is our recourse leverage those that are subject to potential margin calls, even if they are simply credit-based and not spread-based, what is termed out? what is less termed out? what is the rate of that financing? what is the maturity of that financing? so there is a multitude of factors that we're taking to account. but i would say generically, just given current market conditions, we would like to seek to reduce our leverage further from that 2.9 total leverage ratio that we have today, the 1.9 recourse leverage ratio today, tweak it down a little further, but again, it will be an evolving situation based upon the totality of what our liabilities and, of course, asset performance looks like.
and, of course, it's a fact that we are 95% senior that i think when you compare our leverage ratio to maybe some of our peers who may not be as focused on senior. and that leverage ratio really needs to take into account some maybe the off-balance sheet leverage that others may have on their loans. so, again, i just want to emphasize that. we are 95% senior and therefore, the leverage ratio should really be taking into consideration with that into account.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
great. and then unfunded commitments, i think i saw the total in the funded, it's about $250 million i think. please correct me if that's not right. but can you talk a little bit, of the $250 million, how much of that is available to be drawn down now? how much has milestones or completions attached to it? or for leasing up assets? can you talk about how you expect that $250 million to be funded over time?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. as you know, the type of loans that we have historically made are transitional loans, where we fund the majority of the commitment upfront. so we certainly have in most of our loans, a component of the commitment that we believe will be funded over time. the primary use of that funding over time, the unfunded commitments, is really what we call good news money, right. good news money associated with leasing of assets, so that for the dollars are necessary for tenant improvements, for leasing commissions, capital expenditures that may be necessary or part of that. and so, when we put money out, for the most part, we think that's a very positive -- that means that there has been very positive progress in the business plans of the underlying properties themselves.
so you're right, we do have approximately $250 million outstanding. i think they can't just simply draw the money, like these are not unfettered credit lines where a borrower can just simply do a drawdown notice and ask for that $250 million. they have to meet milestones. they have to hit the good news that we've talked about. it has to be in accordance with the business plan. so there are [technical issues] loan-by-loan, different milestones that are necessary to be met in order for those dollars to be drawn down.
but i would say, for the most part, again, the majority of that $250 million is for positive events that have happened in the underlying property. and obviously, we're prepared to fund those dollars, because we believe it enhances the underlying collateral values of the properties themselves due to increases in the cash flow.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
great. last question from me, i think i ask every quarter, but the ares facility, i know it's been a pre-funding facility, but not really doing the new originations now to pre-fund the portfolio, i don't think. has there been any development with that facility? is there any optionality to it that you could use that financing for something else? or how do you think about that facility as far as being there if you do a new rate origination, are you looking for stuff that you may like to put on that? kind of any update around the ares facility?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
no, absolutely. the ares facility has been a tremendous benefit to acre pre-pandemic and during the pandemic. so, one of the potential uses is, given the liquidity of acre, given the balance sheet of acre, if we found a very attractive investment that we -- at this moment, don't want to take on to acre's balance sheet but do wanted as future inventory, it is certainly something we can do using that ares warehouse.
the other potential use of the ares warehouse in this current market environment is that, and i think we had mentioned this a little bit in our first quarter earnings call as well, is that, we can use it sort of in the reverse direction that maybe the primary purpose. in other words, we can take a loan that is already on acre's balance sheet, sell it to the ares warehouse to free up capital on acre's balance sheet with the potential and with the option to buyback in the future. i would say, all of that would be done at fair market values. but again, it does provide an additional source of potential liquidity for acre, if and as needed.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
that's great. appreciate the color on that. thank you for taking my questions this morning.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
absolutely, stephen. thanks so much.
operator
our next question comes from doug harter of credit suisse. doug, please proceed.
joshua bolton -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, guys. this is actually josh bolton on for doug. you talked about in your prepared remarks talking about going on offense or the ability to start going on offense. i'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the pipeline that you're seeing or the opportunities you're seeing currently. and how spreads available today compared to what you were seeing pre-covid? thanks.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
yeah, absolutely. i think what we've seen over the last 45 to 60 days as a pretty significant expansion in the pipeline of opportunities, i'd still say that's coming off of a relatively low bar during the more acute portion of the covid crisis, but we've been very pleased with what we're starting to see. still, i'd say, a small percentage of those would fall in the actionable category. but we would expect that during the tail end of the third and into the fourth quarter, we'll be fine. and just following the trend lines over the last 60 days, as i said, i think we'll try to -- we'll be successful in churning up some opportunities that are actionable.
with respect to your latter question regarding spreads, what we've seen is, significant movement beyond the decline in libor. so, obviously, over the last 18 months, we've seen a decline in libor in the neighborhood of 150 basis points. i would say, that spreads are now wider by a greater margin than that. so think about an average loan, just if i'm thinking apples-to-apples in at libor plus 3.50% to 3.75% of six, eight months ago, that same loan today is probably 4.75% to 5.00% over. so still an attractive all-in coupon for a borrower, which i think is an important part to make sure we end up with willing buyers and sellers at the transaction table. but what it allows for us is to have the underlying asset. the loan itself will provide a much greater proportion of all-in yield relative to some of the financial engineering and levered returns that we've seen in the marketplace over the past 18 months. so, all in all, we feel the expansion in the pipeline has been significant and we're pretty bullish on what the fourth quarter and first quarter of next year look like.
joshua bolton -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. appreciate the comments. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from jade rahmani of kbw. jade, please proceed.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- analyst
thank you very much. can you say -- can you give some indication as to whether you expect the current level of earnings to be maintained? you mentioned a few positives that could bolster earnings, including libor floors, as well as some recent improvement in credit and expense curtailment on the westchester hotel property. on the other hand, the portfolio is a little bit smaller post some of the actions you've taken. so, just wondering directionally what you're thinking.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. jade. this is a tae-sik. i can start with that question. so, i think the asset transactions that we've talked about, the five that we talked about, while that will have some impact on earnings going forward, we do think it will be mitigated by some of the other aspects that we've talked about, right? so, we do think that the loss on westchester marriott heading into the third quarter looks like it's going to be materially mitigated versus even second quarter. we do think that's a full impact of libor floors will continue to be felt in the third quarter. second quarter, we certainly had a very material impact as libor continue to fall. in the second quarter, it wasn't, what i would call a full quarter's impact of where libor ended up as of june 30. but so far into the third quarter, we've benefited from a much fuller impact for the libor floors.
third, as you said, we are doing what we can to minimize g&a expenses overall. and so, i'll say this sort of without some extraordinary or somewhat one-time events, we do think operating earnings will remain very consistent for acre heading into the third quarter and not materially impacted due to the five loan transactions that we spoke about.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
yeah. and the one thing i'd add...
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- analyst
oh, go ahead.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
just a quick add on, i think. if you think about a normal capital markets environment, wherein libor floor is at the weighted average of 1.7 or thereabouts, that we have relative to underlying libor at -- in the low-double digits. normally that would be an inducement for accelerated repayments. and as the -- while some of the capital markets have returned to normalcy, there is still a disruption such that that inducement, while people would love to lower their borrowing costs, we're not seeing that accelerated repayment. so, i think we have some stickier loans there, where we will continue to benefit from those libor floors, while being able to continue to stabilize the marriott westchester, as well as pursue some one-off idiosyncratic risk situations that will provide higher yield. so, we're pretty happy with the portfolio and what it's been generating and what we expect it to continue to generate.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- analyst
the one-off idiosyncratic [speech overlap]. go ahead. sorry about that.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah, jade. yeah, i'm sorry. one other thing i just want to add to your question is, in terms of core earnings for the third quarter, i think this should be apparent. but just to make sure that the $4 million mark-to-market loss that we took in the second quarter that impacted gaap earnings did not impact core earnings since the definition core earnings would add back unrealized gains and losses. third quarter, as we mentioned, those transaction did close. and so, the impact of that $4 million will go through core earnings in the third quarter. so, i think you're probably already aware of all that, but i just wanted to point that out.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- analyst
right. and would there be somewhat of an offset in the reserve based on that?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
you mean cecl reserves?
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- analyst
yeah. the -- i mean, provision for loan losses inclusive of cecl.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
for the third quarter, obviously, it's a little too early to tell. but as we mentioned in our q and prepared remarks that of the cecl reserve that change that we had in the second quarter, about $1.2 million of that was due to the transactions that resulted in the sales in the third quarter. so, that's already, in essence, been taken into account in the cecl reserve because when you transfer a loan from held for investment to available for sale, you then are marking that mark-to-market, and so you're taking off the previously held cecl reserve against it. so, there may be additional movements in the third quarter, but in connection with the actual transactions themselves, those have already been accounted for in the second quarter.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- analyst
okay. got it. so, the core earnings -- operating earnings could be consistent, but there is the realization of that loss that would run through core earnings in the third quarter.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
correct.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- analyst
okay. in terms of the second quarter, away from loan sale activity, did you -- what was the magnitude of loan repayments, ordinary course loan repayments?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
so for second quarter, we really did not have material loan repayments. we obviously didn't [phonetic] refinance the $138 million now loan that that bryan referred to. so that technically is a repayment and a new origination, but obviously it was really a refinancing of our own loan. subsequent to second quarter in early july, we did have a repayment of approximately $50 million, and this was an ordinary loan repayment, actually happened earlier than the stated maturity. and so, we did have that loan repayment but that happened early third quarter, not second quarter.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- analyst
got it. are you [technical issues] to paying any additional repayments in the third quarter? and should we expect the fundings of previous commitments to be similar to what took place in the second quarter?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. i think we're obviously closely monitoring business line progress and availability of capital that would permit refinancings or payoffs of our loans. and right now, i think we don't expect there to be material amounts. but there could be some level of repayment in the third quarter. it certainly would not be commensurate with pre-pandemic levels. but there could be some repayments in the third quarter.
and then as far as future funding is concerned, i think as we mentioned, we have about $250 million of unfunded commitments that is over the remaining expected life of all 50 loans held for investment. so it's spread out across quite a few investments. it is very bespoke loan-by-loan, situation-by-situation, transaction-by-transaction of when those money get drawn. i would say, we have historically had, call it, plus or minus $25 million per quarter. again, that is a very, very general number, so i wouldn't count on that being the number for any specific quarter but that's kind of been what we've seen in the past.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- analyst
thank you very much for taking the questions.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
great. thank you, jade.

and our final question comes from chris muller of jmp securities. chris, please proceed.
ronald josey -- jmp securities llc -- analyst
hey, guys. ron for steve today. thanks for taking the question. i want to see if you could just give some general commentary about the student housing in the portfolio. we've heard some positive trends from some other people in the space. so just want to see what you guys had to say about it.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
yeah. we would probably echo that, i think it's been a very positive last 90 days in this space, owing a little bit to less folks being housed on-campus and pushing some demand off-campus. but universally, we've seen occupancy and rate outpace 12 months ago. and importantly, to add on there, early in the covid crisis, what you saw with the leasing at these properties was that they effectively had an out clause if schools didn't open or if covid caused some resurgence there. and almost universally, we've seen that clause and the leases go away, so that they are binding and they're maintaining the same amount or a similar amount, i should say, of parental guarantees on those leases. so, in some, we think the loans -- the lease structures are positive. and again, far outpacing last year's pace of leasing and rate.

operator
good afternoon, and welcome to the ares commercial real estate corporation's conference call to discuss the company's second quarter 2020 financial results. as a reminder, this conference is being recorded on august 6, 2020.
i will now turn the call over to veronica mayer from investor relations. please go ahead.
veronica mendiola mayer -- principal, public investor relations and communications
good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call. i am joined today by our ceo, bryan donohoe; david roth, our president; tae-sik yoon, our cfo; and carl drake, our head of public company investor relations.
in addition to our press release and the 10-q that we filed with the sec, we have posted an earnings presentation under the investor resources section of our website at www.arescre.com.
before we begin, i want to remind everyone that comments made during the course of this conference call and webcast and the accompanying documents contain forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties. many of these forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as anticipates, believes, expects, intends, will, should, may and similar expressions. these forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations of market conditions and management's judgment. these statements are not guarantees of future performance, condition or results and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. the company's actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those listed in its sec filings. ares commercial real estate corporation assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.
during this conference call, we will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures. we use these as measures of operating performance, and these measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. these measures may not be comparable to like-titled measures used by other companies.
with that, i will now turn the call over to bryan donohoe.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
thanks, veronica, and good afternoon, everyone. at the onset of the covid-19 pandemic and its disruptions to the real estate markets, we immediately set several goals and objectives. we aim to maintain stable earnings and use our asset management capabilities to preserve our strong credit quality. we also sought out opportunities to selectively divest certain assets to enhance our liquidity and manage risk exposure.
with respect to the balance sheet, we focused on managing our lender relationships and reducing overall leverage. our overarching goal was to execute on these objectives and protect shareholder value, and i'm pleased to say that we have made progress in all of these areas during the second quarter and into this current quarter.
the work that we completed leading into 2020 has given us a very strong foundation to weather significant economic headwinds. for example, over the last few years we strategically positioned our portfolio to be conservative and well-diversified. the portfolio was comprised of 95% senior loans across 50 investments in 17 different markets with limited exposure to gateway cities. we focused our originations primarily on multifamily, office and industrial properties with limited exposure to hotels and retail. we also built in libor floors to protect our earnings in low interest rate environments.
furthermore, we maintained diversified sources of funding, particularly with respect to hotel loans and we refused to finance our loans with spread-based mark-to-market facilities. as a result, we are proud that our portfolio has performed well, and that our balance sheet remains sound. we have not made any fundamental changes to our business, but rather we have focused on opportunities to enhance our position, and we're excited about the outlook for our company.
let me now walk through our financial results at a high-level, and some of the specific progress we made. this morning, we reported consistent core eps of $0.32 per share, and gaap eps of $0.29 as our earnings continue to benefit from our diversified portfolio and the libor floor protection on nearly all of our loans. during the second quarter, our portfolio quality improved as the number of loans on non-accrual status declined and our overall internal credit risk ratings improved. 100% of our loans held for investment made their contractual debt service payments through july, including the three loans that remain on non-accrual status. two loans representing 2% of our loans held for investment, as measured by outstanding principal balance, are under short-term contractual forbearance agreements.
our internal risk ratings also improved. on a 1 to 5 rating scale, with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest, 91% of our loans rated a 3 or better versus 84% last quarter. our non-accruing loans declined from 6% of unpaid principal balance to 4%, including the removal of one hotel loan where we extended the upcoming maturity of the loan in exchange for a partial debt pay down and the funding of substantial interest in operating reserves from the sponsor.
during the second quarter and subsequent to quarter end, we also took steps to increase our liquidity and manage our risk by prudently divesting selected assets through five transactions. first, we refinanced two loans secured by multifamily properties in florida, totaling $138 million. post closing, we transferred the subordinate interest in the two loans to a third-party and subsequently financed our senior position through our securitization. on a net basis, this transaction resulted in $35 million in cash, while at the same time, derisking our position. we enhanced our liquidity, while creating attractive interest earning loans backed by multifamily properties.
subsequent to quarter end, we sold three loans, two secured by multifamily properties and one by a hotel property. these five transactions totaled $238 million in unpaid principal balance and generated $60 million of net cash. the average price for the five loans was 97% of par value, which included three loans at par, one at 95% of par, and one non-performing hotel loan at 92.5% of par.
following the sale of the hotel loan, our overall hotel loan exposure decreased by $31 million to $237 million in outstanding principal balance across five loans. in total, the five loan transactions helped improve our cash position to $80 million as of august 5, 2020, net of paying our second quarter cash dividend of $0.33 per share on july 15. we also reduced our overall balance sheet leverage, as tae-sik will discuss.
our dedicated asset management team has worked diligently over the last few months and this can be seen by the credit improvement in our portfolio and our enhanced liquidity. we continue to have constructive dialogue with each of our borrowers, allowing us to navigate uncertainties in the market and to seek to address the issues proactively that occur -- that could occur in the portfolio.
going forward, while we continue to actively manage our existing portfolio and our balance sheet liquidity, we believe we have the financial flexibility to go on offense and take advantage of attractive financing opportunities. we are using our extensive relationships and leveraging the power of the ares platform to see off-market, higher spread, attractive investment opportunities, albeit with less senior leverage available. we are primarily focusing on multifamily properties, industrial properties, offices with long-term leases, as well as self-storage assets, which have historically had less volatility and are more consistently financeable. our goal is to rigorously preserve our strong credit quality, and thus, every investment is being highly scrutinized for safety and attractive yields.
with that, i will turn the call over to tae-sik.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
great. thank you, bryan, and good afternoon, everyone. earlier today, we reported consistent core earnings of $10.7 million, or $0.32 per common share, in part as 94% of our loans have libor floors at a weighted average rate of 1.77%, an additional 2% of our loans are fixed rate.
our gaap net income was $9.8 million, or $0.29 per common share. our gaap earnings were impacted in the second quarter, primarily due to an unrealized loss of $4 million, or approximately $0.12 per common share in connection with marking to market three loans held for sale that were subsequently sold in the third quarter.
in addition, our reo property, westchester marriott, had a loss of approximately $2.2 million, or $0.06 in the second quarter. while the west -- while the marriott westchester had been adversely impacted by the pandemic, like most service hotels focus on business travelers, we have taken numerous initiatives to limit expenses and start to rebuild its revenue base. in essence, we have effectively converted the hotel to a limited service model and we have focused our sales and marketing team to solicit government and other essential workers. we're also benefiting from a significant reduction in competition as a few neighboring hotels are closed or closing, some of which we understand maybe permanent. our progress is expected to be seen in the third quarter with expected losses to be materially curtailed.
turning now to our liquidity, as of yesterday's close, we had approximately $80 million in unrestricted cash. in addition, we believe that we have available to us further sources of liquidity should the need arise. for example, we have remaining unfunded capacity under our fl3 securitization, and we believe that we could monetize additional loans, particularly those backed by multifamily properties at par or close to par.
now, let me discuss our liabilities and debt facilities. as we have said in the past, we have very purposely pursued a strategy of diversifying sources of financing and match funding assets and liabilities. and in the past few months, we have begun to reduce our overall leverage ratios and the share of our liabilities subject to credit-based margin calls. first, following the sale or other monetization of the five loans that bryan previously discussed, including those that closed after the second quarter, we reduced our debt-to-equity ratio from 3.2 times as of march 31, 2020 to 2.9 times currently, both measured excluding our cecl reserves. on a recourse basis, our debt-to-equity leverage has been reduced to less than 1.9 times. we will continue to pursue opportunities to reduce our leverage further.
and second, with respect to reducing our liability, subject to credit-based margin calls, we have looked to further term out our financing and have also employed senior subordinate loan structures. for example, for the two multifamily loans totaling $138 million in outstanding principal that we refinanced, shortly after closing, we transferred $38 million of subordinate participations to a third-party while retaining the $100 million interest. you will note in our financials that although the $38 million subordinate participations are junior to our senior positions and not indebtedness to us, the transaction did not qualify as syndications, so that the entire $138 million loan remains consolidated as an asset on our balance sheet with a $38 million subordinate interest presented as a liability on our balance sheet. again, we bear no obligation to repay the $38 million in junior participations, and such interests are subordinate to our $100 million in senior participations.
also, as a reminder, none of our warehouse financing facility contain mark-to-market remargining provisions that are based on changes in market borrowing spreads. instead, our warehouse lines have remargining provisions based on the credit performance of our loans.
finally, our cecl reserve was at $28 million for the quarter ended june 30, down approximately $4 million from the previous quarter. this reduction in the provision was primarily attributable to the three loans that were transferred to loans held for sale, which reduced our cecl reserves by approximately $1.2 million. one additional loan that was repaid that further reduced our cecl reserves by $0.5 million and reduction in the average remaining term for the overall loan portfolio.
and with that, i will now turn the call back over to bryan for some closing remarks.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
thanks, tae-sik. to sum it up, we are really proud of the significant progress we have made with respect to our objectives of enhancing liquidity, maintaining strong profitability, and improving credit quality, while protecting shareholder value. we are pleased with the performance of our portfolio and the hard work and dedication of our entire team. we are all stronger for persisting through the last five months together, which makes us better positioned to navigate the road ahead and to take advantage of the opportunities we believe we will find in the market going forward.
with that, i'd like to ask the operator to open the line for questions.
",2020-Q2,ACRE
,,,0.9999,":
operator
[operator instructions] the first question will be from doug harter of credit suisse. thanks. can you just talk about your current liquidity holdings, kind of how you think that that progresses over the coming quarters? and, you know, assuming that that number comes down, how would you prioritize deploying that liquidity?
tae-sik yoon -- partner, chief financial officer of ares real estate group and chief financial officer and treasurer
sure, doug. this is tae-sik. you know, liquidity is obviously a paramount importance and we have been building the amount of liquidity over the past few quarters. as you can see, as of even, you know, just the last couple of days, we're up to about 91 million, you know, which if you look at it as a percentage of our equity, look at it as a percentage of our overall loans and potential needs, you know, we think we're at a very appropriate level today. obviously, we're also taking into consideration, you know, what we anticipate our cash flow from operations to be on a go-forward basis. i think having said all that, you know, we-you know, we remain cautious. you know, the markets are quite volatile, so we want to make sure that we continue to have, you know, appropriate levels of liquidity to support the business. at this point, you know, we do feel we're in a good position. so, we are evaluating the uses of that capital, including, you know, deploying that capital into new investments, but no firm decisions have been made on that. but, you know, we do believe that liquidity is at a good level, where, you know, we can start to look at some offense opportunities, while at the same time, making sure that we have the appropriate amount of defensive liquidity, and that we have other plans in place that we can move very quickly on to actually add additional cash onto the balance sheet if necessary.
doug harter -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. and tae-sik, it looked like, you know, kind of the average asset yield ticked up during the quarter. you know, was there anything kind of that would-you would kind of call out in there that we should be aware of?
tae-sik yoon -- partner, chief financial officer of ares real estate group and chief financial officer and treasurer
i mean, not really. i think, you know, you'll see a little bit of changes in asset yields, you know, based upon portfolio composition, based upon potentially some modifications, potentially on some partial repayments, or full repayments. but no, it's not really due to changes in, you know, big, big, significant changes in the portfolio, i think its fine tuning of the portfolio. you know, one of the nice things, again, about our portfolio is that, you know, 95%, 97% of our portfolio is either floating rate, you know, with a fixed libor floor. we also mix in, you know, a small amount of fixed rate loans. so even with the sharp changes and drop in libor that we've seen, you have not seen a change in our overall unleveraged effective yield. so, we do expect this to be relatively steady and whatever changes you see so far, sort of quarter-to-quarter are not due to any significant changes in the portfolio.
doug harter -- credit suisse -- analyst
great, thank you.
tae-sik yoon -- partner, chief financial officer of ares real estate group and chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, doug.
operator
the next question is from steve delaney of jmp securities.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
hi, everybody. congratulations on the quarter. wondering if you could give us an update on your westchester hotel, any strategy, any changes there from a strategy standpoint? and if you could estimate sort of the quarterly cash drain that you're now seeing on the property? thanks.
bryan donohoe -- partner, head of real estate debt
yes. thanks for the question. i think, you know, the strategy we took at the outset with the westchester marriott really mirrors a lot of the way we thought about the overall portfolio, which was to take a long-term view and i think that served us well in the portfolio and certainly with respect to westchester marriott. as tae-sik indicated in his remarks, we've benefited from the fact that a good portion of our competitive set has closed either temporarily or permanently. so, as you've seen this national uptick in demand and while it's certainly less than prior years, as you all know, we've been able to kind of harness more of that demand into our assets. so there's been some one-off events that have continued to benefit us. obviously, it's still relatively opaque to book group business on a go-forward basis, but we are seeing the benefits of staying open, of containing our costs, and really of minimized any downsides with respect to that asset.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
and, bryan, in terms of just quarter-to-quarter operating results, approximately what would you say the impact currently is on your earnings?
bryan donohoe -- partner, head of real estate debt
really relatively flat overall.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
okay.
bryan donohoe -- partner, head of real estate debt
and i think it's obviously the risk in lodging assets generally is the daily mark-to-market as of revenues.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
sure.
bryan donohoe -- partner, head of real estate debt
but-you know, so it's tough to say how consistent that will be. but we've been extremely pleased with the decisions that we've made at the asset. i mean, to have created this cost contained asset and still be able to successfully manage, and like i said, harness as much revenue as possible, given 40% reduction in our competitive set. we're really pleased with what we've done there.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
thanks for that. and then, as a follow-up, we noticed this morning that blackstone announced they had done $1 billion clo in the fourth quarter. your 2017 clo, i think i believe that reinvestment expires in march. just curious how you're seeing that market, that financing market these days, and if you have the flexibility to call your clo either before or, you know, when it-when reinvestment expires, what your plan is, you know, next spring? thanks.
bryan donohoe -- partner, head of real estate debt
yes, we look at a lot of different options with respect to our financing, as we indicated earlier on the call. i think the fact that the capital markets have returned for clos and cmbs, generally, i think, are a couple of positives, right? first and foremost, that fluid really helps to allow for willing buyers and sellers to come back to the table. and so, i think over the long term, those types of markets being open should allow for more repayments over time, just in general, right, and allowing a more normal course of business. we evaluate on a constant basis, the most efficient way to finance our assets. and obviously, as we've said in prior quarters, our partners on the financing side have been extremely constructive. but certainly there's accretive solutions in the clo market today, relative to certain financings, warehouse lines and the like, so it's something we're going to continue to look into like we do in the normal course.
steve delaney -- jmp securities -- analyst
okay, great. thank you for the comments.

the next question will be from stephen laws of raymond james.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
hi, good morning. you noted in your remarks, leverage continues to decline, and you're certainly benefiting from libor floors. you know, thinking about the valuation, you know, how do you evaluate potential stock repurchases against the leverage declines you've made? is that something you consider here given the surprise to book? you know, and-you know, pretty small amount of unfunded commitments, i guess, relative to the total portfolio size, so can you maybe comment on valuation and how you think about returning capital to shareholders possibly through a stock repurchase?
tae-sik yoon -- partner, chief financial officer of ares real estate group and chief financial officer and treasurer
yes, [speech overlap]
bryan donohoe -- partner, head of real estate debt
yes, go ahead, tae-sik.
tae-sik yoon -- partner, chief financial officer of ares real estate group and chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. great, great. sure, stephen. so, in terms of, you know, share repurchase, as you know, several years ago during a, sort of like capital markets timing, you know, we did go ahead and repurchase some shares. and, you know, we continue to evaluate, you know, the attractiveness of doing so, i mean, obviously, with our shares trading at current levels, you know, a significant discount to our book value. it would certainly be accretive from a book value per share perspective to do a meaningful share buyback. you know, at the same time, we obviously have other uses of capital, including some of the things that we just talked about, in terms of having some offense opportunities as well as making sure that we have enough cash and liquidity for defense purposes as well just given the great volatility of the market. so, you know, we haven't obviously done a share buyback recently, but it is certainly something that we will continue to evaluate. and the considerations that we will take into account is certainly, you know, accretion to book value per share. but also, you know, making sure that again, we sustain a sufficient level of liquidity, and also sustain a level of market capitalization that will continue to make our shares liquid in the market. you know, as one of the challenges we have at acre is just a small size of our overall balance sheet, including equity capital. and to the extent that we do share buybacks, that will obviously decrease that share capital further, which is something-again, it won't stop us from doing it, certainly, but it's certainly one of the factors that we would want to take into consideration.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
great. and i guess, you know, you probably should have started with the leverage side, but you know, you brought leverage down almost half a turn over the last couple of quarters. you know where do you see that near term? is there a level where you start to make new investments? you know, are you focused on-you know, is there a target that you'd like to get to 2.5 or somewhere else? can you maybe talk about where, you know, you'd like to see leverage trend over the next six to 12 months?
bryan donohoe -- partner, head of real estate debt
sure. you know, great question. and, you know, we've been-we have been very focused on reducing our leverage and we're balancing our leverage with, you know, all of the other important factors, right, all the other important factors about, you know, generating attractive roes to our investors, you know, continuing to pay a consistent cash dividend to our investors. you know, it'd be so called easy enough for us to further delever and delever the balance sheet to make it more conservative and safe on a relative basis. but obviously, that has its knock on effect of reducing earnings and reducing our ability to pay dividends. and so, we're trying to find the right balance. and so, i would say, you know, we have been, you know, helped by the fact that we have our libor floors so that we can continue to generate very attractive returns with, you know, $91 million of liquidity and with lower leverage. and so, we'll continue to evaluate it, you know, our leverage levels and the overall context. having said all that, you know, i think we are still comfortable saying that, you know, the target leverage that we are looking at right now is right around, call it 2.75 plus or minus 25, so a range of 2.5 to three is kind of where we think given today's market conditions that we would want to target today, so we're right there. and, you know, again, it'll be fluid depending on what happens with market conditions, what happens with pipeline, what happens with, you know, our overall loan performance, and we're always looking to potentially change it. but for the snapshot right now, it's somewhere between that 2.5 to three with, you know, a midpoint of 2.75.
stephen laws -- raymond james -- analyst
right, thanks a lot.
bryan donohoe -- partner, head of real estate debt
thank you, stephen.

the next question comes from jade rahmani of kbw.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
thank you very much. ares' management participated through a fund in a single family rental transaction with [indecipherable] partners, an active participant in that sector. and one of the other commercial mortgage reits called [indecipherable] that space has attractive on the debt side. is that an area that potentially could be earmarked for a new investment?
david roth -- partner, head of ares u.s. real estate private equity, president of ares commercial real estate
yes. thanks for the...
bryan donohoe -- partner, head of real estate debt
david, do you want to give a little bit of an intro there?
david roth -- partner, head of ares u.s. real estate private equity, president of ares commercial real estate
yes, i was going to say-you know, i'm obviously involved with the equity side of business as well and we did announce the transaction. obviously, it's a public company transaction, so i can't really comment on that, but needless to say, when you do something like that, you-it reflects that you find the cash flows and the sector attractive. i've spent a long time in the sector. i was, in my prior life, at blackstone, was responsible for the initial investment in [indecipherable] homes, so have a lot of expertise. was on the public company board for a long time. and so, i would just say as a concept, we like to space, and obviously, work hand-in-hand with our partners on the debt side to help them understand opportunities that might exist in that space.
bryan donohoe -- partner, head of real estate debt
yes. and jade, i'll just add-i mean, obviously, david speaks to the collaboration between the groups and our own involvement in between debt equity and investments in different sectors like that. i think one of the phenomenon we're seeing, right, as you've kind of redlined retail and certainly at least temporarily, being extremely cautious on lodging assets today, with that reduction in the denominator of effectively makes you look outside the normal four or five food groups of our investment universe, right. and i think when you look around, what you see is extremely consistent rental collections despite this downturn in that sector. and so, i do think it's an attractive place to play and i think it's also an asset that becomes very leverageable by our counterparts. so, i think it is something that will see an increased share of the pie going forward.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
thank you. and can you give a flavor for some of the other types of transactions in the pipeline? you said, you're very excited about the potential to deploy capital.
bryan donohoe -- partner, head of real estate debt
yes. i mean, what we've seen is, as certain banks have pulled back from the markets, we're seeing attractive opportunities in industrial that have typically been more well banked by the super regional banks and the like. and certainly in the multi-family space, the continued liquidity being provided by fannie and freddie has really been an anchor for that market. and so, we can step into assets that are in lease-up in the markets that we cited some of those tax migration areas, mid-rise buildings that have been just almost uniformly less affected by the virus or the fallout from the virus, and really attach at interesting levels, and create meaningfully higher spreads relative to where these same assets would have traded 12 months ago. beyond that, i think there's certainly, you know, continue to be a smattering of more esoteric asset classes that you've seen become more incumbent in the real estate equity markets, but the primary focus is going to remain in cash flowing multi-family, industrial and the like.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
thanks. in terms of the non-accrual loans, what's the aggregate number of individual loans on non-accrual? and are there any additional loans targeted for sale?
tae-sik yoon -- partner, chief financial officer of ares real estate group and chief financial officer and treasurer
sure, jade. so the number of loans in non-accrual status is three. you know, early this year, right at the onset of the pandemic, i think we had four loans. we have taken one off non-accrual status based upon some modifications that we were able to get done with the borrower, which resulted in both a partial pay down and some funding of reserves that really significantly increased the likelihood of, you know, interest payments, so we took the one loan off of non-accrual. so, as of 3q we have three loans that are, that are on non-accrual. and in terms of loans for sale, now, as of 09/30, we had no loans held for sale. as of second quarter, as we mentioned, you know, we had a couple of loans that were held for sale. we took the marks through unrealized loss in the second quarter, and obviously reversed that in the third quarter, so you'll see some activities there, but as of third quarter, there is no loans available for sale.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
and in terms of the outlook for those three loans, what do you anticipate happening?
tae-sik yoon -- partner, chief financial officer of ares real estate group and chief financial officer and treasurer
i think with respect to those three loans, and really the entire portfolio, conversations have remained very constructive with our borrowers. and, you know, we've continued to maintain dialogue on a weekly basis with them and we're seeing increased collections throughout the portfolios we mentioned, right. if we look at the trend line, we've been picking up a point or two on rent collections underlying the portfolio throughout, you know, certainly for the last three, four months. and that progress and the fact that these borrowers, in most cases have continued to infuse equity into the assets, makes us feel pretty confident that resolution will be positive ultimately. and i think like a lot of borrowers today, i think they need more time to execute their business plan, but we still feel confident in the ultimate outcome.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
thank you very much.
bryan donohoe -- partner, head of real estate debt
and just add to that, jade.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
go on.
bryan donohoe -- partner, head of real estate debt
just adds to that, i think, you know, again, it's important to note that the three loans that are on non-accrual are unique and that they continue to pay current interest, so they are not behind an interest, and yet, you know, i think we took steps to put them on non-accrual and start amortizing down our carrying value, you know, as we are receiving the interest payments. but again, i just want to make sure, you know, this is not the typical non-accrual situation where you're not accruing and you're not receiving the interest payments. in these all three situations, we're actually receiving the interest payments and yet we're still maintaining them on non-accrual status.
jade rahmani -- kbw -- analyst
thanks very much.
bryan donohoe -- partner, head of real estate debt
thank you, jade.

[operator instructions] the next question is from charlie [phonetic] jpmorgan.
charlie -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, good afternoon, everybody. thanks for taking the questions. i noticed in the q there was four loan modifications that happened in the quarter. can you talk to the nature of those modifications, and i'm wondering if those were all met with additional equity contributions from the sponsors?
bryan donohoe -- partner, head of real estate debt
yes, certainly. good question. i think as a backdrop, given the types of assets we finance, and especially, if you compare what we do relative to cmbs, where it's really kind of a closed circuit, loan modifications can be done in the normal course as business plans progress, accelerate, decelerate and the like. and obviously, the impact of covid has caused both acceleration in certain business plans and deceleration in others. in general, the things that we will tweak are going to be maturity date, certain deferral of covenants, and in almost every instance, we're getting something in return for that, that makes sense based on the specific business plan and situation. so-and in many cases, that does include an equity infusion. and as i indicated earlier, we think that equity infusion that has been made in the normal course by these borrowers speaks to their own belief in their equity investment, and i think, that speaks positively to ultimate outcome for the debt investment as well.
charlie -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay, got it. and then, if you could just specifically provide any additional color on the alabama student housing loan, i think the maturity was extended to december of this year, just wondering how things are progressing on that asset?
bryan donohoe -- partner, head of real estate debt
you know, that's an asset that certainly fits into that category of a business plan interrupted by covid and the plan is for that asset to be sold by the current owner. and i think the extension just gives really a runway for that sale to occur.
charlie -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. okay, thanks very much for taking the question.

operator
good afternoon, and welcome to ares commercial real estate corporation's conference call to discuss the company's third quarter 2020 financial results. [operator instructions]
i will now turn the call over to veronica mayer from investor relations.
veronica mendiola mayer -- principal
good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today's conference call. i am joined today by our ceo, bryan donohoe; david roth, our president; tae-sik yoon, our cfo; and carl drake, our head of public company, investor relations. in addition to our press release and the 10-q that we filed with the sec, we have posted an earnings presentation under the investor resources section of our website at www.arescre.com. before we begin, i want to remind everyone that comments made during the course of this conference call and webcast and the accompanying documents contain forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties. many of these forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as anticipates, believes, expects, intends, will, should, may, and similar expressions. these forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations of market conditions and management's judgment. these statements are not guarantees of future performance, condition or results and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. the company's actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those listed in its sec filings. ares commercial real estate corporation assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. during this conference call, we will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures. we use these as measures of operating performance, and these measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. these measures may not be comparable to like-titled measures used by other companies.
with that, i will now turn the call over to bryan donohoe.
bryan donohoe -- partner, head of real estate debt
thanks, veronica. and thanks everyone for joining today. as you can see from our earnings release, our business continues to perform well despite conditions brought on by the pandemic. in order to understand how we are positioned today, i think it's important to first remind everyone that since the inception of acre, we are focused on defensively positioning our portfolio to withstand market downturns. for example, we carefully structured our loans with meaningful covenant protections to make sure we can protect our rights. we held firm in our deal negotiations to ensure that we are protected from falling interest rates by getting libor floors. we maintained the portfolio with a 94% allocation to senior mortgage loans, and we purposefully avoided marketable securities. we shied away from what we viewed as overpriced gateway markets and pivoted more and more to multi-family, office properties with long-term leases, and industrial properties and focused on areas with lower cost of living, lower state taxes, and growing demographics. we diversified our funding sources, especially with respect to more volatile asset classes such as hospitality, and structured our financing so that we do not have margin calls based on changes in market spreads. we believe our ability to successfully navigate this cycle is in part due to these strategic decisions. as a result, our portfolio quality, earnings, and dividends have all remained relatively stable. this stability can be seen through our third quarter core earnings per share of $0.31, which is consistent with our second quarter levels. it can also be seen in the credit performance of our portfolio in the quarter.
our portfolio has a number of attributes that drive this stability. it is very well diversified across 49 different loans and is primarily collateralized by multi-family, office, and industrial properties. we have a total of five hotel loans, all of which are limited or operative select service models, and no loans that are collateralized by stand-alone retail centers. our 49 loans are spread across 17 different markets with minimal exposure to gateway cities and with no full service lodging assets in any of these gateway cities. within our multi-family and office portfolio, we focus on light transitional properties where there are generally increasing cash flows and growing tenancy, which we believe counteract some macro headwinds that may exist. our office portfolio is primarily comprised of class a properties and their respective markets with institutional quality tenants and long-term leases. in fact, the average remaining lease for our top 30 tenants by the percentage of leased area is 5.5 years longer than the fully extended average term of our loans. we have less than 2% exposure to co-working tenants in our office portfolio. similarly, in our multi-family portfolio, we have avoided major cities and luxury high rises. in both our multi-family and office properties, we are continuing to see positive trends in underlying tenant rent collections in the mid-90% range and the average occupancy rate for our multi-family portfolio is at approximately 90%. the work of our dedicated asset management team has been exceptional, and is also reflected in the performance of our portfolio. this is a real strength of our platform.
in the third quarter, there were no changes to the number of loans on non-accrual status. and 100% of our loans held for investment made their contractual debt service payments for the quarter and for the october payments date. our internal loan risk ratings also remained steady. on a one to five rating scale, with one being the lowest risk and five being the highest, 91% of our loans were rated a three or better, with an average rating of 3.0. in addition, our liquidity position remains stable at approximately $91 million. we have also taken the initiative to further reduce our leverage. we now sit at 2.8 times debt-to-equity overall, and 1.8 times on a recourse basis, levels that we believe are appropriate for financing investment portfolio consisting of 94% senior loans. as we've navigated this time pandemic with improving liquidity, we believe we are in a position to begin selectively making new investments, albeit with a high bar for safety and appropriate returns. our team's been active in other parts of our business and we're seeing a substantial pickup in both the quantity and quality of transactions. this is especially true in property types that have historically had less volatility like multi-family, industrial, self storage, and in states benefiting from tax migration. our goal remains to rigorously preserve our credit quality, while having the optionality to go on offense based on the opportunity set, which we're really excited about. overall, we're proud of our team and efforts to-date, which have resulted in acre's ability to pay a stable and consistent dividend to shareholders.
i'm going to now turn the call over to tae-sik for some additional details on our third quarter results and financial position.
tae-sik yoon -- partner, chief financial officer of ares real estate group and chief financial officer and treasurer
great. thank you, bryan. and good afternoon, everyone. earlier today, we reported gaap net income of $14.9 million or $0.44 per common share, and core earnings of $10.5 million or $0.31 per common share, largely consistent with our prior quarter results. our earnings continue to benefit from libor floors, with 95% of our loans having such built-in protection at a weighted average rate of 1.74%. as discussed in our last earnings call, during the second and third quarters, we sold or monetized five loans at an average of 97% of par, including one hotel loan. these transactions improved our cash position, reduced our hotel exposure, and lowered our overall leverage. the difference between our gaap and core earnings in the third quarter reflects the $4 million or $0.12 per common share in loss associated with the sale of two of these loans. with respect to westchester marriott, performance continue to improve in the third quarter. we are seeing the positive impact of our plan to reduce expenses and rebuild our revenue base. our sales and marketing team successfully solicited government and other central workers. and our hotel has benefited from less competition from other properties in the area that are either temporarily or permanently closed. as of september 30, 2020, we continued to build book value up to $14.03 per common share, versus $13.91 at the end of the second quarter of 2020.
turning to our liquidity, as of yesterday's close, we had approximately $91 million in unrestricted cash. given our earnings from operations outlook and current cash flow needs, we believe that our liquidity levels are appropriate. however, should the need for further liquidity arise, we have additional sources of cash available to us, including reinvestment capacity under the ares warehouse. now, let me discuss our liabilities and debt facilities. we continue to reduce our debt to equity ratio to 2.8 times versus three times at the end of the second quarter, and 3.2 times as of the end of the first quarter, all of which excludes cecl reserves. on a recourse basis, our debt-to-equity leverage is 1.8 times. and as a reminder, none of our warehouse financing facilities contain mark-to-market remarketing provisions that are based on changes in market borrowing spreads. finally, our cecl reserve was at $27 million at the end of the third quarter, lower by approximately $1 million from the prior quarter. this reduction in the cecl reserve was primarily attributable to contract reductions and loan commitments and pay downs, and the shorter average remaining term in the overall loan portfolio.
and with that, i will now turn the call back over to bryan for some closing remarks.
bryan donohoe -- partner, head of real estate debt
thanks, tae-sik. in conclusion, we believe we are very well positioned based on the differentiated actions we took to structure our portfolio defensively prior to the pandemic. all of the actions we have taken to defensively position our portfolio diversify our loans geographically and by market and spread out of our funding sources has positioned us to deliver consistent earnings and dividends. with our current liquidity position, we expect to be in a position to selectively take advantage of the more attractive investment opportunities, which we believe we will continue to see in the market going forward. we appreciate the support from our shareholders and employees. and thank you for the time today.
with that, i'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. thank you.
",2020-Q3,ACRE
,,0.6829,,":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question will come from steve delaney with jmp securities. please go ahead.
steve delaney -- jmp securities llc -- analyst
thanks. hello everyone. really just my one main question that i have listening to your comments and the deck, repays look like they were fairly light in the second quarter at $125 million or about 7% of the funded portfolio. do you have some insight or view to what might -- how that level of repay might play out over the second half of this year? thanks.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks. good question. i think one of the factors is the active asset management that our team works through in the portfolio. and we're in constant dialogue with our borrowers to understand and try to get as much transparency as we can about future repayments and we'll work to kind of keep what we can and keep what makes sense in the portfolio and extend the life cycle of loans, or i think that active asset management that is certainly a big part of our platform, benefits us to some degree there.
the way we're managing it though, probably most importantly, is that we're going to operate as if the expectation is that as our loan portfolio matures, that we will see some accelerated repayments. so we're going to manage the book as if it's coming. but thus far it has been probably more muted than we would have expected and we'll continue to manage it as actively as we can, but really tough to put a specific point on it, but it's certainly a focus of ours.
steve delaney -- jmp securities llc -- analyst
and obviously, you're trying to ramp up lending and take advantage of current opportunities to have that pipeline, in case that you do get a spike, right, or you can maintain and hopefully slightly grow your portfolio, especially with the new common equity. would you -- let me put it this way and understand you don't want to give a specific, a lot of this is unknown, right, in terms of borrower behavior over the next five months of the year. but i think i heard you say that the recent rate or at least that 7% in a quarter, it sounded like you do view that is maybe a little surprisingly on the light side, if i heard you correctly.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
to a degree, i mean, look, i think each of the assets that we've invested in, if you think about bottoms up underwriting approach, each asset, underwritten specifically and each asset is going to have a different life cycle. but if we -- portfolio wide in normal course, right, we're thinking about these loans being kind of two and a half to three years of weighted average life. and some of the repayments as we're all aware of were muted last year. so we're managing the book as if we're going to see more of that repayment and to your point, we've really focused on making sure that we are a net positive from a deployment perspective. and beyond that, just active dialogue with these borrowers to understand and have as much transparency as possible but on a macro level, we just -- we think about it in terms of weighted average life and being around that 30 to 36 month period.
steve delaney -- jmp securities llc -- analyst
thanks for the comments, bryan. i'm going to leave the rest of the topics to the guys coming up behind me. thanks.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
appreciate it.
operator
our next question will come from rick shane with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
richard shane -- j.p. morgan securities llc -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for taking my questions this morning. look, there's been a steady ramp in originations, and if we look back, you are on pace to potentially have your strongest year ever, especially, we sort of think about what july look like in terms of fundings in volume. i am curious when we think about the binding constraints on the model going forward, and we think about capital and we think about repayments. i'm curious how much scalability you think you have on the origination side? i think it's pretty clear that you can source of $1 billion of funding a year. do you think you can go meaningfully above that? and again, i'm not asking for guidance, i'm asking just from a capability perspective, if the balance sheet supports it.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
yeah, great question. look, i think that we tried to touch on in our earlier discussion was really the breadth of the platform, right. we built out an origination team to match the scale that we feel we have capacity for in this business. and i think some of our capital raises that that tae-sik touched on what it allows us to do is improve upon the quality of our borrowers, right, just scale does the larger loan sizes will ultimately come with more institutional sponsorship groups.
but the scale that we can now attach to in terms of originations is such that it's larger loan sizes. so it's not just the number of deals that is going to increase. it's the size of the loans. and i think the quality of the sponsor and properties kind of comes in and come in with that. so i think we've built a team -- to summarize, we've built a team to certainly attack the opportunity set that we see in the space, but it's not just simply adding to the quantity of deals. it's adding to the size of the deals that allows us to do that.
richard shane -- j.p. morgan securities llc -- analyst
got it. okay. that's very helpful. and look, i understand there's been a long-term investment in the origination platform, and i think right now that the opportunity is really sort of catching up with that. thank you, guys.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question will come from jade rahmani with kbw. please go ahead.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
thank you very much. what are your thoughts around the sustainability of the supplemental dividend as you think about future runoff on the portfolio, incremental investment yields, cost of financings, other capital avenues the company may explore.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
yeah, great question jade. why don't i -- i'll let tae-sik take it at the outset here and i'll add some color.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
great. yeah, no, it's a great question, jade. earlier this year, when we instituted the supplemental dividend of $0.02, we obviously said that we expect that to set dividend to be in place for the full year of 2021. and that toward the end of the year, we would reevaluate kind of what to do with that $0.02 supplemental dividend, obviously, so far we've announced three quarters of that dividend consistent with our initial indications. and again, we're certainly on pace for the fourth quarter to do the same, obviously we haven't declared that yet. but i think we're on pace to do that.
i think as you referred to the libor floors, with a limited amount of repayment that we've had so far for the six -- for the first six months of this year, we've been able to continue to maintain very strong benefit from libor floors. so you can see that even as of the end of second quarter, the weighted average libor floor was 1.36% versus call it 10 basis points spot one-month libor today. so we're well within the money of our libor floors. there has been some runoff obviously since the beginning of the year, but continue to generate very strong positive incremental income from the libor floors itself.
the other thing we're doing obviously is we know this is a finite life asset, and therefore we are positioned a portfolio and we have a number of levers that we think we can exercise and take advantage of to make sure that when these libor floors are of much smaller benefit than they are today that we will have sufficient earnings to continue to pay out a very attractive dividends. obviously, one of them who we talked about in the context of further scale is even more efficient forms of financing, right. so with greater scale, we believe we can take advantage of more efficient forms of financing that provides higher proceeds, but most importantly, lower cost of debt. we think our deployment levels will continue to grow, so that we will have more and more of our available capital put to work. we will always obviously push for spreads on our assets try to push down at the same time, our cost of funding.
and then finally, with greater scale, i mean, obviously we've grown our capital base, as we mentioned by 45%. and with greater scale, we believe that that we will also enjoy some g&a savings, right, as a percentage of our equity base. today, we find ourselves at 2.1 debt to equity. so the -- if you want to call it the organic earnings that we're able to generate is sort of under optimized right now, because of that under leveraged position today. but we do plan on adding incremental leverage to our balance sheet to get much, much closer, if not right at the target of 3.0 debt to equity.
so i think those are all the levers that we believe will -- we have available to us. we're obviously very, very busy implementing all of those strategies. and so as the libor floors runoff, we will implement those strategies to maintain our earnings as much as possible. and at that time, i think we'll make the decision of what to do with the supplemental dividend longer-term. but for now, again, we are comfortable saying that for 2021, we will maintain our supplemental dividend and that toward year end, we'll be in a much better position to talk about what to do with it on a go-forward basis.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
bryan, did you have any additional comments?
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
no, jade. i think tae-sik covered it well. i think you talked about the different avenues that we would explore. and i think the primary one tae-sik finished with which is just our leverage capacity, which is there's a lot of different forms of leverage available to us. and i think we can continue to press on that efficiency. and i think we'll see the benefit from that moving forward.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
thanks. couple of questions on credit, the decline in non-accrual loans to $31.3 million from $66.8 million, i apologize i didn't get a chance to go through all the footnotes, but could you just discuss what took place there?
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
yeah tae-sik, you want to cover that?
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. so jade, i mean, obviously we had three loans on non-accrual status. and just this last quarter, we took two off non-accrual. one is a student housing project, the other one is a hotel. the student housing project itself was sold and a new party came in, put in additional equity. we were fortunate enough to be able to work with this new buyer to keep the property in our portfolio. there was basically $6 million net equity injected into the property. and we think the new owner, the new operator sponsor here. it was a great business plan to sort of reinvigorate this property. but certainly with having the same collateral, but $6 million less than proceeds -- we felt that was appropriate, certainly because it's a new loan as well to no longer have that property on non-accrual status.
and the amount of repayment that we had on our original loan was sufficient to certainly more than cover our carrying value of the loan. so we took no loss, in fact, showed a small gain versus our carrying value versus what we received in terms of the principal repayment. the second property that we took off non-accrual status is a portfolio of hotel loans. again, as you know, we were very scrutinizing of our hotel portfolio during the pandemic. this portfolio of hotels, particularly in the last three months has shown sort of very robust increase in occupancy, in adr, and in revpar.
frankly, it's probably come back to beyond pre-pandemic levels. and now that it has shown sustained recovery of its performance, again, we thought that was appropriate to take it off of non-accrual status. so as you mentioned, that leaves us with one property collateralized by -- one loan collateralized by a hotel that remains on non-accrual status, again, we're hopeful that this property will continue to show some improvement. we don't think that improvement has been enough and hasn't been sustained enough to make the transition, but certainly trending in the right direction as well.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
and on the modification side, i think usually you guys disclose number of modifications or the aggregate amount of principal that it relates to and i can see that in the 10-q, i'm assuming perhaps there were no modifications, but one or two double-check that.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah jade, i think that's right. again, nothing really worth noting, obviously the two loans that we mentioned that are past the maturity, we have not modified and we have allowed them to be in their status quo, but yes, nothing material.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
and just the two loans in maturity default, what do you think the timing of resolution is for those? and it seems you did not take an impairment or book a reserve anything of that nature. so you feel there's adequate coverage on the asset side.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
yeah, part of the -- sorry, go ahead, tae-sik. i'll jump in after.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
okay, sorry about it. yeah, no, i'm just going to just mention on the impairment side, yeah, no, jade, i think that's the most important point here, right is we do believe there is sufficient collateral to protect us from an impairment. obviously, that's the reason we don't believe that an impairment in either case is warranted. as you know, we've had situations in the past where we've had default and we felt it was in our best interest to put the loans in default. so that we will have proper positioning with the borrower to negotiate the best resolution, but bryan, why don't you go ahead? i just wanted to make a comment certainly on the impairment question.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
yeah. and i'll just add specific to your question jade on the timing. like, we've -- i mentioned the active asset management earlier, we've got the capacity and the expertise to kind of work through loan issues in a lot of different formats, right? there's a lot of arrows in the quiver, so to speak from acceleration through just kind of calling the default. and in this case, we think that the best resolution and most timely is through just allowing us as tae-sik said, allowing these loans to sit in the status they are. but i think that the default interest in some other economic factors will accelerate the resolution of these transactions in the near-term.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
thank you for taking your questions.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
hey, jade. just one thing before you leave. i just want to mention, in terms of modification, the answer is no, we didn't make any modification in terms of what a borrower would typically request. just to be complete, i just wanted to mention that we did make so-called one modification of a loan on a multi-family loan, because we wanted to a potential maturity was coming up and we wanted to keep that loan on our books. so we did, i guess, if you want to call it, technically modify it, but it wasn't due to the loan not performing. in fact, it's the opposite. this is a loan we want to keep. and so we were able to do that and keep this loan on our books.
jade rahmani -- keefe, bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
thanks and good to know that. appreciate it.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you. thank you, jade.

our next question will come from stephen laws with raymond james. please go ahead.
stephen laws -- raymond james & associates, inc. -- analyst
hi. good morning. good discussion so far and wanted to touch on the reo asset, revenue came in, a good bit above what i was looking for. can you talk about the trajectory there with that asset and how do we think about seasonality with the asset versus more of a straight line recovery from covid on the hotel.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
yeah, good question. i think the performance of the asset somewhat speaks for itself. and i appreciate you picking up on that. and i think thematically, it's based on a lot of what we've touched on in prior quarters reduction in kind of an unnatural reduction in supply in the market, and a lot of work to harvest as much demand as we could in that geography. it's tough to say, how see -- my gut is that seasonality, which impacts most hotels will be a little bit tougher to predict this year, just as people come out of covid and make their plans and kind of -- i don't necessarily think you'll be as tethered to the traditional calendars as we've been historically.
typically, in the market the first quarter, first couple months of the year is kind of a little bit slower. but demand has been positively trending for the asset. and then just to add to that, i'd say that just because we talk about it in most quarters, in terms of where we see the alternate resolution based on the recovery you see in the numbers. i think we will continue to monitor and explore the ultimate resolution of the asset over the next few quarters as well.
stephen laws -- raymond james & associates, inc. -- analyst
great. and when i think about the operating expenses there, i mean, can we take the sequential change and think about that as the variable expenses associated with that amount of incremental revenue? are there other factors either plus or minus that number that we should consider?
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
i think it's been pretty constructive in general in terms of the way we've worked with the manager there to kind of operate in a -- as we've described a kind of a mid service model. and i think to the extent that we're seeing increased revenues, clearly some operational expenses will come parcel with that. but i think we'll continue to be constructive in terms of limiting expenses and making sure that we're focused on margins as well as revenues.
stephen laws -- raymond james & associates, inc. -- analyst
great. and then i wanted to follow up on steve's question earlier, just as far as managing portfolio growth and repayments coming in. and i went back and looked a couple of years ago unfunded commitments were in the mid teens. you guys have those in the high single digits now under 10. i know you've got the pipeline -- you've got the ares facility, is that enough to manage the upcoming repayments as those start to come in 6 or 12 months? or do you think you'll take back that up the unfunded commitments side, back up into the mid or high teens?
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
good question. tae-sik do you want to touch on that a little bit.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
sure. no, i think, obviously we have a number of things that we can do on the balance sheet to help manage repayments and making sure that we're as fully deployed and interest earning as possible. i mean, you certainly mentioned one, which is the ares warehouse line. ares warehouse line as you know is about $200 million plus of capacity that we would have to do senior loans there. it is something that has been very, very valuable to us particularly during the pandemic to help manage the liquidity and needs of acre.
and i think going forward, i think it will be extremely helpful for us to, again, put loans on the ares warehouse line. so that, again, real-time we have the ability to bring it back on to the balance sheet as loans pay off on the acre side itself. in addition, we have, as we mentioned, significant debt capacity right now. we are significantly under-levered from our target of 3-0. so i think the best strategy to manage repayments frankly is to make sure that we are as fully invested as fast as we can make good loans and find ourselves in a position where we will be fully invested.
we'll have loans in the ares warehouse and we will be in a good position at that point then to handle the upcoming repayment. and again, one of the strategies that we just covered in one example that we'll continue to push on is we'll work very hard to keep the loans that we want on our books. and if that means generating more attractive terms for the borrower. we certainly will do that to make sure that we're at least at market. but there are certainly a number of strategies that we can do to help mitigate what we would anticipate to be the growing repayments in the upcoming quarters.
stephen laws -- raymond james & associates, inc. -- analyst
great. appreciate the color on that tae-sik. thanks for the commentary today.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
absolutely stephen, thank you.
operator
our next question will come from doug harter with credit suisse. please go ahead.
doug harter -- credit suisse securities (usa) llc -- analyst
thanks. could you talk about the spreads that you're -- that you got on kind of 2q loans and 3q to-date and how that compares to the existing portfolio?
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
yeah, good question. i think, notwithstanding the scale deployments, there's -- we mentioned the inefficiencies in the market in general. there's been compression around multi-family and industrial, but kind of in keeping with that financing costs are similarly compressed and really in a pretty good state of equilibrium, i would say. so if we took it as a whole, you're seeing relative value in the real estate that generally, but really with spreads that are in line with pre-pandemic levels, but a little bit of disparity in terms of asset class allocation at this point.
doug harter -- credit suisse securities (usa) llc -- analyst
got it. and bryan, you mentioned that, one of the benefits of scale is kind of being able to move up in size and in quality of the underlying sponsors and borrowers, i guess, how did that translate? do you give up some spread to move -- to make that move up or just how would you compare relative value there?
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
yes, i think, i'd be remiss to say that higher quality sponsors don't garner some lower coupons. i think that if we think about the underlying mission, right, which is to create a stable platform -- stable portfolio to deliver yields to our investor base. i think the higher quality sponsors and performance and quality of asset that comes with that is a net benefit. and again, as tae-sik touches on each quarter, we don't -- we certainly focused on the spreads themselves of the loans we make. but the real focus is on the margin between our borrowing costs and the loans we make. and so what the higher quality loans, the more scaled positions allows us to have more pricing power as it relates to our lender counterparties. so net-net, despite potentially coupons that come down and keeping with the quality of the sponsors, i think we're in a better place overall.
doug harter -- credit suisse securities (usa) llc -- analyst
great. thank you, bryan.
operator
our next question will come from tim hayes with btig. please go ahead.
timothy hayes -- btig -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, guys. thanks for taking my questions. first one, obviously tonight's growth this quarter, but interest income was pretty flat sequentially. so just curious if there was a timing mismatch between originations being a closed in the back end of the quarter versus repayments on the front end, or if maybe there were just some older vintages that paid off. so you got less prepayment income, just trying to reconcile that.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
yeah, tim, i think, timing sort of any quarter, certainly makes a big difference, right? and i think you're right. i think some of the loans that we closed in the second quarter really were much more back-ended for the second quarter. so you didn't see as much income being generated for the quarter. the second thing that worked is that because we are less deployed in terms of our leverage, as i mentioned, 2.1, we continue to accrue the amortization of fees associated with much of our interest expenses, and that is not being spread over a bigger borrowed amount. and so you'll see a little bit of a tick up in our borrowing costs as well.
so i think those are probably two major reasons for not seeing that lift. if you want to call it that with the higher originated balance. but i think you'll see that start to even out in the third quarter. as we mentioned in the third quarter, so far we've kind of had the opposite situation, which is great, right, which is that we've closed $200-plus-million of loans in the first month of the quarter, unlike second quarter where again, most of the loans were a little bit more back ended.
timothy hayes -- btig -- analyst
right, makes sense. and then, excuse me, on the capital stack, it's small, but i know you have the term loan that $60 million of term loan coming due, i forget exactly when, but sometime in the next few months, i believe. and just curious how you feel about addressing that if you're considering up-sizing it and refinancing at a lower cost, given other execution in the market, or if there are other forms of debt capital you're considering to add to the cap stack that can help kind of satisfy that maturity?
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
sure. no, great question. so the $60 million term loan comes due in december of this year, so a couple of months away. basically as you know the history here is that it began as $110 million term loan and we did pay down $50 million of it earlier this year, so leaving a balance of $60 million. today's capital markets, there are numerous options for us to pursue. as i mentioned, basically getting our company closer or if not to the full target leverage over the next few months is a big priority of ours right from 2.1 to closer to 3.0.
and as part of that, leveraging off of the balance sheet, i think paying down the $60 million term loan debt and recapitalizing the company with different forms of leverage is certainly something that we are well underway, analyzing and executing on. whether we'll replace it with another term loan, whether we'll refinance with our existing lender, whether we'll pursue other forms of debt capital, such as convertible notes on secure, there is quite a few debt available -- debt capital available that is out there.
and so, we feel we're in a very good spot to do it. final answer of course is that, $60 million is a relatively small amount of debt as a ball of maturity. so not too concerned about the amount itself, but it is going to be basically a refinance as part of an overall sort of recapitalization plan of our debt as we continue to increase our debt-to-equity from 2.1 up to 3.0.
timothy hayes -- btig -- analyst
yeah, makes sense. okay. and then to my last question kind of on the -- nearly 50% of your originations were in the industrial space this quarter. i know that the mortgage reit space, the commercial lenders have typically had a hard time finding a lot of loans that kind of fit their strategy in that sector. so i'm curious if you could just touch on your pipeline where that's -- i guess where that's coming from, if it really has to do with the ares platform and your expertise on the equity side in that space providing some resources to you guys?
and then, along those same lines, are there opportunities as you target larger loans? is there opportunities for you to do significantly larger loans that can be kind of syndicated across different areas, vehicles and hope you get some exposure to higher quality sponsors, higher quality assets without having a giant capital commitment.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah, good question, tim, i'll answer your second question first, which is to say yeah, there is the opportunity to utilize different parts of the broader platform to capitalize assets and benefit in the ways that you're noting. so i think that is a significant progression of where we sit as a team today. and i think our investors in acre will benefit from that moving forward. with respect to the industrial asset in question, a couple of things come to mind. first and foremost, i think where your direction -- your question is headed is, is that the pricing for fully stabilized industrial is a little bit more core in nature than which would -- than that, which would likely fit into the mortgage rate model.
i think what we benefit from with respect to the asset and the question is really two things. first and foremost, it is a high conviction asset class for us historically at areas in the debt and equity space. and we do think that the addition of black creek to the broader platform also brings some particular insights that allows us to participate in the asset class at different parts of the asset's life cycle, right? so earlier and prior to stabilization, we can have higher conviction in the space based on the expertise and the amount of investment history we have in the sector. and then secondly, the nature of this acquisition specifically was with a repeat sponsor. and the timeline for closing was such that it really allowed us to take advantage of certain attributes of the closing process and find an asset in the sector that matched up with the roe targets that we have more broadly
timothy hayes -- btig -- analyst
understood. well, i appreciate the comments as always guys. thank you.

operator
good afternoon. and welcome to the ares commercial real estate corporation's conference call to discuss the company's second quarter 2021 financial results. as a reminder this conference call is being recorded on july 30, 2021.
i will now like to turn the call over to john stilmar from investor relations.
john stilmar -- investor relations
good afternoon. and thank you for joining us on today's conference call. i am joined today by our ceo, bryan donohoe; tae-sik yoon, our cfo; and carl drake, our head of public company investor relations. in addition to our press release and the 10-q that we filed with the sec, we have posted an earnings presentation under the investor resources section of our website at www.arescre.com.

now i would like to turn the call over to ares commercial real estate's ceo, bryan donohoe, who will walk through our second quarter earnings results. bryan?
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
thanks, john and good afternoon everybody. this morning, we announced another strong quarter with distributable earnings of $0.37 per share up 16% year-over-year. we are pleased with our performance, which is primarily being driven by our portfolio of strong and diverse credits, increased investment activity, reduced funding costs and the continuing benefits we received from our libor floors. our company continues to benefit from ares scaled real estate platform alongside of growing economy and a more active real estate market with improving fundamentals.
overall, as individual property transaction activity has increased over the quarter, we are now at levels commensurate with the second quarter of 2019. the improving economy is also driving broad-based rent growth, which is improving across all major property sectors with particular strength in multi-family, one of our favorite and targeted sectors. against this backdrop of improving fundamentals, we are seeing an attractive, competitive landscape highlighted by post-pandemic market inefficiencies on the origination side, while stronger players like us are able to benefit from more attractive funding.
this has resulted in a more fragmented marketplace that enables scale platforms such as those affiliated with ares to find attractive investment opportunities and grow market share. the capabilities and reach of the broad ares platform are driving, sourcing advantages throughout our space and even more specifically in high conviction property types, such as industrial and multi-family, as well as in favorite segments, such as self storage, student housing and select office opportunities. the increased size and diversity of our investment pipeline enables us to remain highly selective closing less than 5% of the loans we evaluate, while maintaining a strong deployment pace.
the result of this is that we are seeing loan opportunities with all-in spreads that are approximately in line with pre-pandemic levels, but with attachment points and credit terms, that tend to be more attractive than pre-pandemic structures. the strength of our platform and the market opportunities, have enabled us to accelerate our new investment commitments. in fact, the second quarter commitments of $311 million represented the third consecutive period in which we grew new commitments and origination volumes.
this higher loan activity is also driven by incumbent borrow relationships as approximately 64% of our commitments to this quarter came from repeat borrowers. however, we were also pleased to find strong receptivity for new high-quality sponsors, given the breadth of our product offerings. as an example, during the second quarter, we closed a $38 million multi-family loan with a new sponsor that is one of the largest multi-family owner operators in the southeast with more than 30,000 units under management. this origination momentum is continuing into the third quarter with approximately $254 million of new commitments closed thus far in july.
in order to support our expanded investment pipeline and greater investment activity, we issued 6.5 million common shares to raise just over $100 million of common equity at a 10% premium to book value near the end of the second quarter. the benefits of scale from our two equity raises this year will enable us to further gain market share during an attractive time to invest as the overall economy continues to recover. as far as the capital we raised in june, we are working hard to invest the majority of the net proceeds in the third quarter, but do expect that the additional shares that we have issued to have a temporary, modest impact to our earnings per share in the third quarter.
however, given our expected pace of capital deployment, we do not expect that our fourth quarter earnings will be impacted. most importantly, as we have said consistently from the beginning of this year in connection with the announcement of our supplemental $0.02 per share quarter dividend, we continue to expect full coverage of both our regular and supplemental dividends from our distributable earnings for the full year 2021. turning to the portfolio, our book remains 98% invested in senior loans. and approximately two thirds of our loans are collateralized by multi-family office, industrial and self-storage properties.
we continue to be underweight hotels and retail exposures. and against the backdrop of an improving economy and further bolstered by the strength of our asset management capabilities, we continue to see strengthening of the credit of our portfolio as reflected in our weighted average internal loan risk rating, which improved for a third consecutive quarter to 2.8 as of q2 2021 versus 2.9 in the first quarter and 3.0 at year end 2020. additionally, loans on non-accruals declined from three to one, reflecting the healthy recovery of underlying property performance. while the covid-19 pandemic and all the uncertainty and challenges it brought are not over, we have optimism for the remainder of 2021 and beyond.
with that, i will now turn the call over to tae-sik to provide more details on our second quarter results and financial position.
tae-sik yoon -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, bryan, and good afternoon, everyone. earlier today, we reported gaap net income of $17.6 million or $0.43 per common share and distributable earnings of $15.1 million or $0.37 per common share. our earnings continue to benefit from our libor floors with a 1.36% weighted average one month libor floor on our loan portfolio at the end of the second quarter of 2021. our second quarter gaap earnings also benefited from a $3.9 million reduction in our cecl reserve.
18% decline in our cecl reserve was primarily driven by an improved macroeconomic forecast and as further evidence of the improvement of our loan portfolio risk ratings. and in addition to strong earnings, we continue to grow our book value per share. for the second quarter supported by continued improvement in the credit performance of our portfolio and the accretive 6.5 million share common equity offering that we just executed before quarter-end, our book value per share increased by $0.22 to $14.45 per share.
this marks our fourth consecutive quarter of improving book value per share. now, let me talk about the other side of our balance sheet and specifically the strength of our capitalization and liquidity funding mix. our debt-to-equity ratio was 2.1 times as of the end of the second quarter, excluding cecl reserve. additionally, our earnings and balance sheet continued to benefit from highly efficient match-funded and non-recourse sources of clo financing that now comprise 69% of total outstanding borrowings, up from 34% in the second quarter of 2020.
our non-recourse debt-to-equity ratio now stands below one time. and going forward, we believe that we have additional avenues to further optimize our leverage capacity and further lower our cost of capital. as bryan mentioned, we have increased our common equity capital base by more than 45% since the second quarter of last year. these two equity offerings totaling more than 200 million in common equity have enabled us to begin leveraging some of the benefits for scale.
for example, this greater scale has allowed us to invest in larger, more high quality loans to build even a more diversified portfolio. and on the liability side, there's greater scale, has allowed us to execute on more efficient forms of financing such as being able to complete our second clo financing. before i turn the call back over to bryan, i did want to briefly discuss two loans that are beyond their contractual maturities.
while we continue to work with the respective borrowers, rather than simply agreeing to extend the maturity of these loans, we have decided to keep these loans in the current status to put ourselves in the best position to negotiate successful resolutions and outcomes. please note that we believe that we are protected through sufficient collateral values and have not taken any impairment or put these two loans on non-accrual status as of the second quarter of 2021.
and with that, let me turn the call back over to bryan for some closing remarks.
bryan donohoe -- chief executive officer
great. thanks tae-sik. in summary, we're continuing to execute against our strategic and financial goals for the company. during the second quarter, we delivered strong earnings and healthy and improving credit quality in our portfolio. we are well-capitalized to invest our capital into the attractive market opportunities we see in front of us. we believe we remain on track to continue to deliver strong profitability for our shareholders and to meet our financial goals for the year. we greatly appreciate the support of our investors and for your time today.
with that, i'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions. thank you.

thanks. i just want to get your thoughts around leverage going forward, 2.5 times seems relatively conservative versus some of your peers, but you kind of commented that you were kind of relatively fully deployed in terms of capital. so just kind of want to get your thoughts on leverage?
tae-sik yoon -- partner, cfo & treasurer
sure, doug. this is tae-sik yoon. thank you very much for your question. no, you're absolutely right. our long-term target leverage rate for our company is 3.0 and obviously, prior to the pandemic, those were the type of levels that we were able to maintain. during the pandemic, we obviously emphasized liquidity and so took our leverage down as low as the low 2s and we have been building up from there. fortunately, we have been able to more than maintain our earnings more than able to cover our dividend with lower levels of leverage. but it is our intent. it is our goal to take it up to approximately 3.0 on a long-term basis. some periods, it'll be lower than that, some periods will be slightly higher than that. but we do think it will be hovering right around 3.0, which really means versus september 30, 2021, that we have about half a turn of leverage, which is around $350 million of additional capacity that we want to put on to the balance sheet, largely in the form of debt capital to get us to that 3.0 leverage ratio.
douglas michael harter -- credit suisse ag -- research division-director
i guess, just to be clear on that, tae-sik, i mean, i guess, are you comfortable in today's environment kind of getting up to the 3.0 level versus kind of the conservatism you've shown in the post covid world?
tae-sik yoon -- partner, cfo & treasurer
yes. i'll let bryan speak on this as well in terms of the credit quality. but certainly, one of the things that we always have emphasized is that not all debt is treated equal. so, for example, when we lever our loans using clo debt, collateralized loan obligations debt, we feel very comfortable actually taking it above 3.0. in fact, the two clos that we have today have closer to 4:1 debt-to-equity leverage ratios. and that is because of the type of assets that are included in those clos as well as the type of debt being non-mark-to-market, being match funded really gives us more comfort to take on more leverage than the average 3.0.on the other hand, when we're leveraging loan by loan, using some of our warehouse lines, other forms of financing, oftentimes, we will be below 3.0. so, i think really to answer your question, it is more of a loan by loan, financing by financing decision in terms of risk and rewards, but yes, i would say, bryan will comment further, but i would say we are comfortable given the type of quality assets that we have today and the overall balance sheet today, the fact that we have almost 60% of our liabilities in the form of nonrecourse match-funded debt that we are comfortable at that 3.0 level.
bryan patrick donohoe -- ceo & partner of real estate-new york
and i would just add, doug, i think this is more of a timing issue, more when than an if. i think there's ample liquidity in the space today and being a part of the ares platform and reduced borrowing costs that come alongside that, we think this will be something that will have further results over the next couple of weeks and months.
douglas michael harter -- credit suisse ag -- research division-director
great. thank you.
bryan patrick donohoe -- ceo & partner of real estate-new york
thank you doug.

the next question is from stephen laws with raymond james.
stephen albert laws -- raymond james & associates, inc. -- research division-research analyst
hi. i guess, first, if you comment on the reo asset. revenue was up, looks like margins are profitable and have increased over the last few quarters. can you talk about the outlook there as well as the seasonality we should think about in that asset?
tae-sik yoon -- partner, cfo & treasurer
sure, not absolutely steven. thank you very much for your question. i think, our hotel, we are very pleased with its performance, clearly, it was impacted, just, i think like, almost every other hotel during covid. but i do think a couple of things have benefited us. one is some of the competition in the immediate area have either shut down permanently or on a temporary basis and have left fewer competitors, fewer choices and we've also been very much benefiting from a focus that we've had to put in some necessity workers, and they have been a very strong user, and we're very grateful for that. but we have very much focused on group business, and that has created a lot of tailwind for us. the third, i think, is that we've always mentioned that we have very strong asset management capabilities. this is not something we outsource to a third-party servicing company. this is not something that we defer to someone else. this is something that we have in-house as part of our real estate asset management business here at ares. and, so we actively managed this hotel throughout covid to make sure we're optimizing both revenues and expenses. and so, on the expense side in particular, we have really been running this hotel quite efficiently. in terms of the type of amenities, the types of services, we absolutely want to provide our guests as many amenities and services as possible but at the same time, being very judicious about cost and expenses. so, you can see that operating costs are variable with revenues but that we're able to maintain a positive operating margin. and what we're seeing is that as travel comes back and especially as business travel comes back, we're starting to see more and more pickup in activity. and seasonally, as you mentioned, fourth quarter is a pretty good quarter generally. we always find that first quarter is generally the hardest coming out of winter for this northeast corridor, but fourth quarter tends to be a pretty positive quarter, and we expect the hotel to continue to show improvement in performance.
stephen albert laws -- raymond james & associates, inc. -- research division-research analyst
great. appreciate the color, tae-sik. second question. bryan, can you talk a little more about office, majority of your three key originations were collateralized by office assets. can you talk about what you're seeing there? why you guys believe that's the most attractive risk-reward to deploy capital today and kind of your outlook for that asset class in the coming quarters.
bryan patrick donohoe -- ceo & partner of real estate-new york
yes. absolutely. i think we found some unique opportunities, again, given our clean allocation to some of the gateway markets going into covid. and then we remain extremely particular about the type of office that we will seek to finance and even take it another step, specifically what sponsors we want to partner with on those capitalizations. so, what attracted us to the deals that we invested in during the quarter was really a reset basis. so, new york office, for instance, down somewhere between 15% to 30%. we did not have an allocation there. so, when we think about that from an historic basis, there are certainly some attractive macro parts to the story. the types of investors we partnered with, we mentioned earlier on the call, i think that type of intellectual capital was something that was really important to our underwriting. and then the types of buildings, we mentioned in the lead certification, i think that will provide some defensive nature to our investments from just any things that might come up over the future, such as carbon taxes and the like, and that was certainly a big part of our analysis. but these buildings, we were fairly provincial about what we like in the office sector, but we think these buildings, in particular, will be actually a recruiting tool and be outsized beneficiaries of a return to work environment that we're seeing really in new york on a weekly basis.
stephen albert laws -- raymond james & associates, inc. -- research division-research analyst
great, thanks for that color bryan. appreciate for taking my questions.
bryan patrick donohoe -- ceo & partner of real estate-new york
absolutely, thank you.

the next question comes from jade rahmani of kbw.
jade joseph rahmani -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- research division-director
thank you very much. a big question investors are thinking about is the sustainability of stable eps considering the runoff of loans that have high libor floors. you mentioned that in terms of deploying the capital you raised, you were able to achieve consistent roes and your commentary has characterized the earnings are stable to the $0.37 distributable eps rate as a sustainable number to think about?
tae-sik yoon -- partner, cfo & treasurer
jade, thank you again for your question. no, i think we we feel very good about our earnings, certainly this quarter. we are very focused on, as you mentioned, the eventual runoff of our libor floors. frankly, it's occurred a little slower than we had anticipated. we only had two loans, for example, runoff this quarter. and therefore, we're pleased with where our portfolio sits today. i guess, in your question about sort of go-forward earnings, again, as you know, we don't give specific guidance on our earnings. and right now, i guess, looking ahead to 2022, what we're really planning on doing is recognizing that we'll continue to have runoff of our libor floors. i think what it will be very important to do is to make sure that we can pull every lever possible so that we can continue to optimize earnings. so, one of the things that we've done is, obviously, first half of this year, we raised about $200 million of new capital. that significantly increased our capital base, such that one of the benefits we've talked about is with further scaling of our business, we should be able to scale our expenses. and so, you saw that this quarter, in particular, third quarter, which is the first full quarter of having this additional capital, our expense load on capital was probably one of the lowest that we've ever had, was under 30 basis points for the quarter. so even if you annualize that, you can see that the run rate is much more efficient. the other, as we mentioned is that we do plan on using a bit more leverage. so, we've been able to generate the type of earnings that we've had, more than fully covering our regular and supplemental dividends for the past three quarters with significantly less leverage, low to mid-2s. and again, i think the optimized model really looks at something around the 3.0 range, as we mentioned. third is, i think we continue to see pricing of our liabilities go down. we experienced certainly that with our latest clo earlier this year and we'll continue to see that. as you know, we're coming upon the maturity of our term loan and suffice to say, we would feel very comfortable saying that as we look to refinance that term loan or put in a new type of financing, that we do expect to achieve material savings on interest expense on the term loan. so long-winded way of saying, while we won't have a permanent benefit of libor floors, we do expect to offset much of that runoff of libor floors with other ways that we can optimize our business model. and then maybe importantly, as we mentioned in our opening remarks, should interest rates rise, again, no one knows, but should interest rate rise and if you look at today's libor curve, there is some built-in expectation of increasing libor. again, we think that is something that can help us as a further tailwind. because we've hedged a substantial portion of our liability costs and certainly, the new loans that we booked in 2021 have libor floors that are not significantly or materially in the money, material increases in libor will benefit us. and i would say, for example, if you look back at our earnings in 2018, 2019, you can see that full year distributable earnings were $1.40 or so, which would have covered our $0.35 dividend for the year and of course, that was done in a higher interest rate environment where libor was closer or right at that 2% average mark for those years. so, i think there are definitely ways to again, run our balance sheet, run our company more efficiently to offset the libor floors. and we'll see about what happens with actual interest rates. but i think those are really the factors that will play into what our future earnings look like.
jade joseph rahmani -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- research division-director
thank you very much. are you expecting for the fourth quarter a pickup in repayments? and on the funding side, would you expect something similar to the third quarter?
tae-sik yoon -- partner, cfo & treasurer
yes. maybe i can start with repayment, and then i'll turn it over to bryan on the funding side. so third quarter, we certainly experienced less runoff than we originally anticipated. so far, for the fourth quarter, we have not had any material repayments, but we do expect, i would say, more to a more normal level of repayments toward the end of the year. as you know, seasonally, there is a lot of transaction activities that happen in the fourth quarter, particularly right at year-end. and we are closely monitoring and working with a number of our borrowers, where we do expect some material repayments to happen toward the end of the quarter. obviously, given that lead time, we are very busy building up our pipeline. and so i'll turn it over to brian to talk further about that.
bryan patrick donohoe -- ceo & partner of real estate-new york
yes. i think, tae-sik, covered it pretty well. but i think one thing i'd add to the equation here, jade, is that the active asset management and constant dialogue we have with our borrowers gives us as much insight as possible to the timing of repayments. so, we'd like to try to understand what that looks like 45 to 60 days in advance. and then we'll certainly manage the pipeline as well as the warehouse facility to make sure that we can maintain as best we can efficient deployment of our capital base. so, as we sit here today, we feel pretty confident in the pipeline to effectively replace those assets that will run off during this quarter and subsequently.
jade joseph rahmani -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- research division-director
and then lastly, could you just say if you expect net portfolio growth in the quarter, which some of your peers have commented as to?
tae-sik yoon -- partner, cfo & treasurer
i mean, it's tough to predict it down to the quarter, right? obviously, we're running something that we think about as more of an annual business or even longer term. so tough to predict exactly when the repayments and then redeployment of that capital will occur. but if you look at the net portfolio growth over the past couple of years, certainly, the trend would support further growth, and i think probably been echoed throughout the earnings calls of some of our peers. i think the activity in our space is extremely robust, and there is no sign of abatement there. so again, tough to predict quarter-to-quarter, but over the long term, certainly feel pretty comfortable about portfolio growth.
jade joseph rahmani -- keefe, bruyette, & woods, inc. -- research division-director

next question is from richard shane with j p morgan.
richard barry shane -- jpmorgan chase & co -- research division-senior equity analyst
hey guys, thanks for taking my question this morning. i just want to talk about the origination environment. obviously, we've been asking a lot of questions in general about spread compression, floors rolling off. i am curious, when you look at the dynamics with repayments and repricing, with base rates being lower and floors getting struck lower, is there an opportunity to pick up a little spread? and are you starting to, as you think about higher rates starting to require some sort of hedging on behalf of your borrowers?
bryan patrick donohoe -- ceo & partner of real estate-new york
overarching, i would say that the environment is very positive for the lending community right now and we talked about roes being maintained in that low double-digit realm. typically, what happens in our space as base rates decline, spreads do widen. that can be especially true as we near the end of the year, just typically speaking. i think while we don't necessarily directly compete with insurance companies and banks, a lot of the equity allocation that these firms would have received in the first quarter have largely been deployed. so just the supply of capital, especially when you think about how constrained we all are from a human capital perspective, you could expect to see some spread widening, both, again, as a function of underlying base rates as well as just available liquidity. and when you combine that with the borrowing costs i referenced that we benefit from both as a real estate platform, but also within the broader ares family of companies, i think that net interest margin really is our focus. and again, the roes that we're underwriting too are consistent with past performance as well.
richard barry shane -- jpmorgan chase & co -- research division-senior equity analyst
terrific. thank you so much.

the next question will be from steve delaney of jmp securities.
steven cole delaney -- jmp securities llc -- research division-md, director of specialty finance research & equity research analyst
hi bryan and tae-sik, congrats on a very solid quarter. look, you've covered pretty much everything i was interested in leverage, repayments, et cetera. i guess the only thing i would come back to on the hotel, and thanks for your comments on that tae-sik from an asset management standpoint. certainly, nice to see it breakeven, not a shock there, given the world reopening, et cetera. but if we think about that, i mean, that's a $37 million asset. first question is, you don't have any financing on that property at this time. do you?
tae-sik yoon -- partner, cfo & treasurer
steve, we do. we do.
steven cole delaney -- jmp securities llc -- research division-md, director of specialty finance research & equity research analyst
ok.
tae-sik yoon -- partner, cfo & treasurer
we have about $28 million of financing on it, nonrecourse financing. so, our net equity position is right around $11 million for this asset.
steven cole delaney -- jmp securities llc -- research division-md, director of specialty finance research & equity research analyst
okay. so, we need to think of it closer to 10% or 11% as far as if you were able to transfer that off to someone else as far as your net pickup of investable capital and obviously, it would be a better return, i'm sure, on the 11, if you could fund new loans at 3 times leverage than you're seeing now. okay. well, props on, i guess, tae-sik, would the plan be to the extent that you could, as the hotel industry continues to recover, find a buyer at your basis, you would say goodbye? or is this something that you see maybe a more strategic investment, you've worked hard to get it where it is, do you want to potentially hold on to it and realize a larger gain?
tae-sik yoon -- partner, cfo & treasurer
steven, a really good question. now our goal, as a lender, obviously, is to recover our capital, recover our loan basis, and we will actively manage and do all of the asset management possible to do that. obviously, on the equity side of the ares real estate business, we own very similar hotels to this property. so, we know how to manage this from both an equity perspective and debt perspective. but now the answer is we're not here to maximize value for the last dollar, we're here to fully recover our loan basis and put the dollars back to work in our primary and only business, which is as a lender.
steven cole delaney -- jmp securities llc -- research division-md, director of specialty finance research & equity research analyst
yes. yes. i think that's certainly the right answer for our commercial mortgage reit. well, thanks for the comments. appreciate it.
tae-sik yoon -- partner, cfo & treasurer
absolutely. thank you steve.

the next question will come from tim hayes with btig.
timothy hayes
hey good afternoon guys. a lot covered clearly. just one follow-up, kind of wrapping that all together. look, i know it's a board decision, and it's tough to give forward guidance, but you mentioned your expectation that you'll cover the total dividends paid, including supplementals this year. just wondering if you can provide any comments on how you think about it next year, $0.37 of earnings this quarter, you are hedged against rates next year and your outlook does seem pretty positive in terms of growth, although no one has a crystal ball. we don't know where repayments are going and when they can pick up, but given just your comments, i'm just curious what headwinds to your ability to continue paying kind of $0.35 total dividends that you foresee? and how we should think about that heading into next year? thanks
tae-sik yoon -- partner, cfo & treasurer
sure, tim. thank you for your question. absolutely. certainly, our goal is to pay a consistent and growing dividend for a company. and for 2021, as we announced at the outset of this year, we absolutely did want to share with our shareholders some of the benefit that the company has arrived from libor floors and we certainly felt very comfortable at the beginning of this year to basically say that our outlook would certainly feel very confident that we would be able to pay the supplemental dividend throughout 2021. we did not give really any much guidance about what would happen thereafter. we certainly didn't say we will continue, and we certainly didn't say we won't continue. but we said we feel very comfortable throughout 2021. and certainly, with the declaration of the fourth quarter dividend hasn't been paid yet, obviously, but with the declaration of the fourth quarter dividend, we will have kept up to what we said we would do. i think to maybe put some parameters, some bookends on kind of how we think about this, it is a number of factors. clearly, one of the factors will be is how much further runoff that we could see on our libor floors. like we said for the third quarter, we saw much less runoff than expected so far, early part of the quarter. but as of today, we've had no additional runoff of any loans in the portfolio. but as we did say, we do expect meaningful repayments before year-end and so that will certainly be an important part of the equation. and the other important part of the equation is what we talked about before, getting a little bit more optimized in terms of leverage. we're already benefiting from scaling expenses. we'll see where libor is. some of this, again, i don't want to overcomplicate the message. we'll see kind of what happens with libor with sofr and other indices taking into effect as well. we'll see where the markets are in terms of spreads and originations, but so far, things look good. so, i think we'll be in a much better position on our next earnings call to cover our fourth quarter earnings and a little bit more outlook on 2022 to provide more specificity and certainly, with a little bit more passage of time, we will be able to do that. but right now, i would say, very much stay tuned. i think it's a little bit of an evolving situation and story. but certainly, our goal is to continue to share with our shareholders the benefit of increasing earnings and cash flow from our business.
timothy hayes
yes. makes sense. but regardless, i appreciate you walking through that. and yes, we'll look forward to more commentary on that next quarter.

good afternoon, and welcome to ares commercial real estate corporation's conference call to discuss the company's third quarter 2021 financial results. as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on november 3, 2021. i will now turn the call over to veronica mayer from investor relations.
veronica mendiola mayer -- principal of ares public ir & corporate communications group
good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call. i am joined today by our ceo, bryan donohoe; tae-sik yoon, our cfo; and carl drake, our head of public company, investor relations. in addition to our press release and the 10-q that we filed with the sec, we have posted an earnings presentation under the investor resources section of our website at www.arescre.com. before we begin, i want to remind everyone that comments made during the course of this conference call and webcast and the accompanying documents contain forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties. many of these forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as anticipates, believes, expects, intends, will, should, may, and similar expressions. these forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations of market conditions and management's judgment. these statements are not guarantee of future performance, condition, or results and involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

bryan patrick donohoe -- ceo & partner of real estate-new york
thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. this morning, we reported another quarter of strong and stable results with distributable earnings of $0.37 per share, continuing to fully cover our regular and supplemental dividends. we originated $485 million in new commitments during the quarter, bringing our total year-to-date originations to $1 billion. in the first nine months of the year, we have already surpassed our previous yearly record of $955 million. at quarter end, the portfolio was $2.4 billion, up 33% year-over-year, with portfolio growth in all four quarters. while we are seeing a surge in commercial real estate activity and improving fundamentals, our originations momentum also reflects the growing presence of the broader ares real estate platform. the ares real estate group now stands at $36.5 billion in global assets under management, with approximately 200 investment professionals in 17 offices, including ares acquisition of the black creek group. we are a constant presence in the market, continuously buying, selling, borrowing, and lending against high-quality real estate throughout the top msas in the u.s. and europe. there are numerous benefits to this. first and foremost is the depth of the relationships that we maintain in our target markets, which help us drive value in our investment universe. when you combine our relationships and the opportunities generated with the data, information, and experience within the ares platform, the result is a broad funnel and a very selective investment process. for example, we are pursuing more investments in the industrial and industrial logistics sectors, which align with the activity and conviction of the broader ares platform.
as of quarter end, the ares real estate platform owns over 200 industrial investments and approximately 145 million square feet of industrial space. acre has the opportunity to benefit from this in-house product expertise, which allows us to lend earlier in the life cycle of an industrial asset. as our debt platform also continues to scale, currently standing at $9 billion of aum across all our vehicles, we have become an even more attractive partner to the highest quality institutional sponsors. this quarter, we had an almost even split between repeat sponsor business and new sponsors. our incumbent borrowers appreciate the reliability and efficiency of our execution, and these relationships enable us to make new commitments with attractive risk return profiles. we are also pleased to have provided financing to new relationships this quarter. our new relationships are with well-established sponsors like schottenstein and northwood, that have come to appreciate that we can provide a broad array of capital solutions. we continue to efficiently deploy the capital that is available to us, including fully deploying the capital from our june equity offering at a consistent weighted average roe in the low double digits. in the third quarter, we originated three loans for $282 million, secured by class a lead gold certified office properties with desirable amenities, reflecting the relative value that we are currently seeing in certain assets. these loans were in our target markets, which include regions with strong demographic growth engines like e-commerce and technology or linked to national universities. all of these loans were for new acquisitions at post covid valuations to well-established institutional sponsors with strong track records. our robust activity is continuing into the fourth quarter with a deep pipeline of diversified loans.
as a result, we expect to remain fully deployed through year-end, which should support our earnings. our originations pipeline reflects the relative value that we are finding across the spectrum from larger loans with top sponsors to efficiently partnering with nimble sponsors on portfolios of loans in thematic investments where the macro tailwinds are significant. good examples of these loans would be self-storage and industrial-related assets. while continuing to target opportunities in the sunbelt and states benefiting from tax migration, we are seeing opportunities in gateway cities where values in certain sectors have reset lower. these cities are now attracting strong capital positions out of the equity side and given our limited exposure to these areas pre covid, we can provide moderate leverage at these reset values at attractive targeted returns. our loan book continues to be well positioned with approximately 98% invested in senior floating rate loans and approximately two-thirds of our loans collateralized by multifamily, office, industrial, and self-storage properties. we continue to be underweight hotels and retail exposures, and the credit quality of our portfolio remains stable. before i turn the call over to tae-sik to discuss our financials in further detail, i want to note that we declared our regular $0.33 per share quarterly dividend and our $0.02 per share supplemental dividend in the fourth quarter. we expect to more than fully cover both our regular and supplemental dividends from our distributable earnings for the full year 2021. with that, i'll now turn it over to tae-sik.
tae-sik yoon -- partner, cfo & treasurer
great. thank you, bryan, and good afternoon, everyone. earlier today, we reported gaap net income of $10 million or $0.21 per common share and distributable earnings of $17.5 million or $0.37 per common share. this brings our total distributable earnings for the first nine months of the year to $1.14 per common share, well in excess of $1.05 per common share that we have paid in dividends for the comparable period, including $0.06 per common share in supplemental dividends. our earnings this quarter benefited from strong momentum in originations, accompanied by subdued repayment activity, which resulted in a record portfolio of $2.4 billion in loans held for investments at quarter end. in addition, we continue to benefit from libor floors, which had a weighted average rate of 1.17% at quarter end. our leverage remains modest with a debt-to-equity ratio of 2.5 as of the end of the third quarter, excluding cecl reserve. our cecl reserve was at $24.5 million at the end of the third quarter, a net increase of $6.4 million from the previous quarter. this $6.4 million net increase in cecl was primarily due to recognizing initial reserves against the $485 million in new loan commitments for the quarter as well as extending the expected maturities of a few loans. as a reminder, changes in cecl reserve does impact our gaap net income with the net $6.4 million change this quarter, representing approximately $0.13 per diluted common share. changes in cecl reserve, however, are added back from gaap net income as part of calculating our distributable earnings.
we had no material changes to our overall portfoliowide risk ratings with our weighted average portfolio risk rating remaining at 2.8, with 92% of the loan portfolio rated at three or better, all on a five-point scale. and similar to past quarters, approximately 97% of our loans made their contractual debt service payments for the third quarter. we did, however, add a second loan this quarter to nonaccrual status. it is a small $14 million senior loan backed by our residential property located in los angeles. despite its nonaccrual status, however, we believe that the loan is protected through sufficient collateral values and have not taken an impairment on this loan. together with the one other senior loan backed by hotel property outside chicago, the total balance of the two nonaccrual loans represent less than 2% of our overall total portfolio. finally, before i turn the call back over to bryan, let me touch upon a question that we have been recently asked from several shareholders about the impact of potential higher interest rates on our earnings. as we have discussed previously, we believe materially higher short-term rates will positively impact our distributable earnings as the vast majority of our loans pay us interest based on libor. while the majority of our loans have libor floors that are currently in the money, our most recently originated loans, particularly those in 2021, do not have significant libor floors and will benefit from material increases in short-term rates. at the same time, early this year, we hedged a significant portion of our floating rate liabilities so that increases in libor won't have a basis point by basis point increase in our funding costs. so, with that, let me turn the call back over to bryan for some closing remarks.
bryan patrick donohoe -- ceo & partner of real estate-new york
great. thanks so much, tae-sik. in summary, acre delivered another strong quarter of stable distributable earnings. the portfolio is at a record $2.4 billion. our origination activity is at record levels, and we continue to find opportunities to achieve consistent all in yields with what we believe are higher-quality assets than available to us pre covid. we have the opportunity to continue to optimize our balance sheet efficiency, and we are well positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment. with that, i'll ask the operator to please open the line for questions.
