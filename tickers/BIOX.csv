[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of ben klieve with lake street capital markets.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
all right. thank you for taking my questions. first question on the quarter itself. great result, really.
congratulations on a strong end to the year. i'm curious if you can talk about the initiatives that you've taken in both the nutrition and the protection segment and talk about kind of your expectations for fiscal '22 around those initiatives? i mean, you guys are now coming off of a really difficult comp given how good of a second half you had. so i guess, i'm curious, how much further improvement do you expect in these two parts of your business throughout fiscal '22?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
hi, ben. this is enrique. thanks for joining us today. good to have you on the call.
so from those two business segment standpoint, in crop protection, as i was saying in the previous remarks, when we try to realize the channels, the teams, the commercial teams that are focused on the proprietary and more valuable or more profitable products. from other products that are new business opportunity for the company, but that require a different level of attention, a different approach to market such as third-party products and services also that are a good opportunity for business and the company, but are not strategic, but active. so that reorganization process already started delivering results. i think something that might continue throughout the year, for the year, incremental results, but this is more of a one-time reorganization process and not something that will continue delivering results either after a year.
so that is more of a one-timer versus what we are seeing in crop nutrition where the new commercial strategy around micro-beaded fertilizer is working very well until now. if you remember from previous calls, we decided to hit gas with ramping up the volumes of fertilizers -- fertilizers being a bit more aggressive on pricing to farmers, but trying to keep margins as we lead back. and to me, the third quarter and the fourth quarter were a testament to that. we were able to significantly increase the use of installed capacity.
and that is something that we hope will continue delivering results over the year, fiscal year 2022. remember that we are targeting to get to upwards of 60% sometime in the next two years with the use of installed capacity. so still, very long way to go, but the strategy is still hearing. and in inoculants, it's obviously a very, very attractive business segment to us.
in latin america, we have already a market leader, but we are seeing that growth is still happening and taking place in that product category. and the good thing is we have diversified geographic footprint. so as you saw in this quarter, what we lost in south africa was recuperated in latin america. what we probably lost in brazil last quarter was recovered this year.
so still a source of growth to us. and i think that the main strategic point there is geographic distribution globally. and remember that this is the product probably by which we're viewed by the mineral and the agriculture industry, more specifically biologicals.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. thanks, enrique. pivoting over to hb4, there's a lot going on here and i'll admit, i'm a little confused at kind of the near-term expectations, especially for soy.
i understand the first, second, third-generation breakdown that you gave, but for that second-generation that you've outlined as being pretty efficient on kind of poor quality farmland, is the expectation that you're going to be revenuing second-generation seed here in fiscal '22? and if so, what kind of inventory levels do you have of that second-generation material?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
hi, ben. this is federico. thank you for joining the call and thank you for the question regarding the hb4 soy ramp up process. so what we wanted to basically illustrate there is how as we move forward in our breeding efforts, we're improving on the general performance in moderate to highly productive environments and not just the hb4 benefit in these highly restricted environments where we know the technology can deliver 15%, 16% yield improvement, which we believe to be important for the varieties to be used broadly and to minimize any kind of user discomfort, if you will, for whatever reason, situations are good from a rainfall perspective and farmers experience a drag due to the germplasm gap.
so the second-generation varieties of the 23,000 hectares we just harvested, less than 15% of those were planted with second-generation materials. so what we wanted to tell you here is that our ability to ramp up in the coming season is probably going to be less than what we did in the last year. so last year, we did eight times what we did the year before. we think this year we'll be at 3 to 4x because of sort of the constrain generated by the performance in the first-generation varieties, which we will not continue to scale and the repositioning of all of the second-generation materials to double cropping systems for highly restricted areas.
we want to make sure that farmer experience is excellent. and that is kind of what we're putting in the balance here as we design the process for the coming season. now, we are still in ramp up mode, so you won't expect to see -- you shouldn't expect to see revenues materializing until we get the china approval. having said this, if we discontinue some inventories and that gets to be sold as grain or sold as a grain derivative, you will see that coming to the p&l process in the coming year.
and maybe, enrique can give you more color regarding as to how that gets materialized. i'll pause here to see if your question was fully addressed, otherwise, i'll try it again.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
no, i think it did, but that presents another question on your comment about basically meaning to wait here for chinese approval. so does that imply that commercializing hb4 soy via an identity preserved supply chain and ensuring grain customers are domestic, but that's not an initiative that's going to be undertaken here in fiscal '22 or fiscal '22 for soy is going to be purely an inventory ramp year and not a commercial year for hb4 soy?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
it's going to be an inventory ramp year for the materials we get to keep for future sales as seed. and it will become a revenue year for materials we're discontinuing and we are sending into an identity preserve industrialization pack.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
and then i guess the last question on hb4, you talked about the double crop system here now with wheat and soy. really, what does that look like? what's -- kind of what's the double crop system in argentina from a timing perspective? when are they planting wheat and when are they following up with soybean planting?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
so wheat has already been planted. it's usually june, july planting depending on the area. and then depending on the level of humidity, farmers might want to do soy after wheat in november, december. that is where we are seeing that hb4 performance is enhanced, particularly in the moderate environment and moderate to highly productive environments, where we saw the germplasm drag.
and there are 6 million hectares today that are under the double cropping system in argentina. so this is not an insignificant opportunity, where we have not only performance in soybeans that we can point to, but also where we can leverage on the terrific performance of our wheat varieties. the hb4 wheat performance that is beyond dispute can be a terrific complement to the soy products that outperform commercial materials in double cropping systems. so while this is still a fraction of the overall opportunity we are seeking with hb4, i think it's one that we can make use of right away with the second-generation materials we're currently scaling up.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
ok. last one for me and i'll pass it over. you talked about fast-tracking third-generation materials. really, what does that mean? what initiatives are you taking to fast-track? and what does -- what's your expectation for kind of how inventory build can grow over the next year or two given this fast-track approach?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
so the fast-tracking is essentially doing off-season production. so instead of having one cycle of notification every year, we will try to, particularly allion where we are talking about hundreds of factors and not thousands do off-season in the u.s., like we have done in the past for some materials. so that's currently happening. i believe that we will probably be on a few thousand hectares with third-generation materials in the coming off-season on the aggregate.
and the remaining, obviously, to achieve the 3 to 4x will be with second-generation materials. and a significant portion of that as a follower to wheat. we believe that in the next cycle, we should not be hindered by the performance of the materials, or by the availability of inventories, but we will be dependent on chinese approval. as i said before, moving identity to reserve beyond the 0.5 million hectare mark, it's challenging.
so we think that if we do things right from a multiplication perspective, we should be able to be there. and then the chinese clearance becomes of great relevance than what we have today.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
ok. very good. well, appreciate all the comments from both of you. i just want to talk about but i'll turn it over to the other analyst.
thanks for taking my questions.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
thanks, ben.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of kemp dolliver with brookline.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
hi. thank you. a couple of questions. first, on your presentation, you mentioned you expect regulatory approval in fiscal year 2022.
is -- do you have increased confidence or is it based on regulatory interaction? or is this just reflect the passage of time? i'm trying not to read too much into that piece of information in the slide.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
well, thanks, kemp, for joining the call. i think the answer is a combination of all these different aspects that you have indicated. for instance, in terms of the brazil process for hb4 wheat, that's an active process. we can follow what happens in every meeting.
we got questions sent to us, i believe, in the june meeting, after the process was ready to be decided. those questions asked us to generate additional data essentially to look at how hb4 may affect other genes in wheat that can potentially be of allergen-linked. and we did something that has no precedence. we basically evaluated every single gene in wheat and showed that there was no change and we provided that data back to regulators in august 18.
the first meeting since we provided that data was conducted the first days of september. so there was not enough time probably between our filing and that meeting for regulators to have a full view of the data package, but there's an upcoming meeting in october, where we believe enough time would have elapsed for them to come to a conclusion. and then we don't know what that conclusion will be, but there is a process that we can more or less track and we can get an additional question or we can get an approval. so that's where we are in terms of wheat.
with the chinese process, it's -- we have less visibility. all that we know is that we are not getting more questions and that this has been the case since last year. so we didn't get any additional question from chinese regulators during 2021. they have not met yet.
so -- and we don't know when the next meeting is going to occur. there usually is a meeting in the half -- first half of the year, but has not occurred. and this is not bioceres-related. this is for all gmos that they evaluate.
so we don't have a meeting diary that we can sort of point you to today, but that is kind of where we are in our understanding of the process in china and from a time perspective, where within the customary timeframe, within which they've made decisions in the past for other events that they have approved.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
ok, fair enough. that's very helpful. my second question relates to your comments on canada. and typically, we've assumed that small subsets, say, 25% of acreage in a given market would be appropriate for hb4 products.
and your comments on canada today suggested it might be more than that, given the geography. does that reflect the increased visibility on the market opportunity there?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
yeah. that's a very good point, kemp. the 25% is a rule of thumb across sort of the americas, i would say. but when you look at the sub-region that is entailed by southern canada and some parts of the northern u.s., like minnesota, the dakota's, there are 10 million hectares, they're all combined, where we expect penetration to be higher than 25% because these are hectares that are often prone to water deficits and where average yields tend to be below the 3 tons per hectare, sometimes even below the 2.5 tons per hectare.
so the value proposition of hb4 becomes even more compelling. that's why we were eager to secure germplasm for this region. and one thing we're effectively announcing today is the don mario collaboration to be able to have maturity crops to and below that are specifically suited to this part of north america and take advantage of having all the approvals in place to capture on these hectares.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks. and just my -- this will be my last question and it relates to the partnerships. how do the partnership economics work? and more specifically, do they have any impact relative to doing this on a stand-alone basis?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
well, i think there are two important aspects. the -- usually, the technology is priced on two different fronts, the germplasm, the hardware, if you will and the trait, the software that goes into that hardware. so we are software providers from an hb4 perspective. we have our own hardware company.
where we are discussing our proprietary program, the data that you saw from latin america, from argentina comes from our hardware company where we're combining hb4 with our proprietary germplasm. if we use someone else's hardware, that person gets to keep the 3 to 4, sometimes even $8 per bag that are usually hardware-dependent. when we jointly develop the hardware, we split that 50-50, but that doesn't do anything to the price of the software, which we get to keep ourselves for verdeca, if you will, that we fully own today, that is the developer of the trait. we might need certain incentives when we're working with partners on the software revenue and they can be between 15% to 30% of the trait price or trait fees, depending on how deeply involved we are and whether they need or not certain metrics.
but this is building additional economics beyond what we originally had from a germplasm perspective.don mario providing their germplasm capabilities, co-financing that so that we can have ownership into those additional economics and keeping everything else from the trait side, the way it is for our traditional licensee.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
so to be clear, the net effect for you is minimal based on what you had previously indicated to us?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
yes, i wouldn't -- i mean, we're not having a leakage on our hb4 value in general. there will be some germplasm royalties coming to us due to the investment we will be making jointly with don mario. but the important thing here is the ability to capture in a geography, we would not be able to capture in the absence of don mario because we do not have varieties adapted to this region of north america from our proprietary efforts.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of steven ralston with zacks.
steven ralston -- zacks investments -- analyst
good morning. great top line. seems to be that the strategies that you're putting into the crop protection and the crop nutrition segments is gaining traction. this will be kind of a long-winded question.
just looking at it, overall, it appears that the seed business, it's a geographic expansion story and with argentina, of course, bit of lightning good strike here in brazil and china. the nutrition area is a capacity utilization story and you have plenty of room to ramp up the utilization and you're on track there. but looking at the crop protection area, with this reorganizational strategy, it's -- with bringing on these dedicated teams, it seems like there's a structural increase in the sg&a. and could you talk about that? because the sg&a jumped up substantially during the fourth quarter.
but as you say, it's still a lower percentage of sales because this top-line grew so much. but could you talk about what structural implications there are in the sg&a line concerning the reorganizational strategy?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
steven, this is enrique. thanks for joining us. pleasure to have you on the call. so i think that your overview of the different initiatives is accurate.
on your specific question on sg&a, bear in mind that sg&a, we are today accounting for expenses related to the launch of the independent platform, the rollout of hb4 and that is yet what's having an impact here on the top-line, not on profitability. so to me, that is an important point on sg&a. and then on your question --on your specific question about the crop protection reorganization process, that is something that didn't take much of the increasing sg&a that you see. it might be out 20% to 30%, no more than -- not more than that.
and that also takes into consideration brazil, the ramp-up of sg&a. right? if you look at where we were, year after year, we are seeing good levels of growth. but in order for that growth to be captured, we need to put in place the support functions to allow that growth afterwards. so we keep track of the sg&a expenses in brazil that we put in place in one specific period materialize in sales growth on the following period.
so that's the way we think about brazil. so the sg&a increase is a combination of those three things, not specifically attributable to the reorganization process in crop protection.
steven ralston -- zacks investments -- analyst
also, i noticed the r&d line increased substantially. is that because of the second and third-generation hb4 soy?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
well, that is a combination of things. part of the expenses in r&d that you see there have to do with further regulatory request approvals -- approval requests that we made and that you saw in the slide that frederico presented has to do with developing and obtaining registrations for product in our geographies, biologicals, mainly. so it's a split between regulatory expenses for the seed business and for the registration, for adjuvants and biologicals in our geographies.
steven ralston -- zacks investments -- analyst
thank you and thank you for taking my questions.
operator
you have a follow-up from the line of kemp dolliver with brookline.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
quickly, you had refinancing with rizobacter several weeks ago. what range of interest savings do you expect from that?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
thanks, kemp, for the question. i think we've now reached a point at which our average cost of debt is stable. so we don't expect further savings from future issuances, but those issuances is to allow to refinance our existing debt, maintain our leverage ratio. so we are now stabilized.
and i think that opportunities within that space will have to do more with expense maturities than lowering our average cost of debt.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
and this is my last question. you've made a few comments about argentinian inflation in this period. and the cpi numbers are -- the last couple of months have been, i think, as high as 50%. how are you thinking -- if nothing else changed and inflation stayed at this level, how are you thinking about the margin impact over the course of the next year? is this something that will taper off? or do you expect that the magnitude of impact on margins could continue?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
it's a great question, kemp. we don't look at fx and inflation on a stand-alone basis. in argentina, you need to look at those two variables together. so what we've seen in the past, actually decades, is that inflation and valuation or depreciation of the local currency converge in the long run or in the mid-term.
it might be that in the short term, there is a diversion, like it happened in this last two or three quarters in the fiscal year 2021 and that turned into headwinds for our cost structure -- manufacturing costs and that impacted the gross margins but also some of our sg&a costs. but in the last two or three quarters, depreciation of local currency in argentina lagged inflation. so that should catch up at some point. so it's something the effect of don mario should be minimized.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and at this time, there are no further questions. i'll turn the call back over to federico trucco for closing comments.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
so thanks, everyone, for joining us. i know this is a lot of information in today's call. so i hope that you can feel free to reach us back if you need further detail or further explanations, we stand fully available. we're happy with the performance that was obtained in fiscal year '21, particularly after what we saw in the second quarter.
so second half, that was very strong and allows us to show the results we're showing today. so thanks again. i hope everyone has a great week and we are fully available, should you have any follow-ups. thank you.

good day and thank you for standing by. welcome to the bioceres crop solutions fiscal fourth-quarter 2021 financial results conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to maximo goya. thank you.
please go ahead.
maximo goya -- head of investor relations
good day, everyone and thank you for joining us. presenting during today's call will be federico trucco, our chief executive officer; and enrique lopez lecube, our chief financial officer. both will be available for the q&a session. before we proceed, i would like to make the following safe harbor statement.
today's call will contain forward-looking statements and i'll refer you to a forward-looking statements section of the earnings release and presentation, as well in our written filings with the sec. we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect new or changed events or circumstances. also, please note that for comparison purposes and a better understanding of our company's underlining performance, in addition to discussing actual project results during our presentation today, we will discuss comparable results, which exclude the impact of hyperinflation accounting in argentina. additional information in connection with the application of rule ias 29 can be found in our earnings report.
finally, this conference call is being webcast. the webcast link is available in the investor relations section of biocerescrop.com. at this time, i would like to turn the call over to our ceo, federico trucco. 
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
thanks, max and thank you all for joining us today. please turn to slide 3 for a brief overview of the business and financial highlights we will discuss in today's call. from a baseline business perspective, comparable revenues were up 39% to $72.4 million in the quarter and 13% to $197.4 million for fiscal year '21 with ltm adjusted ebitda at $48.3 million. momentum consolidated in the fourth quarter, confirming a very strong second half to fiscal year '21, driven predominantly by sustained micro-beaded fertilizer sales and the reorganization of the crop protection business.
these revenues do not account for approximately $7.2 million of the total of $8.3 million of hb4 program contributed goods with an average gross margin of 43%. however, associated operating expenses were truly discounted from the adjusted ebitda indicated above. hb4 program revenues will be recognized once realized inventories are not longer contributed, but rather sold as seed or grain. top-line growth for the quarter allowed us to remain on track with our historical ltm double-digit growth trajectory, while at the same time, supporting the hb4 program rollouts.
enrique will provide greater details around our financial performance for the quarter and full fiscal year later on this presentation. on the hb4 front, we have scaled up eight times compared to the previous year with the total of close to 80,000 hectares planted with over 10 different wheat and soy hb4 varieties. as we have done in previous calls, i will provide a more detailed updates on agronomic performance, farmer acceptance, inventory scaling up process, our breeding efforts and collaborations across the americas and the current regulatory status for each crop. two relevant highlights worth noting ahead of our more in-depth discussion are the regulatory clearance obtained in canada for hb4 soy.
and the expansion of our collaboration agreement with grupo don mario to north america, especially targeting the southern canada, minnesota and the dakotas region. we will also discuss these two highlights in greater depth in the next slides. please turn to slide 4 for an update on the ongoing hb4 wheat season. hb4 wheat was planted in 55,000 hectors with contributed goods totaling 6.4 million.
as previously explained, the value of these contributed goods will be recognized as revenues once the realized inventories are sold as seeds or grains, but not longer contributed. the current multiplication area represents a 7.8 times increase over last year's effort, including varieties adapted to 75% of argentina's addressable market. the number of participating growers increased eight-fold with a 100% grower repeat rate and very importantly, with 95% of participants onboarding digitally. the crop is evolving favorably with recent grains normalizing the drought situation suffered in some of the sub-regions.
in slide 5 you will see the results of our hb4 soy ramp up process as we finish harvesting all 23,000 hectares planted last season. from a trait performance perspective, results were aligned with technology expectations with hb4 materials showing significant yield benefits in highly restricted environment, particularly in those with average yields below 1.5 tons per hectare. however, the cumulated yield benefit was diluted as moderate to highly productive environments were aggregated as germplasm is still behind some of the most competitive commercial materials. this germplasm drag can be better observed as we zoom into the discrete yield intervals in the next slide with as much as 9.1% yield reduction on average in environments between 2.5 and 3.5 tons per hectare.
this phenomenon was more pronounced in our earliest varieties, which yielded on average 11% less than a selected group of top commercial performers. the germplasm drag became less concerning as we evaluated newer materials with second-generation materials only 3% below the same group of commercial controls and some third-generation varieties matching and even beating top commercial performance. one interesting observation illustrated in slide 7 is that when crop after wheat in double cropping systems, the germplasm drag is minimized and performance greatly improved, at least in some of the second-generation materials where these could be tested and this is shown here in the current slide. in summary, turning to the next slide, hb4 wheat inventory ramp up is progressing as expected considering that we still have not received brazil's regulatory clearance, which we will discuss in a moment.
hb4 soy inventory ramp up is being redesigned to address germplasm drag in earlier materials with ramp up of first-generation materials discontinued and second-generation materials repositioned to double cropping systems as we accelerate multiplication of third-generation materials targeting the broadest hb4 acreage opportunity. now, turn to slide 9. concomitantly with our internal efforts, we are expanding our existing collaboration with top-tier soybean germplasm developer, grupo don mario, with which we signed a new agreement during the quarter to jointly develop and commercialize hb4 soy in north america, more specifically in the sub-region including southern canada, minnesota and the dakotas, where we believe there are approximately 10 million hectares highly prone to water deficit. as you may recall, grupo don mario is an early licensee of the hb4 trait for its latin america soy breeding programs.
and also during the last year, we have expanded our breeding collaborations with tmg, one of brazil's top providers of soybean genetics, with 173 pre-commercial hb4 soy varieties currently being tested and approximately 100 hectares of demo plots being organized with selected farmers during the upcoming season in that country. so gdm and tmg are expected to provide materials as soon as 2023 for the hb4 program in latam as well as commercialize directly in the future using their existing go-to-market models. finally, turning to the next slide, i will discuss the main regulatory highlights for the quarter. received regulatory approval for hb4 soy from the canadian sales agency -- from the canadian food inspection agency, as you know, with approximately 2.5 million hectares farmed every year and yields often below the 3 tons per hector, channelized soybean production regions are well suited for hb4 value generation.
so hb4 soybean is approved today for production in the united states, brazil, argentina, paraguay and canada, representing 85% of the world's soybean hectarage. during the quarter, our regulatory teams submitted hb4 wheat consumption approval request in australia, new zealand, south africa and indonesia. near the end of the quarter, bioceres received a formal requirement from ctnbio, the brazilian regulatory body, to provide additional gene expression information for native, non-targeted genes of relevance to regulators. this information was produced and filed with ctnbio by august 18, continuing the hb4 wheat regulatory process in that country.
no additional information has been requested during the quarter by chinese regulatory authorities regarding hb4 soy. and we believe both the regulators, brazil and china, should be able to resolve approval requests in their upcoming proceedings and look forward to communicating their findings as they are informed to us. this concludes my prepared remarks. i will now turn the call over to our cfo, enrique lopez lecube, to discuss our fiscal fourth-quarter financial results.
enrique?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
thanks, federico. good day to everyone and thanks for joining us today. moving to the financials, please turn to slide 11 for a review of the revenue performance during the quarter and full fiscal year. as federico outlined a few minutes ago, we had a strong fourth-quarter performance with comparable revenue rising through $72.4 million on $51.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, a solid 39% increase and consolidated momentum from the third quarter.
growth during the quarter was mainly driven by a successful outcome from the reorganization initiatives taken earlier in the fiscal year to reignite growth in our crop protection business segment. crop nutrition also contributed to the increase in comparable revenues as the micro-beaded fertilizer business line continued to expand confirming the growth trend that had been displayed in the third quarter. the 48% and 46% increase in crop protection and crop nutrition comparable revenues respectively were slightly offset by an 8% drop in seed and integrated products. on a reported basis, the increase for the quarter was 71% from $48.2 million to $82.2 million.
this increase in reported revenues was significantly higher than the evolution of comparable revenues as ias 29 adjustments decreased the basis of the reported figure in the fourth quarter of 2020 and expanded the reported metric for the fourth quarter of 2021. for the full fiscal year period, total comparable revenues were up 13% through $197.4 million compared to a year ago period with revenue growth across all three business segments. despite the softened performance during the second quarter, which had been negatively impacted by drought in key markets across south america, a strong second half of the fiscal year allowed the business to maintain a double-digit growth trajectory even without the inclusion of $7.2 million out of the total $8.3 million of contributed goods from the hb4 program. please move on to slide 12 now for a breakdown of fourth-quarter revenues per business segment.
the $20.5 million increase in comparable revenues was driven by crop protection and crop nutrition with a slight drop in seed and integrated products. crop protection sales were up 48% from the year ago quarter, reaching $42.9 million. growth across the segment portfolio resulted from the implementation of a reorganization strategy intended to uncouple market access channels from teams dedicated to proprietary products from lower margin third-party products. the expansion during the quarter was mainly driven by higher insecticides, fungicides and adjuvant sales in latin america, specifically b2c sales for the latter category in brazil.
average gross margin for the segment decreased from 39.9% to 36.2% primarily due to increased sales of lower margin seed treatment therapics. the other growth contributor for the quarter's comparable revenue expansion was the crop nutrition segment, which grew to $22.7 million across both product categories. the strong performance of the micro-beaded fertilizer product line during the quarter is the outcome of the shift in the commercial strategy that was implemented two quarters ago, enhanced the attractiveness of the value proposition to farmers. following an already improved performance in the third quarter, the trailing last 12 months' rate of usage of installed capacity increased from 30% to 40% on a sequential basis.
inoculants sales also had a very good performance with volumes increasing from 2.5 million doses to 4 million doses. increased demand of high added value inoculants in brazil, which fully recover the decline of the third quarter was the main growth driver in this category. margins for fertilizers remained stable as volumes scaled up with the overall crop nutrition gross margins slightly expanding 54.2%. seed and integrated products comparable revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 stood at $6.8 million, slightly below the year ago quarter.
the $0.6 million decrease was driven by seed treatment packs despite volumes remaining flat at 1.1 million doses as a portion of the growth that we had accomplished in south africa in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 was replaced by lower price packs in latin america. lower packs contribution as well as a slight shift from b2c to b2b pack sales in argentina led to a segment gross margin drop from 63.5% to 53% this year. overall, we are very satisfied with growth in revenues during the quarter, which was accomplished with an average 43.4% comparable gross margin. it is worth mentioning that aside from the pricing, volume and product mix dynamics i just described, gross margins during the quarter were also affected by fx and inflation dynamics in argentina where we hold most of our production facilities.
inflation-related price increases of raw materials and manufacturing costs denominated in local currency exceeded the benefit of the argentine peso depreciation, which negatively affected production cost structures of some of our products. the interaction between fx and inflation rates turned into headwinds during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 from tailwinds in the year ago quarter, further emphasizing an unfavorable comparison. moving on to slide 13 which shows the breakdown of gross profits per business segment. as a result of the revenues and margins evolution addressed in the previous slides, comparable gross profit for the quarter rose by $6.9 million from $24.5 million to $31.4 million.
comparable gross profit from crop protection was $15.5 million, up $4 million from 11.5% during the previous fiscal year quarter. seed and integrated products contributed a total of $3.6 million in comparable gross profit during the quarter, down $1.1 million from the year ago period, in line with the evolution i described in the previous slide. and finally, crop nutrition delivered $12.3 million in comparable gross profit, an increase of $4 million from $8.3 million a year ago. it is to be noted that crop nutrition displayed the highest growth within the three business segments, reaching a contribution of almost 40% to total comparable gross profit.
reported gross profit rose by $9.6 million to $32.4 million. the increase in as reported gross profit was higher than the increase in comparable gross profit following the same ias 29 adjustments dynamics described for revenues. let's now please move on to slides 14 and 15 for a review on ebitda performance for the quarter and the last 12 months respectively. the $9.6 million increase in as reported gross profit was the main contribution to adjusted ebitda growth for the quarter, which increased 13% and totaled $16.6 million compared with $14.7 million in the year ago quarter.
conversely, operating expenses and other income and expenses rose by 5.6 and $0.5 million respectively, including an expense increase of approximately $1.3 million related to data acquisition within the hb4 program, the rollout of the digital platform and increased support to the program as hectares scale out. setting aside hb4-related expenses, sg&a from the operation of the baseline business increased primarily due to a mix of fixed and variable operating expenses related to the expansion of the business. employee salaries and social security expenses increased by $1.6 million driven by growth in the brazilian subsidiary as well as the reorganization process to support growth in the crop protection segment. also, variable sales related tax expenses grew by $1.2 million in line with increased revenues during the quarter.
on a different note, similar to manufacturing costs, unfavorable inflation and fx dynamics in argentina where the main administrative and support functions of the company are located, also had a negative impact in expenses. despite the increase, total sg&a expenses were down 234 basis points as a percentage of revenue from 21.7% to 19.4% denoting operational leverage. r&d expenses totaled $2 million during the quarter compared to $0.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. approximately two-thirds of the r&d expenses in the quarter were related to the development of seed and traits and the remaining third was related to the development of new biofungicides and biostimulants.
finally, jv results decreased by $1.5 million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, mainly due to ias 29 adjustments on synertech, the company's micro-beaded fertilizer manufacturing jv. in slide 15, adjusted ebitda for fiscal year 2021 totaled $48.3 million, a 4% increase versus fiscal 2020. sales growth extend all business segments with as reported gross profit increasing by a total of $11.1 million from post of $9.3 million increase in comparable gross profit and a $1.8 million positive adjustment from ias 29. the divergence between as reported and comparable metrics for the full year was lower than the fourth-quarter figures as ias 29 adjustments tend to decrease in a scenario of conversions of inflation and fx depreciation in argentina.
growth in gross profit was partially offset by an increase of $7.9 million in operating expenses with the fourth-quarter dynamics explaining most of the increase and building the yearly trend. importantly, sg&a for fiscal year 2021 includes expenses related to the ramp up of the hb4 program, while deferred revenues from contributed goods are yet not fully reflected in revenues and gross profits. inflation and fx dynamics in argentina also had a negative impact in the full-year expenses compared to fiscal year 2020. following the $48.3 million adjusted ebitda achieved during the fiscal year, supplementary cash flow information is presented in the right-hand side of the slide.
investment activities totaled $16.7 million during the full fiscal year. $4 million were invested in tangible assets, including maintenance capex as well as the acquisition of land for the expansion of the adjuvant manufacturing facility in brazil. investment in intangible assets during the year stood at $6.4 million with roughly 35% allocated to the continuous development of the hb4 digital platform. finally, the acquisition of verdeca and other assets from arcadia biosciences mainly explained the $6.3 million in acquisitions during the year.
from a tax perspective, income tax accrued over the period, excluding deferred tax liabilities, stood at $7.3 million. additionally, $1.8 million of deferred tax liabilities from previous fiscal periods were paid during fiscal year 2021. finally, net cash financial expenses and commissions accrued for fiscal year 2021 totaled $14.6 million. let's now please turn to slide 16 to address our debt evolution and cash position.
we continue to make good use of rizobacter's partnership with argentina credit markets throughout the fourth quarter as we completed a $26 million public offering of series 5 corporate bonds in early march. 20% of the issuance had a one year maturity and an annual coupon rate of 0.98% and the remaining 80% was issued with a maturity of 36 months at an annual coupon rate of 5.5%. the total financial debt increased by $22.5 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, first left-hand side column, through the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year, while total ltm financial expenses decreased by 16% from $17.3 million to $14.6 million. total net debt as of june 30, 2021 was $121.3 million, 2.5 turns net debt to adjusted ebitda.
the increase in the company's debt ratio compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to increase in total financial debt as the company replaced inefficient working capital sources with corporate bonds. on a sequential basis, net debt to ltm adjusted ebitda decreased from 2.89 turns on march 31, 2021, primarily due to reduced short-term debt position and higher ltm ebitda. on the liquidity front, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments represented approximately 67% of the current portion of debt. that concludes the financial remarks for today.
so i will now turn it to federico for concluding remarks.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
thank you, enrique. moving forward to the next slide, we can summarize some of the major highlights for the fiscal year '21 where we had double-digit top-line growth across all three segments despite a softened performance in the second quarter due to the climatic situation in south america, growth mainly driven by the development of the micro-beaded fertilizer expansion plan and the fourth-quarter crop protection reorganizational strategy. contributed goods for hb4 program, both hb4 wheat and hb4 soy, increased significantly to $8.3 million, approximately $105 per hectare farmed with gross margin of approximately 43% and the value of these contributed goods, as we indicated before, will be recognized as revenues once the realized inventories are sold as seed or grain had not longer contributed. hb4 wheat was commercially approved in argentina on october of 2020 subject to brazilian import approval for full commercial launch in argentina.
this approval represents a historical milestone for the entire global value chain being the first biotech wheat event to be fully cleared. we acquired the remaining hb4 soy ownership interest in verdeca llc, aiming to accelerate breeding and go-to-market strategies. complete ownership will enable us to capture more of the underlying economic value generated by the technology. and as part of the transaction, the company acquired verdeca's vetted soybean library of gene-edited materials for developing new quality and productivity traits as well as exclusive rights to all of arcadia technologies applicable to this crop.
bioceres has also been granted latin american rights to arcadia's wheat traits and good wheat brand and other gla non-core assets. during the period, we successfully completed the offer to exchange all 24.2 million outstanding warrants in a cost-effective manner, eliminating the future dilution entailed by these derivatives. there were $70 million of total financing obtained also during the last fiscal year. $43 million of funding was added through the company's main operational subsidiary, rizobacter, issuing the series iv and series v corporate bonds and making a considerable progress toward substantially lowering financing costs, extending debt maturities and increasing financial flexibility, as indicated by enrique.
$28.7 million equity financing completed through the aforementioned verdeca's acquisition and the warrants tender of our transaction. management has been focusing in unlocking value from stocks liquidity ad-hoc, accretive deal structure with strategic equity components, as the ones just described, on top of selective persistent ir efforts resulted in a 78% year-over-year improvement of the three month trailing moving average in terms of stock liquidity. moving to the next slide. coming up next in terms of fiscal year '22, you can expect from a baseline business perspective to see reignited profitable growth in the seed and integrated products segment, the same way we saw in the crop nutrition and the crop protection segments over the last two quarters continued to move forward with our digital platform, releasing some of the developments we have generated in this front.
from a product development and go-to-market perspective, accelerate the ramp up of the third-generation materials for both hb4 soy and hb4 wheat and start ramping up inventories for the good wheat materials we in-licensed from arcadia. on the regulatory front, we are expecting china and brazil regulatory clearances of hb4 soy and hb4 wheat respectively. and also, continue to work on the downstream and esg initiatives to build on the data we are accumulating and provide data-driven esg scoring of produced inventories under the hb4 program, targeting downstream specifications. so this essentially concludes today's management overview.
i will now open up the floor for any questions that you may have.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of ben klieve from lake street capital market. ben, please proceed.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
all right. thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on a really good quarter here.i got a question for probably enrique here on the breakdown of sg&a that you talked about. i appreciate the breakdown of the hb4 pre-operational expenses especially, but i'll say it's kind of unclear to me why this number is coming up now, as i can't really tell what has really changed within hb4 this quarter versus prior quarters. so can you help me kind of understand what these expenses are? confirmed that these are, in fact, new expenses realized this quarter? and then talk about kind of what your outlook is for that throughout the next few quarters?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
ben, thanks for the question, and thanks for having on the call once more. thanks for joining. so the pre-operational expenses that we have recorded during the quarter has to do with a bucket of different things. so it's a good question.
so there is a piece of that that has to do with data acquisition costs that is in nature a variable expense because it relates directly to how many tons we are acquiring from farmers, i should say, have been constructed with farmers. so that in nature is a variable expense and depends on when farmers decide to price the signification services that they are providing to us for which we obtained the multi-plant grain. so that is a value-added expense that depends on -- the timing of that expense depends on when farmers could price to get service. about two-thirds of the sg&a costs related to hb4 has to do with data acquisition costs.
and one-third is a semi-fixed expense that has to do with support functions for the hb4 platform. so does that answer your question, ben? or are we -- do you need further expansion on any aspect?
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
no, that's a helpful start. i guess my follow-up question to that though is collectively that, i forget what it was like $1 billion, something like that in the first quarter. is that kind of a good run rate that you expect going forward? do you expect that that's going to pick up in coming quarters? what's your outlook for that line item here down the road?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
again, it's difficult estimate what the run rate is going to be because that depends on when farmers choose to price the service that they provide. what i can tell you is that what we recorded in this quarter has a substantial portion of the services that we have contracted to multiplied service. so there's a big portion of the soybean that we have produced under the hb4 program in the last season that has been already priced. so this number in this quarter has the, call it, note of that service and the big acquisition we made it to the last season of soybean.
now, going forward, that is going to depend on when farmers who applies to the service that they are providing for us to modify the 55,000 hectares of wheat. there's a portion of that that has been already -- we contractualized about one-third of that. it's going to happen in the second quarter and third quarter, but there's still price that needs to be due to that. so it's not for us to project that run rate.
what i can tell you is that most of soybeans from the last season have already been priced and the data acquisition related to that has already been paid
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
got it. ok. great. a couple of other questions.
you talked about kind of the difficulties in your second quarter of last year, given weather conditions. it appears from my vantage point, that conditions here are much more favorable this year. i'm wondering if you can just kind of provide a quick boot on the ground update of growing conditions this year, especially relative to last year.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
ben, this is federico. thanks for joining us today. we are having normal conditions in latin america primarily this year. so we don't expect to see the same weather effect that we saw last year.
so we hope to be able to keep the current momentum on the second quarter. that's probably as far as i would like to go today in terms of guiding toward second quarter outlook.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
ok. no, that's helpful, and understood. last question from me, and then i'll get back in queue. you talked about the challenges around kind of transportation, logistics, etc., that everybody seems to have right now.
it seems that you guys are -- have been able to weather that pretty well. can you talk about the conditions in argentina and throughout your supply chain and how problematic these transportation issues really are? and to the extent to which it's really impacted your ability to get your product to customers. and that will do it for me.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
no, that's an excellent question. i think when we talk about transportation and logistical complications, we are mostly focusing on international logistics. within the country logistics are somewhat normal, and we are not having major difficulties there. it is in terms of sourcing some raw material for adjuvant that we have to take anticipatory needs, if you will, that do payouts.
as you can see, we did see some incremental cost, but nowhere close to the magnitude that other industry participants have observed. and likewise, in terms of our international business where we source products, for instance, from our manufacturing facilities in argentina, we will move inventories way ahead of what we used to, to make sure that farmers have products in the shelf when they need them. and we do recognize that gaining customers, it's not always easy when you're sort of playing internationally. so we don't want the lack of inventory to be an issue.
and in that sense, there are ongoing difficulties in the sector, but we have taken anticipatory measures to try to minimize disruption. and there are certain incremental costs. i think, enrique can comment to that, but nothing to be too concerned about.
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
yes. federico, that is right. [inaudible] basically shipping in more expenses, modalities, if you will. and that basically happens or takes place in inoculants, in part.
so we tend to manage this depending on marginality. so lower-margin products have less flexibility. but as federico said, in terms of imports, now we had to really take some precautions for adjuvants, where we import silicon from outside of argentina, where we have the manufacturing facilities. remember that biologicals don't have any raw materials outside of argentina.
again, we manufacture. and then, for fertilizers where we use dap and map as raw materials, that both grow supply chain has not been as disrupted as containers. so that continued to flow pretty nicely for the quarter and continues too so now.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
got it. that's all very helpful. thank you for that context. congrats again on a really good quarter here.
thank you.

our next question comes from the line of brian wright from roth capital partners. brian, please go ahead.
brian wright -- roth capital partners -- analyst
thanks. good morning.just real quick question. can you give us some -- how much the market for the micro-bead fertilizer is sort of growing? i just want to get a sense of market share gains.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
brian, really happy to have you on the call. thanks for joining. so if i understood correctly, you are comparing to market share gain in micro-beaded fertilizers. that is a great question.
bear in mind that the main competitor for micro-beaded fertilizers rate are basically commodity fertilizers. so we are replacing all technologies with a higher technology fertilizer, specialty fertilizer. so our main challenge is to get farmers to adopt these new technologies rather than competing with other companies. there are obviously other players that provide similar fertilizers to ours in south america mainly, but we do have a competitive advantage that we are the only provider of these type of fertilizers that is manufacturing in-country.
so both in terms of gaining market share versus commodity fertilizers and also competing with other providers of specialty fertilizers, this has been a great quarter. for starters, because they are actualized in commodity fertilizer prices, allowed us or enabled a more receptive market of high-tech products. and the other one is that in terms of the challenges of logistics that ben alluded in his questions, we have a competitive advantage of manufacturing in-country and therefore, making sure that we have a steady supply of these products.
brian wright -- roth capital partners -- analyst
great. and it just seems like given what -- in the futures market for the commodity pricing, it seems like this tailwind should last quite some time.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
yeah. and here -- and then you quite know, but if i heard you correctly, you referred to the commodity -- concerned commodity prices. so what we've seen also is that throughout this quarter, steady commodity [inaudible] and more than anything, soybeans, corn and wheat. we have provided a very healthy profitability environment for farmers, which is a metric where we keep an eye, considering that that is -- we accept the need in acquiring high-tech products that they want to recommercialize.
in particular, i think that from most of our clients, the one that is more exposed to these dynamics, [inaudible] fertilizers just because fertilizers represent a big portion of the farmer's spending every year. having said that, we tend to see that there is a correlation of prices between agricultural commodities and map and dap that are raw material to us and our main competing products for the micro-beaded fertilizer. so if personally i control commodity prices, fertilizers tend to adjust with the lag, but they intend to adjust and that has happened now. what we are seeing now is that commodity prices are, i wouldn't say, softer, but it seems like they reached a new and farmer's sentiment.
i'm thinking it's around that. so as long as prices stay where they are in terms of commodity fertilizers and the agricultural commodities, i think that this is a nice setup.
brian wright -- roth capital partners -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of steven ralston from zacks investment research. steven, please go ahead.
steven ralston -- zacks investment research -- analyst
good morning and congratulations on the successful execution of your two strategies in crop nutrition and crop protection. could you help me understand what management's expectations are on the mix shifts that are occurring in your three segments? it seems like each segment has a very targeted strategy. in crop protection, with your pricing strategy, even though you're compressing the margins, sales are growing very nicely. in nutrition, sales are even growing faster, and the margin is expanding.
and this has caused some compression in the corporate margin. but it seems like when hb4 technology really gained some traction, which is a very high-margin segment that that would drive the corporate margin higher. is that the way management is looking at it? or could you just help me understand that?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
steven, this is enrique. thanks for having you on the call, and thanks for joining. so i think that -- i know you're thinking about it correctly, so that we are seeing the question is some margin compression that might be the only aspect. bear in mind that we are also working on growing our [inaudible] business in brazil, where we intend to invest in expanding our manufacturing capabilities.
that is probably a category that has the higher margin of the crop protection. but that is something that will some time, so we will be building that facility throughout the next 12 months probably. but i don't see it a trend, this margin compression in crop protection, but there is something seasonal. in crop nutrition, you got it right.
we expanded sales and margins likely expanded. i think that this is also kind of like a steady base for the margins, considering that we have our own fertilizers significantly and have been able to maintain the margin for the segment. on the corporate margin, in the long run, as you correctly mentioned, hb4 is a high-tech, high-yielding product. so when those revenues and profits hit our p&l, that should be something that allows us to get adjusted ebitda margin to levels -- to similar levels of what we have seen in the past and probably operate at some point between 25% to 30%.
but that is going to depend on when we are able to get those revenues in buckets to keep our p&l, and that is somewhere a long-term view of growing ebitda financial update, one should brig as they go to market.
steven ralston -- zacks investment research -- analyst
thank you. could you clarify the dynamics that are occurring in the distribution channel in crop nutrition? you mentioned that you have 30 new distributors that incorporated microstar. a clarification of that. are they adopting microstar for the very first time? or are they -- do you already have a relationship with these distributors and they're just extending it to microstar?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
so that is a great question, steve. so this year, 30 distributors were already distributing our products and incorporated new presentations of microstar. so we went to market with a more conventional presentation, if you will, or less technology. and we have been working on new presentations, a new technology in microstar of the main brand in micro-beaded fertilizer.
so throughout the quarter, what we saw is 30 existing distributors to incorporate new presentations of microstar.
steven ralston -- zacks investment research -- analyst
so you expanded the relationship with these distributors. i think a couple of years ago, you put out a chart of all your distributors in argentina, which is impressive. how much more potential is there to broaden your -- microstar into other distributors that you're already having relationships with?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
steve, this is federico. i think there's a tremendous potential. i mean, we probably will not expand the overall points of sale for our portfolio, which today are in excess of 700 in argentina. but they'll be -- -- these new presentations that enrique alluded to that were sold by a very small group or sub segment of these distributors that are likely to be adopted by the majority of them.
and by them, i mean, the sort of the bio version of microstar that has microorganisms incorporated. so we are not only providing the formulation advantage where if you want one-quarter of application rate, that will make the nutrients themselves more revenue available with sort of the microbials that are added to the formulation. and today, you will see that close to 10% of the segment revenues are explained by these new product launches. now, they are in a sub fraction or a smooth fraction of a 700 sale points that we currently have, the 30 that we are adding in the last quarter.
and we knew that throughout the year, we should get to the majority of these participants but not beyond the distribution footprint that we currently have for the selected family of products.
steven ralston -- zacks investment research -- analyst
thank you for taking my questions.
operator
our next question comes from kemp dolliver from brookline capital markets. kemp, please proceed.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you and good morning. apologies if you had covered this earlier, but ctnbio is meeting, i think, today and tomorrow and echo wheat is on the agenda. can you talk about what we should expect if they approve your application, when we would see an announcement? or is there anything left with regard -- are there any other steps in the approval process between a vote at this meeting and then final approval?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
so thank you, kemp, for your question. we have not discussed that earlier in the call, but i think we should know the outcome of the current meeting tomorrow, i believe, on the levels. there are two potential outcomes. in our view, one is that the community in a way approves the technology.
and that is -- it's for the current evaluation or that new questions are requested by committee members, not by evaluators that have not submitted any questions since our last filing that was done ahead of the october meeting, but they did not have enough time to report on that since that -- the october meeting. so the evaluators themselves we believe not to be generating questions, but the committee may request to ask additional aspects. in each case, we will know tomorrow. but i think those are the two possible outcomes on the levels.
if there are more questions, we'll try to sort of reply to them quickly so that we can have -- we can consider again in the december meeting. but we are assured, anxiously waiting for tomorrow's results.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
yes. that's great. and just to clarify, if they approve, does that complete the process and you will be able to effectively move -- yes, you are literally standing in material steps when the process are done and then you'll be able to move forward with the launch?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
so i think if they approve, that will be a huge milestone. remember, we indicated five conditions for us to broadly launch. this is one of them. we have also done findings in other minor export destinations for argentine meet that i believe are below the 5% level and within above the 5% level, we have that as a requirement for launch.
but i've seen this probably delay in one country where we consistently have, if you do like a five-year average, a position that explains more than 5% of argentine in the exports. the approval that will likely be granted after the current evaluation is for [inaudible] so that, i think, will free up the ability of local mills to export big flower to brazil. we've gained approval in the later stage and i think that will probably be matched to in-country production in brazil, which is something we are currently pursuing, and there'll be a subsequent filing to [inaudible] in the coming quarters. but i think it will be huge and it will significantly improve our ability to enroll hb4 contributed goods into revenues.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you. and my last question is, as i look at the balance sheet, biological assets have increased substantially and one, what accounts for the increase since june? and secondly, how should we -- what should we expect for changes in biological assets looking ahead?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
kemp, this is enrique. thanks for joining. good to have you in the call. so biological assets may comprise of hb4 inventories.
so the reason that has gone up after june is basically because we are accounting to all of the hb4 soy inventories that were produced in the last harvest season in argentina in may, june and july. so that is the reason why biological assets have gone up. then we decide to keep all of that plan for future suit, or we can decide to discuss some of those varieties. that are the two variables that affect biological assets.
going forward, bear in mind, we will also incorporate into that wheat production for this year that will be harvested in december and january in argentina. so the trend in biological assets, an upward trend, wheat seasonality considering when we harvested wheat or soy [inaudible]. and then, the outflow of that asset is basically when we decide to discard that [inaudible] not be moved to seed collection or into seed collection for the future. so that is basically the dynamics, and there's always be an upward trend that should build up inventories in next few quarters.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
ok, super. so really, this is just an inventory line item from here?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
yes, it is as long as hb4 is not converted into a final product. when we convert that grain, we basically process that grain into a final seed of hb4 that is converted into or moved into a inventory line. but as long as it sits as grain or a crop that has been planted on the field, it's in biological assets.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
we currently have no further questions. we'll now hand back over to federico and enrique for the closing remarks.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
so not much more to add other than we are very happy and satisfied with the performance we're showing you today. i think this is something to congratulate the operations team at bioceres in terms of different strategies that were implemented. and we believe that toward the next few quarters and probably more importantly, toward the second half of the fiscal year, a similar trend will be seen in the seed and integrated products segment, which is where we are still slightly flat today. and that will materialize primarily as hb4 contributed goods, but and reported as revenues and no longer continue to be like we do today.
so we have a strategy that is moving forward as projected, and we are very satisfied with that. we remain fully available to address any additional questions that you might have. i hope i wish everyone a great rest of the day today.

as we have done in past calls, we will provide a brief update on the hb4 roll-out and regulatory processes. we will also take a minute to introduce a new level of esg reporting on hb4 inventories that will help us measure environmental exposure toward chemicals and promote reduced chemical footprints in our seed and grain production systems. last but not least, we'll report on the completion of rizobacter's $16 million public offering of series vi corporate bonds throughout the quarter. the capital raise adds to the financial strength required to support working capital needs in the coming quarters.
please now turn to slide four for a quick review of a strong self-momentum growth throughout the last three quarters. comparable ltm revenues reached $220 million, up 24% from the same period last year on an ltm metric. we observed top line double-digit growth trajectory results from the effective implementation of new strategies in the crop protection and nutrition segments with revenue growth accelerating from the 35% to 40% level in the first half of the calendar year to about 50% in the current period. first fiscal quarter expansion was driven primarily by the combination of the new commercial strategies recently mentioned, new product launches and generally positive sector dynamics in latin america.
the rising trends in micro-beaded fertilizer sales continues for the third consecutive quarter with the crop nutrition segment explaining 44% of the growth in the period. our installed capacity reaching 48%, up 60% from the year ago period. innovative bionutrition products launched ahead of the summer crop planting season also showed solid performance during the quarter. integral microstar bio and microstar ped bio already represents close to 10% of the segment sales.
the crop protection segment benefited from the full impacts of sales force and channel reorganization, with this segment explaining close to 55% of the growth observed in the period. finally, we expect to see similar growth in the seeds and integrated products segment in the upcoming quarters, primarily as hb4 inventories are not longer contributed but are sold as seed or grain, and also as a result of an ongoing ration process within this segment materializes. growth in the seeds and integrated products segment should help us keep the current momentum so as this part of first quarter of the current fiscal year. please turn to slide five for an update on the ongoing hb4 initiatives.
hb4 inventory ramp up processes are moving forward as discussed in our previous earnings call. early season hb4 soy plantings were completed, while late season planting, which represents the majority of the targeted factors is about to start in the coming days. hb4 wheat harvest started and is currently at about 10%, mainly in the northern regions of argentina where wheat reaches seasonal maturity earlier. operational metrics will be updated in the upcoming quarters at the end of hb4 wheat harvest and hb4 soy planting seasons.
on the regulatory front, no additional information has been requested since our september report by chinese regulatory authorities regarding hb4 soy nor by brazil's ctnbio regarding their ongoing evaluation of hb4 wheat. as we said before, we believe both regulators should be able to resolve approval requests in their upcoming meetings and look forward to communicating our findings as they will inform to us. as you all know, end-to-end traceability is a central feature for our company and is considered a broad across the board approach in the early aspects of the soy program as we generate information and design the tools for consumers and growers to talk to each other. in slide six, you will find a snapshot of different points within our hb portfolio in process where data is collected.
we have dedicated significant time and resources to integrate different technologies into a comprehensive traceability platform, including the use of lock chain ledger to bolster transparency and credibility to all stakeholders. a tangible solution arrive from these assets are the esg reports, which aims to keep track of farmers' performance and provide consumers with solid traceable esgc and grain scoring. we are taking this opportunity to announce the addition of ecotoxicological indexes to our esg reporting process for hb4 inventories, which you will see in slide seven. we have decided to produce a blended ecotoxicological score, combining the very similar scps environmental impact portions with the latest based dependent pesticide risk approach.
these measurements consider factors such as thermal toxicity, toxicity to birds, bees and beneficial ag reports, soil health life, surface potential, plant surface half-life, systemicity, reaching potential among other factors affecting farm workers, environment and consumers, which are estimated for the most frequently used pesticides. we believe this report will set a new industry standard. understanding environmental impacts of exposure to different active ingredients, the carbon intensity of production processes, and the water footprint of agricultural ecosystems are all key elements in designing and promoting a 21st century regenerative agriculture. this concludes my prepared remarks.
i will now turn the call over to our cfo, enrique lopez lecube to discuss our fiscal first quarter financial performance. enrique?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
thanks, federico. good day to everyone and thank you for joining us today. moving over to the financials. please turn to slide eight as we frame the impact of our quarterly performance on an ltm basis.
as federico outlined a few minutes ago, we had a strong first quarter performance at the run-off of the high season of sales in key markets across south america, with comparable revenues rising 54% to roughly $65 million. now, for the third consecutive quarter, our top line has outperformed the previous fiscal year period, clearly offsetting the blowback in the second quarter of the previous fiscal year, which had been negatively affected by serious droughts in south america. as a result, ltm comparable revenues were up 24% to $220 million, even as the ltm metric of this year's seed accounts for that soft second quarter. execution during the quarter consolidated the successful outcome from the initiatives taken in the second half of fiscal 2021 to reignite growth in our crop protection and nutrition business segments.
segregation of commercial teams and enough sales force power, allowing the implementation of a more customized market approach with a product centered strategy for high-technology categories such as micro-beaded fertilizers versus an opportunistic and market-driven approach for third-party product. crop nutrition was the segment that benefited the most from the doubling sales versus a year ago quarter. in particular, we saw a twofold growth in micro-beaded fertilizer volumes as a result of the combination of increased sales force focus and market conditions. growing sales of product lines that minimize negative externalities from farming activities continues to be a key element of our baseline business.
and this quarter's performance is a testimony to that. moving on to slide nine that compares ltm ebitda as of september 2021 with ltm ebitda in september 2020. growth in profitability was more modest than top line growth. this year's ltm ebitda metrics fully accounts for $3.4 million in pre-operational expenses related to the roll-out of the hb4 program that did not exist in the previous fiscal year ltm ebitda.
profitability from our baseline business is currently supporting expenses relating to hb4, but still have no current record in reported revenues and gross profit. it is important though to note that the inventory ramp-up process that is being executed is generating deferred revenues and profitability from contributed goods that will be recognized in a timely fashion once inventories are sold as seed or grain. furthermore, the ltm ebitda metric for this year also accounts for the drawback in the second quarter of fiscal '21 that have been hit by dry weather, as mentioned before, as well as unfavorable dynamics from inflation and depreciation of local currency in argentina, where we hold most of our manufacturing and support function. furthermore, ltm ebitda stands at over $50 million and slightly increased even as we account for these key elements that had no impact in the previous fiscal year is the proof of the strength and resiliency of our baseline business and gives us great confidence as we move forward.
let's please move to slide 10 for a breakdown of first quarter revenues for business segment. the $22.6 million increase in comparable revenues was driven by an almost even contribution from crop protection and crop nutrition with seed and integrated products almost flat versus the previous quarter. crop protection sales were up 58%, reaching $34.3 million. crop protection global supply chain conditions provided tailwinds of product shortages, low prices higher in south america, which was further reinforced by sustained agricultural commodity prices.
as i mentioned earlier, the reorganization of the commercial teams in the segment favored an opportunistic approach to leverage market momentum with higher sales of third-party products, mainly in argentina. on the flip side, the mix train during the quarter drove adjuvant volumes down compared to a year ago quarter, a situation we believe could get normalized during the current quarter. the average gross margin for the segments declined from 38.6% to 33%, primarily due to the increase in sales of lower-margin third-party products, detrimental to sales contribution from higher-margin adjuvants. the crop nutritional segment grew an impressive 83% to almost $22 million.
the expansion in the segment was mainly explained by micro-beaded fertilizer sales that benefited from a combination of factors. first, increased focus from commercial teams with expertise in conducting sales based on product attributes rather than market conditions alone. this was possible, thanks to the incorporation of new salespeople who are focused on lower margin and more opportunistic sales. secondly, the commodity fertilizers market macro conditions also provide an opportunity to ramp volumes up with healthy margins.
commodity fertilizer supply shortages resulting from china's energy crisis and global logistic challenges drove prices higher, which favors market penetration and adoption of high-tech specialty fertilizers. throughout the quarter, 30 distributors have incorporated the new different presentations of microstar, our main brand for micro-beaded fertilizers to the product offering as federico previously mentioned. inoculant's sales were also higher during the quarter despite volumes remaining flat. this was due to a shift in the product mix from conventional inoculants to higher value inoculants, in particular the long-life inoculants, lli, a proprietary technology of bioceres.
lli has been gaining popularity among growers because of its higher microorganism survival rate and greater nodular dry mass. the overall gross margin for the segment increased slightly to 51% despite higher sales contribution from micro-beaded fertilizers, which have lower margins than inoculants. the micro-beaded fertilizer margins remained fairly stable, driven by economies of scale as volumes increase, as well as favorable market conditions. inoculant margins increased as a result of the shift to llis from conventional inoculants.
finally, seed and integrated products comparable revenues in the first quarter of fiscal '22 stood at $8.7 million, flat compared to the first quarter of fiscal '21. seed pack volumes remained flat in the first quarter as the high season for seed treatment solutions in south america begins. margins in the segment dropped to almost 63% due to unfavorable cost dynamics in argentina where seed treatment packs are manufactured. overall, it was a great quarter for our top line growth.
let's please move on to slide 11 for a look at how this translated into gross profit contributions. so in comparable gross profit for the quarter grew to roughly $28 million, almost 40% more compared to the year ago quarter, driven by expansion of our top line was done profitably. crop nutrition contributed roughly two-thirds of the growth for the quarter, as sales grew with gross margin expansion. despite contributing roughly half of the growth in revenues, crop protection only contributed a third of the growth in gross profit as expansion in sales was driven by lower margin third-party products.
overall, gross margin and sales dropped from 37.5% to 43.1%, explained by the product mix shifts as we said before but also by unfavorable cost comparison versus the prior year. our cost of goods sold during this year's quarter have been negatively impacted by inflation and fx dynamics in argentina. for the last 12 months, inflation in the country has outpaced depreciation of the local currency, which has the negative effect on dollar-linked businesses like ours. situation we live should be normalized sometime in the near future based on backed experience.
let's now please turn to slide 12 for a review on ebitda performance for the quarter. adjusted ebitda increased 18%, totaling $12.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal '22. reported gross profit rose by $9.8 million, composed of $7.9 million increase in comparable gross profit and $1.9 million in ias 29 positive adjustments. operating expenses and other income and expenses collectively increased by $7.5 million, partially offsetting growth in gross profit.
importantly and as discussed at the beginning of our presentation, this $7.5 million increase includes $1.9 million in pre-operational expenses during the quarter related to hb4. $1.1 million accounted for in sg&a and $0.8 million accounted for in other income and expenses. these pre-operational expenses are fully accounted for in our adjusted ebitda and, therefore, supported by our baseline business. i'll take a minute to further discuss sg&a, which totaled $16.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal '22 compared to $10.1 million during the first quarter of fiscal '21.
the increase is mainly explained by a combination of variable and semi-fixed expenses. variable sales-related tax and logistics expenses grew by $2.7 million, in line with growth in revenues and increased freight expenses in a global trade challenges. employee salaries and social security costs, a semi-fixed expense, increased by $1.7 million, including resources assigned to hb4. finally, similar to cost of goods sold, fx and inflation dynamics in argentina also played a negative growth on operating expenses.
despite the year-over-year increase, total sg&a expenses remained almost flat as a percentage of revenue at 24.2%. turning to slide 13 to address our debt evolution and cash position before turning it over to federico for remarks. total financial debt by quarter end was roughly $180 million of each approximately 63% consisted of long-term obligations. the liquidity equivalents, cash as equivalents and short-term investments stood at $42 million and represented approximately 63% of the current portion of debt.
the total financial debt increased by $6 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, despite the increase in total financial debt. ltm financial expenses decreased by 7% from $14.6 million to $13.5 million. net debt by quarter end was $137.6 million, a 2.7% ratio of net debt to ltm adjusted ebitda. the sequential increase in the net financial debt is explained by a slight increase in total debt and an increase in the cash position as we enter a high season in key markets and working capital requirements increase.
this concludes my remarks for today. federico?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
thanks, enrique. i will now open up the floor for questions before concluding remarks.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from ben klieve from lake street capital markets. please go ahead.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
all right. first of all, congratulations on a great quarter. first question is around the launch of hb4 wheat. i'm curious the degree to which there are buyer -- downstream buyers secured after harvest.
do farmers that are buying your seed have guaranteed offtake agreements for millers and do those millers have offtake agreements with consumer goods companies or is that something that still is yet to be determined?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
hi, ben, this is federico. thanks for joining us today, and thank you for your question. so we have been working actively to create the agreement with processors. as we move into the next season and commercially launch hb4 wheat, we will continue to handhold with our farmers so that we minimize any kind of commercial disruption.
and as of today, we have already 13 different processors onboarded or in the process of onboarding for processing hb4 wheat with capacity combined -- or a combined capacity, i should say, of about 700,000 tons, which is way in excess of what we would need for the upcoming season. so that's been negotiated, put in place. that is an aspect that we will continue to solve for our customers, understanding the complexity behind this new technology on the commercial front.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
perfect. next question on -- i appreciate your comments on kind of moving from first to second to third generation varieties here to reduce the -- to improve the genetics -- the underlying genetics. i'm curious how that is playing out in soybean within the u.s.? are you -- do you expect that you're going to see -- have that same kind of genetic gap with your first-generation hb4 seed that you've been testing in the u.s.? and if so, how are you addressing that to improve the genetics in the u.s. proactively?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
so that's an excellent question as well, ben. i think in the u.s., since we didn't have a bridging program of our own, and we rely more on third-party genetics we are less likely to observe that generic gap. i think we will be introgressing the trade into already competitive germplasm -- we are introgressing already the trade into competitive germplatform. so we don't expect to see the gap that we saw in argentina.
and also, this is a strategy we're expanded into in argentina as well. so you will see that the onboarding of alex -- alex garcia, head of seeds is predominantly to focus on the new approach and relied on the outstanding genetics of current market participants so that we minimize sort of the germplasm gaps in new markets as we roll out the technology globally.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
got it. got it. perfect. last one for me, and i'll get back in queue.
and i don't know if enrique or federico, who this is more appropriate for, but the results over the last four quarters here as you've changed the go-to-market strategy just been exceptional, but those results are lapping. and so as you look into q3 and beyond, when you've got that strategy already built in to your prior year results, how do you see growth evolving over the next few quarters? is there still runway to be had from this new go-to-market strategy or are you guys expecting kind of a more material decline on a year over year -- your growth from a year-over-year basis?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
i will give you my high-level view on that, and then enrique probably can give you more detail. i do expect to see a similar momentum in the third quarter. so there's still runway from the existing reorganization to be materialized, probably a little less from that particular aspect on the fourth quarter, but i do expect international growth to continue on a very robust manner. and we do expect hb4 to kick in, in the fourth quarter as well, helping keep the momentum that we currently have.
so i'm sort of very happy with the growth trajectory that we've been having and are fairly confident that we can keep this momentum in the next two quarters. enrique?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
yes. i agree with federico's comments. ben, i think that there are some values that played into how we were able to grow through the last year, one of those is market conditions. so we had very, very attractive market conditions out of the fact that fertilizers' prices, for example, went up and that gave us a great setup to go with our product to market.
so i think that as long as those conditions remain in place, we're going to be able to keep showing growth, maybe not as aggressively as what we did until now. but there is still runway ahead, but there's some of the values that helped us that will always be outside of the control of management, right? so steel tools in the toolkit to keep growing as long as market conditions are there. and i think that as federico mentioned as well, we're excited about to have other growth levers to pull like with hb4 wheat kicking in.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
got it. got it. very encouraging. well, i appreciate you all taking my questions.
that does it for me, and i'll jump back in queue.
operator
perfect. thank you, ben, for your question. [operator instructions] and our next question comes from brian wright from wolfe capital markets. please go ahead.
your line is open.
brian wright -- wolfe capital markets -- analyst
thanks. good morning. a couple of questions. i want to start out with, if you could just educate us on the relevance of the yellow rust and what that means from a commercial standpoint?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
hi, brian. it's good to have you on the call. i think it's obviously a concerning aspect to farmers, mostly on the commercial front. i mean consumers don't like to see rust in the flower or in the grain that will be processed.
and i think that that was an unexpected outcome of these new varieties that the rust incidence was significantly diminished. so we expect that to enable more profitable commercialization from a yield perspective in the field. it's an important sanitary aspect, but not too dramatic, i should say.
brian wright -- wolfe capital markets -- analyst
ok. and then just following up a little bit on the improvement on the test weight, is there any quantification you want to help us out with on that?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
sure. i think that's something we observed with a significant number of farmers, particularly in the southwest of buenos aires where we are currently having some of the better results on hb4 technology. these are regions that have very restrictive activity at many times with production goes into forage. the quality component here allows that need to go into industrial uses.
i think that way ph and other elements combined provide for that -- in that particular region in a manner that is very relevant. so it's not only about improving on the tonnes per hectare viewpoint, but also the quality of what's being produced allows for an end use that is more profitable than deviating to forage because of the reduced test weight. i think the improvement was above 10%, which is significant in this particular aspect.
brian wright -- wolfe capital markets -- analyst
great. that's perfect. a couple more. i just wanted to understand.
on slide 7, on the market opportunity in argentina, could you -- on the 2.3 million hectares, is that -- is that acreage that's lower yielding predominantly, or is it just like how that addressable market was kind of defined?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
so those are hectares where we believe hb4 will provide a consistent benefit. so they are usually lower yielding. and that is not to say that we're not expecting, particularly, as we introduced the second-gen varieties, which we have presented in today's presentation, i think we can, aspirationally, target the high productivity areas as well, but we are not contemplating that today in our markets that way. so we are almost restricting the technology to the lower productivity regions, and that's where the number comes from.
brian wright -- wolfe capital markets -- analyst
perfect. and two more if you'll bear with me or actually go back in queue, but i'd like to just go with them, if that's ok.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
no. go ahead.
brian wright -- wolfe capital markets -- analyst
can you remind us on kind of what the historic gross margin differences between the adjuvants versus the insecticide and the fungicides, just ballpark?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
in terms of what are the different product characteristics?
brian wright -- wolfe capital markets -- analyst
no gross margin differentials.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
so adjuvants tend to be our highest gross margin products in the crop protection segment. enrique, you want to comment on the rest?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
yes. absolutely. so adjuvants, we are in the range of 55% to 65%, usually, brian, depending on what type of adjuvant, whether it's a high-tech adjuvant or lower tech based on vegetable oil and not silicon. but most of our adjuvants are high tech, and that is closer to toward the 65% top of the range that i just said.
then on insecticides and fungicides, obviously that is a lower category. i think in the lower category in the segment that basically explains the decline in overall gross margin for the quarter are the third-party products. in third-party products, we make between 25% to 35% margin, sometimes even higher if it's a highly tech sale that needs to be done. but it is a business that is practical to us.
it's not strategic and we usually pay less attention to that. now we're focused a bit more on that. and i think that to us is -- i won't say low-hanging fruit because it does require a commercial effort, but it's a provider of revenues with a margin between 25% to 35%. that's the range for the whole segment.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
i think the only thing we should highlight here is that that is why we are talking about chemicals. if you talk about bioinsecticides or in our case, biofungicide like i think so, the gross margin is more similar to that biological product. so this is upwards of probably 60%.
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
absolutely. yes. when we're talking about proprietary bioinsecticides or biofungicides, the margin is more tilted toward what we make on inoculants and seed treatment bags.
brian wright -- wolfe capital markets -- analyst
perfect. and just last one, if i can. what was that recent acquisition kind of revenue in the quarter?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
you're meaning the one associated to the reorganization of the crop protection segment with the use of the rizobacter sales force?
brian wright -- wolfe capital markets -- analyst
yes. the one that was -- came on board, i think it was last quarter.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
yes.
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
yes. absolutely. federico said it right, that is part of our reorganization. i mean, it's a commercial entity that takes care of basically sales force that is specifically allocated to commercializing third-party products across the main regions in argentina.
they do have some -- we do have now some owned stores, but it basically focuses on low margin i refer 25% to 35% range, type of products. that came on board a couple of quarters ago, they took over the commercialization of the third-party products that are rizobacter sales force be that before, and that allows the rizobacter sales force to focus more on international growth and also in the micro-beaded fertilizers. that acquisition was probably had a run rate in the previous quarter -- in the quarter -- second quarter of the previous fiscal year of about $8 million, and it grew significantly now in our hands.
brian wright -- wolfe capital markets -- analyst
probably almost sliced?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
yes. so the jump from this sort of -- a jump from $8 million to $16 million now in this particular quarter. but that --
brian wright -- wolfe capital markets -- analyst
so it's performing exceptionally well as well. so it's across the board. what you're integrating in is we're seeing great performance across core and acquisition revenue.
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
absolutely. i think that there was -- it makes a ton of sense in terms of synergies as this commercial team that we brought on board was already commercializing some of the rizobacter products way before we make that integration. so it makes sense that we are seeing some very strong commercial synergies coming out of the interaction between the two commercial teams.
brian wright -- wolfe capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you so much.
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
i'd like to thank you, brian, for your questions. our next question comes from kemp dolliver from brookline capital markets. please go ahead. sorry, kemp.
we're not getting any audio from your line. could you please assure you're not in mute?
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
hello.
operator
hello. we can hear you now.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
thank you. so thank you, and good morning. just to start with the growth in the es -- i'm sorry, eu and u.s. markets.
could you talk a little bit more about the actions you've taken to drive that, the outlook, and also a little more -- and i think you mentioned the product segment, but if you could go through the opportunity across the business in those two markets that would be helpful?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
we are thrilled with what we're seeing in europe and the u.s. in the u.s., we've been there for many years and have reorganized the sales force under new management that provided for the incremental sales that we're seeing today, mostly on the inoculant front and the biologicals that are our most international product, if you will. so that incremental growth in the u.s. comes from an internal reorganization and a new manager in place that's been building or rebuilding the relationships on the historical products that were sold in the u.s., mostly, inoculants.
in the case of europe, we've been putting a strategy in place by initially having a subsidiary so that we could secure product registrations, integrating our biologicals with some of the seed care products, and further consolidating some historical relationships, as you know, we are a very important partner of syngenta. and even though that is today most material in argentina, it is a relationship that is expanding to our other geographies. and part of the european growth comes from that relationship as well. so on a forward-going basis, we expect to see similar growth, obviously, not 146% quarter over quarter in every period, but we do expect these two geographies to become very meaningful.
and these are huge markets. the u.s., as you know, for row crops in general, and europe for biologicals or biofertilizers that can't minimize the use or reduce the use of chemical fertilizers, i think we have a very appealing portfolio with the upcoming registration also of our biofungicide for the european market. so we do expect to see a very strong performance in the quarters to come.
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
yes. i would only add to that, kemp, that i think the part that it makes it even more exciting is that these two geographies, north america and europe brought almost a quarter of the growth in gross profit. so it's not only attractive markets from the size perspective, but also markets that are very profitable to us. so that is something that makes us put more focus and effort into building more infrastructure to keep growing.
having said that, i think that still this needs to be evaluated in the sort of like a context of the full season in those countries, and it has just gotten started. so i think that we are here to see what the final result will be for the full season, and that is going to unfold in the second quarter, third quarter, and fourth quarter.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
super. and in the u.s., is this revitalized sales effort, the team you can leverage, or when you roll out the hb4 products, will that require a separate marketing effort?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
i think there might be some support from the existing team, but we are more inclined to thinking of an independent effort for the hb4 program in the u.s. this is a team that specializes on biologicals, particularly seed treatment. we will obviously use the hb4 channel to commercialize biologicals and seed treatments, but the specificity of the seed business will require a dedicated marketing and commercial effort with a different level of expertise. so some synergies, some support, but for the most part, these will be two different teams.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
great. and the guidance regarding eco wheat's very helpful. so a couple of questions related to the assumptions. first for the market opportunity, over what time frame do you think that realization is possible? is that five years, 10 years? what's your thinking about the adoption curve?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
so we believe it's closer to 5 than to 10. it's up three years out, but that's as much as i would like to say now.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
that's fair enough. and with regard to the ebitda guidance, what revenue does that -- what level of revenue does that imply?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
so you can think of this as a 30% to 35% ebitda margin business. so that you can then play with the numbers and get your revenues, or vice versa. obviously, there might be some price pressure as we try to fully penetrate. so it's not like we're going to keep steady pricing, but there might be additional technologies brought into the product offering.
so i think you can use that to sort of play with the numbers and come to some very close understanding of what we expect.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
great. and that would apply to both soy and wheat?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
yes. in general, yes. i think that margins are similar. remember that we do some equity accounting for a jv with florimond desprez that we don't do in soybeans, but ebitda margin-wise, yes.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
so for -- in soy, we're fully owned the technology which part of the technology and the product was co-financed by florimond desprez?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
yes.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
great. and my last product -- or i'm sorry, my last question relates to china. there have been some regulatory changes involving gmo wheat and -- i'm sorry, soy and corn, they appear to focus on domestic development of these products. do you have a -- do you have any thoughts on how that move impacts your application? it seems like a step in the right direction, but it's very hard to determine everything that may be going on there?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
yes. absolutely. i think it is a step in the right direction. it is a step that is mostly designed for the in-country cultivation process and for some local developers that have today products in their pipelines that can be applied in china.
unfortunately, we have not seen sort of a similar attitude toward international approvals. so if you look at the last two innings of the chinese regulators, they have mostly restricted approvals to domestic market issues that have not approved any new soy for feed and food importation, for instance. so it is a process that is difficult to that unlike what we had with brazil ctnbio that we knew every month what to expect, the chinese process is more difficult to track. we are now in the process of requesting argentine authorities to review the current approval.
this is an approval that takes back to 2015. so they have -- seven years have passed already, and we're still waiting for the chinese clearance. so i think that this can be made for a time limitation on the chinese plus here in argentina, particularly for a technology that has already been approved in the u.s., in brazil, in paraguay, in canada. so most of the relevant production geographies without any kind of consideration to the chinese regulatory process.
so we do expect the chinese approval to come, but we are taking a more proactive stance, particularly with the argentine authorities to try to remove that restriction and be able to freely commercialize hb4 in the upcoming season. seven years is not atypical for them.
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
no. but i think it's enough time to make a decision. but we're cautiously optimistic, i should say, even though we did expect this last year, but we're still waiting.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
very good. thank you.
operator
perfect. thank you, kemp, for your questions. at this time, there are no further questions. i now would like to pass the call back over to federico trucco, for any final remarks.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
well, first, i want to thank everyone again for joining us today. i think we had a very good quarter. we are very enthusiastic about the state of our business and the prospects ahead. i mean to say bluntly, we are on fire and delighted to be on fire and hopefully, we can keep on bringing similar performances in the quarters to come.
so not much more. wish everyone a happy thursday and a good end to this week. thank you.

hello, everyone, and welcome to the bioceres corp solutions fiscal second quarter 2022 financial results conference call. my name is victoria, and i will be coordinating your call today. [operator instructions] i'll now present you to your host, rodrigo krause, head of investor relations to begin. please go ahead.
rodrigo krause -- head of investor relations
good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us. presenting during today's call will be federico trucco, our chief executive officer; and enrique lopez lecube, our chief financial officer. both will be available for the q&a session. before we proceed, i would like to make the following safe harbor statement.
today's call will contain forward-looking statements, and i refer you to the forward-looking statements section of today's earnings release and presentation as well as in our recent filings with the sec. we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect new or changed events or circumstances. also, please note that for comparison purposes and a better understanding of our company's underlying performance, and in addition to discussing as reported results during our presentation today, we will discuss comparable results, which exclude the impact of hyperinflation accounting in argentina. additional information in connection with the application of the rule ias 29 can be found in our earnings report.
finally, this conference call is being webcasted. the webcast link is available at the biocerescrops.com investor relations site. at this time, i would like to turn the call over to our ceo, federico trucco. thank you. 
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
thanks, rodrigo. good morning, and welcome to all that have joined us today for our quarterly report. please turn to slide 3 for a brief overview of the business and financial highlights we will be discussing in today's call. we are pleased to report a record quarter in the history of our company with quarterly comparable revenues at $90.3 million and ltm adjusted ebitda at $61.8 million, excluding hb4 prelaunch costs.
our very strong second quarter's performance reflects an 89% growth in revenues over the same quarter of last year with the last growth across all three business segments. we're also very proud to report that our combined growth in europe and north america at 146% year over year, places these important geographies at least to 10% of our global revenues, a huge step forward in our international diversification strategy. as we have done in past calls, we will provide a brief update on the hb4 rollout and regulatory processes. on this last front, i would like to mention the recent announcement in november 2021 by the brazilian national biosafety commission, ctnbio that decided unanimously to approve the import certification for hb4 wheat flour for human and animal consumption in that country.
this approval is a major milestone in bioceres' mission to build agricultural systems that enhance carbon sequestration and climate resiliency and is a necessary step for a commercial launch in the upcoming planting season. please now turn to slide 4 for an overview on our seasons results for a before week as we completed harvesting of 53,000 hectares. hb4 wheat performance was consistent with prior seasons with hb4 varieties outyielding non-hb4 by 12.8% across all environments and mutations with improved performance in local activity environments where a yield benefit averaged 49%. some important takeaways from the current season are the improved sanitary and quality profile observed in our hb4 materials.
for instance, the prevalence of yellow rust in hb4 varieties was 70x lower than in commercial controls in infected fields. as we expand acreage and achieve exposure to a wider array of growing conditions, we are also able to identify some limitations in our current first-generation portfolio, particularly in terms of lodging in undernourished environments and lower yield growth under conditions, most notoriously above the 5 tons per hectare level. we expect to overcome instrumentations with the introduction of second-generation genetics as we will discuss in slide 6 and with grower activities. in slide 5, you will see performance results by region and grower satisfaction levels.
it is very important to note that 225 growers anticipated in the current season, representing an unprecedented level of pre-lodged grower scrutiny for the technology and for our identity preserve production program. yield improvements range from 5.7% to 39.6% across all environments and regions. regions where benefits were lower, reflected limited adaptation by current materials and conversely, in regions with gains were more relevant. grower satisfaction levels ranged between 60% and 80% in regions where yield benefits were below average, and increase to about 80% where benefits were close to or above average.
we believe that the current level of performance information by region, by productivity conditions, and by global profile, provide us a very valuable data to fine-tune our value proposition and portfolio mix ahead of our upcoming launch. turning now to slide 6. as noted, we expect to minimize geographical limitations and improve grower experience under high-yielding conditions as we expand our portfolio to include second-gen materials. our current data show an average improvement of 16% in environments yielding above 5 tons per hectare for new materials when compared to first-generation varieties.
we are moving at full biological speed to include these newer materials in our offering, planning to contract 30% of the 23-24 system multiplication cycle with these second-generation varieties. please turn to slide 7 for our current thinking regarding the hb4 wheat opportunity in key markets. latam represents a total market of roughly 9.5 million hectares, of which argentina, south america's biggest wheat producer, contributes with 6.5 million. we believe we can capture an estimated 2.3 million hectares with our available portfolio and near-term pipeline, and we are currently requesting participation of three commercial varieties.
we estimate an incremental ebitda of between $15 million and $20 million by fiscal year '24, with peak sales in this market projected in the $190 million to $200 million range. we also expect to grow beyond argentina as we secure cultivation approval in brazil, the second-largest latam market. the rate of approval in -- now expected for 2023 after completing in-country evaluations. we believe that hb4 technology may enable significant market expansion in this country, particularly as tropical germplasm currently being tested for reproduction in the region is incorporated to the pipeline.
brazil may, therefore, represent an additional opportunity of between 700,000 to 1.1 million hectares in the medium term. beyond latin america, we are currently pursuing production approvals in the united states, australia, and south africa. these geographies combined represent twice the hectare opportunity currently being pursued in latin america, although in a longer time horizon. please turn to slide 8.
on this slide, we address the rollout of new hb4 soy varieties. as we anticipated in our fourth quarter call of fiscal year 2021, we decided to discontinue the ramp-up process for first-generation materials in favor of second and third-generation varieties. third-generation varieties were multiplied of season in the united states and resulting inventories planted in full in the current cycle, totaling approximately 1,500 hectares, which are generally in good condition. in the case of second-generation materials, where the germplasm drug was not fully eliminated, we decided to reposition a significant part of the multiplication process as a follow-up crop to reach in later season plantings.
data from the 2021 season indicated that the use of these materials as a second crop in later season plantings showed little, if any, performance gap under higher-yielding conditions. unfortunately, the lack of rain during december made some of the locations we selected no longer suitable for the ramp-up process. and consequently, we achieved 60% of the planned area for second-generation plantings. despite not fully achieving our multiplication objective in the current cycle, we still believe resulting inventories may reach multilevel revenues for the next season.
finally turning to the next slide, in our progression to further enhance our business worldwide and develop top-performing genetics for hb4 traits and new technologies, we have brought on board alexandre garcia as global head of seeds. alex has led tmg's innovation and r&d initiatives for many years and has collaborated actively and meaningfully from the tmg side on hb4 technology development in brazil. we take this opportunity to welcome alex to the bioceres family and wish him every success in his new position. this concludes my prepared remarks.
i will now turn the call over to our cfo, enrique lopez lecube, to discuss our fiscal second-quarter financial results. enrique?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
thanks, federico. good day to everyone. thank you for joining us for our presentation. let's turn to slide 10 as we go to our financials for the last quarter.
in the second quarter, we continue to have strong revenue momentum with comparable revenues increasing by 89% year over year to $90.3 million. part of this increase is explained by a weak comparable as last year's second-quarter numbers were negatively affected by drought in key regions of south america. however, year-to-date growth reached 72% and growth in the last 12 months showed a solid 56% increase, jumping to $262.6 million, which confirms robust growth dynamics that go far beyond comparables. the main drivers behind the quarter's numbers are a remarkable commercial performance and market penetration of scaling technologies.
micro-beaded fertilizers, in particular, continued to deliver growth in argentina, while inoculant and seed treatment pack sales were outstanding in north america and europe. let's please move to slide 11 to take a closer look to our baseline business profitability performance on an ltm basis and year to date. as a reference, baseline business ebitda excludes hb4 prelaunch costs, which are expensed as incurred and accounted for in sg&a and other income or loss, both income statement line items that impact our reported adjusted ebitda metric. as we have made headway since scaling up the hb4 program to build seed inventories for commercial launch, expenses related to prelaunch efforts have ceased to be irrelevant relative to our reported ebitda as they had been until last quarter, making it necessary to have a profitability metric that grasps performance of the underlying business that generates revenues today.
the three main components of the expenses that are stripped out from the baseline business ebitda calculation are: hb4 related sg&a, inventory ramp-up and data acquisition costs and ias 29 accounting adjustments to hb4 grain inventories. and we are providing a breakdown for each of these categories, both in the presentation and our press release. to the numbers, following the growth trend in revenues the last 12 months baseline business ebitda reached $61.8 million in the second quarter, as federico pointed out, up 46% year over year. on a sequential basis, ltm baseline business ebitda grew 15%, in line with the upward trend we have seen for the past four quarters.
hb4 prelaunch costs during the last 12 months amounted to $6.2 million, of which close to half correspond to inventory ramp-up and data acquisition costs and $1.4 million were general expenses related to the management of the hb4 program. the remaining $1.9 million were not cash expenses, but the accrual of a negative accounting adjustment from ias 29 application to hb4 grain inventories. during the first half of the fiscal year, our baseline business reached $37 million in adjusted ebitda, a 48% increase compared to the year-ago period. hb4 prelaunch costs for the first half stood at $4.9 million.
importantly, while the sg&a portion of the hb4 prelaunch costs has a roughly steady run rate throughout the year, inventory ramp-up and data acquisition costs can be lumpy as its accrual depends mainly on when farmers choose to set a price to grain they provide us with as well as our own ability to commercialize grain that will not be used for seed purposes. i will refer to the specifics behind the second quarter's performance in the next slides. but as a summary for this one, i believe that we had a great quarter that builds on top of the momentum we have seen in our baseline business for almost a full year now. it is exciting to think about the prospect of adding to this business, the $15 million to $20 million in ebitda contribution from hb4 wheat that we believe we can accomplish by fiscal year-end 2024.
we have now tested our wheat varieties at a broad scale and received good feedback from growers regarding roi, which makes us feel comfortable with the opex we are putting into the prelaunch of hb4. now let's turn to slide 12 for a breakdown by business segment. as mentioned before, comparable revenues increased to $90.3 million in the second quarter, up from $47.7 million a year ago. almost half of this growth came from the crop nutrition segment, which grew by $19.3 million, more than its revenues.
it was an outstanding performance in the quarter, both for fertilizers and inoculants. micro fertilizer sales grew aggressively in argentina, which explained most of the 9,500 tons sold during the quarter. demand generation was done in the last two years, paid out as commodity fertilizer prices continued on an upward trend, offering great market conditions to scale up our own product. also, high inoculant sales were seen across several geographies, in particular, europe, our soybean acreage increased, and brazil, where our long-life inoculant formulation continues to represent a competitive advantage and drive expansion.
importantly, the increase in crop nutrition revenues also came with the gross margin expansion given the positive market conditions and economies of scales in micro-beaded fertilizers and a product mix shift inoculants to higher-value products such as lli. gross margin was 54.1% for the segment, compared to 50.7% a year ago. in the seed and integrated products segment, revenue growth and margin expansion came to europe, u.s., uruguay, and argentina. same as inoculants, pack sales also benefited from europe's rise in soybean acreage.
european growth was also leveraged by new commercial agreements while growth in the united states was mainly explained by changes introduced in the commercial team. segment sales grew by $3.1 million to $15.3 million, a 26% year-on-year increase with a gross margin expanding to 68.9%. finally, crop protection saw a 76% increase in revenues, contributing $20.1 million to total revenue growth. it was the only segment that brought growth with a decline in gross margin as expansion in sales was driven by lower margin third-party products, something to be expected following the split of commercial teams that focus on third-party products versus proprietary portfolio.
in slide 13, we can see how this translated into gross profit contribution per segment. comparable gross profit increased by 69% year over year, reaching $42.2 million. the crop nutrition segment contributed close to two-thirds of the total $17.2 million increase in gross profit with an impressive 233% growth driven by increased sales and margin expansion, as i described in the preceding slide. crop protection and seed and integrated products segments contributed 23% and 15%, respectively, to the overall gross profit growth.
despite all regions nominally growing contributions to gross profit compared to a year ago quarter, europe and north america stood out, contributing jointly 23% of the gross profit growth and representing 15% of the total $42.2 million in gross profit, up 11% in the second quarter of the prior fiscal year. let's move on to slide 14 for a breakdown of the quarterly ebitda. our baseline business adjusted ebitda reached $22.7 million, up 57% from the year-ago quarter, which is a weak comparable to a very strong performance, as explained before. we had an aggressive ebitda growth as a result of top-line expansion, partially offset by the decrease in gross margin, increased operating expenses, and ias 29 adjustments to gross profit.
operating expenses, excluding prelaunch hb4 sg&a increased by $7.3 million, explained by a mix of higher variable and fixed costs. variable expenses such as sales taxes and price increased in line with sales growth and explain roughly one-third of the total increase. fixed expenses, on the other hand, were negatively affected by fx and inflation in argentina, a dynamic that has continued to develop unfavorably to dollar-dominated business, such as ours, for the fourth consecutive quarter, affecting our cost structure in the country operations, not only in sg&a but also in cost of goods sold. jv results went up by $1.1 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021, mainly due to higher synertech sales, our micro-beaded fertilizer manufacturing jv.
hb4 prelaunch costs totaled $3 million in the quarter, leading to a reported adjusted ebitda of $19.7 million. now let's please turn to slide 15 to address our debt evolution cash position before turning it over to federico for final remarks. total debt has been increasing in line with the growth of the business. net debt by quarter end was $147.9 million, a 2.66 ratio of net debt to ltm adjusted ebitda.
on a sequential basis, our leverage ratio decreased from 2.74 in the first quarter due to ltm adjusted ebitda growth. over the last year, we have been working on a debt structure that supports the growing baseline business and that upcoming hb4 launch with two goals in mind: to decrease the current portion of total debt and to reduce cash financial expenses. on the first, we have decreased the short-term portion of our debt from 54% by the end of the year-ago quarter to almost 25% by december 2021. on the second goal, despite the growth in total debt, which reached $187.8 million, our cash financial interest expense line remained roughly flat at $13.4 million for the last 12 months as of december 2021.
during the quarter, our subsidiary, rizobacter argentina completed a $20 million public offering of corporate bonds maturing in december 2024 and paying an annual nominal interest rate 1.49%. this issuance allowed us to maintain a strong liquidity position of almost $40 million by quarter end and further improved our average cost of debt. by way of conclusion, i believe that the strong financial performance of our baseline business, combined with a stable and very healthy debt structure and liquidity position provides a solid foundation for growth. we are excited about what is to come next as we aim for the ebitda contribution that we have identified for hb4 week by fiscal 2024.
but with our minds set in a much bigger global opportunity, which represents beyond that specific target.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
thanks, enrique. i think we can now open up the call for q&a. and after that, i'll finish with some final remarks. operator?

[operator instructions] our first question today comes from ben klieve from lake street capital markets. please go ahead, ben. your line is now open.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
all right. thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on all the developments here. i have a couple of questions on hb4 wheat as there's been an awful lot of news here. regarding australia, which is a really exciting development for a lot of reasons, i think, you mentioned you said an acquisition of s&w's wheat varieties.
are you making any cash payments to s&w for this or is the implication here that s&w is going to be contributing its wheat assets to the joint venture on a non-cash basis?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
hi, ben. it's great to have you here in the call, as always. so it's a combination of cash and receivable ownership for s&w into a new entity as consideration for the assets that we are receiving.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
got it. got it. ok. thank you.
and then my second question on hb4 wheat in australia is has there been any work done on developing this kind of under the radar? historically, i mean, have -- between bioceres florimond and s&w, have you been working on development work prior to this announcement or are these efforts really starting today?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
so we've been working under the radar in australia for some time. we've done this initially with a partner helping us on the regulatory front. and when we decided that -- to move forward in this particular geography, and that was a joint decision with florimond desprez, our jv partner, we needed to engaged with s&w, which we knew acquired the corteva seed assets -- wheat seed assets a few years back, and worked toward this -- that we are announcing today. it also sort of came together at the same time we received news from the new zealand, australia regulatory body recommending an approval for hb4 using -- in feed and food within these two countries.
so things are coming together in a nice way in a market that is, as i indicated, bigger than latin america.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
got it. got it. that's helpful. regarding soy, it looks like a lot of progress here.
great to see the 75% levels, which you noted converting to inventory. the thing that was the most notable to me that you talked about expectations here for kind of a modest launch in the u.s. in 2025, which is a little earlier than i would have anticipated. can you talk about -- can you provide just a bit of context around that? i mean, are you -- is your intention here that you think you will be a seed company selling seed in the u.s.
in 2025? you think this is going to be the royalty business, do you have kind of geographies lined up that you're going to launch? any detail that it would be helpful.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
so, look, we are looking forward to the combination with our own and we do expect to have some of those capabilities become available for us to develop an organic strategy, particularly in the area where we believe hb4 to be most valuable in the u.s., which is kind of the dakota, minnesota, and southern canada, central southern canada part, where we expect that technology to deliver significant yield increases. now we are realistic in terms of our current status in terms of germplasm assets. so what you see there under our proprietary strategy is coming together by us being able to in-license genetics from existing participants in the u.s. market.
so we're not able to disclose today, who the providers are, but we were able to secure genetics that are locally adoptive so that we can have these earlier opportunity. now we understand that for us to be able to fully penetrate this market, we need to develop these third-party channels, like we are doing in latin america. i mean, even though initially we take sort of the lion's share of the bigger share of the effort, we do expect third-party, well-established soybean seed companies to generate royalties for us in the medium to longer term strategy. and in the u.s.
that is critical. so we we want to be the first-to-market channel. we are incorporating third-party germplasm to be able to do so. and hopefully as we validate the u.s.
as a valid market for hb4 for soy, we will have third-party seed companies doing the work like they are in argentina and brazil.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
got it. got it. very helpful. my last question, and i'll get back in queue.
now that hb4 is here, wondering if you can help us a bit with kind of modeling the seasonality. how much revenue from wheat and soy do you expect will be concentrated in your fourth and second fiscal quarters, respectively, versus kind of being extended throughout the entire year?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
hi, ben. this is enrique. good to be talking to you. thanks for joining the call.
look, i think that obviously be surprised that our tailored for planting. and while argentina and brazil remain to be an important part of the revenue stream and profits of this particular initiative of the company, i think that our fourth quarter will be probably when we recognize the revenues coming from wheat might fall -- some of that might fall into the first quarter of our fiscal and the second quarter of our fiscal when we're going to get most of the revenues coming out of soybean. and that's the summer crops planting season in latin america. these will begin to even out when we start getting revenues from the u.s.
but i would expect our q4 and q2 to be where we get most of the revenues from hb4 wheat and soy correspondingly.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
ok. very good. all right. thank you both for taking my questions.
congratulations again on all the exciting news and i'll get back in queue.
operator
thank you, ben. our next question today comes from brian wright from roth capital partners. please go ahead, brian. your line is open.
brian wright -- roth capital partners -- analyst
thanks. good morning. congrats on all the progress. i wanted to just get a sense.
did you speak about the revenue basis for the ebitda for hb4 soy in 2025?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
so a few things to consider there. obviously, the revenue from licenses or royalties coming from third parties would tend to be small, but with a high gross margin contribution because, obviously, there's no cost of goods or relatively small cost of goods to that revenue compared to the proprietary revenue, where we are selling the fully integrated seed product and there and we will be operating on the gross margins you've been seeing from the hb4 program already. i will let enrique complete the answer in terms of what to expect on a per hectare basis perhaps, which is, i think, probably the best way to model total revenues for fiscal year '25.
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
hey, brian. good to have you on the call. so that is a good question. that's why on the presentation we provided our overview of what we think will be the split between proprietary channel and nonproprietary channels.
so i think that for what it's worth, the back of the envelope calculation that you can do is that a nonproprietary channel sale would bring probably a third of the revenues that a nonproprietary channel would bring. but as federico said with a much higher margin as we are only accounting for royalties, so costs of goods sold would be rather low. so i think that one-third of our revenue for nonproprietary channel versus proprietary channels is a good back of the envelope or a rule of thumb to use.
brian wright -- roth capital partners -- analyst
great. i just want to make sure i understand that. so one third of -- if it were proprietary or split among the the two buckets. so let me put it in numbers.
so if we are pricing a bag of soybeans up $30 to $35, then that would mean that on a nonproprietary channel, we would be charging about $10.
perfect. ok. thank you so much. thank you.
got it. got it. and then, if i could just -- one real quick detail follow up. could you give us the exact percentage on the trigall ownership for australia?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
so, obviously, that is still to be finalized, but we will have a controlling interest of 60% on day 1 jointly with florimond desprez and the ability to increase that up to 80% according to the current terms.
brian wright -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. great. thank you so much.
operator
thank you, brian. [operator instructions] our next question comes from kemp dolliver from brookline capital markets. please go ahead, kemp. your line is now open.
hi, kemp. your line is now open. please proceed.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
thank you. first question, just continue with australia, s&w reports that australia represents about $24 million in annual revenue, but i'm pretty sure that includes pieces of the business that will not be in the jv. so first question is, can you roughly size the revenue -- incremental revenue coming in from the joint venture?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
sure, kemp. thanks for joining the call. those revenues reported out of australia are probably mostly from pastures and sorghum and other crops. wheat revenues, if i recall correctly, are less than a million from their existing operation.
so they're not too significant initially but, obviously, that will give us locally adoptive germplasm among which we can breed hb4 right away and have that technology become available in the next few years. we believe that by fiscal year '25, we are likely to get cultivation clearance and probably thereafter be able to launch that commercially in-country. so not meaningful day 1 from a revenue perspective from the commercial business that currently exists.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
super. thank you. and you've made a couple of important moves in the last few months that expand your footprint for essentially distribution and marketing purposes. are there any other markets of consequence on your radar screen that you would like to enter in a similar fashion?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
look, obviously, australia is -- from wheat perspective is a very logical next step for us. in terms of business opportunity for wheat, the u.s. is one that we would like to put online sooner rather than later for wheat. and i think we're likely to do something similar to what we are doing in australia at a second stage and that would be our sort of highest priority outside of what we are currently announcing today.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
ok. i'll ask about one market in particular. so in addition to approving hb4 soy for import in the last couple of months, food security has become a high priority for the chinese government. they've started to loosen their gmo rules for domestic production.
you have a partner there at least who has helped you through the regulatory process. do you see opportunity in china in the next couple of years for domestic growers for hb4 soy and possibly wheat, but i think soy is the bigger concern to them.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
yeah, definitely. i think even though that's been kind of not -- it's something that is not in our immediate plans. i think that the current situation in china, the recent approval of hb4 for feed and food and importation and the growth that we're seeing in our chinese partner, that is becoming a significant player in the biotech sphere within the country, i think allow us to be more optimistic about the possibility of bringing this technology into china. and i think that you will probably see that materializing in the form of a joint agreement or with a local partner of significance, and not something that we are likely to ourselves on a stand-alone basis.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
super. and my last question is, in the past, you've given capacity utilization data for the micro-beaded repeated fertilizer plants. do you have an update on that?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
hey, kemp. this is enrique. good to have you on the call. so, yes, we are -- as we measure use of fiscal capacity, we are today at roughly 65%.
now, you need to bear in mind that that's considered sort of like the annual capacity of a plant when you go into high season like now, what i can tell you is that we are running at full capacity today because we are building inventories for the high season in the summer, crops planting in latin america and also for winter crops planting now. so today we're running at full capacity. if you annualize that, it's around 65% but that 65% doesn't sell a reality because it spreads out capacity throughout the year.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
super. thank you so much.
operator
we have no further questions. i'd like to hand the call back for closing remarks.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
thank you, operator. well, i mean, i think that it's very rewarding for us to see that the momentum that we've been reporting in the last few quarters continues throughout the current quarter. and we are moving forward into closing a fiscal year that i believe will be record setting in many ways and not only sort of reporting these good numbers, but also finally having all these regulatory clearances that were pending materialize. so we achieved that brazil approval last year that basically enabled us to launch hb4 wheat in argentina.
earlier today, we got news that the ministry of agriculture here has fully released the commercialization of the first hb4 variety so that there no doubts as to what the brazil approval means in terms of us being able to bring this forward and materialize the revenues that we are estimating today in the call. and also china that's being long awaited. took us more than six years to get to where we are today. so like someone said, nothing is fast in agriculture, but we are today monetizing or capitalizing or showing some of the results of the investment and decisions we took many years back.
and we are very proud of where we are. we are very happy with where we are going and hopefully, once we get done with the merger with mbi, all of these will become even clearer to investors in the space. so no more than this and i hope everyone can have a great week and looking forward to staying connected as needed.

thank you. 
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
thank you, rodrigo, and thanks to everyone in the call for joining us today. please turn to slide 3 for a quick overview of the quarter's main highlights. our third fiscal quarter has been historically our weakest and less eventful quarter for various reasons. most importantly because it overlaps with the latin american summer, not an important planting period for any one crop.
the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, which we are currently reporting, deviates from this historical role. and this is not only because of the great momentum we continue to observe in our sale with revenues increasing 72% on a completely comparable basis, but also and significantly due to the business development and regulatory milestones that were achieved during the period and subsequently thereafter. as we announced in march, we are pursuing a transformational merger with marrone bio innovations to become an indisputable leader in the ag biological space. and recently in april, we have received the long awaited regulatory green light from china that allows us to move hb4 soy into its commercialization phase.
with regards to the mbi merger, we were able to file f4 documents with the sec this -- last monday, and we continue to be on track for our first quarter closing in fiscal 2023. that is between july and september of this year. in terms of hb4 soy, we are today providing guidance for fiscal year '25, where we expect hb4 soy to contribute between $20 million and $25 million of incremental ebitda. we expect this contribution only after two prior commercial seasons in latin america, as we will describe in more detail in a few minutes.
outside from these important milestones, we're taking advantage of the current momentum with interest to advance commercial agreements for hb4 wheat within latin america and expand outside of the region. among these, our wheat subsidiary, trigall genetics, has reached a preliminary understanding with s&w seed of australia to acquire a majority of its wheat breeding program and assets. this agreement is reached at the time when a positive recommendations obtained from regulators in australia regarding the use of hb4 wheat in food and feed. we'll discuss these and other hb4 wheat-related developments throughout the presentation today.
please now turn to slide 4 for a deeper discussion on our current hb4 soy highlights. the chinese approval for hb4 soy does two immediate things. first, it allows for unrestricted commercialization of hb4 soy in argentina, our most immediate market. and secondly, it releases our third-party licensees from contractual restrictions to initiate launch activities in multiple geographies.
we estimate an addressable market of approximately 35 million hectares for hb4 soy in the u.s., brazil, and argentina just to focus on the most important production geographies currently enabled. we believe that given the status of our pipeline and that of our licensees, we can achieve a 15% penetration of this opportunity in argentina, 4% in brazil, and have an initial 60,000 hectares farm in the u.s. during the 2024, '25 crop season. all combined, we estimate an incremental ebitda contribution of $20 million to $25 million for fiscal year '25, with most of these ebitda and associated revenues resulting from our proprietary channels.
for a more detailed overview on a year-by-year basis, please turn to slide 5. in this slide, you can see the number of varieties expected to be launched during the next three years and how many of these varieties are being developed by us compared to our licensees. we expect each variety to cover between 100,000 and 300,000 hectares on an annual basis once introduced, so not broadly on year 1 but most likely as of the year 2 and forward. finally, on hb4 soy, and turning to slide 6.
we are 52% done in harvesting the current season and expect close to 70% of the resulting inventories to meet initial seed quality standards. non-performing materials and out-of-standard inventories will be commercialized as grain. we'll continue to pursue approvals in significant export markets other than china and we expect to have clearances in place in countries accounting for 75% of its soybean trade out of the americas by fiscal year '24. please turn now to slide 7 for an overview of some major developments regarding hb4 wheat.
as you may know, the current conflict in the ukraine-russia region is significantly affecting the global wheat market. the increasing price of wheat is also translating to increased interest in wheat breeding and production solutions, and we are today benefiting from our unique technology offering for this crop. as i indicated at the beginning, the trigall genetics has reached a preliminary understanding with s&w seed of australia to create a joint entity, trigall australia, that will own the breeding program and assets that s&w bought from corteva agriscience back in 2019 and further develop until today. under the current terms, trigall australia will be majority owned by trigall genetics or joint venture with florimond desprez.
we have also reached a collaboration agreement with the african agricultural technology foundation based in kenya to initiate a path for hb4 wheat into sub-saharan africa. we'll be initially testing hb4 performance in selected environments and initiate trait in progression into locally adoptive materials. the existing approvals for the use of hb4 wheat in argentina and brazil, we have added regulatory clearances or positive recommendations in colombia, australia, and new zealand and expect several other positive regulatory news in the coming months and into next year. in slide 8, you will find some additional information regarding the opportunity for hb4 wheat in australia and the rationale for the establishment of trigall australia by acquiring s&w wheat assets in this country.
to put this into perspective, australia is a bigger wheat market than latin american today. it is a production area that is often and severely affected by drought events and it has established an efficient endpoint royalty system that facilitates collections and quick technology adoption. all these factors make it a very logical next step in our internationalization process for this technology. for a brief update on the status of the hb4 wheat program in latin america, please now turn to the next slide.
wheat planting in argentina will start in the next few weeks and we're estimating hb4 program sales of between $10 million to $12 million in the current season. we have a little over 100,000 tons of wheat that are still in inventory and we have already recovered over $4 million of working capital by selling non-seed inventories as grain. when we do this, we operate with selected processors under our identity reserve scheme to minimize interference with conventional commercial channels. today, we're operating with 12 different processors with aggregated capacity of close to 700,000 tons, a capacity that far exceeds our remaining non-seed inventories for grain processing needs that may result from the harvest of these next crop.
let me share with you some interesting data points. since the approval of hb4 wheat in argentina, 120 optical testing devices were deployed to ports and malls to detect hb4 presence at points of grain delivery. in total, over 4 million tons were tested. despite some anecdotal false positives, no formal complaints or corroborated positive detections have been communicated to us as of today.
we continue to pursue regulatory clearances in important wheat export destinations as we further internationalize this very exciting opportunity. finally, on my part and before turning the call over to enrique, please turn to slide 10 for an overview of an updated timeline regarding the merger transaction with mbi. as i indicated before, we have filed f4 documents with the sec this past monday, and we expect the sec review to take between six to eight weeks. with sec approval, we would then have four to five weeks before the mbi shareholder meeting can be convened and the transaction formally approved.
this gives us today between 10 to 13 weeks before closing, and this is consistent with our prior expectations on this matter. let me now pass the call over to enrique to go over the numbers for our third fiscal quarter.
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
thank you very, federico. good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us today. please turn to slide 11 to get started with the financial review of the quarter. following with our latest top line performance, we saw another very strong quarter for sales.
comparable revenues for our third fiscal quarter grew 72% year over year, reaching $60.1 million a record high third quarter revenue number for us. it was not so long ago, probably two years or less, that a $60 million quarter only took place in the high season and not in a traditionally low season quarter like this one. growth was driven by higher sales across all product categories of the crop protection segment, combined with continued momentum in our micro-beaded fertilizers business. i will provide more details on what drove growth in a minute but it is important to note that this great quarterly performance continued to build on top of what we had accomplished in the first half of our fiscal 2022.
year to date, revenues totaled $215.2 million, a 72% increase versus the year ago period. and ltm revenues reached $287.5 million, a 63% increase compared to the ltm metric from the third quarter of fiscal 2021. no doubt an outstanding performance of our business up to this point. let's please move on to the next slide for a more detailed look at growth drivers, comparable gross margins, and the impact of ias 29 on reported revenues.
the crop protection segment was the biggest contributor to sales growth this quarter with an impressive 118% gain, a 16 -- sorry, a $19.4 million increase, that took comparable revenue for a segment to $35.8 million. we saw higher third party product sales in argentina and a strong increase in sales of adjuvants across south america as many farmers decided to purchase adjuvants in advance to ensure availability in light of the current global supply chain constraints. difficulties to ship active ingredients out of china have driven crop protection prices higher, creating a positive environment for our sales teams in this segment. crime nutrition also had a solid performance, with revenues increasing by $5.7 million to $20.8 million, a 38% growth rate.
as i mentioned, micro-beaded fertilizers continued to push sales higher due to positive market conditions. competing commodity fertilizers, map and dap continue to experience price increases during the third quarter due to high uncertainty around supply in tiered cultural markets, which stimulated demand of our product and further enhanced the value proposition. we have taken a conservative pricing strategy by increasing prices at a slower pace than commodity phosphate in anticipation of map and dap prices turning lower at some point, given that we are currently seeing historically high fertilizer prices. the seed and integrated product segments remain stable with overall comparable revenues a $3.5 million for the quarter.
seed treatment pack sales increased in argentina and europe but this growth was offset by lower seed sales in argentina due to delayed wheat planting decisions by farmers. variances in comparable gross margins for each segments are mostly attributed to product mix rather than by a shift in profitability of the different product categories, which remained fairly stable as sales grew. crop protection decreased from 37.7% to 35.9%, as growth in sales of lower margin seed protection and third party products outpaced growth in adjuvants during the quarter. seed and integrated products rose by 130 basis points to 52.2% on higher contribution of seed treatment packs to the mix.
and finally, crop nutrition fell slightly from 53.2% to 51.6%, given the higher growth contribution of micro-beaded fertilizers, which have lower margin than inoculants. to summarize, growth in sales was achieved on stable margins, which is something on which we always focus. before we turn to the next slide, it is important to note that ias 29 adjustments have become increasingly material over the last few quarters as the inflation rate in argentina outpaced the appreciation of the local currency, generating a distortion in the financial statements of the operating subsidiaries of the country that are then consolidated into bioceres' financials. for example, while we reported revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 were only $1.2 million higher than comparable revenues, this quarter's gap from ias 29 adjustments was more than $9 million.
let's now please turn to slide 13 to review gross profit for the quarter. total comparable gross profit grew by 59% year over year, reaching $25.4 million, a record high third quarter figure and in line with our top line performance. crop protection gross profit rose by $6.6 million, reaching $12.8 million, up 107% year over year. crop nutrition contributed $10.7 million to comparable gross profit, increasing 34% or $2.7 million.
and seed and integrated products generated $1.8 million in gross profit, almost the same as last year. as i mentioned, individual product categories maintain stable gross margins. the overall comparable gross margin decreased from 45.6% to 42.3% as segments with lower gross margins saw greater expansion, mainly crop protection. while segment mix explains these volumes in comparable gross margin, it is important to note that in this particular quarter, ias 29 adjustments heavily affected the reported gross margin figure.
while ias 29 application expanded revenues $9.4 million above the comparable figure, it had the opposite effect on gross profit, contracting the reported metric by $1.7 million versus the comparable gross profit. importantly, adjusted ebitda calculation is based on the reported gross profit tier affected by ias 29. distortion of financials from the application of ias 29 has become increasingly significant as depreciation of the local currency in argentina has lapped the monthly inflation rate by 41% over the last 15 months, an unusually long period of time for these two variables not to converge. please turn to slide 14 to take a closer look at ebitda drivers over the quarter.
adjusted ebitda totaled $4.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, down from $6.9 million in the year ago quarter. i would like to call your attention to a few concepts worth keeping in mind when considering ebitda for the quarter as it might not give you the best picture of the underlying performance of the business, which was outstanding in terms of revenue and gross profit. first, our third quarter is seasonally slow, which tends to amplify smaller items that would probably have less of an impact on high-season quarters. furthermore, our portfolio is heavily biased toward planting activities, which many times create pacing issues by uncoupling expenses from corresponding profits.
particularly in this quarter, freight and haulage expenses were unusually high as we made the decision to anticipate shipments of high margin products closer to end markets as a precautionary measure to address uncertainty in supply chains. freight expenses this quarter rose $1.6 million, a 165% increase versus last year without the corresponding profits that we expect to materialize in the fourth quarter. second, as we scale up hb4 hectares, we are incurring pre-launch expenses on ramp-up costs that were much smaller or not even present in the year-ago quarter. particularly in the third quarter of the current fiscal year, hb4-related costs and expenses increased to $2.3 million from $0.5 million as hectares managed under the hb4 program rose almost threefold, and we recognized no profit from hb4 wheat that are expected to begin in the fourth quarter.
and lastly, the above mentioned 41% lag of the depreciation rate of the argentine peso versus local inflation rate generated three negative effects on quarterly ebitda. one, a $1.7 million ias 29 negative adjustment to reported gross profit on which ebitda calculation is based. two, ias 29 adjustment to expenses. and three, a nominal increase in sg&a incurred in the country, where we house our manufacturing and administrative functions.
the last two together account for $2.3 million of the total seven point million dollars -- $7.8 million in sg&a increase for the quarter. while these two [inaudible], argentine fx and inflation normally average out. when they don't, it creates significant headwinds as this particular quarter shows with a combined $4.1 million impact to our ebitda. let's please turn to slide 15 to briefly review our financial position before turning the call back to federico.
total debt has been increasing in line with the growth of the business. net debt by quarter end was $163.7 million, a 3.06 net debt to ltm adjusted ebitda ratio. total financial debt reached $205 million, increasing from $183.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, which explains higher ltm financial expenses on a relatively stable cost of debt. subsequent to [inaudible] closing, we announced the conversion of 75% of the outstanding amount of the convertible notes issued in 2019, reducing our short-term debt by approximately $37 million as we prepare for two major events, the closing of the merger agreement with mbi and the commercial launch of hb4.
following the recent soy approval in china and progress made in expanding our wheat footprint to australia, it is reassuring to have now set targets for hb4 wheat and soy that imply a contribution of $35 million to $45 million of additional ebitda over the next two to three years that will build on top of a healthy and growing baseline business. this concludes my remarks for today. federico?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
thanks, enrique. and i think we can now open up the call, operator, for q&a.

[operator instructions] our first question today comes from ben klieve from lake street capital markets. please go ahead, ben. your line is now open.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
all right. thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on all the developments here. i have a couple of questions on hb4 wheat as there's been an awful lot of news here. regarding australia, which is a really exciting development for a lot of reasons, i think, you mentioned you said an acquisition of s&w's wheat varieties.
are you making any cash payments to s&w for this or is the implication here that s&w is going to be contributing its wheat assets to the joint venture on a non-cash basis?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
hi, ben. it's great to have you here in the call, as always. so it's a combination of cash and receivable ownership for s&w into a new entity as consideration for the assets that we are receiving.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
got it. got it. ok. thank you.
and then my second question on hb4 wheat in australia is has there been any work done on developing this kind of under the radar? historically, i mean, have -- between bioceres florimond and s&w, have you been working on development work prior to this announcement or are these efforts really starting today?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
so we've been working under the radar in australia for some time. we've done this initially with a partner helping us on the regulatory front. and when we decided that -- to move forward in this particular geography, and that was a joint decision with florimond desprez, our jv partner, we needed to engaged with s&w, which we knew acquired the corteva seed assets -- wheat seed assets a few years back, and worked toward this -- that we are announcing today. it also sort of came together at the same time we received news from the new zealand, australia regulatory body recommending an approval for hb4 using -- in feed and food within these two countries.
so things are coming together in a nice way in a market that is, as i indicated, bigger than latin america.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
got it. got it. that's helpful. regarding soy, it looks like a lot of progress here.
great to see the 75% levels, which you noted converting to inventory. the thing that was the most notable to me that you talked about expectations here for kind of a modest launch in the u.s. in 2025, which is a little earlier than i would have anticipated. can you talk about -- can you provide just a bit of context around that? i mean, are you -- is your intention here that you think you will be a seed company selling seed in the u.s.
in 2025? you think this is going to be the royalty business, do you have kind of geographies lined up that you're going to launch? any detail that it would be helpful.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
so, look, we are looking forward to the combination with our own and we do expect to have some of those capabilities become available for us to develop an organic strategy, particularly in the area where we believe hb4 to be most valuable in the u.s., which is kind of the dakota, minnesota, and southern canada, central southern canada part, where we expect that technology to deliver significant yield increases. now we are realistic in terms of our current status in terms of germplasm assets. so what you see there under our proprietary strategy is coming together by us being able to in-license genetics from existing participants in the u.s. market.
so we're not able to disclose today, who the providers are, but we were able to secure genetics that are locally adoptive so that we can have these earlier opportunity. now we understand that for us to be able to fully penetrate this market, we need to develop these third-party channels, like we are doing in latin america. i mean, even though initially we take sort of the lion's share of the bigger share of the effort, we do expect third-party, well-established soybean seed companies to generate royalties for us in the medium to longer term strategy. and in the u.s.
that is critical. so we we want to be the first-to-market channel. we are incorporating third-party germplasm to be able to do so. and hopefully as we validate the u.s.
as a valid market for hb4 for soy, we will have third-party seed companies doing the work like they are in argentina and brazil.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
got it. got it. very helpful. my last question, and i'll get back in queue.
now that hb4 is here, wondering if you can help us a bit with kind of modeling the seasonality. how much revenue from wheat and soy do you expect will be concentrated in your fourth and second fiscal quarters, respectively, versus kind of being extended throughout the entire year?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
hi, ben. this is enrique. good to be talking to you. thanks for joining the call.
look, i think that obviously be surprised that our tailored for planting. and while argentina and brazil remain to be an important part of the revenue stream and profits of this particular initiative of the company, i think that our fourth quarter will be probably when we recognize the revenues coming from wheat might fall -- some of that might fall into the first quarter of our fiscal and the second quarter of our fiscal when we're going to get most of the revenues coming out of soybean. and that's the summer crops planting season in latin america. these will begin to even out when we start getting revenues from the u.s.
but i would expect our q4 and q2 to be where we get most of the revenues from hb4 wheat and soy correspondingly.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
ok. very good. all right. thank you both for taking my questions.
congratulations again on all the exciting news and i'll get back in queue.
operator
thank you, ben. our next question today comes from brian wright from roth capital partners. please go ahead, brian. your line is open.
brian wright -- roth capital partners -- analyst
thanks. good morning. congrats on all the progress. i wanted to just get a sense.
did you speak about the revenue basis for the ebitda for hb4 soy in 2025?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
so a few things to consider there. obviously, the revenue from licenses or royalties coming from third parties would tend to be small, but with a high gross margin contribution because, obviously, there's no cost of goods or relatively small cost of goods to that revenue compared to the proprietary revenue, where we are selling the fully integrated seed product and there and we will be operating on the gross margins you've been seeing from the hb4 program already. i will let enrique complete the answer in terms of what to expect on a per hectare basis perhaps, which is, i think, probably the best way to model total revenues for fiscal year '25.
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
hey, brian. good to have you on the call. so that is a good question. that's why on the presentation we provided our overview of what we think will be the split between proprietary channel and nonproprietary channels.
so i think that for what it's worth, the back of the envelope calculation that you can do is that a nonproprietary channel sale would bring probably a third of the revenues that a nonproprietary channel would bring. but as federico said with a much higher margin as we are only accounting for royalties, so costs of goods sold would be rather low. so i think that one-third of our revenue for nonproprietary channel versus proprietary channels is a good back of the envelope or a rule of thumb to use.
brian wright -- roth capital partners -- analyst
great. i just want to make sure i understand that. so one third of -- if it were proprietary or split among the the two buckets. so let me put it in numbers.
so if we are pricing a bag of soybeans up $30 to $35, then that would mean that on a nonproprietary channel, we would be charging about $10.
perfect. ok. thank you so much. thank you.
got it. got it. and then, if i could just -- one real quick detail follow up. could you give us the exact percentage on the trigall ownership for australia?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
so, obviously, that is still to be finalized, but we will have a controlling interest of 60% on day 1 jointly with florimond desprez and the ability to increase that up to 80% according to the current terms.
brian wright -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. great. thank you so much.
operator
thank you, brian. [operator instructions] our next question comes from kemp dolliver from brookline capital markets. please go ahead, kemp. your line is now open.
hi, kemp. your line is now open. please proceed.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
thank you. first question, just continue with australia, s&w reports that australia represents about $24 million in annual revenue, but i'm pretty sure that includes pieces of the business that will not be in the jv. so first question is, can you roughly size the revenue -- incremental revenue coming in from the joint venture?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
sure, kemp. thanks for joining the call. those revenues reported out of australia are probably mostly from pastures and sorghum and other crops. wheat revenues, if i recall correctly, are less than a million from their existing operation.
so they're not too significant initially but, obviously, that will give us locally adoptive germplasm among which we can breed hb4 right away and have that technology become available in the next few years. we believe that by fiscal year '25, we are likely to get cultivation clearance and probably thereafter be able to launch that commercially in-country. so not meaningful day 1 from a revenue perspective from the commercial business that currently exists.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
super. thank you. and you've made a couple of important moves in the last few months that expand your footprint for essentially distribution and marketing purposes. are there any other markets of consequence on your radar screen that you would like to enter in a similar fashion?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
look, obviously, australia is -- from wheat perspective is a very logical next step for us. in terms of business opportunity for wheat, the u.s. is one that we would like to put online sooner rather than later for wheat. and i think we're likely to do something similar to what we are doing in australia at a second stage and that would be our sort of highest priority outside of what we are currently announcing today.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
ok. i'll ask about one market in particular. so in addition to approving hb4 soy for import in the last couple of months, food security has become a high priority for the chinese government. they've started to loosen their gmo rules for domestic production.
you have a partner there at least who has helped you through the regulatory process. do you see opportunity in china in the next couple of years for domestic growers for hb4 soy and possibly wheat, but i think soy is the bigger concern to them.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
yeah, definitely. i think even though that's been kind of not -- it's something that is not in our immediate plans. i think that the current situation in china, the recent approval of hb4 for feed and food and importation and the growth that we're seeing in our chinese partner, that is becoming a significant player in the biotech sphere within the country, i think allow us to be more optimistic about the possibility of bringing this technology into china. and i think that you will probably see that materializing in the form of a joint agreement or with a local partner of significance, and not something that we are likely to ourselves on a stand-alone basis.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
super. and my last question is, in the past, you've given capacity utilization data for the micro-beaded repeated fertilizer plants. do you have an update on that?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
hey, kemp. this is enrique. good to have you on the call. so, yes, we are -- as we measure use of fiscal capacity, we are today at roughly 65%.
now, you need to bear in mind that that's considered sort of like the annual capacity of a plant when you go into high season like now, what i can tell you is that we are running at full capacity today because we are building inventories for the high season in the summer, crops planting in latin america and also for winter crops planting now. so today we're running at full capacity. if you annualize that, it's around 65% but that 65% doesn't sell a reality because it spreads out capacity throughout the year.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
super. thank you so much.
operator
we have no further questions. i'd like to hand the call back for closing remarks.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
thank you, operator. well, i mean, i think that it's very rewarding for us to see that the momentum that we've been reporting in the last few quarters continues throughout the current quarter. and we are moving forward into closing a fiscal year that i believe will be record setting in many ways and not only sort of reporting these good numbers, but also finally having all these regulatory clearances that were pending materialize. so we achieved that brazil approval last year that basically enabled us to launch hb4 wheat in argentina.
earlier today, we got news that the ministry of agriculture here has fully released the commercialization of the first hb4 variety so that there no doubts as to what the brazil approval means in terms of us being able to bring this forward and materialize the revenues that we are estimating today in the call. and also china that's being long awaited. took us more than six years to get to where we are today. so like someone said, nothing is fast in agriculture, but we are today monetizing or capitalizing or showing some of the results of the investment and decisions we took many years back.
and we are very proud of where we are. we are very happy with where we are going and hopefully, once we get done with the merger with mbi, all of these will become even clearer to investors in the space. so no more than this and i hope everyone can have a great week and looking forward to staying connected as needed.

thank you. 
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
thank you, rodrigo, and thanks to everyone in the call for joining us today. please turn to slide 3 for a quick overview of the quarter's main highlights. our third fiscal quarter has been historically our weakest and less eventful quarter for various reasons. most importantly because it overlaps with the latin american summer, not an important planting period for any one crop.
the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, which we are currently reporting, deviates from this historical role. and this is not only because of the great momentum we continue to observe in our sale with revenues increasing 72% on a completely comparable basis, but also and significantly due to the business development and regulatory milestones that were achieved during the period and subsequently thereafter. as we announced in march, we are pursuing a transformational merger with marrone bio innovations to become an indisputable leader in the ag biological space. and recently in april, we have received the long awaited regulatory green light from china that allows us to move hb4 soy into its commercialization phase.
with regards to the mbi merger, we were able to file f4 documents with the sec this -- last monday, and we continue to be on track for our first quarter closing in fiscal 2023. that is between july and september of this year. in terms of hb4 soy, we are today providing guidance for fiscal year '25, where we expect hb4 soy to contribute between $20 million and $25 million of incremental ebitda. we expect this contribution only after two prior commercial seasons in latin america, as we will describe in more detail in a few minutes.
outside from these important milestones, we're taking advantage of the current momentum with interest to advance commercial agreements for hb4 wheat within latin america and expand outside of the region. among these, our wheat subsidiary, trigall genetics, has reached a preliminary understanding with s&w seed of australia to acquire a majority of its wheat breeding program and assets. this agreement is reached at the time when a positive recommendations obtained from regulators in australia regarding the use of hb4 wheat in food and feed. we'll discuss these and other hb4 wheat-related developments throughout the presentation today.
please now turn to slide 4 for a deeper discussion on our current hb4 soy highlights. the chinese approval for hb4 soy does two immediate things. first, it allows for unrestricted commercialization of hb4 soy in argentina, our most immediate market. and secondly, it releases our third-party licensees from contractual restrictions to initiate launch activities in multiple geographies.
we estimate an addressable market of approximately 35 million hectares for hb4 soy in the u.s., brazil, and argentina just to focus on the most important production geographies currently enabled. we believe that given the status of our pipeline and that of our licensees, we can achieve a 15% penetration of this opportunity in argentina, 4% in brazil, and have an initial 60,000 hectares farm in the u.s. during the 2024, '25 crop season. all combined, we estimate an incremental ebitda contribution of $20 million to $25 million for fiscal year '25, with most of these ebitda and associated revenues resulting from our proprietary channels.
for a more detailed overview on a year-by-year basis, please turn to slide 5. in this slide, you can see the number of varieties expected to be launched during the next three years and how many of these varieties are being developed by us compared to our licensees. we expect each variety to cover between 100,000 and 300,000 hectares on an annual basis once introduced, so not broadly on year 1 but most likely as of the year 2 and forward. finally, on hb4 soy, and turning to slide 6.
we are 52% done in harvesting the current season and expect close to 70% of the resulting inventories to meet initial seed quality standards. non-performing materials and out-of-standard inventories will be commercialized as grain. we'll continue to pursue approvals in significant export markets other than china and we expect to have clearances in place in countries accounting for 75% of its soybean trade out of the americas by fiscal year '24. please turn now to slide 7 for an overview of some major developments regarding hb4 wheat.
as you may know, the current conflict in the ukraine-russia region is significantly affecting the global wheat market. the increasing price of wheat is also translating to increased interest in wheat breeding and production solutions, and we are today benefiting from our unique technology offering for this crop. as i indicated at the beginning, the trigall genetics has reached a preliminary understanding with s&w seed of australia to create a joint entity, trigall australia, that will own the breeding program and assets that s&w bought from corteva agriscience back in 2019 and further develop until today. under the current terms, trigall australia will be majority owned by trigall genetics or joint venture with florimond desprez.
we have also reached a collaboration agreement with the african agricultural technology foundation based in kenya to initiate a path for hb4 wheat into sub-saharan africa. we'll be initially testing hb4 performance in selected environments and initiate trait in progression into locally adoptive materials. the existing approvals for the use of hb4 wheat in argentina and brazil, we have added regulatory clearances or positive recommendations in colombia, australia, and new zealand and expect several other positive regulatory news in the coming months and into next year. in slide 8, you will find some additional information regarding the opportunity for hb4 wheat in australia and the rationale for the establishment of trigall australia by acquiring s&w wheat assets in this country.
to put this into perspective, australia is a bigger wheat market than latin american today. it is a production area that is often and severely affected by drought events and it has established an efficient endpoint royalty system that facilitates collections and quick technology adoption. all these factors make it a very logical next step in our internationalization process for this technology. for a brief update on the status of the hb4 wheat program in latin america, please now turn to the next slide.
wheat planting in argentina will start in the next few weeks and we're estimating hb4 program sales of between $10 million to $12 million in the current season. we have a little over 100,000 tons of wheat that are still in inventory and we have already recovered over $4 million of working capital by selling non-seed inventories as grain. when we do this, we operate with selected processors under our identity reserve scheme to minimize interference with conventional commercial channels. today, we're operating with 12 different processors with aggregated capacity of close to 700,000 tons, a capacity that far exceeds our remaining non-seed inventories for grain processing needs that may result from the harvest of these next crop.
let me share with you some interesting data points. since the approval of hb4 wheat in argentina, 120 optical testing devices were deployed to ports and malls to detect hb4 presence at points of grain delivery. in total, over 4 million tons were tested. despite some anecdotal false positives, no formal complaints or corroborated positive detections have been communicated to us as of today.
we continue to pursue regulatory clearances in important wheat export destinations as we further internationalize this very exciting opportunity. finally, on my part and before turning the call over to enrique, please turn to slide 10 for an overview of an updated timeline regarding the merger transaction with mbi. as i indicated before, we have filed f4 documents with the sec this past monday, and we expect the sec review to take between six to eight weeks. with sec approval, we would then have four to five weeks before the mbi shareholder meeting can be convened and the transaction formally approved.
this gives us today between 10 to 13 weeks before closing, and this is consistent with our prior expectations on this matter. let me now pass the call over to enrique to go over the numbers for our third fiscal quarter.
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
thank you very, federico. good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us today. please turn to slide 11 to get started with the financial review of the quarter. following with our latest top line performance, we saw another very strong quarter for sales.
comparable revenues for our third fiscal quarter grew 72% year over year, reaching $60.1 million a record high third quarter revenue number for us. it was not so long ago, probably two years or less, that a $60 million quarter only took place in the high season and not in a traditionally low season quarter like this one. growth was driven by higher sales across all product categories of the crop protection segment, combined with continued momentum in our micro-beaded fertilizers business. i will provide more details on what drove growth in a minute but it is important to note that this great quarterly performance continued to build on top of what we had accomplished in the first half of our fiscal 2022.
year to date, revenues totaled $215.2 million, a 72% increase versus the year ago period. and ltm revenues reached $287.5 million, a 63% increase compared to the ltm metric from the third quarter of fiscal 2021. no doubt an outstanding performance of our business up to this point. let's please move on to the next slide for a more detailed look at growth drivers, comparable gross margins, and the impact of ias 29 on reported revenues.
the crop protection segment was the biggest contributor to sales growth this quarter with an impressive 118% gain, a 16 -- sorry, a $19.4 million increase, that took comparable revenue for a segment to $35.8 million. we saw higher third party product sales in argentina and a strong increase in sales of adjuvants across south america as many farmers decided to purchase adjuvants in advance to ensure availability in light of the current global supply chain constraints. difficulties to ship active ingredients out of china have driven crop protection prices higher, creating a positive environment for our sales teams in this segment. crime nutrition also had a solid performance, with revenues increasing by $5.7 million to $20.8 million, a 38% growth rate.
as i mentioned, micro-beaded fertilizers continued to push sales higher due to positive market conditions. competing commodity fertilizers, map and dap continue to experience price increases during the third quarter due to high uncertainty around supply in tiered cultural markets, which stimulated demand of our product and further enhanced the value proposition. we have taken a conservative pricing strategy by increasing prices at a slower pace than commodity phosphate in anticipation of map and dap prices turning lower at some point, given that we are currently seeing historically high fertilizer prices. the seed and integrated product segments remain stable with overall comparable revenues a $3.5 million for the quarter.
seed treatment pack sales increased in argentina and europe but this growth was offset by lower seed sales in argentina due to delayed wheat planting decisions by farmers. variances in comparable gross margins for each segments are mostly attributed to product mix rather than by a shift in profitability of the different product categories, which remained fairly stable as sales grew. crop protection decreased from 37.7% to 35.9%, as growth in sales of lower margin seed protection and third party products outpaced growth in adjuvants during the quarter. seed and integrated products rose by 130 basis points to 52.2% on higher contribution of seed treatment packs to the mix.
and finally, crop nutrition fell slightly from 53.2% to 51.6%, given the higher growth contribution of micro-beaded fertilizers, which have lower margin than inoculants. to summarize, growth in sales was achieved on stable margins, which is something on which we always focus. before we turn to the next slide, it is important to note that ias 29 adjustments have become increasingly material over the last few quarters as the inflation rate in argentina outpaced the appreciation of the local currency, generating a distortion in the financial statements of the operating subsidiaries of the country that are then consolidated into bioceres' financials. for example, while we reported revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 were only $1.2 million higher than comparable revenues, this quarter's gap from ias 29 adjustments was more than $9 million.
let's now please turn to slide 13 to review gross profit for the quarter. total comparable gross profit grew by 59% year over year, reaching $25.4 million, a record high third quarter figure and in line with our top line performance. crop protection gross profit rose by $6.6 million, reaching $12.8 million, up 107% year over year. crop nutrition contributed $10.7 million to comparable gross profit, increasing 34% or $2.7 million.
and seed and integrated products generated $1.8 million in gross profit, almost the same as last year. as i mentioned, individual product categories maintain stable gross margins. the overall comparable gross margin decreased from 45.6% to 42.3% as segments with lower gross margins saw greater expansion, mainly crop protection. while segment mix explains these volumes in comparable gross margin, it is important to note that in this particular quarter, ias 29 adjustments heavily affected the reported gross margin figure.
while ias 29 application expanded revenues $9.4 million above the comparable figure, it had the opposite effect on gross profit, contracting the reported metric by $1.7 million versus the comparable gross profit. importantly, adjusted ebitda calculation is based on the reported gross profit tier affected by ias 29. distortion of financials from the application of ias 29 has become increasingly significant as depreciation of the local currency in argentina has lapped the monthly inflation rate by 41% over the last 15 months, an unusually long period of time for these two variables not to converge. please turn to slide 14 to take a closer look at ebitda drivers over the quarter.
adjusted ebitda totaled $4.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, down from $6.9 million in the year ago quarter. i would like to call your attention to a few concepts worth keeping in mind when considering ebitda for the quarter as it might not give you the best picture of the underlying performance of the business, which was outstanding in terms of revenue and gross profit. first, our third quarter is seasonally slow, which tends to amplify smaller items that would probably have less of an impact on high-season quarters. furthermore, our portfolio is heavily biased toward planting activities, which many times create pacing issues by uncoupling expenses from corresponding profits.
particularly in this quarter, freight and haulage expenses were unusually high as we made the decision to anticipate shipments of high margin products closer to end markets as a precautionary measure to address uncertainty in supply chains. freight expenses this quarter rose $1.6 million, a 165% increase versus last year without the corresponding profits that we expect to materialize in the fourth quarter. second, as we scale up hb4 hectares, we are incurring pre-launch expenses on ramp-up costs that were much smaller or not even present in the year-ago quarter. particularly in the third quarter of the current fiscal year, hb4-related costs and expenses increased to $2.3 million from $0.5 million as hectares managed under the hb4 program rose almost threefold, and we recognized no profit from hb4 wheat that are expected to begin in the fourth quarter.
and lastly, the above mentioned 41% lag of the depreciation rate of the argentine peso versus local inflation rate generated three negative effects on quarterly ebitda. one, a $1.7 million ias 29 negative adjustment to reported gross profit on which ebitda calculation is based. two, ias 29 adjustment to expenses. and three, a nominal increase in sg&a incurred in the country, where we house our manufacturing and administrative functions.
the last two together account for $2.3 million of the total seven point million dollars -- $7.8 million in sg&a increase for the quarter. while these two [inaudible], argentine fx and inflation normally average out. when they don't, it creates significant headwinds as this particular quarter shows with a combined $4.1 million impact to our ebitda. let's please turn to slide 15 to briefly review our financial position before turning the call back to federico.
total debt has been increasing in line with the growth of the business. net debt by quarter end was $163.7 million, a 3.06 net debt to ltm adjusted ebitda ratio. total financial debt reached $205 million, increasing from $183.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, which explains higher ltm financial expenses on a relatively stable cost of debt. subsequent to [inaudible] closing, we announced the conversion of 75% of the outstanding amount of the convertible notes issued in 2019, reducing our short-term debt by approximately $37 million as we prepare for two major events, the closing of the merger agreement with mbi and the commercial launch of hb4.
following the recent soy approval in china and progress made in expanding our wheat footprint to australia, it is reassuring to have now set targets for hb4 wheat and soy that imply a contribution of $35 million to $45 million of additional ebitda over the next two to three years that will build on top of a healthy and growing baseline business. this concludes my remarks for today. federico?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer

[operator instructions] our first question for today comes from ben klieve of lake street capital markets.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
congratulations on the end of a really successful year here. first, i have a couple of questions on the launch of hb4 soy. and federico, in particular, a comment you made in your prepared remarks about the licensing model. can you elaborate a bit more on, first of all, kind of the degree to which hb4 soy both in argentina and brazil is expected to be kind of a straight licensing model versus an ecoseed concept? and then second of all, can you characterize kind of who these licensing partners are? if you can't name names, if you can kind of give a broad characterization of who these folks are.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
sure. so thanks, ben, for joining the call. it's always great to hear you. in terms of hb4, so this is the one crop where we probably have a greater gap in terms of genetics.
for those of you that do not know, in wheat we are partnered with the leader for latam genetics, which is floating on the brain. in soy, this is more of a stand-alone effort. so to be able to counteract that to some extent, we have licensed the technology to leading participants. and there are two that are publicly disclosed or that we have disclosed in the past, such as don mario, which is the no.
1 market share player in latin america and tmg that is a brazil grain company that is important for that country. so these two licensees that have outstanding genetics we'll be able to launch in the upcoming -- not so much in the upcoming season but in '23, 24 with the material safety in developing. and the china approval was key to be able to enable this particular channel. we continue to pursue the ecoseed concept within the hb4 program and with sales through our own network.
and that is what you're likely to see in the upcoming season, bringing the lion's share of the revenues with two varieties that now can be commercialized outside of the program structure using the more conventional approach. these two varieties have been positioned in areas of argentina that together represents slightly less than 1.5 million hectares. so obviously, we're not indicating that that's sort of the acreage we're likely to achieve, but it is meaningful enough for us to be able to do what we need to do this year so that we can be on track for the guidance we provided after the chinese approval.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
got it. got it. that's all very helpful. another hb4-related question, enrique, maybe more for you.
i'm curious, you very helpfully break down kind of the costs associated with the hb4 ramp historically. i'm wondering what your expectations are for really fiscal '23 in terms of costs associated with the ramp versus ebitda contributions in a commercial launch. i mean to what extent do you think those kind of prelaunch costs are going to offset the profitability from the commercial launch of both wheat and soy?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
ben, thanks for joining the call and for the question. so i think there's a divergence between the type of revenue ramp-up that you can expect from hb4 and profitability reported, profitability coming from hb4 and the run rate of the prelaunch costs that you see reported in sg&a. i mean those are more associated to our identity research channel and what we do with generation hb4 as a program where we were jointly with farmers where, as federico pointed out, revenues and profitability from hp will be coming from different sources, not only just that. so i think that we are currently at the run rate of what can be expected for that.
and as we continue to multiply variety and expand and the research channel, you might see that following that acreage rather than the total reported revenues and profitability for hb4. so in essence, i don't think that those are going to offset however, bear in mind that we are ramping up the program. we are still ramping up the variety. so as enrique pointed out, this is only the beginning for hb4.
and i think that we will continue to see those costs to show up in the next fiscal year.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
let me add something to that. ben, for you to keep in mind, i think the hb4 program will be kept almost at a steady state. except mainly in soy, where we might increase it slightly in we today, we're at 50,000 hectares, for instance. so we're not expecting to increase that significantly.
and this is what we use in a way to attract the variety validation, the free marketing component and the inventory ramp-up process. so the more varieties we get that we can channel directly to farmers, either within the ecoseed concept or as we can see, if you will, through conventional distribution, the more those revenues will dilute the -- sort of the ramp-up cost associated to the program. so i think they will become less significant or proportionately less significantly on a forward-going basis.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
got it. ok. that's all very helpful. a point more to talk about it.
i'll just ask one more and then get back in queue. and it's a question kind of on a high level around the outlook on the fertilizer side. i mean this business has just been exceptional now for a long time. and enrique, you commented on capacity expansion broadly.
i'm wondering how you're looking at addressing kind of long-term growth from the micro-beaded fertilizer products specifically and kind of when you think you're going to have to make a decision about potentially making a real material capacity expansion from that product line specifically.
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
that's a great question, ben. and i mean it's a nice challenge that we faced throughout the year because we reached almost half of our capacity ahead of what we expected. so we have already been working on an expansion project for our facility in latin america that is already on its way. so there will be some capex going into that to support further growth in that facility that supplies the latin american market.
i don't think that it's going to be of the size and materiality of the initial investment with us. but you can certainly expect that we will be investing in expanding that capacity to continue growing revenues from micro fertilizers.
operator
our next question comes from kemp dolliver from brookline capital markets.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
first question relates to the performance of the various hb4 soy varieties. and can you just talk a little bit about what you've learned with regard to cause and effect with regard to the performance of the different varieties and how you are thinking about future development of the soy varieties?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
sure. so thanks, kemp, for joining. it's a pleasure to have you here. i think that the key here is to understand that for us to be able to select the right materials, we need to farther up with farmers to identify where these materials work and when they need to be planted and if that is done concurrently with the inventory ramp-up that we can have anticipated launches.
we do it in the conventional way where lots is done with the trialing within the crop development teams. and then we take the varieties to farmers. it takes longer. so that is in a way what brings about some of the bumpiness, if you will, in our ability to move forward with these materials.
now the good news is that we have two materials that we've been testing over the last two seasons, particularly one that's been tested, i think, for more than two seasons, which is 40 to 20 where we now feel fairly comfortable about performance and its ability to win over commercial checks in a particular region of the province that accounts for a little less than 1 million hectares. and when we talk about leading with conventional checks, we're not talking about hb4 performance. i mean we're not talking about how the gene works in the different backgrounds. we're talking about the competitiveness of the hardware in which we're incorporating that software, which, as i indicated before, it's being developed by us and not coming from a market leader like florimond desprez in the case of wheat.
so that is what's leading the challenge. we're improving every year. obviously, we're not going at the same pace we are going with wheat, but we do have the possibility of using licensees to, in a way, narrow that gap, which is what i recently discussed. the performance issues, one that is [inaudible] related that has to do with the genetics of the materials we are using, and it's not in a way related to the performance of the team, which has been well validated not only by us but also by our technology partners.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's good. so i mean, obviously, there's trial and error involved in this process. and based on your last -- your closing comment, it sounds like you've identified, say, the commonality within these -- within the traits that are influencing the performance of the ones that are -- that you've identified as say, loss versus win? is that pretty fair? or is there still some just you would need to do additional research to really understand the differences in performance?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
look, this is kind of gathering farmer information to be able to justify a launch and making sure that the launch it's not erratic and we're launching a video that meet the standards that are required for the technology i think that what we are doing here today is probably open kimono in many ways. this is not something a company will normally disclose. they don't tell you how they get to the variety [inaudible] they launch. we want to do this in a different way because we think it sort of saves time even though this is also showing when we fail, and not only where we win.
now if we win in 8 out of 10 situations, that's impressive. that's probably something that you will not see in a standard variety, and that's the type of quality material that we would like to launch within the program. the one thing we have changed to be able to improve upon what we've been doing is to allow farmers to test a broader set of materials. so in the past, we would only give one variety for each farmer and we would have a win and loss for that particular field.
now we are giving three to four varieties for each farmer, keeping hectares at the same level. we don't want to increase hectares necessarily to keep costs under control, but we want to improve the quality of the data for the targeting launch validation process. and that i believe will significantly accelerate our ability to bring new varieties to the conventional channel like we are going today with 42 20 or 50 21.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
that's great. and my last question or at least topic, it relates to the australian, new zealand market. and i think also this ties into some context with ukraine. and recently, there have been some reports that australian farmers are increasing their plans to export wheat, as i'm sure others are, to try to offset the loss of the ukrainian capacity.
so number one, how are you thinking about advancing process -- your business in australia? and then also, just hypothetically, if ukraine stabilizes and becomes a significant grower again, is that market ever an opportunity? or is there just -- or do they just serve the anti-gmo part of the world that would not accept these products?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
so that's a great question. i think, first, on australia and new zealand, we have not included an update here, but we announced a few months back our intent to acquire with genetics business in country that is currently owned by [inaudible] genetics was in part the breeding program that was run by [inaudible] in the past. and that is a process that's still ongoing and we expect to be able to close before the year's end. this is something we're doing via our jv with [inaudible] genetics.
so that will give us a footprint in australia and an initial set of materials on which we can deploy the hb4 technology. we have already sent materials that are going through the quarantine process to advance the trialing in country and be able to get the production clearance. we do have feed and food clearance today. we need the planting or cultivation clearance to be able to launch in australia season.
so that is a very meaningful market. i can say that it's probably twice the opportunity that we're currently pursuing in latin america. and in terms of the ukraine and other geographies, i believe that the more we make hb4 wheat sort of status quo, if you will, the more likely these geographies that have historically rejected gmos will accept the technology. and i can point to a sort of an interesting observation, which is what happened in brazil.
there was a post-approval survey in brazil that show that close to 70% of consumers have no concerns on gmo wheat. and that observation helped change the position of key groups that historically rejected transgenics in the crop. i mean with this, we're not saying that the job is done, but i think it's far from being done, but we are much closer today to being able to deploy these technologies in geographies where before we thought that would be very challenging, ukraine being one of them. who knows? maybe one day, we will have gmo in france.
i think that can be today more realistic than what it was a year ago. but that's what -- i don't know, enrique, if you have any comments on this.
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
i think just to complement on what federico said, i mean it's evident that with the ukraine situation, food security has become a concern for everyone, and it seems to be a consensus technology and in particular, gmo is a meaningful part of the reply or answer that humanity needs to provide to that full security. so i think that has been also a qualitative tailwind for us throughout the year in obtaining regulatory approvals and gaining exposure to processors. you can see that we've added 30 new processors. and as with many things, concerns fade away when there's a threat of not having something that is important for you.
operator
our next question comes from dmitry silversteyn from water tower research.
dmitry silversteyn -- water tower research -- analyst
i was wondering, you posted a very strong revenue growth number, obviously, and a lot of it has to do with the launch of the hb4. but if you have to look at price, and i think you mentioned that pricing was a little bit of a tailwind in foreign exchange translation. what role did price and fx play in your revenue growth in the quarter?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
dmitry, this is enrique. pleasure to have you on the call for the first time, and thanks for your question. so i would have to say that fx plays no role whatsoever in increasing our revenues, our comparable revenues, as i mentioned. bear in mind that this company operates mainly in hard currency.
so either dollars or euros with the exception of brazil that is a market that operates in local currency. so there's practically no tailwinds from fx whatsoever. there is some tailwinds coming from prices, mainly in the cp segment. so crop protection products did see some increase in prices coming from the disruption in the supply chain.
so raw materials that go into cp coming from china or india, into the u.s., brazil, argentina, paraguay, uruguay, the main ag-producing countries, was a threat throughout the year, and that allows for price increases, which at the end of the day helped us in that particular segment. now more important than that, to me, is the fact that this highlights a competitive advantage from biologicals, which we have significantly invested in with the profarm acquisition. biologicals have manufactured in country. you don't need to get raw materials from the other side of the world to be able to supply farmers with inputs.
so that was a tailwind in cp. in the rest, i would say that it was not a major tailwind prices. it was more related to us expanding the business and having much greater adoption of our main technologies. i would say that probably micro-beaded fertilizers were the star product for the year in that regard.
dmitry silversteyn -- water tower research -- analyst
got it. got it. if i can follow up on the crop protection question on crop protection area. your gross margin there is what i would consider to be a little bit below what kind of the industry averages, if you will, which i think is north of 40%.
clearly, it's going to improve as you integrate profarm. but can you talk about sort of what the drivers of the margin is? first of all, are you looking to expand margins in this business in the short term? and secondly, what would be the major drivers of that?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
that's a very good question. bear in mind that in crop protection, we have some sales to [inaudible] from third-party product sales. so this is not strategic product category for us but rather something tactical. in some countries like brazil, paraguay and argentina, we collect from retailers by getting products in return.
and also, we have become the partner of choice for some other companies that want to commercialize in latin america [inaudible] products to us as a commercial partner. so those two categories of products that are more tactical in nature have lower margins, have lower working capital requirements and are kind of like low-hanging fruit for us. now those products are probably delivering gross margins that range between 25% to 35%. and that's what, at the end of the day, drives down the overall segment margin, which i believe -- i mean, that segment should have a normal run rate, a margin that is closer to 40%.
when you compare that to other cp companies, bear in mind that [inaudible] cp companies are selling products with their own brands and don't have as much of [inaudible] as we have on this type of more tactical product categories. i think that this will remain to be the lower margin business segment within all of the segments until we start seeing marrone, i should say, profarm products becoming reported there that have gross margins are closer to 60%.
dmitry silversteyn -- water tower research -- analyst
gotcha. that's very helpful. and yes, i totally get the third-party distribution margins would be lower. we've seen that in other companies that have participated and particularly in the latin america market.
you mentioned some planned cost issues with argentina plant impacting your quarter a little bit in terms of margins. what's the situation there now? and can we look for the cost manufacturing facility to stabilize as we get into 2023?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
that's also a great question. thanks for asking. so first, i will say that, today, argentina continues to be an important manufacturing hub for us. so even though we commercialize globally many of our products, those are material in manufacturing in argentina.
we are expanding our manufacturing capacity in brazil to diversify product sources. but for this particular fiscal year 2022 period, argentina continues to play an important supplying role. two things i would say, dmitry, it is important to us and what we track is the evolution of the local inflation versus the depreciation of local currency against the u.s. dollar.
so if inflation outpaces depreciation of the local currency, that means that we will begin to see cost pressure out of local currency-denominated costs being inflated when measured in u.s. dollars. that applies as much to cost of goods sold as it applies to sg&a functions that are located in country. throughout the year, i would say that probably in the fourth quarter, we saw these two macro variables, local inflation and depreciation of local currency converging.
that is what we were expecting. but for the previous 15 to 16 months, inflation versus depreciation of local currency. so there's an accumulation -- there's a cumulative effect that has yet not been fully corrected. so i would say is that the bleeding has been stopped in the fourth quarter.
and what we expect is that at some point, these two variables need to converge. it has been always the case and when you look at the last four decades in argentina. and when that happens, the business will get back to the normal run rate and what i was saying about gross margins being in the mid-20% range. i cannot tell you when that would happen.
i would only point out that there's upcoming elections in argentina in 2023, and that has proven to be a catalyst many times for macro variables to fall back in place.
dmitry silversteyn -- water tower research -- analyst
understood. that was very helpful. and then final question before i get in the queue. the latin american planting season is well underway now.
can you provide any color as to how that's going, what you're seeing that may be different from what you saw in 2022, '23 season? and just give us any color that you can on what the current planting season in latin america looks like for you specifically.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
so this is federico. great to have you, dmitry, in the call. in terms of latin america, as i indicated, we are facing significant drought, particularly for winter crops in argentina. so this is an evolving situation, but grains are required promptly.
so it's, in a way, a double-edged component for us because it does showcase hb4 technology and allows us to make the technology more visible to farmers. but on the other hand, it does have a consequence in terms of farmers' income and ability to incorporate new technologies in the future because of their ability to invest if they have a weak crop at the end of the winter. so i think we're waiting for rains. this is in part important in argentina.
in brazil, we have to close because we still have a weak business there of relevance. and i don't know, enrique, if you want to add anything to the latin american part.
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
yes, i would only point out, dmitry, the fact that planting is probably the one decision that the farmer always wants to make and less nature really imposes restrictions and they end up not being able to plant. so you will see that for the product categories of our portfolio that are designed to us planting, we tend to see a high resilience in revenues even though there might be drought windows. it does not work the same way for cp products, for example. so what i would say is that probably, we did have a good planting season for winter crops in argentina that mostly shows up in our q4 results.
what we are probably looking with a little bit more focus now are how rains will evolve in light of the upcoming some of the costs. some usually takes place by the end of q1, beginning of q2 of our fiscal year in latin america.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from brian wright of roth capital
brian wright -- roth capital partners -- analyst
would the -- i was hoping to get an update on profarm, just maybe are you in a position to provide an update on kind of what their 2q results kind of look like?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
brian, this is enrique. thanks for joining the call, and pleasure to be talking to you. so as i mentioned, q4 of our fiscal year, so march through june was a drought quarter in the u.s. in particular.
and in california, even more so. as you know, about half of the revenue stream from profarm is coming from cash crop sales in california, where half is coming from road crops in the u.s. and europe. so what i would say is that for profarm has been a tough quarter.
we do expect and we are here to see how the second half of the calendar year, we will evolve for them coming out of that. so i would expect q4 and full fiscal year of profarm revenues to be here flat or slightly below the number that they reported in the previous fiscal year of them, so 2021. i mean, to us, obviously, i think that it is more important, the benefit that we will be gaining from diversifying revenue sources, which i mentioned. sometimes california, for example, might be an offsetting factor as it was in march through june.
and hopefully, sometimes you will help us sort of like offset other revenue threats like the ones that we have in latin america with drought for some of the crops potentially. so that's all i can say. as of now, we will be probably giving a little bit more color on profarm's numbers in the upcoming earnings call, where we will be consolidating the results for the first time.
brian wright -- roth capital partners -- analyst
great. great. just also on -- just from a bigger picture, given the drought conditions in argentina right now, given just broad weather conditions across the globe, isn't that conducive for the next selling season as far as hb4? or am i --
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
no. look -- brian, this is federico. great to have you on the call. but i think, obviously, the current situation with drought becoming not only notorious here in latin america, but also in asia, the situation in china is quite dramatic.
in europe, as we've seen coming out of the summer, yields have been hit by significant drought and high-temperature conditions. the california situation that we are witnessing for [inaudible] crops. so all of this is creating sort of a need for the next generation of biotechnology solutions. so if you look at sort of what the industry delivered until now, which was mostly crop protection-focused, i think that what we are seeing today also in light of climate change creates a perfect scenario for the type of solutions we are bringing to market.
now that also there has been kind of our central solution in terms of seed rate, but also the biological package that comes along with profarm we saw last year, where we can improve crop health and soil health and improve the bionutrition so that we are less demanding or less dependent on chemical nutrients, if you will, for crop management. so i think this is obviously favorable for us. you see these reflected in the regulatory clearances and the speed at which we're obtaining approvals in geographies that have been challenging in the past. and so i think your observation is well based.
operator
we have no further questions for today. so i will hand it back to federico trucco for any closing remarks.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
ok. so thanks, everyone, again, for joining. as i said at the beginning, this has been a terrific year, one that we are very proud of. so i want to congratulate the more than 700 people today that work in the broader bioceres crop solutions organization for their hard work and invite them to keep on doing what they are doing so that we can continue to deliver the type of performance we are showing here today.
i hope you have a terrific rest of the week and look forward to interact and do follow-ups with those that are interested in learning more about our company and our technologies. thank you.

hello, and welcome to the bioceres crop solutions fiscal fourth quarter 2020 financial results conference call. my name is alex, and i'll be coordinating the call today. [operator instructions] i will now hand over to your host, head of investor relations, paula savanti. paula, please go ahead.
paula savanti -- head of corporate finance and strategic research
thank you. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining. presenting today during the call will be federico trucco, our chief executive officer; and enrique lopez lecube, our chief financial officer. both will be available for the q&a session.
before we proceed, i would like to make the following safe harbor statements. today's call will contain forward-looking statements, and i refer you to the forward-looking statements section of today's earnings release and presentation as well as our recent filings with the sec. we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect new or changed circumstances. also, please note that for comparison purposes and a better understanding of our company's underlying performance, we will discuss during our presentation as-reported results as well as comparable results, which excludes the impact of hyperinflationary accounting in argentina.
additional information in connection with the application of the rule ias 29 can be found in our earnings report. finally, this conference call is being webcast. the webcast link is available at the bioceres crop solutions investor relations website. at this time, i will turn the call over to our ceo, federico trucco.
thank you. 
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
thank you, paula, and good morning to everyone on the call. thank you for joining us today. please turn to slide 3 for a quick overview of the main highlights for the quarter and the fiscal year. i would like to start by saying that we are extremely proud of the performance delivered by our teams in the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022.
this last quarter was particularly challenging since we are comparing to a record-setting quarter in 2021 while we grew at close to 40% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. consequently, the 44% top-line growth observed in the current quarter represents an amazing closing to an amazing year with an end of 62% revenue growth for the 12-month period. adjusted ebitda for the year ended at $61.9 million after excluding hb4 ramp-up costs. although this number represents a 24% improvement over last year's metric, it fails to capture the full magnitude of our ebitda expansion as ias 29 accounting rules artificially magnified some of our costs.
this will be explained in more detail by enrique during his part of the presentation. fiscal 2020 was not only an amazing year due to our financial performance but also in terms of achieving gatekeeping regulatory clearances, most importantly, feed and food approvals for hb4 wheat in brazil and for hb4 soy in china. these approvals placid us in a very select club of companies. we are, for the first time, reporting revenues associated to the hb4 technology with $12.4 million recognized in the quarter for hb4 wheat, representing a 94% increase when compared to contributed goods reported for the hb4 program in the year-ago period.
finally, and as an important subsequent event to the quarter's end, we have successfully culminated our merger with marrone bio innovations and have integrated and suit the company in less than four months since announcing the transaction. like the recent integration back in 2016, we believe this merger will be transformational for us. i will provide a brief update on the integration process later in the presentation. please turn to slide 4 to better understand the growth acceleration that we're currently experiencing.
and for this purpose, we're going back to 2019 when we became listed. top line revenue growth has accelerated in the past fiscal year with a growth rate at 62%. that is more than four times the average of the last two years. similarly, our adjusted ebitda growth has more than doubled the average growth of the last two years and more than tripled that of last year.
enrique will explain the drivers behind the current performance, but i would like to highlight that what we are seeing today is the outcome of decisions that we took many years back. only modestly reflecting initial for sales and not accounting in any form for the growth we expect from our recent merger and international expansion. likewise, on slide 5, you can see the evolution of hb4 revenues or contributed goods since we launched the hb4 program. the hb4 program was designed to parallel-track product development in terms of geographic targeting and performance validation for prelaunch varieties with the inventory ramp-up process.
fiscal 2022 revenues and contributed goods represent a 74% increase over the year before period with an overall gross margin expansion of 900 basis points. you can see that almost all the growth experienced in fiscal '22 was achieved in the currently reported quarter with hb4 wheat, which is discussed in more detail in slide 6. wheat revenues were generated with the hb4 program kept at a steady state slightly over 50,000 hectares and with initial sales to conventional channel participants such as multipliers and distributors, something we can only do now after being granted registration for the first five materials. growing conditions are very challenging now in argentina with many regions being affected by long-standing non-lapping routes.
although it is too early to tell, hb4 varieties are favorably withstanding the current stress, and we look forward to report on the revolution in upcoming calls. to minimize disruption in the commercial chain, we continue to build our downstream channel for hb4 wheat as shown in slide 7. in the past quarter, we doubled the number of processors onboarded now reaching a total of 25, and we are currently working with 23 new processors to be onboarded in the next few quarters. total processing capacity stands at over 1 million tonnes, a number that far exceeds hb4 grain current or near-term availability.
we are also working to take advantage of existing import approvals and have recently finalized our first final export of hb4 flower to brazil. to leverage on the identity reserve capabilities developed for the hb4 program and expand our relationships with downstream players, we have planted the first 300 hectares of good wheat materials. these are wheat varieties genetically edited to meet consumer demands, such as increased dietary fiber or reduced gluten content. although these materials are targeted yet been improved to perform competitively, something that is currently ongoing, the produced grain will allow us and our partners to jointly develop consumer interest in anticipation for our future technology launch.
turning now to slide 8. we have finished harvesting last season's hb4 soy crop and are moving forward to launch two of the varieties with selected multipliers and distributors in the upcoming season. we have also redesigned the hb4 program to allow growers to test a larger set of materials within their production regions, and this will allow us to accelerate variety validation evaluation and geographic positioning. we intend to have more materials available for launch in upcoming seasons.
we are also making good progress in brazil, where we are advancing two varieties under the hb4 program approach to be ready for launch in the '23, '24 season. based on our ongoing conversations, we also expect our leading licensees to be able to launch their first materials during the '23, '24 season, and this is both for argentina and probably, a lesser extent, to brazil. slide 9. provides an overview of the progress we are -- sorry, slide 9 provides an overview of the progress we made during the last fiscal year in terms of regulatory clearances.
we are pleased to see the evolution of approvals for hb4 wheat since the initial green line in argentina back in 2021. the approval in brazil was particularly important since this was a prerequisite to be able to get variety registered in argentina and, consequently, revenues booked. we intend to seize the current regulatory momentum in wheat and continue to submit applications in important import geographies such as those of southeast asia. we have already filed in indonesia, for instance, and we are looking forward to file in the upcoming months in thailand, vietnam, and the philippines.
the approval of hb4 soy in china carries a similar implication for us to that of wheat in brazil as we now can register varieties that enable conventional sales in argentina. also, china's approval was a triggering event for our licensees, which are now free to launch in their respective geographies. we expect to be able to recognize hb4 soy revenues in the upcoming season. right after the quarter's end and less than four months since the announcement, we have successfully merged with and delisted marrone bio innovations.
this update of the integration process can be found on slide 10. we have rebranded the company under the profarm name and promoted the founder, matti tiainen, a founder of the subsidiary, as our president and managing director for these business units. the profarm business unit will manage the portfolio and pipeline of legacy marrone globally and have channel responsibilities in north america and europe. similarly, rizobacter will remain our defacto commercial channel in south america and other rest of the world geographies.
on the cost synergies front, we are already at 60% of the $8 million target we set for ourselves and expect to be able to fully achieve this goal in the upcoming months. finally, i would like to thank former ceo, kevin helash, and the interim board for their contribution to this successful integration process. i would also like to welcome yogesh mago and keith mcgovern, as continuing board members as well as cassie hilder and agustin biagioni, who have taken key evp roles for the integration process and future operations of the company. enrique, the floor's yours.
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
thank you, federico, and good morning to everyone joining us today. before i dive into what has been an exceptional year from both an operational and a financial perspective, i want to remind you that i will focus my comments on comparable revenues and comparable growth profit. as you know, our reported results are affected by the adoption of ias 29 in our argentine subsidiaries. given the current local macroeconomic conditions in argentina, ias 29 this year has resulted in revenues and costs that are overestimated for our local subsidiaries and, therefore, margins that are underestimated.
we show you the differences in the release and on the slides, but i'll speak today to more relevant comparable metrics. if you would refer to slide 11, fourth quarter comparable revenue growth of 44% topped off an exceptional year, in which all quarters delivered strong growth. full-year comparable revenues were recorded at almost $320 million, a 62% year-on-year gain, as federico pointed out. importantly, these metrics do not include pro forma numbers, which will begin to be consolidated in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.if i summed up both the quarter and the year, i would point to accelerated adoption of some of our main technologies.
we increased volumes of micro-beaded fertilizers by 64% for the full year. we expanded inoculant sales in an important target region in brazil, and we also reported hb4 wheat revenues for the first time, which represented more than half of the seed and integrated products revenues in the fourth quarter standing at $12.4 million. we also benefited from our proactive steps to reorganize commercial operations for third-party product sales. throughout the year, we had some tailwinds that favor the adoption of our technologies, but we also faced disruptions in global logistics and some temporary cost pressure.
overall, we were able to successfully weather the challenges of the year and leverage the commercial -- the strength of our commercial teams to capture value in an ever-changing global environment for agriculture. slide 12 illustrates the breadth of our strength across all of our reporting segments. crop protection benefited from the reorganization of third-party product sales, as i mentioned, as well as from higher prices, which were driven by disruptions in global supply chains. cp sales represented almost half of overall sales in both the quarter and the full year.
increased adoption of our micro-beaded fertilizers and inoculants drove 45% growth in the quarter and 77% growth for the year in the crop nutrition segment. during a volatile time in the global fertilizer market, we nearly doubled sales of micro-beaded fertilizers, adding 200 new clients and experiencing doubling of past purchases by existing customers. additionally, in brazil, we saw a particularly strong inoculant sale. brazil has been a targeted expansion region for our lli or long light inoculant technology because of the competitive advantage it offers growers in that country.
while a smaller contributor from a dollar perspective, the addition of revenues from for wheat was the most exciting development for the quarter and the year in the seed and integrated products segment. we delivered first-time revenues of $12.4 million, topping our prior estimate of $10 million to $12 million in initial revenues. this creates a strong base from which to continue to grow this breakthrough seed offering. clearly, our exceptional revenue growth in 2022, we have set a new high watermark for the company and elevated the base from which we will grow.
while this year's tremendous space will be very difficult to replicate, we do see a path forward with continued growth in line with our historical from current annual growth rates. we now have the tools and the portfolio in place, which will allow us to consistently deliver revenue growth at multiples far above the industry average. in the near term, we are broadening our biologicals portfolio with the addition of profarm group expanding the global adoption of our products to our extensive and growing network of partners and capitalizing on our investments in hb4 technology. let me now take a moment to look at comparable gross profit and gross margins more closely, as shown for the fourth quarter on slide 13.
the total gross profit rose by 32% to $41.4 million. seed and integrated products increased by 270% from the sales of hb4 wheat, while the relatively smaller gains in crop nutrition were mostly offset by the decline in crop protection gross profit. the resulting gross margin was 366 basis point decline, reflecting product mix and higher cost of goods sold. since the effect of ias 29 is cumulative throughout the year, it becomes particularly relevant in the fourth quarter.
while ias 29 application expanded revenues above the comparable figure, it had the opposite effect on gross profit, constricting the reported metric by almost $5 million versus the comparable gross profit and therefore reducing margins to 34.5% on the reported metrics. as shown on slide 14, each reporting segment contributed to the 45% increase in full-year gross profit of $136.9 million. from a gross margin perspective, the same factors that impacted margins in the fourth quarter were evident throughout the fiscal year. as a result, margins were in the low 40% range rather than the high 40% range reported for our last fiscal year.
at this point, we expect our annual target for blended gross margin to be in the mid-40% range, and we are well within reach. going forward, we anticipate that the addition of pro forma and hb4 sales will boost our margin profile and will help offset the margin headwind we experienced with manufacturing costs at our argentine facility. while the first half of the year has been challenging for profarm due to persistent drought conditions around the world, particularly in the united states, we are looking forward to including their revenues in the second half of the year where they sell their seed and soil treatment, which is typically the stronger half of the year. please turn now to slide 15.
adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter, excluding hb4 freelance costs, was $17.7 million, 2% higher when compared with $17.4 million in the same quarter in 2021. this number excludes $3.2 million in costs associated with the prelaunch ramp-up of inventories for the hb4 program as we continue to target revenues well above what was reported in the current quarter and the fiscal year. adjusted ebitda growth was lower than top-end growth, given changes in the segment mix, the gross margin dynamics i just mentioned and macro dynamics in argentina that created transitory cost pressure in our local subsidiaries. consistent with our past practice, we do not use comparable figures in reporting adjusted ebitda.
however, we have isolated the impact of ias 29 adjustment in this graph to illustrate this effect to a tune of $4.4 million for the quarter. on slide 16, we highlight the 24% increase in full-year adjusted ebitda, excluding, once again, gross profit gains drove the improvement to $61.9 million, with operational expenses offsetting some of that pain. importantly, out of the almost $30 million increase in operating expenses, only two-thirds of this are costs associated with operational growth. the remaining increase is explained by hb4 program operating costs and ias 29 adjustments.
operational growth was driven by higher valuable sg&a in line with our sales growth as well as higher logistic costs as we took cautionary measures to ensure continued supply of our products. as well as the temporary cost pressures in argentina i already mentioned. the overall effect of ias 29 accounting is very relevant when looking at full-year results. where it reduces gains in adjusted ebitda by a nontrivial amount of $18.5 million.
let me take a few moments to close with a review of our balance sheet and cash position. if you will turn to slide 18. as you know, we have proactively replaced more expensive sources of capital with newly issued debt instruments throughout the year. additionally, we have lowered our total financial debt position over the course of the fiscal year, giving conversion of 75% of the 2019 convertible notes into common stock.
by fiscal year end, our net financial debt stood at $127.3 million, and our net debt to ltm adjusted ebitda ratio stood at 2.47 turns. as cfo, i'd like to be somewhat below this range, although we'll see some uptick in the first two quarters as we report debt associated with the profarm acquisition. in relation to the profarm acquisition, we have executed subsequent to quarter closed two financing agreements and new secured convertible notes due in 2026 that provided us with $55 million in cash and the rollover of the remaining part of the 2019 convertible notes into a new note with no convertibility feature into common stock. as a high-growth company, i believe we are in a good position with the appropriate mix of short-term debt and working capital, further backed by a meaningful liquidity position as our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments stood at $38 million by year end prior to incorporating the $55 million proceeds from the new convertible note and debt from profarm.
in summary, 2022 has been a watershed year for bcs. the revenue growth and profitability from our base business, plus the investments we have made for future growth will be catalysts for success in line with our historical cagr. we have greatly enhanced the diversity of our revenue sources, broadened our market reach and acquired a new stream of exciting r&d projects with profarm. we are in a solid financial position and have the flexibility to invest in capital projects and other commercial and manufacturing improvements.
everyone on the team has done a remarkable job of setting the stage and putting in place the resources that will transform bioceres in the coming years. with that, let me turn the call back to federico.

[operator instructions] our first question for today comes from ben klieve of lake street capital markets.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
congratulations on the end of a really successful year here. first, i have a couple of questions on the launch of hb4 soy. and federico, in particular, a comment you made in your prepared remarks about the licensing model. can you elaborate a bit more on, first of all, kind of the degree to which hb4 soy both in argentina and brazil is expected to be kind of a straight licensing model versus an ecoseed concept? and then second of all, can you characterize kind of who these licensing partners are? if you can't name names, if you can kind of give a broad characterization of who these folks are.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
sure. so thanks, ben, for joining the call. it's always great to hear you. in terms of hb4, so this is the one crop where we probably have a greater gap in terms of genetics.
for those of you that do not know, in wheat we are partnered with the leader for latam genetics, which is floating on the brain. in soy, this is more of a stand-alone effort. so to be able to counteract that to some extent, we have licensed the technology to leading participants. and there are two that are publicly disclosed or that we have disclosed in the past, such as don mario, which is the no.
1 market share player in latin america and tmg that is a brazil grain company that is important for that country. so these two licensees that have outstanding genetics we'll be able to launch in the upcoming -- not so much in the upcoming season but in '23, 24 with the material safety in developing. and the china approval was key to be able to enable this particular channel. we continue to pursue the ecoseed concept within the hb4 program and with sales through our own network.
and that is what you're likely to see in the upcoming season, bringing the lion's share of the revenues with two varieties that now can be commercialized outside of the program structure using the more conventional approach. these two varieties have been positioned in areas of argentina that together represents slightly less than 1.5 million hectares. so obviously, we're not indicating that that's sort of the acreage we're likely to achieve, but it is meaningful enough for us to be able to do what we need to do this year so that we can be on track for the guidance we provided after the chinese approval.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
got it. got it. that's all very helpful. another hb4-related question, enrique, maybe more for you.
i'm curious, you very helpfully break down kind of the costs associated with the hb4 ramp historically. i'm wondering what your expectations are for really fiscal '23 in terms of costs associated with the ramp versus ebitda contributions in a commercial launch. i mean to what extent do you think those kind of prelaunch costs are going to offset the profitability from the commercial launch of both wheat and soy?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
ben, thanks for joining the call and for the question. so i think there's a divergence between the type of revenue ramp-up that you can expect from hb4 and profitability reported, profitability coming from hb4 and the run rate of the prelaunch costs that you see reported in sg&a. i mean those are more associated to our identity research channel and what we do with generation hb4 as a program where we were jointly with farmers where, as federico pointed out, revenues and profitability from hp will be coming from different sources, not only just that. so i think that we are currently at the run rate of what can be expected for that.
and as we continue to multiply variety and expand and the research channel, you might see that following that acreage rather than the total reported revenues and profitability for hb4. so in essence, i don't think that those are going to offset however, bear in mind that we are ramping up the program. we are still ramping up the variety. so as enrique pointed out, this is only the beginning for hb4.
and i think that we will continue to see those costs to show up in the next fiscal year.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
let me add something to that. ben, for you to keep in mind, i think the hb4 program will be kept almost at a steady state. except mainly in soy, where we might increase it slightly in we today, we're at 50,000 hectares, for instance. so we're not expecting to increase that significantly.
and this is what we use in a way to attract the variety validation, the free marketing component and the inventory ramp-up process. so the more varieties we get that we can channel directly to farmers, either within the ecoseed concept or as we can see, if you will, through conventional distribution, the more those revenues will dilute the -- sort of the ramp-up cost associated to the program. so i think they will become less significant or proportionately less significantly on a forward-going basis.
ben klieve -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
got it. ok. that's all very helpful. a point more to talk about it.
i'll just ask one more and then get back in queue. and it's a question kind of on a high level around the outlook on the fertilizer side. i mean this business has just been exceptional now for a long time. and enrique, you commented on capacity expansion broadly.
i'm wondering how you're looking at addressing kind of long-term growth from the micro-beaded fertilizer products specifically and kind of when you think you're going to have to make a decision about potentially making a real material capacity expansion from that product line specifically.
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
that's a great question, ben. and i mean it's a nice challenge that we faced throughout the year because we reached almost half of our capacity ahead of what we expected. so we have already been working on an expansion project for our facility in latin america that is already on its way. so there will be some capex going into that to support further growth in that facility that supplies the latin american market.
i don't think that it's going to be of the size and materiality of the initial investment with us. but you can certainly expect that we will be investing in expanding that capacity to continue growing revenues from micro fertilizers.
operator
our next question comes from kemp dolliver from brookline capital markets.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
first question relates to the performance of the various hb4 soy varieties. and can you just talk a little bit about what you've learned with regard to cause and effect with regard to the performance of the different varieties and how you are thinking about future development of the soy varieties?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
sure. so thanks, kemp, for joining. it's a pleasure to have you here. i think that the key here is to understand that for us to be able to select the right materials, we need to farther up with farmers to identify where these materials work and when they need to be planted and if that is done concurrently with the inventory ramp-up that we can have anticipated launches.
we do it in the conventional way where lots is done with the trialing within the crop development teams. and then we take the varieties to farmers. it takes longer. so that is in a way what brings about some of the bumpiness, if you will, in our ability to move forward with these materials.
now the good news is that we have two materials that we've been testing over the last two seasons, particularly one that's been tested, i think, for more than two seasons, which is 40 to 20 where we now feel fairly comfortable about performance and its ability to win over commercial checks in a particular region of the province that accounts for a little less than 1 million hectares. and when we talk about leading with conventional checks, we're not talking about hb4 performance. i mean we're not talking about how the gene works in the different backgrounds. we're talking about the competitiveness of the hardware in which we're incorporating that software, which, as i indicated before, it's being developed by us and not coming from a market leader like florimond desprez in the case of wheat.
so that is what's leading the challenge. we're improving every year. obviously, we're not going at the same pace we are going with wheat, but we do have the possibility of using licensees to, in a way, narrow that gap, which is what i recently discussed. the performance issues, one that is [inaudible] related that has to do with the genetics of the materials we are using, and it's not in a way related to the performance of the team, which has been well validated not only by us but also by our technology partners.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's good. so i mean, obviously, there's trial and error involved in this process. and based on your last -- your closing comment, it sounds like you've identified, say, the commonality within these -- within the traits that are influencing the performance of the ones that are -- that you've identified as say, loss versus win? is that pretty fair? or is there still some just you would need to do additional research to really understand the differences in performance?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
look, this is kind of gathering farmer information to be able to justify a launch and making sure that the launch it's not erratic and we're launching a video that meet the standards that are required for the technology i think that what we are doing here today is probably open kimono in many ways. this is not something a company will normally disclose. they don't tell you how they get to the variety [inaudible] they launch. we want to do this in a different way because we think it sort of saves time even though this is also showing when we fail, and not only where we win.
now if we win in 8 out of 10 situations, that's impressive. that's probably something that you will not see in a standard variety, and that's the type of quality material that we would like to launch within the program. the one thing we have changed to be able to improve upon what we've been doing is to allow farmers to test a broader set of materials. so in the past, we would only give one variety for each farmer and we would have a win and loss for that particular field.
now we are giving three to four varieties for each farmer, keeping hectares at the same level. we don't want to increase hectares necessarily to keep costs under control, but we want to improve the quality of the data for the targeting launch validation process. and that i believe will significantly accelerate our ability to bring new varieties to the conventional channel like we are going today with 42 20 or 50 21.
kemp dolliver -- brookline capital markets -- analyst
that's great. and my last question or at least topic, it relates to the australian, new zealand market. and i think also this ties into some context with ukraine. and recently, there have been some reports that australian farmers are increasing their plans to export wheat, as i'm sure others are, to try to offset the loss of the ukrainian capacity.
so number one, how are you thinking about advancing process -- your business in australia? and then also, just hypothetically, if ukraine stabilizes and becomes a significant grower again, is that market ever an opportunity? or is there just -- or do they just serve the anti-gmo part of the world that would not accept these products?
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
so that's a great question. i think, first, on australia and new zealand, we have not included an update here, but we announced a few months back our intent to acquire with genetics business in country that is currently owned by [inaudible] genetics was in part the breeding program that was run by [inaudible] in the past. and that is a process that's still ongoing and we expect to be able to close before the year's end. this is something we're doing via our jv with [inaudible] genetics.
so that will give us a footprint in australia and an initial set of materials on which we can deploy the hb4 technology. we have already sent materials that are going through the quarantine process to advance the trialing in country and be able to get the production clearance. we do have feed and food clearance today. we need the planting or cultivation clearance to be able to launch in australia season.
so that is a very meaningful market. i can say that it's probably twice the opportunity that we're currently pursuing in latin america. and in terms of the ukraine and other geographies, i believe that the more we make hb4 wheat sort of status quo, if you will, the more likely these geographies that have historically rejected gmos will accept the technology. and i can point to a sort of an interesting observation, which is what happened in brazil.
there was a post-approval survey in brazil that show that close to 70% of consumers have no concerns on gmo wheat. and that observation helped change the position of key groups that historically rejected transgenics in the crop. i mean with this, we're not saying that the job is done, but i think it's far from being done, but we are much closer today to being able to deploy these technologies in geographies where before we thought that would be very challenging, ukraine being one of them. who knows? maybe one day, we will have gmo in france.
i think that can be today more realistic than what it was a year ago. but that's what -- i don't know, enrique, if you have any comments on this.
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
i think just to complement on what federico said, i mean it's evident that with the ukraine situation, food security has become a concern for everyone, and it seems to be a consensus technology and in particular, gmo is a meaningful part of the reply or answer that humanity needs to provide to that full security. so i think that has been also a qualitative tailwind for us throughout the year in obtaining regulatory approvals and gaining exposure to processors. you can see that we've added 30 new processors. and as with many things, concerns fade away when there's a threat of not having something that is important for you.
operator
our next question comes from dmitry silversteyn from water tower research.
dmitry silversteyn -- water tower research -- analyst
i was wondering, you posted a very strong revenue growth number, obviously, and a lot of it has to do with the launch of the hb4. but if you have to look at price, and i think you mentioned that pricing was a little bit of a tailwind in foreign exchange translation. what role did price and fx play in your revenue growth in the quarter?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
dmitry, this is enrique. pleasure to have you on the call for the first time, and thanks for your question. so i would have to say that fx plays no role whatsoever in increasing our revenues, our comparable revenues, as i mentioned. bear in mind that this company operates mainly in hard currency.
so either dollars or euros with the exception of brazil that is a market that operates in local currency. so there's practically no tailwinds from fx whatsoever. there is some tailwinds coming from prices, mainly in the cp segment. so crop protection products did see some increase in prices coming from the disruption in the supply chain.
so raw materials that go into cp coming from china or india, into the u.s., brazil, argentina, paraguay, uruguay, the main ag-producing countries, was a threat throughout the year, and that allows for price increases, which at the end of the day helped us in that particular segment. now more important than that, to me, is the fact that this highlights a competitive advantage from biologicals, which we have significantly invested in with the profarm acquisition. biologicals have manufactured in country. you don't need to get raw materials from the other side of the world to be able to supply farmers with inputs.
so that was a tailwind in cp. in the rest, i would say that it was not a major tailwind prices. it was more related to us expanding the business and having much greater adoption of our main technologies. i would say that probably micro-beaded fertilizers were the star product for the year in that regard.
dmitry silversteyn -- water tower research -- analyst
got it. got it. if i can follow up on the crop protection question on crop protection area. your gross margin there is what i would consider to be a little bit below what kind of the industry averages, if you will, which i think is north of 40%.
clearly, it's going to improve as you integrate profarm. but can you talk about sort of what the drivers of the margin is? first of all, are you looking to expand margins in this business in the short term? and secondly, what would be the major drivers of that?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
that's a very good question. bear in mind that in crop protection, we have some sales to [inaudible] from third-party product sales. so this is not strategic product category for us but rather something tactical. in some countries like brazil, paraguay and argentina, we collect from retailers by getting products in return.
and also, we have become the partner of choice for some other companies that want to commercialize in latin america [inaudible] products to us as a commercial partner. so those two categories of products that are more tactical in nature have lower margins, have lower working capital requirements and are kind of like low-hanging fruit for us. now those products are probably delivering gross margins that range between 25% to 35%. and that's what, at the end of the day, drives down the overall segment margin, which i believe -- i mean, that segment should have a normal run rate, a margin that is closer to 40%.
when you compare that to other cp companies, bear in mind that [inaudible] cp companies are selling products with their own brands and don't have as much of [inaudible] as we have on this type of more tactical product categories. i think that this will remain to be the lower margin business segment within all of the segments until we start seeing marrone, i should say, profarm products becoming reported there that have gross margins are closer to 60%.
dmitry silversteyn -- water tower research -- analyst
gotcha. that's very helpful. and yes, i totally get the third-party distribution margins would be lower. we've seen that in other companies that have participated and particularly in the latin america market.
you mentioned some planned cost issues with argentina plant impacting your quarter a little bit in terms of margins. what's the situation there now? and can we look for the cost manufacturing facility to stabilize as we get into 2023?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
that's also a great question. thanks for asking. so first, i will say that, today, argentina continues to be an important manufacturing hub for us. so even though we commercialize globally many of our products, those are material in manufacturing in argentina.
we are expanding our manufacturing capacity in brazil to diversify product sources. but for this particular fiscal year 2022 period, argentina continues to play an important supplying role. two things i would say, dmitry, it is important to us and what we track is the evolution of the local inflation versus the depreciation of local currency against the u.s. dollar.
so if inflation outpaces depreciation of the local currency, that means that we will begin to see cost pressure out of local currency-denominated costs being inflated when measured in u.s. dollars. that applies as much to cost of goods sold as it applies to sg&a functions that are located in country. throughout the year, i would say that probably in the fourth quarter, we saw these two macro variables, local inflation and depreciation of local currency converging.
that is what we were expecting. but for the previous 15 to 16 months, inflation versus depreciation of local currency. so there's an accumulation -- there's a cumulative effect that has yet not been fully corrected. so i would say is that the bleeding has been stopped in the fourth quarter.
and what we expect is that at some point, these two variables need to converge. it has been always the case and when you look at the last four decades in argentina. and when that happens, the business will get back to the normal run rate and what i was saying about gross margins being in the mid-20% range. i cannot tell you when that would happen.
i would only point out that there's upcoming elections in argentina in 2023, and that has proven to be a catalyst many times for macro variables to fall back in place.
dmitry silversteyn -- water tower research -- analyst
understood. that was very helpful. and then final question before i get in the queue. the latin american planting season is well underway now.
can you provide any color as to how that's going, what you're seeing that may be different from what you saw in 2022, '23 season? and just give us any color that you can on what the current planting season in latin america looks like for you specifically.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
so this is federico. great to have you, dmitry, in the call. in terms of latin america, as i indicated, we are facing significant drought, particularly for winter crops in argentina. so this is an evolving situation, but grains are required promptly.
so it's, in a way, a double-edged component for us because it does showcase hb4 technology and allows us to make the technology more visible to farmers. but on the other hand, it does have a consequence in terms of farmers' income and ability to incorporate new technologies in the future because of their ability to invest if they have a weak crop at the end of the winter. so i think we're waiting for rains. this is in part important in argentina.
in brazil, we have to close because we still have a weak business there of relevance. and i don't know, enrique, if you want to add anything to the latin american part.
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
yes, i would only point out, dmitry, the fact that planting is probably the one decision that the farmer always wants to make and less nature really imposes restrictions and they end up not being able to plant. so you will see that for the product categories of our portfolio that are designed to us planting, we tend to see a high resilience in revenues even though there might be drought windows. it does not work the same way for cp products, for example. so what i would say is that probably, we did have a good planting season for winter crops in argentina that mostly shows up in our q4 results.
what we are probably looking with a little bit more focus now are how rains will evolve in light of the upcoming some of the costs. some usually takes place by the end of q1, beginning of q2 of our fiscal year in latin america.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from brian wright of roth capital
brian wright -- roth capital partners -- analyst
would the -- i was hoping to get an update on profarm, just maybe are you in a position to provide an update on kind of what their 2q results kind of look like?
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
brian, this is enrique. thanks for joining the call, and pleasure to be talking to you. so as i mentioned, q4 of our fiscal year, so march through june was a drought quarter in the u.s. in particular.
and in california, even more so. as you know, about half of the revenue stream from profarm is coming from cash crop sales in california, where half is coming from road crops in the u.s. and europe. so what i would say is that for profarm has been a tough quarter.
we do expect and we are here to see how the second half of the calendar year, we will evolve for them coming out of that. so i would expect q4 and full fiscal year of profarm revenues to be here flat or slightly below the number that they reported in the previous fiscal year of them, so 2021. i mean, to us, obviously, i think that it is more important, the benefit that we will be gaining from diversifying revenue sources, which i mentioned. sometimes california, for example, might be an offsetting factor as it was in march through june.
and hopefully, sometimes you will help us sort of like offset other revenue threats like the ones that we have in latin america with drought for some of the crops potentially. so that's all i can say. as of now, we will be probably giving a little bit more color on profarm's numbers in the upcoming earnings call, where we will be consolidating the results for the first time.
brian wright -- roth capital partners -- analyst
great. great. just also on -- just from a bigger picture, given the drought conditions in argentina right now, given just broad weather conditions across the globe, isn't that conducive for the next selling season as far as hb4? or am i --
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
no. look -- brian, this is federico. great to have you on the call. but i think, obviously, the current situation with drought becoming not only notorious here in latin america, but also in asia, the situation in china is quite dramatic.
in europe, as we've seen coming out of the summer, yields have been hit by significant drought and high-temperature conditions. the california situation that we are witnessing for [inaudible] crops. so all of this is creating sort of a need for the next generation of biotechnology solutions. so if you look at sort of what the industry delivered until now, which was mostly crop protection-focused, i think that what we are seeing today also in light of climate change creates a perfect scenario for the type of solutions we are bringing to market.
now that also there has been kind of our central solution in terms of seed rate, but also the biological package that comes along with profarm we saw last year, where we can improve crop health and soil health and improve the bionutrition so that we are less demanding or less dependent on chemical nutrients, if you will, for crop management. so i think this is obviously favorable for us. you see these reflected in the regulatory clearances and the speed at which we're obtaining approvals in geographies that have been challenging in the past. and so i think your observation is well based.
operator
we have no further questions for today. so i will hand it back to federico trucco for any closing remarks.
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
ok. so thanks, everyone, again, for joining. as i said at the beginning, this has been a terrific year, one that we are very proud of. so i want to congratulate the more than 700 people today that work in the broader bioceres crop solutions organization for their hard work and invite them to keep on doing what they are doing so that we can continue to deliver the type of performance we are showing here today.
i hope you have a terrific rest of the week and look forward to interact and do follow-ups with those that are interested in learning more about our company and our technologies. thank you.

hello, and welcome to the bioceres crop solutions fiscal fourth quarter 2020 financial results conference call. my name is alex, and i'll be coordinating the call today. [operator instructions] i will now hand over to your host, head of investor relations, paula savanti. paula, please go ahead.
paula savanti -- head of corporate finance and strategic research
thank you. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining. presenting today during the call will be federico trucco, our chief executive officer; and enrique lopez lecube, our chief financial officer. both will be available for the q&a session.
before we proceed, i would like to make the following safe harbor statements. today's call will contain forward-looking statements, and i refer you to the forward-looking statements section of today's earnings release and presentation as well as our recent filings with the sec. we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect new or changed circumstances. also, please note that for comparison purposes and a better understanding of our company's underlying performance, we will discuss during our presentation as-reported results as well as comparable results, which excludes the impact of hyperinflationary accounting in argentina.
additional information in connection with the application of the rule ias 29 can be found in our earnings report. finally, this conference call is being webcast. the webcast link is available at the bioceres crop solutions investor relations website. at this time, i will turn the call over to our ceo, federico trucco.
thank you. 
federico trucco -- chief executive officer
thank you, paula, and good morning to everyone on the call. thank you for joining us today. please turn to slide 3 for a quick overview of the main highlights for the quarter and the fiscal year. i would like to start by saying that we are extremely proud of the performance delivered by our teams in the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022.
this last quarter was particularly challenging since we are comparing to a record-setting quarter in 2021 while we grew at close to 40% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. consequently, the 44% top-line growth observed in the current quarter represents an amazing closing to an amazing year with an end of 62% revenue growth for the 12-month period. adjusted ebitda for the year ended at $61.9 million after excluding hb4 ramp-up costs. although this number represents a 24% improvement over last year's metric, it fails to capture the full magnitude of our ebitda expansion as ias 29 accounting rules artificially magnified some of our costs.
this will be explained in more detail by enrique during his part of the presentation. fiscal 2020 was not only an amazing year due to our financial performance but also in terms of achieving gatekeeping regulatory clearances, most importantly, feed and food approvals for hb4 wheat in brazil and for hb4 soy in china. these approvals placid us in a very select club of companies. we are, for the first time, reporting revenues associated to the hb4 technology with $12.4 million recognized in the quarter for hb4 wheat, representing a 94% increase when compared to contributed goods reported for the hb4 program in the year-ago period.
finally, and as an important subsequent event to the quarter's end, we have successfully culminated our merger with marrone bio innovations and have integrated and suit the company in less than four months since announcing the transaction. like the recent integration back in 2016, we believe this merger will be transformational for us. i will provide a brief update on the integration process later in the presentation. please turn to slide 4 to better understand the growth acceleration that we're currently experiencing.
and for this purpose, we're going back to 2019 when we became listed. top line revenue growth has accelerated in the past fiscal year with a growth rate at 62%. that is more than four times the average of the last two years. similarly, our adjusted ebitda growth has more than doubled the average growth of the last two years and more than tripled that of last year.
enrique will explain the drivers behind the current performance, but i would like to highlight that what we are seeing today is the outcome of decisions that we took many years back. only modestly reflecting initial for sales and not accounting in any form for the growth we expect from our recent merger and international expansion. likewise, on slide 5, you can see the evolution of hb4 revenues or contributed goods since we launched the hb4 program. the hb4 program was designed to parallel-track product development in terms of geographic targeting and performance validation for prelaunch varieties with the inventory ramp-up process.
fiscal 2022 revenues and contributed goods represent a 74% increase over the year before period with an overall gross margin expansion of 900 basis points. you can see that almost all the growth experienced in fiscal '22 was achieved in the currently reported quarter with hb4 wheat, which is discussed in more detail in slide 6. wheat revenues were generated with the hb4 program kept at a steady state slightly over 50,000 hectares and with initial sales to conventional channel participants such as multipliers and distributors, something we can only do now after being granted registration for the first five materials. growing conditions are very challenging now in argentina with many regions being affected by long-standing non-lapping routes.
although it is too early to tell, hb4 varieties are favorably withstanding the current stress, and we look forward to report on the revolution in upcoming calls. to minimize disruption in the commercial chain, we continue to build our downstream channel for hb4 wheat as shown in slide 7. in the past quarter, we doubled the number of processors onboarded now reaching a total of 25, and we are currently working with 23 new processors to be onboarded in the next few quarters. total processing capacity stands at over 1 million tonnes, a number that far exceeds hb4 grain current or near-term availability.
we are also working to take advantage of existing import approvals and have recently finalized our first final export of hb4 flower to brazil. to leverage on the identity reserve capabilities developed for the hb4 program and expand our relationships with downstream players, we have planted the first 300 hectares of good wheat materials. these are wheat varieties genetically edited to meet consumer demands, such as increased dietary fiber or reduced gluten content. although these materials are targeted yet been improved to perform competitively, something that is currently ongoing, the produced grain will allow us and our partners to jointly develop consumer interest in anticipation for our future technology launch.
turning now to slide 8. we have finished harvesting last season's hb4 soy crop and are moving forward to launch two of the varieties with selected multipliers and distributors in the upcoming season. we have also redesigned the hb4 program to allow growers to test a larger set of materials within their production regions, and this will allow us to accelerate variety validation evaluation and geographic positioning. we intend to have more materials available for launch in upcoming seasons.
we are also making good progress in brazil, where we are advancing two varieties under the hb4 program approach to be ready for launch in the '23, '24 season. based on our ongoing conversations, we also expect our leading licensees to be able to launch their first materials during the '23, '24 season, and this is both for argentina and probably, a lesser extent, to brazil. slide 9. provides an overview of the progress we are -- sorry, slide 9 provides an overview of the progress we made during the last fiscal year in terms of regulatory clearances.
we are pleased to see the evolution of approvals for hb4 wheat since the initial green line in argentina back in 2021. the approval in brazil was particularly important since this was a prerequisite to be able to get variety registered in argentina and, consequently, revenues booked. we intend to seize the current regulatory momentum in wheat and continue to submit applications in important import geographies such as those of southeast asia. we have already filed in indonesia, for instance, and we are looking forward to file in the upcoming months in thailand, vietnam, and the philippines.
the approval of hb4 soy in china carries a similar implication for us to that of wheat in brazil as we now can register varieties that enable conventional sales in argentina. also, china's approval was a triggering event for our licensees, which are now free to launch in their respective geographies. we expect to be able to recognize hb4 soy revenues in the upcoming season. right after the quarter's end and less than four months since the announcement, we have successfully merged with and delisted marrone bio innovations.
this update of the integration process can be found on slide 10. we have rebranded the company under the profarm name and promoted the founder, matti tiainen, a founder of the subsidiary, as our president and managing director for these business units. the profarm business unit will manage the portfolio and pipeline of legacy marrone globally and have channel responsibilities in north america and europe. similarly, rizobacter will remain our defacto commercial channel in south america and other rest of the world geographies.
on the cost synergies front, we are already at 60% of the $8 million target we set for ourselves and expect to be able to fully achieve this goal in the upcoming months. finally, i would like to thank former ceo, kevin helash, and the interim board for their contribution to this successful integration process. i would also like to welcome yogesh mago and keith mcgovern, as continuing board members as well as cassie hilder and agustin biagioni, who have taken key evp roles for the integration process and future operations of the company. enrique, the floor's yours.
enrique lopez lecube -- chief financial officer
thank you, federico, and good morning to everyone joining us today. before i dive into what has been an exceptional year from both an operational and a financial perspective, i want to remind you that i will focus my comments on comparable revenues and comparable growth profit. as you know, our reported results are affected by the adoption of ias 29 in our argentine subsidiaries. given the current local macroeconomic conditions in argentina, ias 29 this year has resulted in revenues and costs that are overestimated for our local subsidiaries and, therefore, margins that are underestimated.
we show you the differences in the release and on the slides, but i'll speak today to more relevant comparable metrics. if you would refer to slide 11, fourth quarter comparable revenue growth of 44% topped off an exceptional year, in which all quarters delivered strong growth. full-year comparable revenues were recorded at almost $320 million, a 62% year-on-year gain, as federico pointed out. importantly, these metrics do not include pro forma numbers, which will begin to be consolidated in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.if i summed up both the quarter and the year, i would point to accelerated adoption of some of our main technologies.
we increased volumes of micro-beaded fertilizers by 64% for the full year. we expanded inoculant sales in an important target region in brazil, and we also reported hb4 wheat revenues for the first time, which represented more than half of the seed and integrated products revenues in the fourth quarter standing at $12.4 million. we also benefited from our proactive steps to reorganize commercial operations for third-party product sales. throughout the year, we had some tailwinds that favor the adoption of our technologies, but we also faced disruptions in global logistics and some temporary cost pressure.
overall, we were able to successfully weather the challenges of the year and leverage the commercial -- the strength of our commercial teams to capture value in an ever-changing global environment for agriculture. slide 12 illustrates the breadth of our strength across all of our reporting segments. crop protection benefited from the reorganization of third-party product sales, as i mentioned, as well as from higher prices, which were driven by disruptions in global supply chains. cp sales represented almost half of overall sales in both the quarter and the full year.
increased adoption of our micro-beaded fertilizers and inoculants drove 45% growth in the quarter and 77% growth for the year in the crop nutrition segment. during a volatile time in the global fertilizer market, we nearly doubled sales of micro-beaded fertilizers, adding 200 new clients and experiencing doubling of past purchases by existing customers. additionally, in brazil, we saw a particularly strong inoculant sale. brazil has been a targeted expansion region for our lli or long light inoculant technology because of the competitive advantage it offers growers in that country.
while a smaller contributor from a dollar perspective, the addition of revenues from for wheat was the most exciting development for the quarter and the year in the seed and integrated products segment. we delivered first-time revenues of $12.4 million, topping our prior estimate of $10 million to $12 million in initial revenues. this creates a strong base from which to continue to grow this breakthrough seed offering. clearly, our exceptional revenue growth in 2022, we have set a new high watermark for the company and elevated the base from which we will grow.
while this year's tremendous space will be very difficult to replicate, we do see a path forward with continued growth in line with our historical from current annual growth rates. we now have the tools and the portfolio in place, which will allow us to consistently deliver revenue growth at multiples far above the industry average. in the near term, we are broadening our biologicals portfolio with the addition of profarm group expanding the global adoption of our products to our extensive and growing network of partners and capitalizing on our investments in hb4 technology. let me now take a moment to look at comparable gross profit and gross margins more closely, as shown for the fourth quarter on slide 13.
the total gross profit rose by 32% to $41.4 million. seed and integrated products increased by 270% from the sales of hb4 wheat, while the relatively smaller gains in crop nutrition were mostly offset by the decline in crop protection gross profit. the resulting gross margin was 366 basis point decline, reflecting product mix and higher cost of goods sold. since the effect of ias 29 is cumulative throughout the year, it becomes particularly relevant in the fourth quarter.
while ias 29 application expanded revenues above the comparable figure, it had the opposite effect on gross profit, constricting the reported metric by almost $5 million versus the comparable gross profit and therefore reducing margins to 34.5% on the reported metrics. as shown on slide 14, each reporting segment contributed to the 45% increase in full-year gross profit of $136.9 million. from a gross margin perspective, the same factors that impacted margins in the fourth quarter were evident throughout the fiscal year. as a result, margins were in the low 40% range rather than the high 40% range reported for our last fiscal year.
at this point, we expect our annual target for blended gross margin to be in the mid-40% range, and we are well within reach. going forward, we anticipate that the addition of pro forma and hb4 sales will boost our margin profile and will help offset the margin headwind we experienced with manufacturing costs at our argentine facility. while the first half of the year has been challenging for profarm due to persistent drought conditions around the world, particularly in the united states, we are looking forward to including their revenues in the second half of the year where they sell their seed and soil treatment, which is typically the stronger half of the year. please turn now to slide 15.
adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter, excluding hb4 freelance costs, was $17.7 million, 2% higher when compared with $17.4 million in the same quarter in 2021. this number excludes $3.2 million in costs associated with the prelaunch ramp-up of inventories for the hb4 program as we continue to target revenues well above what was reported in the current quarter and the fiscal year. adjusted ebitda growth was lower than top-end growth, given changes in the segment mix, the gross margin dynamics i just mentioned and macro dynamics in argentina that created transitory cost pressure in our local subsidiaries. consistent with our past practice, we do not use comparable figures in reporting adjusted ebitda.
however, we have isolated the impact of ias 29 adjustment in this graph to illustrate this effect to a tune of $4.4 million for the quarter. on slide 16, we highlight the 24% increase in full-year adjusted ebitda, excluding, once again, gross profit gains drove the improvement to $61.9 million, with operational expenses offsetting some of that pain. importantly, out of the almost $30 million increase in operating expenses, only two-thirds of this are costs associated with operational growth. the remaining increase is explained by hb4 program operating costs and ias 29 adjustments.
operational growth was driven by higher valuable sg&a in line with our sales growth as well as higher logistic costs as we took cautionary measures to ensure continued supply of our products. as well as the temporary cost pressures in argentina i already mentioned. the overall effect of ias 29 accounting is very relevant when looking at full-year results. where it reduces gains in adjusted ebitda by a nontrivial amount of $18.5 million.
let me take a few moments to close with a review of our balance sheet and cash position. if you will turn to slide 18. as you know, we have proactively replaced more expensive sources of capital with newly issued debt instruments throughout the year. additionally, we have lowered our total financial debt position over the course of the fiscal year, giving conversion of 75% of the 2019 convertible notes into common stock.
by fiscal year end, our net financial debt stood at $127.3 million, and our net debt to ltm adjusted ebitda ratio stood at 2.47 turns. as cfo, i'd like to be somewhat below this range, although we'll see some uptick in the first two quarters as we report debt associated with the profarm acquisition. in relation to the profarm acquisition, we have executed subsequent to quarter closed two financing agreements and new secured convertible notes due in 2026 that provided us with $55 million in cash and the rollover of the remaining part of the 2019 convertible notes into a new note with no convertibility feature into common stock. as a high-growth company, i believe we are in a good position with the appropriate mix of short-term debt and working capital, further backed by a meaningful liquidity position as our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments stood at $38 million by year end prior to incorporating the $55 million proceeds from the new convertible note and debt from profarm.
in summary, 2022 has been a watershed year for bcs. the revenue growth and profitability from our base business, plus the investments we have made for future growth will be catalysts for success in line with our historical cagr. we have greatly enhanced the diversity of our revenue sources, broadened our market reach and acquired a new stream of exciting r&d projects with profarm. we are in a solid financial position and have the flexibility to invest in capital projects and other commercial and manufacturing improvements.
everyone on the team has done a remarkable job of setting the stage and putting in place the resources that will transform bioceres in the coming years. with that, let me turn the call back to federico.
