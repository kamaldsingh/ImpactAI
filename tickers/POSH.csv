manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
thanks, christine. hello and welcome, everyone. thank you for joining us for our second earnings call as a public company. before i get into my main remarks, i want to take a moment to acknowledge the crisis in india.
as the second wave of covid-19 continues to devastate communities across the country, our hearts go out to everyone in india, especially our poshmark team, who's thankfully staying safe and whose health and safety remains our top priority. now i'll transition to my main remarks. our mission is to put people at the heart of commerce, empowering everyone to try, but bearing technology with people's inherent desires to socialize, we have built a vibrant social marketplace that makes the buying and selling experience incredibly seamless, easy, and social. we remain focused on supporting our community, innovating for a fantastic user experience, and expanding the reach and offerings of our social marketplace.
because our community of millions of sellers are constantly adding new products to the marketplace, our model is incredibly responsive to demand and we are generally not impacted by supply chain disruptions. our asset-light model holds no inventory leading to consistent high gross margins, resulting in a scalable and profitable business. we're the leader at the intersection of three key trends shaping the future of shopping. the shift to online, the shift to social, and the shift to second hand.
we're unique from other marketplaces as we focus on growing our overall community of users to create hyper engagement and loyalty. these users activate as buyers and sellers, creating a virtual [inaudible] of growth, monetization, and strong cohort retention. the beauty of our social marketplace is that our users, who spend an average 27 minutes a day on our app, continue to engage and reengage over time, both as buyers and as sellers, fueling the high-velocity flywheel of organic growth. we reported a strong first quarter and grew our gmv end revenue by 43% and 42%, respectively to $441 million and $81 million, a testament to the strength of our cohorts even when faced with near-term disruption.
we delivered a fourth consecutive quarter of adjusted ebitda profitability with $4.2 million in adjusted ebitda and 5.2% in adjusted ebitda margin. our business model is built on the long-term retention of our cohorts. despite mid-quarter challenges due to weather and covid, our cohorts remain resilient as growth rates across states began to normalize and converge once again in the second half of march, as our community express increased optimism about economic conditions and real things. in march, shoppers want aspirational items that they look forward to showing off once the weather improves and restrictions started to lift.
top-performing secondhand categories by sales were crop tops, up 101%; thick-knees, up 86%; jean shorts, up 85%; and hatch-up 71% year over year. in march, we announced a tv and marketing campaign with marie kondo, the master of tidying up, decluttering, and organization. a campaign focused on the emotional connection we have with clothing and the value of resale and secondhand. it featured marie kondo encouraging consumers to give new life to items they have loved from their closet by listing them on poshmark, allowing the items to spark joy for someone new.
we're optimistic that as consumers begin to leave their homes and engage in social activities once again, there will be demand for a different wardrobe from the stay-at-home outfits that prevailed in 2020. pent-up demand for apparel could drive more frequent in a wider range of apparel and accessory purchases, benefiting our marketplace. re-enter 2021 as a public company with a business that is stronger than ever, driven in large part by great execution of our four growth strategies. our first strategy is to focus on product innovation to continue driving user engagement which is fundamental to the retention of our user cohorts and gmv growth.
in march, we completed the full rollout of video listings which allowed sellers to add videos directly into their listings, providing new ways to market their products, drive traffic to their closets, and engage with potential buyers. we see video commerce as the next generation of e-commerce. in our marketplace, video drives increased engagement, both views and likes and conversion, particularly, with younger customers who've been the first to adopt video as a form of self-expression. in april, we started highlighting listing videos and the use of feature to help sellers increase the visibility of their listings.
our sellers are excited about this feature and they're starting to update their listings to include video. so far, the most popular categories for videos are dresses, bags, jewelry, makeup, and toys. though still early, we're excited about this feature and we'll share more details as we continue to evolve and grow adoption of video commerce. growing our international footprint is a second key strategic focus and we plan to invest ahead of revenue.
we're excited about the opportunity ahead in australia and have just begun investing in marketing to grow the userbase. our market research indicates that australians have $5 billion worth of unused clothes, shoes, and accessories in their wardrobes. our study found 79% of shoppers bought from online stores in 2020. however, nearly 60% of the items they bought went unworn.
in fact, we found that there were at least $500 worth of unused fashion items in the average australian's wardrobe and 54% of those surveyed felt guilty throwing those pieces out. poshmark provides australians with a simple, social, and sustainable way to keep those items circulating. our top priority in australia is building the poshmark community and one of our first major activations was launching a celebrity charity closet with serena williams in march, with proceeds going to black dog institute to support mental health research and suicide prevention for australia's first-nations people. while still too early to provide much detail, australia has seen great use of buyer and seller growth since our february launch.
our third strategy is to go to category expansion. we launched back in february to address the style needs of the entire family. we have seen that attract new sellers and buyers to the platform, demonstrating the scalability of our model. as expected, supply and demand is dominated by dog and cat style items from clothing to collars and leashes, and the majority of these are non-branded, some of which are even handmade.
though still early, we're excited for the growth potential of the pets category and our excitement is shared by our community with positive feedback and high volumes of user-generated pets content. our fourth strategy is to deliver robust easy-to-use and effective seller services to help sellers market and sell their product offerings. our social market base makes it very easy for anyone to sell and we provide incredible demand-generation services to attract shoppers to sellers listings. in mid-march, we completed the rollout of sellers shipping discounts, a new feature which gives sellers the ability to list items with discounted shipping that they began testing in january.
previously, shipping discounts were only available through private negotiations and offers. we now have more shipping tiers: no discount, the first level of discount, the second level of discount, and free shipping. all tiers provide expedited priority usps shipping one to three days. currently, about 7% of listings offer discounted shipping, adoption rate has been highest for the highest price-point items.
since the introduction of sellers shipping discounts, we have seen increased engagement as repeat listeners and posh ambassadors, both of whom have adopted this feature at a higher rate, revisit existing listings to add shipping discounts. in mid-april, we introduced icons in review and listing details to indicate items that have discounted or free shipping, which has begun to positively impact conversion and order rates. in april, we introduced two new seller tools, style tags, and price suggester in the listing process. styled tags give sellers the option to use three relevant phrases to describe the items design, aesthetic, material, and more, enhancing the ability for buyers to search for relevant products.
these include things like handmade tie-dyed cotton. we also launched price adjuster to help sellers, especially new listers list items more efficiently by providing a suggested price range for their listings. as these tools have just launched, we'll share more details on our next earnings call. our community is the heart and soul of poshmark.
together, we make buying and selling simple, social, and sustainable. we're committed to helping our sellers succeed and have begun accepting applications for our heart & hustle community fund. every day, poshmark sellers turn their passion into profit by creating new brands, sharing their style, and connecting with shoppers. to help them get closer to their goals, whether that's making extra money, scaling their business, supporting the circular economy, or turning a side hustle into something bigger, we want to recognize and empower them.
our new fund is one of the ways will do that. in conclusion, we had a strong first quarter and start to 2021, where the poshmark team once again executed well for the benefit of the entire community. we believe that poshmark has an incredibly compelling growth potential for years and decades to come, be of high conviction around making the investments that are going to allow us to achieve that full potential. poshmark will continue to be a place where you can save money, make money, and find human connection.
and with that, i'll turn it over to anan.
anan kashyap -- chief financial officer
thank you, everyone for joining us. our first quarter was another great quarter as we delivered strong gmv revenue and our fourth consecutive quarter of operating profitability. our business model is built on the long-term retention of our cohorts which we demonstrated in 2020, during an extraordinary year due to covid. during the first quarter of 2021, even when faced with near-term disruptions, our cohorts have remained resilient as growth rates began to normalize in the second half of march, as economic conditions and weather improved.
our robust cohorts helped us generate $441 million gmv in the first quarter of 2021, which was 43% growth from $309 million in the first quarter of 2020. commensurately, net revenues were $81 million in the first quarter of 2021, which was 42% growth from $57 million in the first quarter of 2020. this was driven by an increase in gmv in the first quarter of 2021, an overall growth of our community, including an 18% growth in active buyers to 6.7 million from 5.79 million in the first quarter of 2020. our take rate was 18.4%, which is down slightly from last year's 18.5%, a result of higher-than-expected delayed or canceled orders, resulting partially from severe weather conditions in february.
cost of revenues was $13 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 31% from the first quarter of 2020, and decreased to 16.1% of revenues due to some leverage in hosting expenses. therefore, adjusted gross margin which is net revenue less cost of net revenue, improved to 1.2% to 83.9% of revenues in the current period, as compared to the first quarter of 2020. marketing expenditure, excluding stock-based compensation was $32 million in the first quarter of 2021, a decrease of 6% from the first quarter of 2020. marketing was 40% of net revenue in the first quarter of 2021, down significantly from 60% of net revenue in the first quarter of 2020, due to rationalizing our marketing spend to focus on strong roi user acquisition channels.
we invested in upper funnel strategy such a more targeted tv, as well as, influencer marketing. in march, we launched a unique partnership with tudying master, marie kondo with two new tv ad to drive more listing activity and build brand visibility. moving to operating expenses. operations and support, excluding stock-based compensation was $13 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 15.7% of revenues, up from 14.7% last year.
we experienced an increase in credit as a result of shipping delays from the holiday and severe weather conditions during the quarter. during this unprecedented time, we had to increase hiring across the team to support customer need and maintain our excellence in customer service. research and development, excluding stock-based compensation was $8 million in the first quarter and decreased to 10.1% of revenues from 11.5% last year, mainly due to slower hiring than planned. hiring accelerated throughout the back half of the quarter, so we do not expect the first-quarter leverage to persist.
in fact, we expect to double down and invest additional resources across a number of key initiatives, including international expansion. g&a excluding stock-based compensation was $11 million in the first quarter, an increase to 13.3% percent of revenues from 11.7% last year, mainly due to the additional ongoing costs of being a public company, including annual audit cost, which was primarily incurred during the first quarter, as well as, greater-than-expected premiums for d&o insurance that we discussed in our last earnings call. stock-based compensation was $20.4 million in the first quarter in 2021, an increase from $1.8 million last year. first-quarter 2021 stock-based compensation included $22.3 million from restricted stock units, of which $15.6 million was a one-time cumulative expense due to the accelerated vesting of our restricted stock units upon the ipo in january.
we delivered adjusted ebitda, which excludes stock-based compensation of $4 million with adjusted ebitda margins of 5.2%, compared to the loss of $9 million and negative 15.2% margins in the first quarter of 2020. the majority of the profitability improvement was driven by strong revenue growth and our decision to lower our marketing investment, as compared to the prior year. as we have discussed before, the remainder of 2021 we will prudently invest in marketing in the future as we did in the first quarter, but with a continued focus on growth and margins. operating income excluding stock-based compensation was $3 million in the first quarter of 2021, with operating margins of 4.2%, which is a meaningful change as compared to the loss of $9 million or negative 16.4% margins in the first quarter of 2020.
similar to the improvement and adjusted ebitda, the increase in income from operations was driven primarily by strong revenue growth and a decrease in marketing expense. due to the transition from a private company to a public company, we incurred gaap non-cash other expenses due to the higher share price impact on changes in fair values of our convertible warrants and the loss on extinguishment of our convertible notes. thus, we believe that excluding all non-cash one-time capital structure expenses, resulting from our ipo in january, our net income is a better indicator of our operating performance. first-quarter 2021 non-gaap net loss to common stockholders was $21 million that excludes non-cash expenses of $54 million.
this was due to the loss on conversion of our convertible notes into common stock upon the completion of the ipo and change in fair value of preferred stock warrants. the $50 million convertible notes were converted into 1.4 million shares at a price of $35.70, a 15% discount to our ipo price of $42. however, due to the timing of the settlement of shares which occurred at the closing of the ipo, three businesses after pricing, we had to record a non-cash accounting loss of $51 million, of which, $49.5 million was due to the increase in the fair market value of the stock to $74.90 the closing price on january 19th, as well as, the loss on extinguishment on the debt of $1.6 million. in addition, we had a $3 million loss due to a change in fair value of convertible preferred stock warrants, also due to the increase in the fair market value of our common stock share price.
excluding the combined impact of these non-cash expenses, non-gaap loss per share to common stockholders was $0.33. beginning in the second quarter, we no longer have these non-cash capital structure expenses, as all of our convertible securities were converted into common stock at the closing of our ipo in january. cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $575 million as of march 31st 2021. during the first-quarter 2021, we completed our ipo, raising $297 million net of underwriting discount and commissions.
in addition, all 52 million shares were convertible preferred stock were converted into class b common shares at the ipo. as we look ahead and think about capital allocation and use of cash, our number one priority is using our strong balance sheet to position us to invest in growth and strategic investments to drive long-term growth internationally. moving to the cash flow statement for the three months ended march 31st 2021, free cash flow was $19 million, compared to $1 million for the first three months ended in 2020. our strong cash-flow generation significantly strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity.
looking ahead, we think the customers' inherent desire to socialize and resume normal activity, combined with their interest in retail should drive demand for apparel going forward which would benefit our marketplace. we expect second-quarter revenues of $79 million to $81 million, resulting in a growth rate of 18% to 21%, taking into consideration difficult comparisons against 41% year-over-year growth last year. our revenue guidance reflects 59% to 61% growth on a two-year stack basis and acceleration from the two-year stack growth of 50% in the first quarter. we expect our second-quarter take rate to be similar to the first quarter due to slightly higher cancellation rates.
we expect to remain profitable with the second-quarter ebitda of $1.5 million to $2.5 million, as we continue to focus on balancing growth and profitability when investing in marketing. adjusted gross margin performance during the first-quarter 2021 was ahead of our initial expectations, benefiting from lower-transaction processing costs and leveraging our hosting costs. the remainder of 2021, we expect adjusted gross margin to be similar to 2020 levels due to normalization and closing expenses. we expect operations and support in the second quarter to be a little higher as a percentage of revenue than the first quarter due to the higher costs of managing shipping and logistics.
we expect r&d expenses in the second quarter to increase as a percentage of revenues from the first quarter, as we increase the pace of hiring to support our continued product innovation and international expansion. we expect g&a expenses as a percentage of revenue for the remainder of the year to be similar to the first quarter due to public company expenses. we will remain disciplined with our roi-based approach and expect marketing as a percentage of revenues in the low 40s in 2021 to grow users and support the launch of geographic expansion and categories. we believe there is still a large opportunity before us and so we plan to invest in building the brand, grow our user community, and international and category expansion.
we continue to see very strong gmv retention due to our social model which drives engagement and repeat transactions. these cohorts have been both resilient and have high residual value after the initial year of acquisition. thus, we're confident that the growing engagement of our user cohorts will enable us to deliver consistent growth over the long-term. overall, we believe we have executed very well during a challenging environment with the focus on the safety for our employees, supporting our community, and driving efficiency in our operations.
thank you. and i will now turn the call over to the operator, so we can take our questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and your first question comes from the line of ross sandler from barclays. your line is open.
ross sandler -- barclays -- analyst
hey, one for manish and one for anan. manish, and first one, just a question about retention and frequency right now. for the most recent cohorts compared to what you're seeing last year during covid, the [inaudible] guide is kind of flattish q on q and there was the stimulus benefit in march and then you had the texas and new york issues that you flagged last quarter. just, how do we think about if we strip all that noise out, the underlying kind of sequential cadence and how retention is trending? and then on australia, i know it's early, but just any color on, how we should think about the cadence of that region ramping up, compared to maybe how canada ramped up in the -- in the early quarters? like, any a reason why that would be a little faster or a little slower? that's it, guys.
thanks a lot.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
sure. so in terms of the overall retention of our cohorts, it's actually pretty stable and continues to be very stable when you measured it across the quarter. even though there were some variations within the quarter and we see very, very stable retention across all of our cohorts, as well as, growth on all of that cohort. so i think the predictability and sort of the convergence as we pointed out in the call is back.
so we expect to see pretty healthy sort of movement of the cohorts as we go into q2 and beyond. and certainly, remain optimistic as the economy opens up, it could provide a positive sort of uplift as people go out and engage with fashion and engage with sort of the outdoor activities. australia is early, shaping up well despite sort of having to launch the country in a very remote way from here and we haven't seen the team or the community in the early days. it's shaping up sort of in the normal healthy development of the buyers and sellers and the users.
anan kashyap -- chief financial officer
yeah. just one additional point i want to make, ross, is that you know, we typically don't see this outsized quarter-over-quarter growth from q1 to q2. so when we talk about the guiding toward a $79 million to $81 million, it's a 59% to 62% growth on a two-year stack basis, which is an acceleration of 50% from the first quarter. so you know and we're still, obviously, extremely optimistic about how the quarter is going to go, but it's also important to remember we're remaining profitable throughout all of this as well.
so that dynamic is obviously great for us long-term.
operator
your next question comes from the line of lauren schenk from morgan stanley. your line is open.
nathan feather -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, this is nathan feather on for lauren. just two quick ones from me. can you talk about how average order value trend in the quarter, given some of the early success of seller shipping discounts, particularly on higher-value items. and then also you noted hiring came in a bit below your expectations and r&d.
can you just talk us through why that was? and i know you mentioned hiring was accelerating that cost back up to your plan. thank you.
anan kashyap -- chief financial officer
yeah. so on an average order value, we actually seen it basically remain relatively stable throughout the last few months. you know, the seller shipping i think has been a positive impact for conversion in general. and how we think about it is, you know, sellers ultimately dictate the pricing, both on that item, as well as, the shipping.
and so we think this is just another tool for them over the long-term. you know, as far as r&d hiring, two things i think are sort of interesting. we actually started the quarter with very sort of positive momentum, but when it came down to actually the timing of when people were hired, it was -- it ended up being more back-end loaded toward the end of the quarter and so we started catching up toward the end. but as you can imagine, just the dynamics of the ramp from the beginning to the end the quarter was what caused the numbers to be a little bit lower.
but for us, you know, r&d is a very critical investment, especially in terms of product innovation. so as you can see from the pace of features that we're launching, it's a major area of investment for us and will be something that will continue for the remainder of the year.
operator
your next question comes from the line of ralph schackart from william blair. your line is open.
ralph schackart -- william blair & company -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for taking the question. i know the strong trend and the gmv i know you talked about kind of reacceleration in q2 in a tier-stack basis. just curious how much of that was turning to strength in the business? i know there's some stimulus in there and maybe some tough comparers or some comparability issues due to covid last year, but just love your overall thoughts on that.
that's the first question. you know, if i get add-on, as you think about your non-apparel vertical such as beauty, home, and pet, maneesh, i think you talked about pet bringing buyers to the platform. we just love your thoughts in terms of, you know, are these new categories also adding to gmv at this point? thanks so much.
anan kashyap -- chief financial officer
yeah, just -- maybe we'll talk about the overarching dynamics of stimulus last year and this year. as you can imagine, last year in the first quarter was weak for us right around when covid hit around the end of sort of the end of february and the beginning of march. and if you look at the second quarter, we actually had great quarter with reacceleration of the business to 40% growth and so that was, part of the reason why the comp is actually a little bit higher for us this year. as far as, you know, stimulus and how we think about it, look at the positive uplift for consumers, the economy, and numerous businesses, we think it's really a true testament to the strength of our cohorts which overcame some mid-quarter challenges due to weather and covid and remains resilient, and we actually saw the states actually begun to -- begin to normalize and converge once again in the second half of march.
now it's impossible to determine the -- to separate the exact impact of stimulus. the timing also coincided with a rival's spring and optimism about reopenings. the second is also, we can produce a number of great seller tools in march, the video listing, seller discounted shipping which have also positively impacted the business. so we think that innovation is one of the key drivers of growth is, why we continue invest there.
so we think long-term the consumers desire to socialize and resume normal activities to drive demand for apparel going forward which should benefit the marketplace. and i'll let manish talk about --
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
sure. yeah, i think that all of the categories are already starting to drive gmv growth, as well as, listing scope. the expansion in categories, both in direct apparel and beyond apparel, for us brings in growth from two different perspectives. one is it activates new buyers and sellers on the platform.
and second is, it gives existing buyers and sellers new ways to sell and shop on the platform. so it sort of drives in on both dimensions and reaching positive impacts of these categories on both of those fronts in terms of driving growth, and ultimately, gmv per buyer.
ralph schackart -- william blair & company -- analyst
great. thanks, manish. thanks, anan.
operator
your next question comes from the line of aaron kessler from raymond james. your line is open.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thanks, guys. one, can you talk about how many from the advertising side, any expected impact from idfa and also another retailer mentioned that recently. and second just maybe, are you seeing kind of increased interest from brands or vendors as well? thank you.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
sure. so idfa is of course, going to have a shift in spend and channel mix for the short-term over the long-term. you know, it's a little bit unknown how it sort of shifts the overall mix for us because we have focused on a very diverse set of marketing channels. it allows us to rebalance the spend and continue to focus on growth despite the short-term shift of the advertising landscape overall.
operator
[operator instructions]
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
aaron, can you reapeat the second question again?
operator
[operator instructions] and he has not re -- i'm sorry. he just requeued up now. your line is open.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
thank you. sorry. the second question is on the brands and kind of vendors, are you seeing kind of increased interest from -- from them as well? or just any update there? thank you.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
absolutely. so you have to continue to experiment pretty aggressively brands we believe that the size and scale of our community have the interest on brand on, both retail and social commerce, makes the partnership with them inhabitable for poshmark. and we continue to do pretty aggressive experiments and experimentation there. nothing specific to announce right now, but a lot of good work going on there.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from line of oliver chen from cowen. your line is open.
oliver chen -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi, thank you. as we look ahead to the active buyer growth, should we expect it to be in the high teens or maybe accelerate as some of the growth comparisons ease? and as you think about the marketing spend for the balance of the year, how are you thinking about the composition as you referred to upper funnel and also the global opportunities that you're addressing as well?
anan kashyap -- chief financial officer
yeah. so i'll start with -- i'll start with the kind of upper funnel dynamics and sort of marketing in general for the year. but the main thing i would say is, you know, as manish mentioned, one of the important strategies for us is, to actually be very diversified, both from a upper funnel, as well as, kind of purely transactional basis. and what we've found is that, by allowing that flexibility, we can shift depending on what we see with idfa or any other sort of disruption in the marketing ecosystem.
so how we think about it is, you know, we've got a tremendous roi-based approach which is focused on a payback of about two years and that continues to be our modus operandi. and the only time that that shift as you think about kind of international expansion opportunities around canada and we've launched australia, obviously, where those payback periods are usually extended as we are essentially investing in those markets. hopefully, that answers your question.
oliver chen -- cowen and company -- analyst
that's very helpful. and active buyers, what are your thoughts on how that may proceed through the year?
anan kashyap -- chief financial officer
yeah. so i think we -- we haven't really guided toward active buyers in our commentary. i think, you know, what we would normally expect that to be relatively in line with overall growth of the business. you know, there may be some differentiations when it comes to certain markets, but today that that dynamic is very consistent, as compared to overarching gmv and revenue growth.
oliver chen -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you. and lastly, a big bigger picture, as the competition does get more competitive in resale. why would the customer choose to list on poshmark versus others. could you speak to the defensibility of your take rate? thank you.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
sure. you know, first of all, i think as the market for resale is growing, we're sort of seeing -- we feel getting adopted in every single dimension with a [inaudible] adopting it, marketplaces are adopting it which is exciting. so we think of resale as a massive expanding opportunity which paves the way for our own sort of scaling and expansion. and for us from day one, we have been the simplest and the most social and the most engaging way for people to buy and sell fashion and fashion-related, style-related products, and that continues to be our core focus.
our take rate has also been consistent since we started the company. we've partnered with sellers since day one. haven't taken it up and haven't taken it down, it's been a very consistent partnership and we continue to maintain that partnership as we build out the product. what we have done is in that same partnership, is added tremendous level of services for our seller and buyers over that time, whether it is adding things like posh post posh authenticate or adding listing videos, seller discounts, other seller tools, etc.
so we continue to show our core community of buyers and sellers on all different dimensions, bringing the best engaging online experience, the best social experience. and that we believe is, ultimately, the key to our growth, our long-term growth, but also key to a successful partnership with our seller community.
oliver chen -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you, very helpful. best regards.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
and your next question comes from the line of ron josey from jmp securities. your line is open.
ron josey -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. i had two. you know, you talked about sellers shipping discounts now live and the four shipping cures.
can you give us some updates or talk to us about his conversion rates you're seeing across the fourth [inaudible]. the use cases that a seller might use when they offer discounts from from zero to call it, fully discounted and what that means, the conversion rates? and i ask this in reference to, i guess, the question just ask now from oliver around just as seller tools and newer services that you're offering. so conversion rates or asking about conversion rates on shipping. and then lastly, another question on just category expansion.
you know, it's a key focus for posh and it's great to hear pets are bringing new users and sellers to the platform. let's talk a little bit more about what we might look forward to for categories this year and next? thank you.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
so sellers shipping discounts, when you think of the different players and tiers we offer, it's really a tool for sellers to decide how they want to price their product. do they want to build more of the margin and the core price and then offer a shipping discount? or sort of use those two knobs continuously and sellers are still playing with it. we're seeing increased adoption, but i feel that there is significant potential for much more adoption in the marketplace. and typically, you'll see free shipping being added to the place where the pricing can sustain a free-shipping margin and then lower shipping discounts available for a couple of different tiers.
a lot of sellers are starting to experiment with at least the basic tier of discounting to offer value to their shoppers, as shoppers are used to different kinds of shipping out there. so we see that happening. really, the place where shipping discounts ultimately have a positive impact to the sellers is, the speed with which they clear that item. so it touched on sort of their sell through rate and the speed of timing, and that's been very positive to measure of there.
we'll continue to build more and more seller goods to both help them promote and market that. so for example, one of the things we recently launched is, the ability for shoppers to filters by different seller discounts over time. the second question that you asked about categories, if you think about focus for categories, it has been categories that are really put it into your style and your best in categories that particularly foster discovery more than just [inaudible]. so you start to see as expanding from -- our original focus was women then we expanded to mens, kids, home, beauty, and most recently, pet.
so you should see adjust in categories that express an individual style, and ultimately, lead to more discovery-oriented architecture. and that's sort of going to be a our goal mantra in terms of helping them out a full category portfolio on poshmark.

manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
thanks, christine. hello and welcome, everyone. thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. before i share a recap of our q2 performance, i'd like to take a moment to welcome poshmark's newest board member, ebony beckwith, whose appointment we announced yesterday.
ebony is chief philanthropy officer at salesforce and the ceo of the salesforce foundation. she is a powerhouse leader, who brings deep experience across technology, operations and philanthropy, and a deep connection to the brand as an avid posher, who joined the poshmark community in 2014. i'm absolutely delighted to welcome a member of our community to the board. and even more so, i'm also excited about the impact she will have on our company, our community, our culture, and our mission as we empower consumers around the world and shape the future of shopping.
now turning to our q2 results. we remain focused on this executing of our long-term growth strategies and delivered another strong quarter. we grew gmv and revenue by 25% and 22%, respectively, to $450 million and $82 million. due to the reliability and strength of cohorts and despite difficult comparisons, we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of adjusted ebitda profitability with $6.1 million in adjusted ebitda and 7.4% in adjusted ebitda margin.
our asset-light model holds no inventory, leading to some consistent high gross margins, resulting in a scalable and profitable business with a highly engaged community in loyal cohorts. our community of sellers is both dynamic and flexible, keeping our marketplace constantly refresh with curated merchandise that reflects current and emerging trends and lifestyle preferences. in the second quarter, our sellers were once again the forefront of an ever-changing fashion landscape, staying ahead of emerging trends such as '90s and y2k styles. our marketplace is highly adaptable and incredibly responsive to our buyer's changing demands for either staying at home or for going out, and supply it just almost instantaneously.
thus, we are confident that we can navigate any potential future impact from the delta variant, as is evidenced by the resilience of cohorts, which delivered strong financial performance during covid last year and so far in 2021. one of the reasons that we have such a loyal and engaged community is our commitment to making selling on poshmark as simple as possible. we do this through robust tools that enable broad distribution of sellers' listings to the buyers everywhere. in may, we announced a partnership with snapchat, which went live on july 8 to all u.s.
snapchat users. through poshmark mini, snapchat users can now engage with their poshmark community, our 10 virtual posh parties, shop our entire catalog of merchandise, and easily search for top trending brands and styles in poshmark, all within snapchat. the poshmark mini will introduce millions of the new shoppers to poshmark while deepening our relationship with gen z, who are an important fast-growing part of community. gen z makes up 77% of daily active players using poshmark mini on snapchat.
our business remains stronger than ever, driven by continued progress of our four growth strategies. our first strategy is to focus on product innovation to also continue driving user engagement, which is fundamental to the retention of our user cohorts and gmv growth. and to enhance the buyer experience, we introduced buyer alerts, a new feature that sends a notification when a listing you have liked receives an offer from another buyer. the item you like was purchased by someone else, we will direct you to similar listings for identical items.
we've seen an increase in listing views, engagement and the order conversion rates as a result of this new enhancement, which puts power in the buyer's hands and that creates a more personalized and curated shopping experience. expanding our international footprint is our second key strategic focus, and we continue to invest ahead of them. i'm happy to announce we've recently hired a new vice president of international, sylvie de wever, who will lead the international growth and expansion plans as we bring the poshmark social shopping experience to consumers around the world. prior to poshmark, sylvie served as ebay's general manager of latin america, where she helped launched the scale of the business, and was also instrumental in expanding the footprint in emerging markets.
i look forward to partnering with sylvie and our international team to accelerate poshmark's expansion into new markets. and in the second quarter, we celebrated poshmark canada's two-year anniversary. our thriving community has grown to more than 2.5 million canadians, who are engaged in more than 1 billion of social interactions and listing nearly half a billion dollars worth of inventory since launch. our success in canada provided a playbook for launching poshmark in australia, which has seen great user, buyer and seller growth since our feb launch.
we are also focused on the -- aggressively growing our australian community and continue to invest in marketing to grow our user base. so as you may have seen last week, we announced that india will be the next stop in our global expansion strategy. india is one of the fastest-growing e-commerce markets in the world and has a vibrant culture of resale, thrifting, and pre-loved shopping. we have hired a country general manager and continue to build out our team on the ground.
we have also begun the process of building community and supply to the data phase of development. and on behalf of myself, my co-founders and the team posh, we're overwhelmed with joy to bring poshmark to india. our third strategy is to go through category expansion. we've launched art & design as two new subcategories under the home department and as a natural extension to address the styles of our community.
we have seen art & design attract new styles and sellers to the platform, demonstrating the scalability of our model and view these new categories as the foundation for building our handmade artisan business for poshmark sellers. our forward strategy is to deliver the -- innovative, easy-to-use, and effective seller services to help sellers market, merchandise and sell in their listings. in april, we introduced style tags, a powerful new search and discovery tool that allows our sellers to merchandise and market their listings by style and trends and provides buyers with new ways to shop beyond their usual brand preferences. if, for example, a buyer is shopping for y2k looks, they can now simply follow y2k as a trend, which also greatly expands their ability to find and track relevant listing start with that.
similar to how buyers can follow brands such as gucci or lululemon, they can now follow these emerging trends such as '90s or bohemia. in june, 28% of sellers use style tags, and a result, we saw increase in daily listing views and buyer engagement with these listings. and though early, we believe that shopping by style and trends is the way consumers want to shop and poshmark style tags will help drive conversion over time. we also launched price suggester to help sellers, especially new sellers list items more effectively in providing a suggested price range for their listing.
this new feature not only helps to drive new supply, it also positively impact sell-through rates as it increases the percentage of products are poised to sell in our marketplace. as early pioneers of social commerce, we're always innovating core marketplace functionalities to make it easy for sellers to engage with shoppers and grow their sales. at the end of june, we launched four powerful bulk listing tools that take social selling to a whole new level for poshmark sellers with these large closets. the new features allow sellers to share multiple listings at once, make closet pipe price adjustment and execute multiple offers like us all at once driving our productivity, engagement and sales.
our seller community is also responding enthusiastically to this new time-saving functionality. since day 1, our sellers have been the heart of the poshmark community, and the heart & hustle community fund is an important step in recognizing, rewarding and empowering our diverse seller community. in june, we awarded 142 sellers with $125,000 in brands to help support their business goals. from our dollar balancing full-time business while caring for our sick mother to a college student paying for tuition, this is just one of the ways we support our seller community so that everyone can try.
to experience the vibrancy of the poshmark community, i invite you to join us in october at posh fest, our annual two-day conference, where community members connect, network and learn how to grow and succeed by selling on poshmark. as many consumers return to work and school in fall and engage in more social activities, we expect new apparel purchase to accurate and the demand for a different type of wardrobe to emerge from the quarantine outputs that prevailed in 2020. in addition, the seismic shift in fashion currently underway is expected to unleash pent-up demand for apparel that we believe lasts for several years, driving more frequent and a wide range of lifestyle purchases benefiting our marketplace. now i want to take a moment to thank anan for being my friend and partner for the last five years, helping us scale the business more than 10 times from $160 million in gmv in 2015 to over $1.6 billion in trailing 12 months gmv as of the second quarter and taking us public.
his numerous contributions have helped lay the foundation for consistent revenue growth and continued margin expansion in the years to come. i'm confident in the strong finance team that anan has built, and truly appreciate the role he has played in positioning poshmark for long-term success. with support from a leading executive search firm, the board and i have initiated a search for a new cfo. in the meantime, i'm pleased to announce that our vp of finance, kapil agrawal, will become interim cfo.
kapil has been with poshmark for the last five years, leading finance, strategy and corporate development. kapil brings a decade of leadership experience in strategy, financial planning, and business analysis at fortune 500 companies, including uber and capital one. on behalf of the entire board, management team and poshmark, anan, you will be greatly missed, and we wish you the best of life in your future endeavors. we appreciate that you are staying on as an advisor until the end of the year to help ensure a smooth transition with the next cfo.
and with that, i'll turn it over to anan. 
anan kashyap -- chief financial officer
thank you, manish. i appreciate the kind words. i'm incredibly thankful to have been part of such an exceptional team over the last five years, a time in which poshmark has executed a number of transformative steps in its growth strategy. the next stage of poshmark's development is now solidly underway, and i have complete confidence that poshmark has a strategy and team in place to capture the enormous opportunities ahead of it.
i'm excited to hand the baton to kapil, who was my first hire and has been my partner for the last five years, helping us drive growth, reach profitability, and build the finance team. as manish mentioned, our second quarter was another great quarter as we delivered strong gmv and revenue, building upon the continued demand trends we saw in the first quarter as consumers remain focused on buying apparel for different events in their lives, and we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of operating profitability. during the second quarter 2021, our cohorts have remained resilient and helped us generate $450 million in gmv in the second quarter of 2021, which was 25% growth from $360 million in the second quarter of 2020 or 67% growth on a two-year stack basis, an acceleration from the two-year stack growth of 52% in the first quarter. commensurately, net revenues were $82 million in the second quarter 2021, which was 22% growth from $67 million in the second quarter of 2020 or 63% growth on a two-year stack basis, an acceleration from the two-year stack growth of 50% in the first quarter.
this is driven by an increase in gmv in the second quarter of 2021 and strong growth in our community, including a 16% growth in the trailing 12-month active buyers to 7 million from 6 million in the second quarter of 2020 and a 15% increase in trailing 12-month gmv for trailing 12 months' active buyer. our take rate was 18.2%, which is down slightly from last year's 18.6% due to a mix shift to more orders greater than $15. orders that are less than $15 have a higher take rate due to the flat fee of $2.95. cancellation rates peaked in april and improved and stabilized as the quarter progressed.
cost of revenues was $13 million in the second quarter of 2021, an increase of 19% from the second quarter of 2020 but a decrease of 15.6% of revenues from 16% last year due to nonrecurring credit in transaction payment processing. therefore, our adjusted gross margin, which is net revenue less cost of net revenue improved 0.4% to 84.4% of revenues in the current period as compared to second quarter of 2020. marketing expense, excluding stock-based compensation, was $32 million in the second quarter of 2021, a 139% increase from $11 million in the second quarter of 2020, where we dramatically reduced marketing spend in response to the covid crisis. marketing was 38.7% of net revenue in the second quarter of 2021 and was slightly below our plan of low 40.
during the second quarter, similar to others who use digital marketing, we began to see the impact of idfa, which effectively increased the cost of mobile advertising due to less efficacy when running targeted marketing programs. since our marketing mix is highly diversified and adaptable, we adjusted by focusing on strong roi user acquisition channels as well as investing in upper funnel strategies such as tv and influence of partnerships to counter the effect of idfa. moving to operating expenses. operations and support, excluding stock-based compensation, was $12 million in the second quarter of 2021, an increase of 34% from the second quarter of 2020.
ops and support improved to 14.8% of revenues from 15.7% in first quarter, but was up from 13.5% in the second quarter of 2021. the improvement was due to lower issued customer credit as usps shipping congestion eased and we had a onetime reversal of credits. research and development, excluding stock-based compensation, was $9 million in the second quarter, up 43% from second quarter of 2020. r&d increased 11.4% of revenues from 10.1% in first quarter of 2021 and from 9.8% in second quarter 2020.
this was due to the planned increase in the hiring we have previously discussed as we invest additional resources across a number of key initiatives, including product innovation, improved platform functionality and international expansion such our most recent india launch. g&a, excluding stock-based compensation, was $10 million in the second quarter, up 74% from the second quarter of 2020, increasing to 11.9% of revenues. this improved from 15.3% of revenues in the first quarter of 2021 due to lower non-personnel costs, but was higher than 8.4% last year due to additional ongoing cost of being a public company. stock-based compensation was $8.1 million in the second quarter of 2021, an increase from $1.7 million last year, mainly due to performance-based vesting of outstanding rsus upon completion of our ipo in january 2021.
we delivered adjusted ebitda, which excludes stock-based compensation of $6.1 million with adjusted ebitda margins of 7.4%, up from 5.2% in q1, compared to $23.7 million and 35.4% margin in the second quarter of 2020. the decrease in profitability was primarily driven by an increase in marketing investment as compared to the prior year, where we lowered our marketing spend during the initial onset of covid-19. as we've discussed before, for the remainder of 2021, we will prudently invest in marketing in the future as we did in the second quarter but with a continued focus on growth and margins. operating income, excluding stock-based compensation, was $5 million in the second quarter 2021 with operating margin of 6.4% compared to $23 million with margins of 34.4% in the second quarter of 2020.
second quarter 2021 net loss to common was $3 million, compared to $11 million in income last year. cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $579 million as of june 30, 2021. as we think about capital allocation, our no.1 priority is using our strong balance sheet to make strategic investments to drive long-term growth internationally. moving to the cash flow statement for the six months ended june 30, 2021, free cash flow was $24 million, compared to $33 million for the first six months ended in 2020.
our strong cash flow generation significantly strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity. we expect third quarter revenues of $81 million to $83 million, resulting in a growth rate of 18% to 21%, taking into consideration difficult comparisons against 38% year-over-year growth last year. our revenue guidance reflects 56% to 59% growth on a two-year stack basis. we expect our third quarter take rate to be similar to last year due to an improvement in cancellation rates from the first half of the year.
we expect to remain profitable with third quarter ebitda of $1 million to $2 million as we continue to focus on balancing growth and profitability while investing in marketing. adjusted gross margin during the second quarter of 2021 was ahead of our initial expectations. and for the remainder of 2021, we expect adjusted gross margin to be similar to 2020 levels due to normalization of hosting expenses. we expect operations and support in the third quarter to be similar as a percentage of revenue to the first quarter.
r&d expenses in the third quarter are expected to increase as a percentage of revenues from the second quarter as we continue to increase our investment in international expansion and product innovation. for the remainder of the year, g&a expenses as a percentage of revenue should be similar to the first quarter. due to the timing of different public company expenses, we continue to expect marketing as a percentage of revenues to be in the low 40 in the remainder of 2021 as we grow users, support geographic expansion, and launch new categories. we will continue to invest in a highly diversified mix of channels and expect the impact of idfa to normalize throughout the year.
our marketplace is adaptable, as evidenced by the resilience of our cohorts and our strong financial performance during covid last year. looking ahead, we think that consumers' inherent desire to socialize and resume normal activity, combined with the interest in resale, should drive demand for apparel going forward, which should benefit our marketplace. we remain very excited both about our opportunities in the u.s. as well as our global expansion into canada, australia, and india.
and finally, before we begin q&a, i would like to thank manish for trusting me five years ago and giving me the opportunity to build poshmark into a dynamic social marketplace that empowers millions of our loyal poshers. i've had the pleasure of working closely with some of the most talented individuals in my career. and to them, i would like to say thank you for your partnership, your [inaudible] and your kindness. and i'm going to continue being poshmark's biggest supporter and look forward to following manish and the poshmark team continue building a truly global marketplace that puts people at the heart of commerce.
thank you, and i will now turn the call over to the operator so we can take your questions.

operator
[operator instructions] we have the first question come from the line of lauren schenk of morgan stanley. your line is now open. you may ask your question.
lauren schenk -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks. i wanted to dig into international a little bit, curious if there's anything you can share on how the australia launch is going thus far? and then just on the india announcement sort of the marketing strategy around that, if there's any color on unit economics you can share there. i know it's still early.
and then lastly, i think the u.k. is sort of the other big market you had talked about entering this year, what sort of the expected time line of that launch as well? thanks so much.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
lauren, thanks for the question. this is manish. number one, for australia, we're seeing the metrics continue to be very healthy. the community is performing very well.
the monetization per buyer, etc., all of those metrics are trending in absolutely the right direction. it's only four or five months since the launch, so we expect the marketplace to continue to evolve in a positive direction. india, the plan is to take it live in this quarter. we just sort of announced the pre-launch phase of the product.
our general economic strategy there is very congruent with our other markets, but we'll get more data as we get experience in that market over the next few quarters. and then broadly, what you've seen as this year has launched australia, launched india and we'll continue to sort of march to the other countries starting -- continuing with sort of english language countries and then going beyond that. i can't comment on the specific plans, but broadly, that's sort of our strategy. and canada also continues to move in a very healthy direction, broadly speaking.
lauren schenk -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. we have the next question comes from the line of oliver chen of cowen. your line is now open. you may ask your question.
oliver chen -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. thank you very much. apparel and apparel performance, we were curious about apparel in relation to frequency of purchase and any observations you've had about the back-to-school season? have you noticed changes in consumer behavior? my second question is in relation to new active buyers and your additions this quarter. what do you think is the right level for new buyer numbers that we should think about going forward? thank you very much.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
on the back-to-school side, it's a little too early to comment because we're just in that season right now. but broadly, we are seeing the health of the cohorts and sort of all of the cohorts shaping up very much in line with history and continue to scale up in terms of stacking up and the growth and the health of the cohorts. i'll let anan comment a little bit on the active buyers.
anan kashyap -- chief financial officer
yes. so thank you for the question. no, we don't ultimately dive too much toward active buyers but what i would say is that we normally expect active volume growth to be relatively in line with the overall growth of the business. as we've mentioned earlier, similar to others who've faced some of the challenges in digital marketing, we saw the impact of idfa at the end of the second quarter, which results in a little bit less efficacy when running kind of targeted marketing campaigns.
so we expect this to essentially continue in the third quarter. we have -- we do a very diversified and adaptable marketing mix and we adjusted as we went through the quarter, and we'll continue to do so. and we are currently investing a little bit more in some upper funnel strategies but we think all this should normalize by the time we get to the back half of the year, and especially into the fourth quarter. we think the impact of mobile is -- mobile advertising is real, but we will manage our roi thresholds to balance out especially growth and profitability.
oliver chen -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. thank you. and on the reopening as well as the volatility we're experiencing with delta, what about the apparel category? and what have you been seeing with category trends that have been interesting to you? anan, it's been great working with you as well.
anan kashyap -- chief financial officer
thank you.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
yes, thank you, oliver. on the apparel trends, what we are seeing is really the adaptability of the marketplace toward the market demand. so a few things we saw in q2 was the surge in sandals, mini-dresses, and blouses. again, all congruent as people plan to start going out.
we also saw some of the vintage trends like y2k and '90s come back in a strong wave across the platform. and as we go into fall, we expect, again, the market to respond, both in terms of going out, going to school, but also i think the delta variant will continue to sort of put a twist on the fashion and fashion demand. but broadly, the apparel demand was extremely healthy, and we saw our category mix in line with our historical data.
oliver chen -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you very much. best regards.
operator
[operator instructions] next question, we have a line of ralph schackart of william blair. your line is now open. you may ask your question.
ralph schackart -- william blair & company -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for taking the question. two, if i could. first, just in the nonapparel categories, pet and home and beauty and on the others, just curious if you're still continuing or if you're seeing impact both on gmv as well as helping to attract new buyers and new sellers to the platform, and then i have a follow-up.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
yes. these categories are extremely attractive and it being able to both monetize existing buyers and sellers could also attract new buyers and sellers. and certainly, pets, which we launched in q1 has been a good magnet to continue to grow those areas. art & design mode at the subcategory level and -- just recently launched but yes, the categories have been generally very positive and accretive to buyers and sellers overall.
ralph schackart -- william blair & company -- analyst
great. and just on india, in particular, just given the opportunity with the population there. just, manish, maybe if you could share some color? just -- i know it's super early, but just any trends you're seeing there that gets you excited. and then assuming that trends remain positive there, how should we think about sort of the gmv per buyer there or aob? and could there be some potential downward pressure on that metric if india scales? and i guess, the reverse will be true potential upside to buyers if it takes off?
anan kashyap -- chief financial officer
well, i don't really have any data to share yet because the product is not fully launched yet. we're in the prelaunch phase, so really hard to share. i think generally, i would expect the gmv per buyer will be slightly lower than the average, but the number of buyers will be more just given the population of the mix and sort of that's the way to think about it. if you think about our gmv, it's a multiplier of number of [inaudible] gmv per buyer.
so that's sort of the way i think about it. but again, we'll have more to share in a couple of quarters once we get real data in the market. so far in australia, canada, and u.s.a. have been very, very similar in that characteristics.
ralph schackart -- william blair & company -- analyst
great. and, anan, best of luck in the next role.
anan kashyap -- chief financial officer
thank you, ralph. appreciate it.
operator
thank you. next question, we have the line from aaron kessler of raymond james. your line is now open. you may ask your question.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks. a couple of questions. maybe first, just if you can comment a little bit on the video uptake there that you're seeing from buyers and sellers? and then second, with the bulk of listings, actions, any updates there thus far, maybe traction? and does that open up to any more retailers or brands as well to more effectively sell in the platform? thank you.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
yes. so number one, the video continues to sort of see an uptick, and we continue to invest in embedding it in more and more places. you'll see it roll out more and more across the site as we gain confidence in its conversion ability as well as sort of just the engagement metrics that we are seeing come out of the video area. the bulk sharing tools have been extremely well received as sort of the bulk listing action tools for sharing, price tags, etc., and really open up our platform for a pretty large-scale resellers and certainly brands who want to participate in it as well.
so we continue to see that as a massive game-changer in our key enablement. and for the brands, we continue to partner and experiment with them. we don't have specific updates yet but as soon as we do, we'll definitely let you know, but we see that as an exciting opportunity. certainly, bulk listing is a powerful enabler of that market.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you. and i'll echo our comments. anan, great working with you.
anan kashyap -- chief financial officer
thank you, aaron.
operator
the next question comes from the line of ross sandler of barclays. your line is now open. you may ask your question.
ross sandler -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
hey, guys. just a question on the marketing efficiency comments. so it looks like you're guiding here, marketing is going to grow about 60% in the back half, and gmv or revs are growing closer to 20, buyers closer to high teens or so. so how much of that market investment is going to international versus sellers versus buyers? and if it's mostly international, is the ebitda margin in the u.s.
like comparable to kind of where we were last year, a little bit lower? any color on like where the margin pressure is coming from? and then similarly on retention, now you got these new categories, what does your retention look like now versus maybe pre-covid and during the peak last year this time? thank a lot.
anan kashyap -- chief financial officer
yes. thanks a lot, ross. great question on marketing. so if you recall last year, i think we were still coming out of the whole -- coming out of the covid crisis, and we spent only 17% of revenue on marketing in the second quarter, and we only increased it marginally in the third quarter.
and so that's the primary driver for what i would consider easier comp store from a marketing investment standpoint versus revenue growth overall. i think the structure of how we allocate spend between the countries is much more focused on roi. so in the u.s., especially, which is a market that we've been in for almost eight to 10 years, we have a very -- essentially called payback policy. so we like that to be approximately two years.
we're going to stay very disciplined on it. it's actually in the second quarter when we saw some issues with idfa. we essentially decided to reduce some of our investment in mobile advertising and shift it to other channels. i think the reality is that if you look at some of the newer markets, there is going to be a bit more investment ahead of revenue.
so india being the perfect example but even in australia. it's still very early stages in its development. canada, i would consider more middle stage. so we do have roi targets and thresholds for canada.
but in australia and india, the investment is a little bit heftier. so as a percentage of revenue, if you're looking -- thinking about it from a leverage standpoint, the u.s. is going to be lower than that, call it, 40 -- low 40s target we gave as a totality but the rest -- the remainder of the investment is really going international. and then as far as retention is concerned, look, the older cohorts continue to be very, very stable and continue to see very solid growth.
i think the category expansion is definitely helping. hard to say if that's the primary driver or really, it's the fact that we've got this great social ecosystem. and so we think of both being very sort of positive dynamics for us in the long term, and that's why we continue building products toward improving retention in the long term.
operator
thank you. we have the next question comes from the line of ron josey of jmp securities. your line is now open. you may ask your question.
ron josey -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question, anan. we'll miss you going forward, as you know. so, manish, i wanted to ask about delta.
i think you said poshmark is confident that it can manage any disruption. and so can you help us understand -- maybe unpack those comments, any insights on july, august gmv trends? of course, it would be helpful and/or maybe how you're thinking about growth on a two-year stack? that would be super helpful to understand your comments on managing through delta. and then i wanted to ask a little bit more about the snap partnership. i think i -- i think you said it launched this a month or two ago.
just talk about how this could play out. we're seeing a lot of adoption here for social commerce, and i think the snap mini is pretty fascinating. so any insights would be helpful. thank you.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
sure. so on the delta, when we sort of get into covid-related changes that are happening, it's hard to predict exactly how the world is going to shape up as we saw last year. the thing we do know is that our marketplace is pretty adaptable. so if you think about the core tenets of a market, which is online.
it's online, social, it's secondhand. so a lot of the inventory is coming from people who have the inventory to sell. you can sell from home, you can shop from home, you can ship from home. so all of those things allow us to be fairly robust in case people have to stay back at home or mingle and sort of order back and forth as the world is.
and even the variances aross the country in terms of the attitudes, that will be there. so that's really the strength we see in the core marketplace that has allowed us to manage through all of the different changes over the last 18 months or so that we've seen with covid and covid-related attitude or changes. so that's the confidence underlying that comes in. i think when you look at a two-year stack basis we shared for q1 and q2, we're looking at 52% for q1 gmv two-year stack and 67% for two-year stack on the gmv basis.
so we're seeing consistent growth across the cohorts and consistency there. and ultimately, it is that consistency and stacking of the cohorts, combined with the adaptive by the marketplace that gives us confidence going into q3 and facing sort of the uncertainty that broadly delta brings to the table.
ron josey -- jmp securities -- analyst
that's great. thank you, manish. very helpful. any thoughts on snap?
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
oh, yes. so snapchat is very exciting. i think for us, we think of ourselves technically in a super innovative sort of space and continue to invest in innovation across the board. if you go back all the way to when we started the company, we were the first people to bet 100% on iphone and mobile back in 2010, 2011 when everyone thought you needed a website.
so when you look at this new platform opening up with snapchat and posh winning on snapchat, it's an exciting place. the way we've designed it is that you can shop natively in snapchat on poshmark. you can shop the closets, you can shop the inventory, but you can also shop the virtual posh parties there and make the purchase directly there as well. so that's sort of how we see it.
and it's -- the idea is to open up poshmark to audiences and then bring them back into poshmark as a broader platform of engagement. and the early results show that a significant number of engagement -- amount of engagement we are seeing, over 77% of what they call active daily users or active daily players are gen z. and so that just continues to broaden the appeal of poshmark to different audiences overall. and we certainly see this approach as something that other platforms might take, and we'll be there to partner with them as we expand our footprint.

[operator instructions] thank you. i would now like to turn today's call over to christine chen, head of investor relations. please go ahead.
christine chen -- head of investor relations

and with that, i'll turn it over to manish. 
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
thanks, christine. hello, and welcome, everyone. thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. our vision for poshmark is to become the world's leading social marketplace and the no.
1 destination for sellers around the world. we're laser focused on making strategic investments that drive the continued growth of our business, give the best overall experience for sellers and make our marketplace the no. 1 most trusted destination for buyers. our social marketplace was built to support sellers of all sizes, and we want to empower each and every one of them to be successful while fueling a more circular shopping engine.
while we faced greater-than-expected headwinds during the third quarter due to idfa and apple privacy changes, we grew gmv and revenue year-over-year by 18% and 16%, respectively, to $442.5 million and $79.7 million despite difficult comparisons. on a two-year basis, gmv and revenue grew 64% and 59% year-over-year, respectively. we delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of adjusted ebitda profitability with $0.3 million in adjusted ebitda and 0.3% in adjusted ebitda margin, while increasing our marketing spend to counter the impact of apple privacy changes. investing in marketing and product innovation in the quarter helped drive 17% growth in ttm active buyers, up from 16% in the second quarter.
our asset-light model holds no inventory leading to consistent high gross margins of 85% in the third quarter, resulting in a scalable business with a highly engaged community of loyal cohorts. third quarter sales reflected poshmark as a go-to destination to source trends such as tiktok-inspired styles. searches for tiktok increased 1,500% over the last two years, and we have seen a surge in demand for brands that are trending with tiktok influencers. we grow the gmv of our marketplace by growing our overall community of users.
these users activate as buyers and sellers, creating a virtual flywheel of growth and monetization. when users join, they connect with each other through social interactions, which grew 37% year-over-year during ttm q3 '21 to 38.9 billion. our marketplace makes shopping online fun and interactive, and we continue to add features to increase engagement. accelerating growth while navigating the impact of apple privacy changes is our top priority, and we will continue to adjust our marketing strategy accordingly to grow gmv.
we began adjusting our marketing spend in the middle of q3 and have seen an early positive impact on october gmv growth. product innovation, category expansion, international growth and new seller tools build a foundation for driving gmv revenue and active buyer growth. we remain confident in the opportunities for accelerating future growth, driven by continued progress of these four growth strategies. first, we continue to focus on product innovation to drive user engagement, which is fundamental to the retention of our user cohorts and gmv growth.
at the end of july, to enhance the buyer experience, we expanded our partnership with affirm to include their split pay products for items between $50 and $200. as a result of this new pricing tier, we have seen an increase in aov and number of orders at these price points. since we completed the full rollout of buyer alerts at the end of second quarter, we have seen an increase in listing views, engagement, order conversion and incremental daily gmv. this enhancement creates an urgency to buy for items with competing offers and creates a more personalized and curated shopping experience by merchandising similar or identical items to the buyer when the item they like has been sold.
we recognize the importance of premium-priced products in the resale market and have seen strong growth in this category, with $200-plus items now representing in the low 20s as a percentage of gmv, up from 17% in 2019. last month, we completed our milestone first acquisition of suede one, a new york city-based sneaker authentication platform that combines machine learning technologies, computer vision and human expertise to conduct virtual authentication. this will build more trust and loyalty with our shoppers, create a more efficient and sustainable approach to authentication and help accelerate growth in sneaker and luxury categories. expanding our international footprint is our second key strategic focus, and we continue to invest ahead of revenue.
in mid-september, we launched poshmark india as our first marketplace in asia. the indian market has over 622 million active internet users and a rapidly growing base of sustainability and value-conscious consumers who seek a more socially connected experience, particularly gen z and millennials. india is an ideal fit for our unique social commerce model, both from a cultural and business perspective. though still very early, india is off to a strong start with higher-than-expected user growth as we begin building the community.
growing gmv through category expansion is our third strategy. with the launch of our brand closets program, we're opening our social marketplace to large-scale brands and retailers, allowing brands to directly connect, converse with and sell to poshmark's community of over 80 million users with a suite of social merchandising tools. our social commerce platform allows us to bring rich insights about fashion trends and real-time data about consumer interest to our brand closet partners, helping them reach new audiences, including millennials and gen z. some brands have a larger following on poshmark than their own social media channels.
and 79% of our buyers have purchased a brand for the first time on poshmark. we already have 140-plus community brands using brand closets to reach our 80 million registered users. some have built their entire brand using poshmark. we have piloted brand closets with a few large-scale brands since 2020, developing a full-scale program that offers the features a large brand needs to thrive on poshmark.
we're excited about this new program as more brands see the value of social commerce and circular models, and we see brand closets as an important inflection point as we work together to shape the future of shopping. delivering innovative, easy to use and effective seller services to help sellers market, merchandise and sell their listings is core to our strategy. our co-founder, tracy sun, is now officially leading a new organization at poshmark that is exclusively dedicated to empowering our sellers, anticipating their needs and innovating to bring fresh ideas, solutions and tools that will help them grow and scale their businesses. sellers are the heart of poshmark community, keeping our marketplace constantly refreshed with curated merchandise that reflects current and emerging trends and lifestyle preferences.
the four powerful bulk listing tools that we launched at the end of june have helped sellers improve their sales productivity. during the third quarter, we saw a strong adoption of these tools with professional sellers having the highest adoption rate of 30%. professional sellers who adopted bulk actions show a higher increase in sales, driven by an increase in orders than did listers who did not use bulk actions. we see continued opportunity for increased adoption of this feature to drive gmv growth.
we also introduced a new slate of tools to help sellers replicate the best part of client service when shopping in our physical boutique. this includes my shoppers, a social selling and clienteling tool that is unique to poshmark; closet insights, providing sellers with real-time data on their sales and inventory; direct messaging, allowing sellers to communicate directly with their buyers; and a new gold badge in the posh ambassador program to recognize and reward outstanding members of our seller community. we announced these new product enhancements in october at our ninth annual poshfest, our conference where our vibrant and passionate community members connect, network and learn how to grow and succeed by selling on poshmark. attendees of the virtual event came from all 50 states, guam, puerto rico, canada, australia, india, the netherlands, u.k., mexico, spain and colombia, evidence of the global appeal and reach of our community.
our highly engaged community gives us the confidence that we will be able to navigate near-term headwinds, and we will continue to adjust our marketing to accelerate growth. as we celebrate poshmark's tenth anniversary next month, we believe that our business model is tailor-made to thrive in the current environment. because our millions of sellers are constantly listing new products, our market base is highly adaptable and incredibly responsive to buyers' changing demands, and were not impacted by supply chain disruptions. we're optimistic that this holiday season, consumers will once again attend events and see friends and family, all reasons that drive demand for apparel and accessory purchases with the potential for more self-gifting and gift-giving.
our resale marketplace enable shoppers to rotate styles, mix trends and give a second life to items, contributing to a more sustainable fashion ethos for consumers. and with that, i will turn it over to kapil.
kapil agrawal -- chief financial officer
thank you, manish. as manish mentioned, despite difficult comparisons and the headwinds of apple privacy changes, we delivered solid gmv and revenue growth year-over-year and our sixth consecutive quarter of adjusted ebitda profitability. during the third quarter of 2021, our cohorts have remained resilient and helped us generate $442.5 million in gmv, which was 18% growth from $375.4 million in the third quarter of 2020, a 64% growth on a two-year basis. net revenues were $79.7 million in the third quarter of 2021, which was 16% growth from $68.8 million in the third quarter of 2020 or 59% growth on a two-year basis.
this was driven by a 17% growth in ttm active buyers to 7.3 million from 6.2 million in the third quarter of 2020, up from 15% in the second quarter. our take rate was 18%, which is down slightly from last year's 18.3% due to continued mix shift to more orders greater than $15 as orders less than $15 have higher take rates due to the flat fee of $2.95. cost of revenue was $12.1 million in the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 6% from the third quarter of 2020 but a decrease to 15.2% of revenues from 16.5% last year due to a nonrecurring credit in payment processing fees. therefore, adjusted gross margin improved by 1.3% to 84.8% of revenue in the current period as compared to the third quarter of 2020.
marketing, excluding stock-based compensation, or sbc, was $35.4 million in the third quarter of 2021, an 89% increase from $18.8 million in the third quarter of 2020 when we dramatically reduced marketing spend in response to the covid charges. on a two-year basis, marketing only grew 6% from q3 2019 to q3 2021. during the third quarter, similar to others who use digital marketing, we continue to see the impact of apple privacy changes. since our marketing mix is highly diversified and nimble, we adjusted by focusing on strong roi user acquisition channels, as well as investing in upper funnel strategies such as tv and creative partnerships to counter the effect of idfa.
marketing was 44.5% of net revenue in the third quarter of 2021 as we increased spending during the later part of the quarter to navigate the impact of apple privacy changes. the increased investment in marketing also accelerated the growth rate of ttm active buyers to 17% in the third quarter, up from 16% in the second quarter. moving to other operating expenses. ops and support, excluding sbc, was $12.4 million in the third quarter of 2021, similar to the second quarter.
ops and support was slightly lower than expected and was 15.6% of revenues, up from 14.5% in the third quarter last year. r&d, excluding sbc, was $9.2 million in the third quarter, similar to the second quarter. r&d was 11.5% of revenues, up from 10.4% of revenues in the third quarter of 2020. this was due to the planned increase in hiring we have previously discussed as we continue to invest in additional resources across a number of key strategic initiatives.
g&a, excluding sbc of $10.3 million in the third quarter, was similar to the second quarter and was slightly lower than expected due to fewer in-person events and lower travel costs. g&a was 12.9% of revenues, up from 9.5% in the third quarter last year due to the ongoing cost of being a public company. stock-based compensation was $6.7 million in the third quarter of 2021, an increase from $2.6 million last year, mainly due to performance-based vesting of outstanding rsus upon completion of our ipo in january 2021. we generated adjusted ebitda, which excludes sbc of $0.3 million with adjusted ebitda margin of 0.3%, as compared to $15 million and 21.9% margin in the third quarter of 2020.
the decrease in profitability was driven by an increase in marketing investment as compared to the last year where we significantly lowered our marketing spend during the initial onset of covid-19. as we have discussed before, for the remainder of 2021, we'll continue to invest in marketing to accelerate gmv growth. operating loss, excluding sbc, was negative $0.6 million in the third quarter of 2021 with operating margins of negative 0.7%, compared to $14.3 million with margins of 20.8% in the third quarter of 2020. third quarter 2021 net loss to common was negative $7.2 million, compared to $8.1 million in income last year.
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $589 million at the end of the third quarter 2021. as you think about capital allocation, our no. 1 priority is using our strong balance sheet to make strategic investments to drive long-term growth. moving to the cash flow statement.
for the nine months ended september 30, 2021, free cash flow was $31.3 million, compared to $67.1 million for the first nine months ended in 2020. our strong cash flow generation significantly strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity. we expect fourth quarter revenues of $80 million to $82 million, resulting in a growth rate of 15% to 18%. we have seen early signs of the positive impact of increased marketing investment that we started in the third quarter with accelerated jv growth in october.
similar to third quarter, we expect to see a pressure on our fourth quarter take rate from last year as we expect continued mix shift to orders greater than $15. in addition, we anticipate that usps will once again experience logistics disruption during the holidays as the shift to e-commerce outpaced its capacity. we expect negative ebitda of $7 million to $8 million in the fourth quarter as we continue to invest in marketing to accelerate top line growth while navigating the impact of apple privacy changes. adjusted gross margin during the third quarter of 2021 was ahead of our initial expectations.
and for the remainder of 2021, we expect adjusted gross margin to be similar to 2020 levels due to the absence of nonrecurring credits in payment processing fees. we expect ops and support, excluding sbc in the fourth quarter as a percentage of revenue, to be slightly higher than last year due to anticipated logistical challenges faced by usps during the holiday season. r&d, excluding sbc, in the fourth quarter is expected to increase as a percentage of revenues from last year as we continue to increase our investment in product innovation to accelerate growth. for the remainder of the year, g&a, excluding sbc as a percentage of revenue, should be higher than last year due to the ongoing cost of being a public company.
we expect marketing, excluding sbc, as a percentage of revenues to be in the high 40s due to higher cost in digital advertising as a result of apple privacy changes. our asset-light, high gross margin business and consistent behavior of our cohorts gives us the confidence that we will be able to adapt to the changes in the digital advertising landscape by investing in marketing now to accelerate growth. we will be disciplined in our marketing investments. and our diversified marketing mix will enable us to build our user base to grow active buyers, which will put us in a stronger position in the long term.
we expect that uncertainty due to covid and its effect on reopening time lines across international markets launched in 2021 will result in a slower ramp-up than what we had initially expected for next year, impacting growth rates. but we would expect growth next year to accelerate from the current quarter as we begin to benefit from our investment in marketing, category expansion and the launch of brand closets. our social marketplace is nimble, as evidenced by the resilience of our cohorts. our asset-light model holds no inventory to supply highly responsive to buyers' changing demands, positioning us well to thrive in the current environment.
we have a long runway of growth ahead, fueled by the execution of our growth strategies and our relentless focus on building a more seamless, more social and more secular way to shop. thank you. and i will now turn the call over to the operator so we can take your questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of lauren schenk with morgan stanley. your line is open.
nathaniel feather -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. you've got nathan feather on for lauren. just one in mind, i guess, trying to figure out a little bit more on the impact of idfa to some of the kpi [inaudible]. i would have assumed that would have had the most impact on active buyer growth, but that did accelerate in the quarter.
so can you just talk about how idfa was impacting kind of gmv and revenue growth? or is it really more kind of a new user getting in the door impact? thank you.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
thanks. the thing with idfa is it has really increased the cost of digital advertising and decreased the efficacy when running targeted marketing programs. and so for us, being a data-driven organization, we spent june and july really measuring the roi and figuring out what the right level of spend is. and in fact, if you recall in the last call, we actually decreased our marketing spend at the end of second quarter to allow our marketing team time to assess how to navigate apple privacy and efficiency.
once we sort of realized where the right level of spend was, we increased our marketing spend starting in the second half of the third quarter. and that's when we saw an acceleration in ttm active buyer growth of 17%, and we've seen an early positive impact of october gmv and -- because of this increased marketing spend. so really, the dynamics started on the positive side a little bit later in the quarter.
nathaniel feather -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. great. that's helpful. and then can you just give an update on how things are progressing with the poshmark mini app integration into snapchat?
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
sure. yeah. so snap and poshmark partnership continues to be a really great partnership, which allows our sellers' inventory to be distributed inside snapchat and brings snapchat users to poshmark inventory natively in snapchat. as you know, snapchat has a predominant community of gen zers.
so this is obviously a very relevant and very fast-growing part of our community. gen z makes up 77% of daily active players using poshmark mini. and our goal is to really make poshmark ubiquitously available. you see that on all the platforms.
you see that in the browsers. and certainly, snap is an important platform for reaching young consumers who seek a more social and sustainable way to shop. so we continue to make good progress there in terms of just penetrating that and scaling that.
nathaniel feather -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of ross sandler with barclays. your line is open.
unknown speaker
this is thomas on for ross. any high-level comments on retention, given the uptick in marketing as a percent of gmv? is this going to remarketing previous cohorts or new customers? any color here is pretty helpful. thanks.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
yeah. when we think of marketing, we really think of it in two buckets, either new user acquisition to drive growth. and really, that comes from organic growth, word-of-mouth sellers and then direct response advertising. direct response is both google and facebook and certainly other channels out there, but those are the most dominant ones.
and then the third is brand awareness, which is tv and creators and influencers out there. now if you think of these channels, some of these channels drive both new growth, as well as retained growth. if we think of purely marketing to retention, it comes predominantly through our own channels, email notification, vlogs, social, events, posh parties or whether our social network. so when we think of our overall growth strategy, we think of that mix, that sort of impacts that healthy mix between focusing on new user growth and the older user growth.
the cost per user on the new user side was definitely the most impacted in terms of the apple privacy changes and idfa.
operator
your next question comes from ralph schackart with william blair. your line is open.
ralph schackart -- william blair -- analyst
there's been a lot sort of talked about on idfa and industrywide cacs have gone up pretty significantly. so just curious how your cac has trended relative to what's going on in the industry with these recent changes and then sort of your current thoughts on ltv to cac. as you look forward, do you think you'll be able to sort of get back to where you were historically? or do you think this will take some time to sort of grind through? and i have a follow-up question.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
yeah. look, i think as it's no surprise, our costs have gone up. and when we think of how we invest in it, ultimately, we rely on our long-term behavior of cohorts and our high gross margin business, which allows us to recoup these costs. certainly, we've represented and we've talked about how we have thought in terms of payback period, which has been in that two-year time frame.
in order to accelerate the spend in growth, we have to give a little bit of leeway to our marketing team to do that, and it will impact our payback periods temporarily. but when we think of the long term, we have successfully navigated several different digital advertising landscape changes over the last few years. going all the way back to 2018, facebook had changed its algorithm if you remember in q2 of 2018. and it took us about a year, year and a half to sort of digest that cost and normalize it and get that to normal pay period.
last year, google went through search changes, and that was also a pretty fast revectoring. idfa is changing -- taking a little bit more time to digest, both on our revectoring and our partner's revectoring, but we expect, over time, it will get normalized and we'll be able to rebalance to our normal payback periods.
ralph schackart -- william blair -- analyst
great. and just a follow-up, if i could, please. just in terms of the guide that calls for negative ebitda. is that a reflection of what you're seeing in the current market environment with idfa? and if so, how should we think about that sort of investment period going forward into 2022? and i guess a bolt-on to that question is there was some commentary about slower growth in 2022.
i apologize if i missed it, if you could just sort of repeat some of that commentary, i'd really appreciate it. thank you.
kapil agrawal -- chief financial officer
thanks, ralph. so there are two key assumptions which are driving our ebitda guidance for the fourth quarter. first is we are increasing our marketing investment from mid-40s in the third quarter to high 40s to counter the impact of idfa and to accelerate gmv growth. and second, similar to what we saw last year, we expect potential disruptions at usps due to the influx of online shopping over the holidays.
and that could result in higher ops and support cost as we want to maintain our high level of customer service during the peak holiday season. and as far as 2022 is considered, ralph, it's too early for us to give an outlook on 2022 as we are in the middle of our planning cycle. but given our strong balance sheet, we'll continue to invest in marketing next year to accelerate our top line growth.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
the only thing, i think, which we did talk a little bit about, ralph, which i want to just reemphasize is the fact that we are counting on these non-u.s. and canada markets to have a slower ramp to sort of becoming critical to our business. so that's the one thing we are asking you not to sort of include in your 2022 assumptions. because of covid, these markets have taken time.
they're seeing early signs of good engagement, etc. but we want to be just much more cautious about factoring them too much into 2022 growth.
ralph schackart -- william blair -- analyst
ok. was that relative to the commentary about slower 2022 growth as i think i understood during the prepared remarks?
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
yeah. it's mostly around that. yeah. yeah.
on the core side, we actually expect it to grow -- to accelerate from q3 levels.
ralph schackart -- william blair -- analyst
ok. so it's just the covid impacts from some of the international markets then?
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
yeah. in terms of -- i mean, you're seeing different countries sort of behave differently. i mean i was just reading and -- sadly about germany's conditions right now. so each market is just sort of in a different trajectory overall.
ralph schackart -- william blair -- analyst
understood. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from oliver chen with cowen. your line is open.
katy hallberg -- cowen and company -- analyst
this is katy hallberg on for oliver chen. i would just love a little bit more details on the learnings from your launch in india now that it's been several months. and then i have a follow-up after that.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
sure, absolutely. we launched india in mid-september and really been thrilled by the vibrancy of the market. tremendous potential there, 622 million active users and a rapidly growing base of sustainable and value-conscious consumer. we're seeing strong user engagement, and actually, user growth is ahead of plan there.
and we are seeing good listings growth, good sort of engagement overall. so for us, when we see a country which is slightly different than, say, canada and australia has some very specific local dynamics and see the market sort of thrive, it's very encouraging about the universal appeal of our model. and i think india is still readjusting from covid. so that sort of -- that impact is still there.
but overall, the core social flywheel is very well in progress and showing very good traction in india.
katy hallberg -- cowen and company -- analyst
that's great. thank you so much. and then i would just love to know a little bit more about the trends across categories. if you could just speak to home and pet or non-apparel versus apparel.
and then specifically, just a little bit more on women's apparel would be much appreciated. thank you.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
could you repeat the last question again?
katy hallberg -- cowen and company -- analyst
just a little bit more detail on the trends across the categories. so non-apparel versus apparel, and specifically, how did women's apparel look in q3? thank you.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
do you have the data? let me try to see what we can share on that front. but broadly, when we think of sort of the newer categories, they continue to take hold very well, particularly pets, which we launched in q2. we've seen an acceleration in non-apparel categories for sure, including sneakers and handbags. but on the apparel side, can we get that data? so just to give you a sense that non-apparel categories were 6% of gmv in 2020 and have sort of scaled to 6% in the third quarter of 2021.
so they're sort of at that same level.
katy hallberg -- cowen and company -- analyst

your next question comes from aaron kessler with raymond james. your line is open.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you. a couple of questions. maybe just first on the brand closets program.
can you talk a little bit about the rollout of this, kind of the go-to-market strategy and maybe list how brands will deal with logistics there as well? thank you.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks. super excited about the growth opportunity with brand closets, as brands can interact and sell to our community of over 80 million registered users, helping them reach new customers. one of the great things about brands selling new items on poshmark are that they are participating in a very different shopping ecosystem.
it's an ecosystem where items can have multiple lives, exchange hands many time over through features like reposh and continue to get resold. many brands have a larger following in poshmark than their own social media channels, and that's sort of one of the interesting factors that they look at. the other thing is we bring brands to new buyers. 79% of our buyers have purchased a brand for the first time on poshmark.
we currently have a handful of large brands who are active on our platform, free people, lucky brand, doses of color and hue. we've seen interest in brand project-wise significantly since our announcements, and we are in active discussion with several other large brands. we have about 140-plus smaller brands using our brand closet program. and ultimately, the brand closet program brings all of the social tools that we have, but adds to it enterprise integration, as well as giving them extra traffic with the brand closet -- a button -- official brand closet button on their brand pages and allows them to leverage the fan base that they have in poshmark for their brands to get new distribution, new buyers, but also reconnect with buyers that they have.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst

your next question is from the line of roxanne meyer with mkm partners. your line is open.
roxanne meyer -- mkm partners -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. my question was on your other big initiative, suede one. i was wondering if you could elaborate on your strategy to go after a more luxury market, how you see the ramp there.
and any -- what kind of time and further investment you might need to communicate the authentication and to gain the trust of your customer base? thanks a lot.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
we're excited about the suede one acquisition, which really gives us an extra tool to sort of expand our authentication from where it is, which is at the $500-plus price point to lower price points, but also brings special expertise to authenticating sneakers. we recognize the importance of these premium-priced products, particularly in the resale market. and we've seen strong growth in this category of these $200-plus items. they now represent in low 20s as a percent of gmv, up from 17% in 2019.
when we think of this milestone acquisition and its integration into our platform, it ultimately allows us to broaden that trust and safety to a much wider price point than we could do with physical authentication. we've just closed the acquisition in fourth quarter of 2021. we expect it to go live in 2022 in our platform. it's preliminary to give sort of the full impact, but we should have some more progress on it in 2022.
roxanne meyer -- mkm partners -- analyst

your next question is from the line of tom nikic with wedbush securities.
tom nikic -- wedbush securities -- analyst
good afternoon. i want to ask about the marketing cost ratio. so that was mid-40s in q3, high 40s for q4. is that -- do you think that high 40s rate for q4 represents a high watermark? and as you start to maybe reap some of the benefits of the accelerated investment in the back half of 2021, maybe you can step off the gas pedal a little bit next year? or do you think you're going to have to keep accelerating the marketing investment beyond q4?
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
i think the honest answer to that is simply that there's a little bit of uncertainty. we were hoping that idfa would balance by end of q4. it's taking a little bit longer. so once we sort of see that rebalancing, yes, we should be able to take the foot off the pedal.
but for now, just given our strong balance sheet, our asset-light model, strength of our cohort, we don't want to slow down on growth as we sort of navigate through this idfa challenge. so that's sort of the answer. it's not something that we want to do. it's something we are doing to counteract the impact of just higher user costs in the short term.
operator
your next question comes from the line of brian mcnamara with berenberg capital. your line is open.
brian mcnamara -- berenberg bank -- analyst
thank you for taking the question. i guess just a follow-up on the last question. i guess, can you just talk in layman's terms of how you expect the idfa to balance, as you said? and what gives you confidence that growth will reaccelerate after you work through the marketing efficacy issues? thanks.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
sure. a couple of things. i think whenever we have sort of looked at rebalancing out of marketing resistance, it boils down to what you are -- going to the customers of how you're marketing to it, using the strength of our community word-of-mouth and sort of leveraging the organic impact of all the paid marketing that we do. and third is rebalancing it across channels, whether it's top of the funnel channels like awareness channel or creator channels out there.
so those are the ways in which we have traditionally sort of rebalanced out whenever one specific channel becomes exceptionally impacted. the second thing is the platforms themselves, whether you look at sort of any of the social platforms or mobile platforms, are also actively rebalancing that. and we expect that to also have a benefit on our side. we're not counting on it.
we're counting more on the work that we are doing on our side to counteract the impact of this change.
brian mcnamara -- berenberg bank -- analyst
thanks. and just a quick follow-up. i mean the stock hasn't performed well on your kind of first three or four earnings reports out of the gate. i'm just curious what should you leave long-term investors with in terms of something that should give confidence within the business moving forward? thank you.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
great question. i think, look, it's been definitely not a great sort of three, four quarters from a stock performance perspective. i think the foundation of the business is very solid. when you think of the community we have, the users we have, the scale of the business and high gross margin.
and for us, when we look into the future, we see a future that is all of the trends that we are investing in are actually shaping the future of shopping. certainly, as a marketplace, we are asset-light, so we can respond to trends in apparel and all these things, changes happening. second is we continue to invest in innovation, which allows our sellers and shoppers to connect faster and sellers to sell faster. and third is continue to diversify the people who can sell on the platform.
last two years, for apparel, for accessory, for fashion, have not been linear in any way. we've stopped going out. we're sort of just starting to reintegrate with society. we start and then have to stop again.
so all of this volatility has not made for a great sort of apparel climate. but despite that, we've done pretty well in growing for the last few years. so as you look into the next year, as the world opens up and normal social activities resume, there should be a lot more excitement as we look into that. so that's, i think, ultimately the foundation of an asset-light model, social model, second-hand, reuse and high gross margin should give investors the confidence that over the long term, this is a great company to own.
brian mcnamara -- berenberg bank -- analyst
great. thank you.

[operator instructions] your next question comes from anna andreeva with needham. your line is open.
anna andreeva -- needham and company -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. we wanted to follow up on the take rate. was a little bit lower than what you had expected, and you talked about the mix shift to the higher-priced items.
could you maybe talk about how we should think about the take rates as we look out for the next couple of quarters? and on that, maybe remind us what's the percentage of a professional as opposed to more cash-based seller percent of your seller community? just trying to think about the potential to monetize some of the seller services that you guys have been pivoting into? thank you so much.
kapil agrawal -- chief financial officer
our take rate came in at 18% in the third quarter, and that was due to an increase in orders greater than $15, which shifts this order mix away from orders below $15. and as a result, our blended take rate decreased slightly because of flat commission of $2.95 for orders below $15 generates a higher take rate. we do continue to see strong momentum in premium-priced items going at a faster rate than non-luxury items. and that was for q3.
now if we talk about q4, there are two factors which will tie our take rate in q4. one is continued mix shift to high-priced items, but also expected disruptions to usps during the holiday as the shift to e-commerce outpaces shipping capacity. and that will potentially increase cancellations similar to the fourth quarter last year. while disruption to usps are more seasonal and specific to fourth quarter, it's hard to predict mix shift too in 2022.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
and just to go to your question, anna, about professional services, we haven't broken down the split there, but there is definitely, as time has gone on over the last eight to nine years, a very significant presence of people who are using poshmark or selling in higher volumes. and some of the initiatives we've launched over the last year really recognize that. so when you think of tools like my shoppers, when you start to think of closet insights, etc., and certainly, they've been asking for more and more tools and many of them pay for third-party services. so there's definitely an opportunity there.
we haven't announced anything concrete, but that's definitely an area that people have been asking us for more and more tooling and more and more services as they scale their business on poshmark. so the whole professional reseller community has become a pretty mighty force in the retail universe.
anna andreeva -- needham and company -- analyst
that's great. and just as a quick follow-up. you mentioned the october gmv inflected, and you're doing something differently with the marketing upper funnel type of initiatives. can you just maybe dive into that a little more? and are there specific categories that are also driving that inflection? thank you so much.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
yeah. on the marketing side, i think we continue to balance out the various channels, but one of the channels that obviously is very, very active at the minute because trends are shifting constantly is the creator channel and the influencer channel. just to give you a couple of sense of specific trends that are happening, we saw, for example, retailer loungefly as sort of having a huge momentum and just that brand at a 99% growth in y-o-y sales on poshmark. and a lot of it is driven by they are focused on collectible backpacks, wallets and purses, driven by partnership with entertainment franchises like marvel, harry potter and star wars.
so that's sort of some of the trends you're seeing on poshmark in terms of what's driving the growth, and that's sort of part of that creator channel. if you look at the categories, we haven't seen any significant shift in categories in october so far. it continues to go well in line in trends for the q3.
anna andreeva -- needham and company -- analyst
ok. thank you so much, and best of luck for the holiday.

good afternoon. my name is emma, and i will be your conference operator today. at this time, i would like to welcome everyone to the poshmark fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. [operator instructions] after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.
[operator instructions] thank you. christine chen, head of investor relations, you may begin your conference.
christine chen -- head of investor relations
welcome to poshmark's fourth quarter and full year 2021 conference call. joining me today are manish chandra, our founder, chairman, and ceo; and rodrigo brumana, chief financial officer. please keep in mind that our remarks today include forward-looking statements such as statements related to our financial guidance and key drivers; the impact of covid-19 on our communities, business, and strategy; potential benefits of our marketing and product initiatives; and the anticipated return on our investments and their ability to drive growth. our actual results may differ materially than those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements.
forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties, which are described in today's earnings release and our filings with the sec, including our most recent annual report on form 10-k and subsequent filings. any forward-looking statements we make on this call are based on our beliefs and assumptions as of today, and we don't have any obligation to update them. also, during this call, we'll present gaap and non-gaap financial measures. a reconciliation of non-gaap to gaap measures is included in today's earnings release, which you can find on our ir website, along with the replay of this call.
and with that, i'll turn it over to manish. 
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
thanks, christine. hello and welcome, everyone. thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. i'm pleased to welcome rodrigo brumana, who joined us as our cfo in december.
he will take you through our fourth quarter and full year performance in a moment. but first, i wanted to share some of the key highlights. we had a very strong finish to a historic year for poshmark with record gmv and revenues. despite a very unpredictable and volatile environment globally, i'm pleased to report that we delivered our second year of operating profitability during our first year as a public company.
full year revenue grew 25% to $326 million, which on a two-year basis represents 59% growth. full year gmv grew 27% to $1.8 billion, which is 65% growth on a two-year basis. as we mentioned on our prior earnings call, we began adjusting our marketing spend in the middle of q3 and started seeing the positive impact on october gmv growth, which continued throughout our fourth quarter, resulting in record ttm active buyers of 7.6 million. throughout the year, consumers came to poshmark to discover and shop the latest trends, and this culminated in our strongest-ever holiday performance.
fourth quarter sales reflected poshmark as a go-to destination for self-gifting and unique gift-giving items as consumers celebrated the holidays by attending events and seeing family. we saw a surge in demand for luxury items with giftable accessory brands like van cleef & arpel up 890% and [inaudible] up 385%. we also saw spikes in dressed-up styles, with suits and blazers up 215% year over year and one-shoulder dresses up 92% year over year. while cold-weather staples such as puffers, ski suits, and uggs surged at the end of the quarter.
and we saw demand for one-of-a-kind, unique vintage items with searches for vintage up 42% in the fourth quarter. we continue to lead the three trends shaping the future of shopping: the shift to online, the shift to social, and the shift to second hand. our social marketplace is defining a new, more human way to shop online by making the shopping and discovery experience more interactive and social. for the year 2021, social interactions were up 47% year over year to more than 44.6 billion.
this social engagement drives community connection and conversion. one thing that distinguishes poshmark is that more than 80% of all purchases are preceded by social components such as a like, comment, or offer. execution of our four long-term growth strategies contributed to our strong fiscal performance and are the foundation for driving gmv, revenue, and active buyer growth. our strategies include category expansion, product innovation, new seller tools, and international growth.
first, we continue to focus on growing gmv through category expansion to increase share of wallet with consumers and grow our overall market share. we think of our category growth in two ways. core categories at all price points make up 93% of our gmv. our marketplace is a leading fashion destination, which is why women's, men's, and kids apparel make up 45% of gmv and is our largest category.
shoes are another 20%, bags are 18%, and accessories are the remaining 10%. we see opportunities to increase our wallet share with shoppers by focusing on our core segments, particularly in high growth categories such as affordable luxury like shoes and bags, as well as introducing new categories to make poshmark the shopping destination for all style needs. the balance of our gmv, 7%, comes from our expansion categories, which include beauty, home, toys and games, and now, pets and electronics, which we launched in 2021. gmv from premium-priced products, which we define as $200-plus items, has experienced more than one and a half times of growth of overall gmv, driven by bags and shoes in particular.
as a result, gmv contribution from these premium $200-plus items increased to the low 20s as a percentage of gmv in 2021. higher contribution from premium-priced products was one of the factors that drove higher aov to $40 in 2021, up from $35 in 2020. we are committed to growing our market share in premium-priced products, as evidenced by the strategic investment we made in suede one in the fourth quarter to expand our authentication services. we're strategic about our approach to categories and evaluate new additions based on fit, community demand, and potential tam while staying focused on keeping our marketplace fresh, relevant, and engaging.
because we are an asset-light model, we can enter a new category with minimal investment. ahead of the holiday season, we launched the electronics category, and we are encouraged by the uptick in new buyers and sellers who were attracted to poshmark's social shopping experience. thirty-five percent of electronic buyers are new buyers, and 18% of electronic sellers are first-time sellers. average aov of electronic items is higher than our overall aov.
initial demand has been strong, with video games plus consoles leading the pack, followed by media, cellphone and accessories, headphones, and cameras. while our expansion categories are still small, representing just 7% of gmv, they are growing faster than our core categories, and they are key to our long-term growth as we expand beyond apparel and accessories. another expansion area is our work with brand closets. since launching in october, we have delivered 6x monthly gmv growth and seen strong interest from large-scale brands and retailers.
signing on several more new partners, we're excited to directly connect with and sell to poshmark's community of more than 80 million registered users. these partners consistently share that poshmark's rich and real-time insights are valuable in helping them effectively address consumer preferences and reach new millennial and gen z audiences. second, we focus on product innovation to drive user engagement and buyer conversions, which is fundamental to the retention of our user cohorts and gmv growth. poshmark is a style destination where shoppers come to discover, follow, and shop for fashion.
in the fourth quarter, we began rolling out shop by trend, a new feature that strengthens searchability and engagement, contributing to the stickiness of our platform and user retention. we completed the full rollout in mid-january and are excited to see growth in daily page views, listing clicks, likes, and conversion. gen z shoppers on poshmark are increasingly shopping by trend, as evidenced by the growth in tiktok-driven trend searches. and we are excited to continue innovation in this area.
we're working to integrate our acquisition of suede one, a sneaker authentication platform that combines machine learning technologies, computer vision, and human expertise to conduct virtual authentication. we anticipate launching this capability later in 2022 on our social marketplace. ensuring authenticity and quality of supply will build more trust and loyalty with our shoppers, create a more efficient and sustainable approach to authentication, and could accelerate growth in sneakers and other premium-priced categories. since we expanded our partnership with a firm in the u.s.
to provide buy now, pay later at the end of july to the $50 to $200 price range, more of our listings are now eligible for pay-over-time solutions. we saw adoption of these options accelerate through the remainder of the year, helping drive faster gmv growth during the fourth quarter in the $50 to $200 price range and in the premium-priced items than the rest of the business. delivering innovative, easy-to-use, and effective services to help sellers market, merchandise, and sell their listings is core to our long-term growth. our sellers are the heart of the poshmark community.
casual sellers, which we define as those who generate less than $10,000 in gmv annually, represent the majority of our gmv. casual sellers often evolve to become pro sellers over time given the ease of monetizing their closets on our platform. while the growth and health of our casual seller cohorts continues to be important for poshmark, we are focused on growing our pro-seller base, those who contributed $10,000 or more, which experienced three times the growth in gmv in 2021 compared to casual sellers. at the end of october, we launched closet insights, providing our sellers with real-time data on their sales and inventory.
we also launched my shoppers, our crm for pro sellers that has driven gmv lift for those who have adopted it. we also saw continued strong adoption of our bulk listing tools in the fourth quarter. pro sellers have the highest adoption rate of 30%, and those who use bulk actions saw gmv lifts from increased orders. investing in seller-focused product innovation will continue to drive long-term gmv growth and marketplace differentiation.
finally, we are focused on enhancing our enterprise selling services to bring more professional sellers, brands, and retailers to our marketplace. this includes providing them with innovative tools and technology to help them grow in scale. expanding our international footprint is our fourth key strategic focus, and we continue to invest ahead of revenue for the long term. in 2021, international gmv grew 3x faster than the u.s., but from a much smaller base, driven by canada.
while our newer markets, australia and india, are important to our long-term growth, as we mentioned on our last call, we do not expect a meaningful contribution from these markets in 2022. our asset-light model enables us to seed new markets early, to establish a presence in the rapidly growing resale space, and nurture them over time, with minimum initial investment. as we look to our three-year anniversary in canada in 2022, the majority of our international investment will be focused on driving growth through advertising, community development, and shipping innovation. we're very excited to begin holding in-person events again across the country to strengthen community connections and accelerate growth in this market.
in conclusion, our vision for poshmark is to become the world's leading social marketplace and the no. 1 destination for sellers around the world. we're focused on making strategic investments that drive long-term growth, give the best overall experience for sellers, and make our marketplace the most trusted destination for buyers. our highly engaged community gives us confidence that we can navigate near-term headwinds, and we will continue to adjust our marketing to accelerate growth.
because our millions of sellers are constantly listing new products, our marketplace is highly adaptable and responsive to buyers' changing demands, and we are not impacted by supply chain disruptions. we're optimistic that beginning in 2022, consumers will once again attend events and see friends and family, unlocking pent-up demand for apparel and accessories purchases. our resale marketplace enables shoppers to rotate styles, mix trends, and give a second life to items, contributing to a more sustainable fashion ethos for consumers. now, i'd like to turn it over to rodrigo to dive deeper into the financials.
rodrigo brumana -- chief financial officer
thank you, manish, and to team posh for the warm welcome. having worked at four online marketplaces before poshmark, including ebay and, most recently, amazon, i am committed to bringing industry expertise and operating rigor to poshmark. i joined the company for two reasons. first, the social element that drives engagement, buyer and seller cross-pollination, and retention levels that i had not seen before in my career.
for instance, by year 5, there is over 40% overlap between buyers and sellers. in 2021, stacked buyer cohort retention was 104%, two points higher than in 2020. stacked seller cohort retention was 112%, up one point from the prior year. second, i adamantly believe in poshmark's mission and commitment to sustainable commerce.
poshmark is leading the way for a new model of sustainable commerce that resonates with today's consumers, especially gen z and millennials. i have spent my first 90 days doing deep dives into various aspects of our business, drawing upon my past experiences to increase the regrowth of our financial planning process and strengthening our business operations. i am excited by the many potential opportunities for future growth ahead. that's why my key priorities for 2022 are focusing on execution, growing our core business, and ensuring that our initiatives are properly funded.
we ended the year strong, with both fourth quarter revenues and ebitda coming in ahead of our guidance. gmv grew 27% to 490.8 million, up from 387.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, or 62% growth on a two-year basis, despite headwinds from apple privacy changes. as we mentioned on our prior earnings call, we began adjusting our marketing spend in the middle of q3 and started to see the positive impact on october gmv growth, which continued throughout the fourth quarter. net revenues grew 22% to 84.2 million, up from 69.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, or 55% growth on a two-year basis, and was ahead of our guidance of 80 million to 82 million.
this was driven by 17.3% growth in trailing 12 months active buyers to a record 7.6 million, up from 6.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. on a two-year basis, trailing 12 months active buyers grew 41%. our take rate in the fourth quarter was 17.2%, down from last year's rate of 17.9%, due to seasonal holiday cancelations and continued mix shift to more orders greater than $15. this [inaudible] should be a take-rate headwind as orders less than $15 have a higher take rate due to the flat fee of $2.95.
cost of revenues of 14.1 million in the fourth quarter was 16.7% of revenues, an increase of 21% on a year-over-year basis. adjusted gross margin was 83.3% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2021, flat from our fourth quarter of 2020. marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, or sbc, of 37.4 million in the fourth quarter, was 44.4% of revenues, up from 39.1% in the fourth quarter 2020. that's lower than our guidance of high 40s.
and marketing increased 38% from 27 million and in the fourth quarter of 2020. though, on a two-year basis, marketing only grew 4%. similar to other companies that use digital marketing, we continued to see the impact of apple privacy changes during the fourth quarter, as mobile represents about a third of our advertising spend and over 70% of our gmv. we continued to adapt our marketing investments to minimize the impact of idfa changes.
since our marketing mix is highly nimble, we adjusted by focusing on stronger roi user acquisition channels and invested in upper-funnel strategies such as tv and creator partnerships. we diversified our spend across platforms by increasing our penetration with google search, tiktok, and the snap. the increased investment in marketing accelerated trailing 12 months active buyers growth to 17.3% in the fourth quarter, which was up from 16.6% in the third quarter and 15.7% in the second quarter. moving to other operating expenses.
ops and support, excluding sbc of 14.7 million in the fourth quarter, was 17.4% of revenues, up from 16.9% in q4 2020 due to higher costs from seasonal cancelations and higher shipping costs. r&d, excluding sbc of 11 million in the fourth quarter, was 13% of revenues, up from 10.5% of revenues in q4 2020. this was due to the planned increases in hiring we have previously discussed, as we continue to invest additional resources across a number of key strategic initiatives. g&a, excluding sbc of 11.8 million in the fourth quarter, was 14% of revenues, up from 9.8% in q4 2020, primarily due to ongoing costs of being a public company.
q4 2020 g&a includes a 0.6 million favorable adjustment as a result of revising g&a expense in order to correct an overstatement of chargeback losses from our payment processor. we have outlined this in today's earnings release. stock-based compensation was 9.3 million in the fourth quarter, an increase from 1.9 million in q4 2020, due to the vesting of rsus upon completion of our ipo in january 2021. adjusted ebitda, excluding sbc, was negative 4.7 million, down from 4.8 million in q4 2020.
adjusted ebitda margins were negative 5.5%, compared to a 7% margin in q4 2020. however, it's important to note that these numbers were ahead of our guidance of negative $7 million to $8 million. compared to last year, the decreasing profitability was primarily driven by investments in marketing, which successfully accelerated top-line growth. we will continue to focus on balancing marketing efficiency and investing to accelerate growth in 2022.
operating loss, excluding sbc, was negative 5.7 million in the fourth quarter, with operating margins of negative 6.7%. that compares to 4.1 million, with margins of 5.9% in the fourth quarter of 2020. fourth quarter 2021 net loss to common shareholders was negative 14.8 million, compared to negative 3.2 million in q4 2020. cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were 581.5 million at the end of fourth quarter of 2021, or about $7.52 in cash per share.
as we think about capital allocation, our no. 1 priority is using our strong balance sheet to make strategic investments to drive long-term growth. moving to cash flow statements. for the 12 months ended december 31, 2021, free cash flow was 26.7 million, compared to 84.6 million in the 12 months ended december 31, 2020.
we continued to generate cash for the second year in a row. before i jump into guidance, i wanted to share some observations from my first few months as cfo. i believe they'll help set the context for how to think about the business and how we will create long-term value for all stakeholders. first, we have a massive opportunity in our core u.s.
fashion business. but as we have expanded into new categories and geographies, we have diluted our focus on the core. for that reason, we have appointed dedicated leadership to focus on driving and accelerating growth within our core u.s. business, including improving how we execute.
our community is obsessed about poshmark, and we must be obsessed about executing flawlessly so that we deliver an amazing buyer and seller experience. second, as we look beyond the core, we see international expansion as a strategic, long-term growth opportunity. we will continue to invest ahead of revenue growth to build the foundation, and we'll ensure our international expansion is set up for success and properly funded for strong execution. third, we have a sticky platform and engaged community.
as said earlier, we have historically seen and continue to see net positive gmv retention toward cohorts, and that is very unusual for any transaction e-commerce player. in 2021, our social activity reached an all-time high of almost 45 billion social interactions or 47% growth versus 2020. we believe this engagement shows there is a big opportunity to drive growth of our core business. now, onto guidance.
while we are confident that focusing on growing our core business and continuing to invest in marketing can positively impact the gmv growth, the disruptions from omicron at the beginning of the year, the lapping of stimulus, and the current geopolitical situation made us to be cautious about our outlook for the first quarter. after a better-than-expected holiday season, similar to others in e-commerce and retail, we saw softer trends in january as consumers were impacted by omicron, and events were once again canceled or postponed. while trends improved in february, we have our most difficult comparison still ahead in the second half of march as we lap stimulus. while we hope that covid is becoming endemic, we expect that the normal seasonality of consumer spending could continue to be disrupted during 2022, especially in the near term as we monitor consumer response to inflation, wait for omicron to fully retreat, and monitor how the geopolitical situation will impact consumer spending.
we expect first quarter revenues of 86 million to 88 million, resulting in a growth rate of 7% to 9% as we lap difficult comparisons of 42% growth in q1 last year. on a two-year basis, growth is expected to be 51% to 54%. compared to q1 last year, we expect to see slight pressure on q1 take rate as the mix shift to orders greater than $15 continues. we expect negative adjusted ebitda of 7 million to 9 million in q1 as we continue to invest in r&d to drive product innovation, g&a to build the infrastructure necessary to evolve as a publicly traded company, and marketing to grow our community of users.
we expect adjusted gross margin to remain consistently high and similar to q4 '21 levels as we hold more inventory. ops and support, excluding sbc, in the first quarter is expected to be 17% of revenues, or slightly higher than q4 '21, as we continue to invest in customer support and authentication services. r&d, excluding sbc, in the first quarter is expected to be 14% of revenues, or $1.5 million higher than q4 '21, as we continue to increase our investments in product innovation to accelerate growth. g&a, excluding sbc, in the first quarter is expected to be 16% to 17% of revenues, or $3 million higher than q4 '21, due to the higher costs of being a public company and as we build out our finance, accounting, and legal teams.
we continue to expect marketing, excluding sbc, as a percentage of revenues to be in the high 40s in the first quarter and throughout 2022 as we invest in the brand and address higher costs in digital advertising. we will continue to be disciplined as we invest in marketing to accelerate gmv growth while we continue to diversify our marketing channels to minimize the impact of idfa changes. we have proved that our platform is sticky and cohorts deliver net positive gmv dollar retention over time. with high gross margins and a strong balance sheet, we have the ability and conviction to continue to invest in marketing.
in the near term, these investments would enable us to build our user base and grow active buyers, which will put us in a stronger position in the long run. in closing, while we expect that macroeconomic and geopolitical factors could potentially impact consumer behavior in 2022, we are focused on controlling the things we can control. first, continuing to enhance our product experience. second, continuing to build our brand with the global consumer.
and third, invest in marketing talent and a robust operating mechanism to drive execution. in 2022, our priorities are focusing on execution, ensuring that our initiatives are properly funded, and growing our core business. first and foremost, we are curators of style. we are well-positioned to win as shoppers become more sustainably conscious and find a better value in inventory availability during periods of inflation and supply chain disruptions.
we are well-positioned to cater to a growing young population that embraces social and seeks self-expression through unique looks they can find only on poshmark. our sticky platform and asset-light model drives high gross margin, holds no inventory, and our supply is highly responsive to buyers' changing demands, positioning us well to thrive in a shifting fashion environment. by strengthening our business operations, improving our execution, and enhancing our financial planning process, i am confident that we have a long runway of growth ahead. we are making strategic investments in growth and focusing relentlessly on building a more seamless, more social, and more sustainable way to shop.
thank you. and i will now turn the call over to the operator so we can take your questions.

[operator instructions] your first question today comes from the line of lauren schenk with morgan stanley. your line is now open.
nathan feather -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, this is nathan feather on for lauren. can you just give an update on how india is performing in the first, you know, call it six months after launch, along with, you know, international more broadly? and then how are you thinking about fiscal '22 international expansion? and then one more on that. you know, you saw kind of a material drop in the take rate in 4q. is that just due to the mix shift to items $15 and higher? and should we expect that kind of lower take rate to continue? thank you.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
yeah, this is manish. i'm going to give the answer for the international. i'm going to have rodrigo give you color on the take rate. on the international side, you know, we are continuing to invest in australia and india.
australia is going through a period where we are really focused on our community building. now that the world is open, we're actually doing a lot more physical events, a lot more sort of direct community building in australia. and so, we're excited about sort of where that is going. we are also looking into new markets in terms of new countries and new areas to expand.
and as we said, our focus has been primarily around english-speaking countries. so, we're going to continue to follow that strategy into 2022.
rodrigo brumana -- chief financial officer
right. and for the take-rate question, there are actually two factors. so, first, we see higher cancelation rates during the holidays. and particularly in q4 2021, we saw higher holiday seasonality than compared to q4 2020.
however, you'll see that in q1 2022, we are seeing cancelation rates just normalizing, and they are back to the trending of where they were a year ago in q1 2021. and the second point is the one that we pointed out. we continued to see a mix shift away from the items under $15, which causes some pressure on take rate.
nathan feather -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. great. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of mike ng with goldman sachs. your line is now open.
mike ng -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thanks for all the detail around the marketing investments. i was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about some of the marketing strategies and the outlook for 2022. specifically, have you seen any changes to rois for channels like facebook post-idfa? and, you know, the guidance implies a step up in marketing investments throughout 2022.
any specific areas or channels that you're particularly focused on? thank you.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
yes. so, just broadly speaking, you know, our overall approach to marketing is in response to idfa has been, number one, to focus on the upper-funnel strategy. so, we're looking at different ways to retool that. and that means, you know, tweaking channel mix, potentially moving to other channels that are more attractive.
so, for example, we've shifted in q4 a little bit of spend to -- more to tv. we also are looking at more creator partnerships. and so, in q1, we launched a partnership with ateez, which is a k-pop band, and we're doing more sort of micro and macro creator partnership. in terms of -- on just share install channels, we've definitely allocated more to tiktok and snapchat as two channels that are showing very attractive -- and a more attractive sort of value proposition.
i would say facebook and instagram have been improving but are not quite at the pre-idfa levels in terms of just their performance.
mike ng -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thank you for all the color, manish.
operator
your next question comes from the line of ross sandler with barclays. your line is now open.
ross sandler -- barclays -- analyst
hey, manish. the comments about focusing on the pro sellers, i think, is pretty interesting. we've talked to some pros that can do really well on poshmark and others that have kind of struggled. so, i guess can you just give us a little overview on what tools are these pros asking for? what have you already delivered to them? and what are the most interesting things that you're going to provide to pros to make their life easier in terms of selling on poshmark? thanks a lot.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
yes. so, over the course of 2021, we've invested quite a bit of our r&d investments in building out a suite of tools, starting with bulk sharing, which was sort of one of the first big massive things we did, which was to really simplify sharing as a promotion engine and a curation engine and allows them to work with a lot of listings at the same time. we've launched closet insights, which gives them a lot of data and analytics on their own stores and closets on poshmark. we also have the first version of my shoppers out, which is a unique customer relation management team -- tool that allows them to work through a lot of their past customers, prospective customers, interact with them, almost like a boutique kind of a crm system that we've created.
and there's a lot more that we'll be doing in the my shoppers area and in terms of the innovation. i think a lot of the work that the pro sellers and the enterprise sellers need is in scaling up the use of tools, how they can sort of work with a lot more things at the same time, how they can manage bulk offers, you know, upload. we also launched bulk upload of listings where people can take a lot of inventory and upload that. for some of the larger enterprise sellers, we've also integrated some of their warehouse management system so they can process it from there as well.
so, we continue to invest in, you know, a variety of tools that can help more efficiently to our sellers or scaling up their business on poshmark to manage that -- their business and then continue to listen very closely to them. and now that the world is open, we hope to be able to have a lot more in-person gatherings with some of our pro sellers and get their feedback, which has been obviously hard to do in the last two years. we're also excited about, you know, our -- this year in terms of just opening up our live events that we are starting to host to engage more with our community and learn more in terms of their needs, which i'm sure many of them continue to evolve as people are readjusting to life, you know, and just sort of covid transition back into more physical life. so, that's sort of the high-level perspective on the tools.
it's an area of constant innovation and constant sort of distribution for us. the other thing, which is really powerful that we launched earlier this year, is our trends engine and our trends merchandising engine. and that is extremely powerful because one of the things we've noticed about fashion and style is that going into pandemic, people sort of went in a different direction. but coming out of it over the last year, the trends in fashion has been changing very rapidly, driven by newer social media platforms like tiktok, but also driven by the fact that a lot of people are remixing stuff from their closets, vintage, second hand, etc.
so, actually, the importance of educating our seller and our shoppers to our trends engine has been -- has taken on a new meaning, and that's an engine that we're investing a lot in in '22.
operator
your next question comes from the line of oliver chen with cowen. your line is now open.
oliver chen -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi, manish. you have a lot of really exciting new business opportunities with 200-plus, electronics, and thinking about footwear as well. what are your thoughts in terms of how these evolve with new customer or existing customer acquisition and also the nature of competition and how that intersects with how you think about top of funnel and marketing? just would love some thoughts there. and then, rodrigo, you mentioned in detail a focus on core and execution there and the product experience.
if you could elaborate on what you mean and where you see the most opportunities there, that would be helpful. and then finally, just a near-term modeling question, very helpful with march and the nature of comparison march and the softer trends in january. could you speak to which categories are most sensitive to that and what's within your control as, you know, algebraically face tough compares? thank you.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
thanks, oliver. so, just talking a little bit about electronics and category and sort of how we see top of the funnel. i think, for us, we go back to who we are. we're, ultimately, a community platform.
and so, we see the world evolving around what we think of as microcommunities, which is, you know, when you think of electronics, we don't think of just as products, but we think of communities that gather around that products. it could be the gaming community. it could be, you know, people who are sort of looking at specific kind of hobbyist around that. and so, a lot of the work we do here is focused on style, focused on sort of personal direction.
and that is where we see the excitement. when you think of pets, it's not just as much about pets as a category. we think of it as a community of people who are part of the different kinds of pets communities. and so, a lot of the innovation you'll see for -- from us in 2020 is encouraging, connecting these microcommunities in a more direct way.
and you can see some of that in our app today where we gather up college communities together. we have city communities. and those things have been really powerful in connecting people and people discovering. so, you may have a chapter out in louisiana that poshmark is gathering together and connecting.
and most recently, we actually brought back our posh n coffee, which we had suspended at the beginning of covid almost two years back. and the first set of physical posh n coffee are starting to happen as well. so, we're excited about encouraging and creating these microcommunities and on both style and other categories on the platform.
rodrigo brumana -- chief financial officer
yes, and, oliver, rodrigo here. so, your question about some of our emphasis on business operations and especially our focus on core. as mentioned, our core, when you step back, core fashion categories, apparel, bags, shoes, and accessories, they are 90% of our gmv. so, we think this core, we are focused on growing our market share of premium-priced products.
and that's one of the reasons that we acquire suede one. and then we are integrating that as part of our product, and we are excited about it. so, it's really focused on -- heavily on users that are looking for those priced -- premium-priced products, and that's one of the capabilities that we built. we also have this shop by trend, which is an example of how we are using product innovation to drive growth for our core fashion categories.
and when you think about the seller side, we are focused on growing the pro sellers, as manish talked about. we have some focus on the enterprise selling through the brand closets, but we are not alienating our casual sellers. so, the good thing about poshmark is we build the platform so everyone can thrive here. so, that's kind of how to think about the categories.
and you have a third question, if you can remind me, please?
oliver chen -- cowen and company -- analyst
so, thanks, rodrigo. just as you lap stimulus, which categories have been more volatile? and you spoke to the softer trends in january. so, what's in your control in terms of facing this tough comparison and executing against it?
rodrigo brumana -- chief financial officer
yeah, it's a good question. we don't comment on the category specific, but as you mentioned, march. and march is where the tough lapping is happening because that's when we saw the stimulus checks kind of kicking in last year. so, we are lapping that period as we speak.
we're not guiding march, obviously, because we haven't closed march. but how to think about it? focus on things that we can control. i'll highlight marketing. so, if you look at this platform, we see when you acquire a user, over time, that user produces more gmv over time.
and that stickiness, i have not seen on my career so far, and this is my fifth marketplace that i'm working for. so, focus on the things that we can control, especially marketing, is where we have high conviction to focus as we lap this part of q1.
oliver chen -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you. best regards.

your next question comes from the line of ralph schackart with william blair. your line is now open.
ralph schackart -- william blair -- analyst
good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. first question, just on cohort retention. maybe you can provide some color, if you could, please, on both the buyer and seller side, sort of what's driving that increased retention engagement. i'm guessing it has something to do new products such as new seller tools.
but if you could elaborate on that, that'd be great. and then i have a follow-up.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
yeah, it's really our continued focus on product innovation. i mean, if you think about what we've done all of last year is invested in our discovery engines, invested in our search, invested in seller tools, and certainly continue to sort of bring more demand to our sellers and more supply to our shoppers. so, all of those core product innovation is really the key to long-term retention of our cohorts. and so, we continue to invest in that at various levels, you know, whether it's a casual seller who's going to benefit from some of the casual seller listings improvements we've done into the core listing flow or you look at sort of more of our pro seller who benefits from my shoppers.
we just continue to invest in these things. and that, i think, is ultimately how we've thrived in the platform that's been serving our community to the fullest.
ralph schackart -- william blair -- analyst
great, and maybe one for rodrigo. sounds like, rodrigo, that you're going to be leaning into some marketing spend. sounds like you're getting some efficiencies in some new channels. so, just curious, as you're thinking about sort of balancing growth and profitability for 2022, how are you thinking about that trade-off and sort of that, you know, growth phase, i guess, as we think about it for 2022?
rodrigo brumana -- chief financial officer
hey, ralph. we're not guiding to 2022, but i'll stick to what we said in the beginning of the call. so, we're guiding to the high 40s on marketing. and we're thinking about it? we are coming back and looking at how our retention has trended.
so, first, again, i highlight that in -- by year 5, 40% of the buyers become sellers and sellers become buyers. so, i like that. and the fact that when you look at the stacked cohort retention from both buyers and sellers, they continue not only to return more than 100% retention, but they grow over time. and then we saw that we accelerated on both, you know, buyers and sellers.
so, with that in mind, we are sticking to the plan to lean into marketing to the high 40s through 2022.
ralph schackart -- william blair -- analyst
ok. thanks, rodrigo. thanks, manish.
operator
your next question comes from the line of andrew boone with jmp securities. your line is now open.
andrew boone -- jmp securities -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for taking my questions. as we think about apparel rebounding with the reopening of the economy, can you just remind us in terms of the trends that you've seen as we've now gone through multiple waves of covid? when we think about maybe getting through covid, how demand has trended for apparel and help us think about that as we think about the [inaudible] for 2022?
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
well, apparel broadly defines the bulk of our sales, as we pointed out. and, you know, within the apparel categories, what we continue to see is the distribution between the different groups, whether you look at bags or shoes and core, seems to be very stable. and, you know, what we are really seeing is a shift in -- shift to -- sort of when we start to think about the shift to the different styles and silhouettes that are happening is apparent in poshmark. so, for example, you know, we've talked about the shift to sort of more looser based, you know, sort of tightened top and broad at the bottom kind of a silhouette that that sort of is apparent in our apparel mix.
that all that you have to see and you can see that -- you know, we change is a little bit of shift more toward the premium-priced points in both apparel and bags and handbags on fashion.
andrew boone -- jmp securities -- analyst
and then stepping back, as i think about efficiency in 2022, has there been any change competitively against other secondhand platforms that are out there? do you guys feel like that's changed since pre-covid, during the pandemic, and then as we sit today? thanks so much.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
yeah. so, i think -- look, in general, i would say that there has been definitely an increase in competition. but if you look at sort of where we are, we have been growing our business at a pretty good rate. and what you see in the latest quarter we showed is that our active buyers have grown 17%, delivering a record active buyer of seven -- or the more than 7 million active buyers in our platform.
and so, we feel that in this landscape, we are faring pretty well. and again, it goes back to the strength of our community, strength of our cohorts, and this very unique experience that we've crafted, which is not just about buying and not just about selling, but it has -- it brings in curation and community into an integrated thing. and you see the proof in everything that happens on poshmark, whether it is increased social interactions, it is how people buy and sell, or it is how our cohorts are trending. so, we feel we are pretty well competitively positioned to play in this landscape.
i think at the same time, in the last two years, the opportunity has exploded massively. you know, when we talk about the future of shopping as being secondhand, we talk about the future of shopping as being online, and we talk about the future of shopping as being social, well, these trends are exploding in a massive way with the younger generations, with the older generations, and covid has just accelerated it. so, we find ourselves in even a bigger market opportunity than we did when we were starting out with covid. so, while competition increased, the opportunity has increased even bigger.
so, we see like a really exciting future as we invest into it and grow into it.
andrew boone -- jmp securities -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of anna andreeva with needham. your line is now open.
anna andreeva -- needham and company -- analyst
great. thank you so much. and good quarter, guys. congrats, and thanks for all the color.
we had two questions. we noticed there were some changes to search functionality in the last month. my understanding is a new iteration was launched just last week. just curious, how is the community reacting to that? and i guess, do you anticipate any additional changes down the road? and i know you're not providing annual guidance, but as we think about the year, should we expect the sales growth to accelerate after 1q? and i had a quick follow-up as well.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
i'm going to answer the first part and then have rodrigo sort of answer the second part. so, you know, we want to continue to provide the best matching experience for buyers and sellers on our platform. and for that, we are constantly optimizing our discovery and search experiences. we did a shift in our just shared algorithm earlier this quarter.
we got feedback from the community. we took a step back, redid it, and relaunched it fully just this week. it's 100% live this week. all of the testing from the first version and second version have actually shown growth across both buyers and sellers in the platform, and we will continue to optimize it.
i think there's so much opportunity here as we are using a combination of algorithms, machine learning, and social curation. the thing that we have our commitment to our community, to our sellers, and to our shoppers is that the focus is always on them. for example, sharing, which is very unique to poshmark, and that's sort of something that has been great for both the sellers and the shoppers in creating a highly curated, fresh experience, will always be front and center for us. so, we'll continue to invest in it.
but at the same time, we also want to enhance it, that algorithmic relevance, and other pieces. so, this is an area of active innovation and active evolution for us, and we'll continue to sort of grow it overall. and ultimately, our goal is to help all of our sellers thrive, whether they're small or big, and all of our shoppers be able to quickly find what they're looking for. and that drives all of our true north for innovating in search and discovery on the platform.
rodrigo brumana -- chief financial officer
hi, anna, rodrigo here. so, obviously, we're not guiding the year. but since we last reported the results in november, there has been impressive [inaudible] volatility in the macroenvironment. and thus, it feels premature to be giving any 2022 guidance.
we all know the last few years have been anything but certain. and the current atmosphere just creates more volatility into consumer behavior. and as you know, they're just coming out of covid and into an inflationary environment right now. so, it's just difficult to predict.
but having said that, we are focused on the things we can control. we plan to continue to invest in product innovation through r&d, in acquiring new users through marketing. and we do that because we continue to see the net positive gmv retention from both buyers and sellers, and we believe this will pave the way for the long-term growth. and that's what we are focusing on right now, long-term growth.
anna andreeva -- needham and company -- analyst
ok. no, i appreciate that. that's helpful. and my follow-up was just on the take rate.
great to hear that the higher-priced product is doing well. just curious, with the acquisition of suede, as you're increasingly pivoting into higher-priced, how do you guys think what's the right level structurally for take rates for poshmark?
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
you know, for us, we are very much focused on delivering an integrated, simple, transparent value in everything that we do, whether you look at our shipping system, you look at our fee structures, you look at sort of our tooling infrastructure, etc. we have made everything universally available to all of our sellers across all of the pieces. and that simplicity philosophy guides our decision and everything we make. we feel that, ultimately, being simple, being sort of clear about these fee structures, and being able to build a sustainable business, which serves our sellers and our shoppers, is the way we do.
so, we have, in fact, pretty much since day one, had the same take rate. and today, we are certainly don't see any reason to make changes to the take rate as we look into the future. and ultimately, the key for us is to continue to deliver value to both our sellers and shoppers. and that's what we'll do.
anna andreeva -- needham and company -- analyst
all right. well, i appreciate it. thanks so much.

[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of ashley helgans with jefferies. your line is now open.
unknown speaker
hi, good afternoon. it's blake on for ashley. just wanted to ask a more high-level one on inflation. i know you mentioned lapping stimulus and the omicron impacts.
obviously, you've talked about a higher mix of higher price point items doing well. so, should we read that as, you know, you're not having much elasticity for some of the other categories, or how do we think about the category impact by maybe higher prices? are you seeing maybe some higher-income consumers come to the platform? and then also, do you think inflation could actually be a positive for your platform at all given the affordability of retail? thank you.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
yeah. so, look, inflation is a challenging thing that the american consumer and the consumers probably around the world face. we believe our platform can really be a great partner for consumers faced with inflationary pressure. on one side, we provide a way that anybody can sell stuff from their closet and allows them to provide -- get liquidity and really rotate that stuff, which is great for the planet and great for the wallet.
on the flip side, we have, you know, amazing amount of value-oriented, both new, but also, more importantly, secondhand inventory available that people can come and shop. and we provide different kinds of pricing and negotiation tools to arrive at a good price. so, we believe that that, combined with our asset-light model, where the inventory can revector dynamically, gives us tremendous flexibility as people deal with inflation going into 2022. i think your question is why are we not seeing downward or upward pricing pressures? i think at the minute, it is -- fully -- i would say, in the platform, it is fully hard to say exactly how the consumer will completely react to inflation.
i think that inflation is not -- in my opinion, is not fully factored into people's decisions across the board. it's starting to come more and more as we've seen with recent gas prices. so, that picture will unfold. what we do know is being asset-light, giving the people the ability to sell, and giving the people the ability to shop will allow us to be a great partner to the consumer in these very inflationary times.

your next question comes from the line of brian mcnamara with berenberg. your line is now open.
brian mcnamara -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the question. i understand you're lapping your toughest comp in q1, but it's also, i believe, your easiest comp for the year on a two-year basis. so, how should we think about your growth relative to the resale market growth in general? are you gaining or losing share? thanks.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
you know, from our perspective, it's hard to know exactly whether we're getting or losing share because we're in the middle of a quarter. but i would say if you look at last year, our performance has been relatively quite strong compared to the other players in the market. some are private, some are public, so it's hard to 100% compare across the board. you know, when we think of [technical difficulty] in this quarter, particularly in q4, it's a very strong growth, you know, ttm active buyers of 17%, with a record, you know, a little over 7 million buyers that we clocked in, which is the highest active buyers that we've had.
we've also continued to see the, you know, huge retention, both in our sellers and buyers, and both of them accelerated. so, we continue to see that we have a very strong business in this changing landscape. and i think the entire market is growing so fast, but i think it also gives us a tremendous set of opportunities. i think one thing to just think about, our active buyer number is -- that 7.6 million active buyer is bigger than most other players out in the market.
so, that can give you a little bit of a sense of how we rank with respect to other marketplaces.

manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
thanks, christine. hello, and welcome everyone. thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2022 earnings call. we're pleased to report that we are off to a strong start in 2022.
our focus on our four core strategies, category growth, product innovation, new seller tools and international growth remains the foundation for driving gmv, revenue and active buyer growth. our strategies are working and continue to drive our business forward. we plan to discuss these strategies in further detail in a bit, however, let's first discuss our q1 results. first quarter gmv grew 12% to $493.4 million and revenue grew 13% to $90.9 million, beating our expectation for the quarter, which is our most difficult comparison for the year and positioning as well for the year ahead.
on a two-year basis, gmv and revenues grew 60% and 59% respectively. our growth is fueled by the consumer shift to online, social and sustainable shopping. three trends that poshmark continues to lead as demonstrated by 16% trailing 12 month active buy growth to a record $7.8 million in the first quarter. we continue to adjust our marketing spend to navigate a volatile macro environment and draw attention to poshmark as a great place to save your wallet and save the planet, particularly among style and value conscious shoppers, who are feeling more constrained due to inflation.
in march, we kicked off our seasonal marketing campaign, focused on the annual ritual of spring cleaning, which drove increase in listings and engagement across all channels. first quarter sales reflected poshmark as a fashion destination for moments that matter, as evidenced by the increase in sales of prom items up 75% year over year and listings for wedding items up 39% year over year. as people increasingly attended physical events, throwback vintage styles are becoming more popular, particularly among gen z consumers. vintage listings were up 68% year over year in the first quarter.
our social marketplace continues to define a new more human way to shop online by making the shopping and discovery experience more interactive and social. social interactions grew 59% year over year during trailing 12 months q1 '22 to a record $50.7 billion. this social engagement drives community connection and conversion. we find that more than 80% of all purchases are preceded by social interaction, such as like, comment or offer.
poshmark's social experience is a key differentiator. and after two years of lockdowns and virtual events, we are overjoyed to announce the return of in person community events, which launched in q1. in-person events are an important part of our growth activation engine. they introduce the poshmark brand to new consumers, foster loyalty and connection at the micro community level and grow our highly engaged user base.
these events create one of a kind opportunity for our community to come together to socialize and share success stories and advise on how to build their businesses on poshmark. we held 35 of these events in the first quarter, attracting community members across the us. looking at the rest of the year. we're focused on executing our full long term growth strategies, category growth, product innovation, new seller tools and international growth.
these remain the foundation for how we will drive gmv, revenue and active buyer growth. our first strategy is to grow our core fashion categories to increase share of wallet with consumers, grow our overall market share and drive gmv growth. our marketplace is a leading fashion destination. and as a reminder, our core fashion categories, apparel, shoes, bags and accessories, represent over 90% of our gmv.
high contribution from premium price products continue to be one of the factors that drove year-over-year aov growth during the first quarter of 2022. we remain committed to growing our market share in premium price products and look forward to expanding our authentication services by end of the year, as we integrate our suede one acquisition. we continue to be excited by the opportunity for brand closets to contribute to the growth of our core fashion categories. though still small brand closets gmv during the first quarter of 2022 grew 2.5x compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, and monthly gmv growth continues to accelerate.
we continue to see strong interest from large scale brands and retailers, and have to wait list for onboarding signed partners. these new partners value being able to directly connect with and sell to our community of more than 80 million registered users and they benefit from a real time insights, which enables them to effectively address consumer preferences and reach new millennial and gen z audiences. for our community brand closets enhance our marketplace as a go to fashion destination by increasing the product assortment available, attracting more buyers to our platform. our second strategies to focus on product innovation to drive user engagement and buyer conversion, which is fundamental to the retention of our user cohorts and gmv growth.
as a style destination where shoppers come to discover, follow and shop, product innovation enables us to guide the treasure hunt for fashion. in january, we launched the redesign of our feed and shop tab, which modernized and refreshed the pages to make it easier to shop. this refresh has led to an increase in engagement and is directionally driving up buyers and orders, too. we completed our rollout of shop by trend, a new merchandising engine that complements our existing brand merchandising capabilities.
trends is an editorial curated daily feed that brings the best of what's popular in poshmark's main feed and strengthens searchability and engagement, contributing to the stickiness of our platform and user retention. this first version of trends includes curated daily trends in the shop tab and a remarketing engine to surface the freshest listings from trends consumers have engaged within the feed. it also includes new curated communications that are customized to each user. we are excited to see growth in daily page views, listing clicks, likes and conversion as a result of this new feature.
throughout the first quarter, we also tested versions of our search algorithm to combine the power of sharing with machine learning. we're constantly optimizing our search algorithm to better match supply and demand. early results of these tests show a positive impact on sales, buy growth, orders and listing views. however, we are empathetic to some of our sellers who are impacted by these changes and continue to work to make it better for everyone in our community.
our third strategy is to deliver innovative easy to use and effective services to help sellers market, merchandise and sell their listings. in february, we began rolling out a new messaging tool that allows buyers and sellers to communicate directly with each other once an order has been booked. this feature, which was one of the topic was from our community, empowers buyers and sellers to resolve order related issues privately and directly. with this new messaging interface, once an order is booked, the buyer and seller can start a conversation right from the order details page.
about 56% of chat sessions are initiated by sellers and 44% by buyers. we expect this new feature to improve order completion rate, reduce incoming cases and improve the overall user experience. in february, we also launched posh ambassador ii, a new tier in our posh ambassador program, which caters to our most active community members by highlighting them with a gold star badge in their profile, and offering them additional benefits such as exclusive forums with our leadership team, vip events and other additional perks. our ambassadors value this new tier and it should help pa ii see more success as well as impact engagement, retention and other social commerce metrics.
posh post, our simple and unique shipping system, allows for items to be shipped in any box with a printable label at an affordable flat rate with a quick trackable one to three day shipping. as shipping costs continue to rise, we have intentionally kept our shipping costs for the buyers competitively low, while providing a single label to ship anything up to five pounds. this stands at not only one of the most economical, but also the simplest solution for shipping, and one that can be used by millions of sellers across the country. our fourth growth strategy is to expand our international footprint and we continue to invest ahead of revenue for the long-term.
as we look beyond the core, we see international expansion as a strategic long-term growth opportunity. we celebrated australia's one year anniversary during the first quarter and continue to lay the foundation for building an active community and seller base, and we look forward to holding in person events in that country. as we approach the three year anniversary of poshmark canada this month, the majority of our international investment will be focused on driving growth through advertising, community development and shipping innovation. we have seen success in reactivation retention efforts for older cohorts in canada due to remarketing and targeted promotions.
we're excited to begin holding in person events again across the country to strengthen community connections and accelerate growth in this market as well. in conclusion, our vision remains becoming the world's leading social marketplace and the number one destination for sellers around the world. our marketplace powered by millions of highly engaged sellers is flexible, adaptable and ready to meet the ever changing needs of shoppers. we believe poshmark is positioned to win due to its strong cohort retention, unmatched scale, price value appeal and asset light model.
we will continue to navigate near-term headwinds by staying focused on executing our long-term growth strategies and serving our community. now, i'd like to turn it over to rodrigo to dive deeper into the financials.
rodrigo brumana -- chief financial officer
thank you, manish. as we mentioned on our last call, after a better than expect holiday season similar to order in e-commerce and retail, we saw softer trends in january as consumers were impacted by omicron and events were once again canceled or postponed. trends improved in february and further into march, resulting in a strong end to the first quarter with both revenues and ebitda coming in ahead of our guidance. gmv grew 12% to $493.4 million, up from $441 million in the first quarter of 2021 or 60% growth on a two-year basis despite a tough comparison period as we lapsed tenuous.
net revenues grew 13% to $90.9 million, up from $80.7 million in the first quarter of 2021 or 57% growth on a two-year basis. this result was ahead of our guidance of $86 million to $88 million due in part by a better than expected take rate and a 15.8% growth in trailing 12 month active buyers to a record $7.8 million, up from $6.7 million in the first quarter of 2021. on a two-year basis, trailing 12 month active buyers grew 36.4%, thanks to our continued marketing investments. our take rate in the first quarter was 18.4%, up slightly from 18.3% from last year due to lower than expected first quarter cancellation rates from the holidays, which more than offset the pressure from continued mix shift to more orders greater than $15.
mix shift continues to be a take rate headwind as orders less than $15 have a higher take rate due to the flat fee of $2.95. cost of revenues of $15 million in the first quarter was 16.5% of revenues, an increase of 16% from the first quarter of 2021. adjusted gross margin was 83.5% of revenues in the first quarter, slightly down from 83.9% from the first quarter of 2021 due to higher hosting costs. marketing expenses, excluding stock based compensation or sbc, of $41.3 million in the first quarter was 45.6% of revenues, up from 39.6% in the first quarter of 2021.
that result is lower than our guidance of high 40s. market increased 30% from $32 million in the first quarter of 2021 due to higher cpu, more in-person events and community building initiatives. moving toward expenses, ops and support, excluding sbc, of $14.3 million in the first quarter was 15.7% of revenues, which is flat from the first quarter of 2021. r&d excluding sbc of $11.6 billion in the first quarter was 12.7% of revenues, up from 10.1% of revenues in the first quarter of 2021.
this was due to a planned increase in hiring we have previously discussed as we continue to invest additional resources across a number of strategic initiatives. g&a, excluding sbc, of $13.2 million in the first quarter was 14.5% of revenues, up from 12.6% in the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to the ongoing cost of being a public company. stock based compensation was $8.7 million in the first quarter, down from $24.1 million in the first quarter of 2021 due to the absence of rsu vesting that we saw upon completion of our ipo in january 2021. adjusted ebitda, which excludes sbc, was negative $4.7 million, down from $4.8 million in the first quarter of 2021.
adjusted ebitda margins were negative 5.2% compared to the 6% margin in the first quarter of 2021. however, it's important to note that these numbers were ahead of our guidance of negative $7 million to $9 million due to lower marketing expenses and lower g&a expenses as we postponed some g&a investments that will hit in the second quarter and second half of 2022. compared to last year, the decrease in profitability was primarily driven by investments in marketing, which successfully accelerated top-line growth. we will continue to focus on balancing marketing efficiency and investing to accelerate growth in 2022.
operating loss excluding sbc was negative $5.7 million in the first quarter with operating margins of negative 6.3% that compares to $4 million with margins of 5% in the first quarter of 2021. net loss to common shareholders was negative $14 million in the first quarter compared to a negative $74.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. cash, cash equivalents were $596.6 million at the end of the first quarter or about $7.65 in cash per share. moving to cash flow statement.
for the three months ended march 31, 2022, free cash flow was $13.9 million compared to $19.8 million for the three months ended march 31, 2021. we continued to generate cash despite making investments for the future growth. we remain confident that our asset light and high gross margin model positions us well to grow market share and will continue to optimize our investments in product innovation and marketing to drive gmv growth. we help our community save money during their treasure hunt for a wardrobe refresh as they attend more in-person events in travel, and we are also a destination where consumers can supplement their income by unlocking the value in their closets.
however, the current marketing environment and unpredictability of consumer spending behavior in the face of inflation leaves us to be cautious in our outlook for the second quarter. now, on to guidance. looking to the second quarter, we overcame tough comps in april. but in the latter half of the quarter, we often see seasonality impact both engagement and transactions as where they gets better and consumer shift their attention from cleaning out closets to travel for spring and summer break.
we also continue to navigate changes in the digital advertising landscape and expect idfa to maintain pressure on our revenue growth rates in the second quarter as well into 2022. as such, we expect second quarter revenues of $86 million to $88 million resulting in a growth rate of 5% to 8% as we lap difficult comparisons of 22% growth and 72% growth on a two-year basis. on a two-year basis, growth is expected to be 29% to 32%. we expect our second quarter take rate to be flat versus last year.
we expect negative adjusted ebitda of $9 million to $11 million in q2 as we continue to invest in r&d to drive product innovation g&a to build the infrastructure necessary to evolve as a publicly traded company and marketing to grow our community of users. we expect adjusted gross margin to be down slightly from q1 2022 due to higher hosting costs as we anniversary a non-recurring credit in transaction payment processing fees during the second quarter of 2021. ops and support excluding sbc in the second quarter is expected to be 17% of revenues as we continue to invest in customer support and authentication services. r&d excluding sbc in the second quarter is expected to be 15% of revenues as we continue to increase our investment in product innovation to accelerate growth.
g&a excluding sbc in the second quarter is expected to be 16% of revenues due to the higher cost of being a public company as we build out finance, accounting and legal teams. we continue to expect marketing excluding sbc as a percent of revenues to be in the high 40s in the second quarter and throughout 2022 as we invest in other brands, diversify our marketing channels and address higher costs in digital advertising. we have proved that our platform is sticky and cohorts deliver net positive gmv dollar retention over time. with high gross margins and a strong balance sheet, we have the ability and conviction to continue to invest in marketing to accelerate gmv growth.
in the near-term, these investments will enable us to build our user base and grow active buyers, which will put us in a stronger position in the long-run. in closing, consistent to our messaging the last earning release, while we expect that macroeconomic factors could continue to impact consumer behavior in 2022, we are focused on execution with a strong focus on our core business. first, continuing to enhance our product experience. second, continuing to build our brand with the global consumer.
and third, invest in marketing, talent and a robust operating mechanism to drive execution. we are confident that our business model is resilient for the current environment and well positioned to benefit from secular trends in resale, sustainable commerce and consumers looking for value in the unique looks. our sticky platform and asset light model holds no inventory driving high gross margin. our supply is highly responsive to buyers' changing demands and our product assortment is not impacted by supply chain disruptions, positioning us well to thrive in the shift in fashion environment where consumers maybe more valued and environment conscious.
thank you. and i will now turn the call over to the operator so we can take your questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and we'll go take our first question from lauren schenk, morgan stanley.
nathan feather -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey. this is nathan feather on for lauren. what kind of macro backdrop are you assuming in guidance and as we head into the second half? and then understanding a lot more kind of uncertain at the moment. but how do you think the business would fare in kind of a weaker macro environment? and then how are you thinking about the impact from the us seller income tax reporting change and did that have any impact in 1q? thank you.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
let me take the question related to the guidance and then we'll figure out the rest. i think you gave us a little bit of a long question, we may have to come back to you, but let's start with your first question here. we are not guiding the second half. so how do we think about it is we stick to how we guided q2.
and the reason that we are not providing that visibility into the second half is things continue to be a little bit unprecedented in terms of volatility and the macroeconomic environment, it's just premature to give any guidance. we are more specific about q2 we can provide some color, but we're not guiding the second half.
rodrigo brumana -- chief financial officer
so in terms of just if you think about like what's happening in the market today, particularly in the consumer sentiment, there is two or three things driving us. one is inflation is at a level that i think most of us haven't seen in our lifetime. and then we sort of combine that with the pressures on the consumer wallet is very high. so when you think of a platform like poshmark, we provide ourselves as a key partner to the consumer.
on the one side, we allow the consumer to save money by really shopping for extraordinary deals. second thing is we allow them to earn money by really leveraging their closet. when you combine these two things, poshmark can be a really great partner for the consumer in many different ways as this inflationary and recessionary environment comes together. as far as your question on the 1099 process that has come together, let me just sort of take a step back and talk about what's happening here.
as part of the american rescue plan act that passed in march last year, the 1099-k reporting threshold was lowered from $20,000 and 200 transactions per year to $600 gross annual sales with no transaction limit. we began rolling out our 1099-k seller reporting requirements in january and it is now fully launched on our platform. so our results reflect the launch of that. so far we've seen minimal to no impact to our business and for our sellers, they seem to have embraced it.
nathan feather -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
next up is ross sandler, barclays.
ross sandler -- barclays capital -- analyst
hey, guys. maybe you could talk about what you're seeing quarter-to-date in 2q, assuming the take rate remains kind of stable, which looked like it improved a little -- a bunch from the holly cancellation thing in 4q into 1q. but assuming that stays about the same in 2q, your guidance implies like a 3% quarter-on-quarter downtick in gmv. and i think you're normally kind of flat up in 2q.
so is that just kind of the macro uncertainty? could you talk a little bit about which categories are doing better or a little worse in the current environment? that'd be the first question. and then second question is just marketing intensity picked up a little bit. you mentioned rodrigo high 40s for this year. sounds like the offline marketing, in person events is a factor.
but how are you thinking about digital marketing efficiency, i guess, both in the first quarter and then throughout the year as we model out that high 40s? that's it.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
let take most of your questions here. so first, how do we think about q2 into q1 from a top-line standpoint? well, we still in may, so we're not going to talk about specifically in may. but let me tell you how we think about the quarter and our guidance. as mentioned in the call, we are pleased that we overcame our toughest comps in april, but the latter half of the quarter, that's where we kind of see the normal seasonality impact on some of the engagements and some of the transactions there.
so while we do think that as folks go out more and they need a wardrobe of fresh, just the macro challenges we're just being cautious about the outlook for the rest of the quarter. so that's one. and also we continue to navigate some of the changes in the digital advertising landscape. so we expect idfa to maintain some pressure on our revenue growth, not only in the second quarter but also 2022.
that's why we are still shooting for the high 40s on marketing. and also you want to kind of remind, i'll talk about take rates in a bit, but since we mentioned about marketing. we continue to have buy conviction to invest in marketing. and the proof for that is we continue to see a sticky behavior on our cohorts, both in the buyer and the seller side.
and by the way, even through q1, we started to see some progress on cpu, slightly down from how we begun the quarter q1. so that gives us confidence that our marketing teams are doing an amazing job in navigating that. so with that high gross margins the majority of our expand being variable, which means things that we can control and we prove that we could be profitable, we continue to invest in marketing. now take your q1 take rate question.
so -- and how that translates to q2. here's kind of how to think about it. so first the q1, we came in slightly better than expected, because the cancellation rates from the holidays were better than expected. if you remember last year, we had the usps disruption and then this year we didn't see as much cancellation from the holidays.
that's kind of q1 the explanation. when you look at q2, that's kind of disruption that picked in april last year it's kind of going to go away. and the phenomenal of the mix shift from orders below $15 to orders higher than $15 continue to be a secular headwind to our take rate. so we've taken that in consideration in the take rate of q2.
so see that deceleration first on gmv, i can't recall your calculation, but it's kind of -- you know it makes sense to see the q2 gmv below than q1.
rodrigo brumana -- chief financial officer
in terms of, you know, ross, your question around categories. i think, we generally don't share within a quarter category trends, but there's a couple of things i wanted to highlight. one is we saw an acceleration of apparel, and that's something that's really powerful because it tells us that people are actually going out and engaging in the world of fashion. we saw prom items up 75% year over year, wedding items up 39% year over year.
so real meaningful growth in event oriented shopping. the second thing is again another dimension is that the premium price items, $200 plus items, continue to out base overall growth in 1q. so that gives you a little bit of flavor of how categories scaled up in q1.
operator
[operator instructions] next is alexandra steiger, goldman sachs.
alexandra steiger -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you for taking my questions. i wanted to focus on the brand closets program. could you maybe share some milestones here now that we're a few months in and if it helps you to acquire a new court of customers and then could you also talk about the type of brands you're targeting to join the program? and then secondly, can you just give us an update on how international, especially india is performing?
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
so when we think about brand closets, we think of them as something that really adds to the overall ecosystem of the poshmark platform. very symbiotic with our core sellers, they bring complementary inventory, attracts new buyers and really create a bigger marketplace. our focus on brand closets has been to really integrate it with a series of brands that complement our ecosystem and also benefit our popular on the platform. we've had multi-brand retailers, larger brands, as well as many community brands who've partnered with us on the platform.
and in fact, right now just from an implementation perspective, there's a waiting queue to kind of implement these brands on the platform. a lot of it was contingent on some of the back end integration work that we were rolling out, and that's -- sort of has been rolled out and that's accelerating the growth of these brand closets on the platform. when we think about the kind of sort of people that are on the platform, they include everything from luxury, to beauty, to everyday brands. and the goal is to really compliment the availability of inventory and selection on poshmark with these brand closets.
your second question was centered around india. what we've seen in sort of the first few months of india is that the core engagement metrics and the scaling is happening as we would expect in the early days. it's still super early and it's going to take some time to develop that market. but the kind of posh ambassador growth kind of early community growth is very much in line.
and in fact in line with what we shared about our in person events, india is starting to see a lot of these in person events happening for both closet activation but also community engagement. and we're just super excited about the market, because it's a very large market. it's a market that's growing very fast in a broader sense of e-commerce adoption. and certainly the focus on resale has been there for the beginning.
so it just continues to be an exciting but early stage market for us.
operator
oliver chen with cowen and company has the next question.
oliver chen -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. thank you very much. digital advertising, you called out higher cost a few times and also in light of the privacy changes. what's happening in terms of how you're approaching return on ad spend? and do you expect privacy to continue to drive some risk factors around thinking about the right roas as well as customer acquisition costs? and a follow-up, you've had attractive user growth and there's low unemployment, and you offer strong consumer value.
so which parts of the nature of the consumer are you more concerned about as it impacts your business? thank you.
rodrigo brumana -- chief financial officer
yeah. let me take the first one and then i think the other parts, manish, you can take. here's kind of how we think about the idfa changes. first, to clarify, it will take until at least for a company in q4 this year to fully lap idfa impact, because that is when we begun invest more in marketing last year.
so having said that, we have made progress on lowering marketing costs by looking for other channels, which i'll talk in a minute that diversified encounter some of the idfa headwind. and in fact, we have begun seeing some signs of cpu improvements during the first quarter and into april. so that's a good sign, that's a good progress there. and since our marketing mix is highly adaptable, what we have done we adjusted by focusing on strong roi user acquisition channels, outside that, investing upper funnel strategies, such as tv and creator partnerships.
we also see a strong traction on the organic creator in our community kind of being reignited with some of the in person events, and that continue to adjust our marketing strategies toward that type of channel. and then i think this is kind of the social experience as being a key differentiator of poshmark, especially when you think about 2022. so again, reigniting the in person events, we think that that is a key part of our growth in the activation engine. and what it does as well, it introduces poshmark brand to new consumers, folks that are new to the platform.
and that continues to fulfill or foster our flywheel, which drives their loyalty and the stickness or cohort...
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
in terms of what are the dimensions of what could sort of concern the consumer? i think, consumer is impacted by a lot of different things. many of them could be unsettling for us in the short term, but a lot of them can be very positive for poshmark. so if you think about their concern for the wallet they could dampen in their spending, but they could look to poshmark for finding bargains. number two is they could be concerned about how much money they're making.
again, they can look to poshmark to sell their closet. so when we think of these two disruptions, they can be in some ways positive for poshmark. the third thing is supply chain disruptions that are happening. and again, poshmark can complement that supply chain.
so if you look at the beginning of the pandemic, at that point ,we didn't know when the pandemic was starting, how the consumer is going to react to a secondhand used clothing marketplace. it ended up being a source of income and a source of sort of shopping for many consumers. so i think it's more the uncertainty that we are managing through having gone through two years of a pandemic, inflation, supply chain disruption. it's like every time you think that the world is going to become stable, there's something little bit more happening.
so we continue to navigate through it and adapt to it. but if you look at the heart of what poshmark has, we have an inventory less marketplace, super adaptable, inventory quickly response, as we've seen in terms of shifting our supply and demand, a very vast assortment, dynamic pricing and 7.8 million active buyers. but you combine all of that i think it gives us a lot of confidence that we'll be able to navigate through the challenges that come in the next few months.

and next up is tom nikic, wedbush securities.
tom nikic -- wedbush securities -- analyst
hey. good afternoon. thanks for taking my question. so when we think about poshmark in, i mean, i guess post idfa world or after you kind of readjust the marketing and stuff like that.
like how do we think about the top-line growth potential of the company? i mean you grew low double digits in q1, you're kind of guiding us to mid to high single digits for q2. i would imagine that that's not where you envision kind of the sort of multi-year growth trajectory of the business. so once the marketing is kind of realigned and some of those headwinds go away, like how do we think about gmv and top-line growth here?
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
well, let me start by -- that type of predictability or guidance, we're not kind of going there and give you guys like a number. but the way that we think about is we come back to the notion of the stickiness of our cohort. and as long as -- and in the early question, as long as we can continue to lower the cac, which saw an increase due to the idfa, and having conviction the ltv and getting that equation to remain positive or remain attractive to us, we continue to make that investment in marketing. on the top of that, one of the things that we are also doing is improving retention, which we have a set of 80 million users that we can drop on, and that can be another area of us just not to focus only on the top of the funnel or the new user acquisition, but also turn on some of our engines related to the retention.
there are a lot of opportunities there and the marketing team is actually working on it. but when you kind of step back and think about like the long term goals that i think we said on the roadshow, especially toward the profitability of the business, we have shown that we can be profitable, it'd be highly profitable. and what drives that is, first, again, most of our spend is variable and is still with our control. we have conviction today that continue to invest in marketing is the right thing to do.
if we needed to, we can kind of come back and slow down the growth in marketing spend. we just don't think this is the time to do so. and again, we are kind of sticking to the plan. we are making these a long term play in our ltv2 capture, they continue to be a positive equation and we continue to have that high conviction to continue to invest in marketing.

anna andreeva -- needham and company -- analyst
great. thank you so much. good afternoon, guys. two questions.
i think you said you saw sales acceleration in march. but just curious what drove that a little counterintuitive, i think march was tougher for the industry mostly. so was that better traffic or any specific categories that performed well? and then secondly, you had mentioned adding new leadership for posh core business to accelerate growth and execute better. can you provide some color on what they're focused on specifically and maybe some of the early innings -- early learnings from that? thank you so much.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
sure. thank you, anna. the first thing is, i think, it was a roll out of some of the core product innovation work we did, roll out of our new search, roll out of shop by trends. so it was the investment in our core product that was part of the acceleration.
and the second thing was some of the optimization we did on marketing in terms of our costs. so those were the things that help us counteract some of the macro challenges that were there in the second half of the quarter. in terms of the core leadership, we've added several executives actually just in the last few months. and a couple of things that we are really partnering with them is some of the core product innovation, adding some key aspects to the product and platform that we are growing, as well as adding to the overall financial and process management within the business.
so it's all about taking us to that next scale of leadership team to help us scale the business to the next level.
operator
our next question will come from ashley helgans, jefferies.
ashley helgans -- jefferies -- analyst
hey. thanks for taking our questions. you had active buyer growth in the quarter. we're just curious what you're seeing from the seller side.
and then also on the last earnings call, i believe you mentioned that you were exploring or potentially exploring some other countries in 2022. any update you could provide us that would be great. thanks.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
sure. i mean -- i think our seller ecosystem is, continues to be very healthy, we don't provide the actual numbers intra quarter. and what we did provide in q1 for was 2021 stack cohort retention metrics for our sellers and those were very healthy. coming back to -- can you repeat the question?
ashley helgans -- jefferies -- analyst
the second question was on the last earnings call. i believe you talked about maybe exploring some additional countries for international expansion in 2022. just curious if there was an update there.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
yes. no updates to share right now. we certainly continue to explore and make sure that our international plan continues to be healthy and growing and scaling, but nothing new to report yet.
operator
next up, we'll take a question from seth sigman, guggenheim.
seth sigman -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
hey, everybody. i wanted to follow-up on the margins and the cost question earlier. so seemed like most cost buckets actually came in better for the quarter, even excluding the sales upside. now, i think you mentioned some timing.
can you just elaborate on that timing? how much of that hit this quarter, when does that actually come back? and then based on the guidance, should we be thinking about q2 as the low point for ebitda for the year?
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
well, let me take, and there is some background noise maybe from the operator. your first question related to some of the goodness that we saw, again, based on two things. first was the marketing spend and the marketing spend came in a little bit lower than expected because of some of the phenomenal that we discussed about seeing the cpus getting slightly better than our expectation as we guided the high 40s, so that's contributed. we are still shooting for the high 40s in q2 and that's kind of how we started.
even though we comped april, like i said, we remain cautious for may and june, just because of that's when the seasonality started kind of lowering a little bit in our total gmv, as folks go to summer break and take a trip, etc. for ebitda, we are not guiding the second half. but how to think about it is we -- some of that spend in q1 is happening q2, mostly on the g&a, there were some shifts there and some of that sprinkled through to the second half as well. we are not guiding the second half but we are also not expecting to make drastic changes to the course of our other no marketing lines.
and then we kind of gave you guys an idea for q2 as a percentage of revenue, that's not a bad place to start as you update your models.
operator
up next, we'll take a question from brian mcnamara, berenberg capital markets.
brian mcnamara -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
hey. thanks for taking the question. so one of your peers had some pretty downbeat comments earlier in the week. i'm curious how fast do you guys think the digital resale market is growing, and are you taking share in your view? and with close to 80% of your market cap and cash, what does the market not appreciate about your stock here? thanks.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
we believe, i think, the resale market is pretty healthy. we're going through sort of a lot of the adjustments that you see in the broader e-commerce markets in terms of the growth, we all saw in the pandemic timeframe and just sort of a little bit of readjustment. we do believe our market share has grown a little bit, again, many of the resale players are still private. so we have to use second order data to take a look at that.
i think there's two things that are hard for the market to appreciate. one is the stage of development we are in and the investment required to develop this market. and i remember 10 years back when i started the company, nobody even believed that anybody would buy secondhand and today you can find a secondhand section at almost every major brand and every major retailer. so that's sort of the growth that has happened in a decade.
so if you look out another decade, it's going to be pretty phenomenal in terms of what happens here, especially as we look to the future on both the convenience aspect of secondhand, the variety, but also the impact to the planet. so that's one aspect of it. i think the second thing is just the growth that's happening in terms of the younger demographic, millennials and gen z and their adoption is a seismic shift. i remember i was talking to a group of shoppers and sellers in our company who are younger.
they're all in their early 20s and late 20s. and we were just talking about different ways of shopping. and i said, you guys talk about planet health, etc. and then you go in and talk shop some of the cheapest fashion clothing.
and their answer was secondhand is a little expensive. that is completely a 10 year opposite if i talk 10 years back. so i think part of the whole thing is as people are getting introduced to secondhand and understanding what's happening here, there's a generational shift that's happening and that's going to take time for people to fully understand. what we've done is preserved a very consistent partnership with both our sellers and shoppers through the 10 years.
if you go back 10 years and take a look at when we started, we had a 20/80 partnership with our sellers. 10 years later, we have a great 20/80 partnership sellers, we have a minimum fee. what is interesting is 10 years back, we had -- we offered our shipping at $7, today our shipping is $7.67. so that consistency ultimately allows for that stickiness of cohort combined with our social model and all of that, ultimately, i think will lead to the meaningful profitable growth that will manifest in the future.
so excited about the future. we are at a point in time in the history and sort of where we are.
rodrigo brumana -- chief financial officer
and i'll add a few things to manish's comments here, which i point this strength of our financial architecture. manish talks about the sticky cohorts. and when you go down to the p&l, you see high gross margins and you see the majority of our spend is variable within our control. we hold no inventory.
we are asset light. we proved that we could be profitable. we can be at any point we want, and we have a strong balance sheet. and i call your attention to $7.65 off cash per share.
so i think there are a few things here that the market may not be appreciating, and that's what i would add to manish's comment there.
operator
and everyone at this time, there are no further questions. i'll hand the call back to management for any additional or closing remarks.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
thank you, everyone for joining. and i know that week has been kind of interesting for everyone, so good luck with all your sort of things, and we hope to see you next quarter. thanks everyone.

manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
thanks, christine. hello, and welcome, everyone. thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2022 earnings call. before we discuss our second quarter results, i want to take a step back to reflect on our mission.
when we started poshmark in 2011, we focused on making selling a superpower by making, selling and buying fashion simple, social and fun by building the world's largest network of shoppable closets and creating a new, more human way to shop online. our social marketplace is designed to serve everyone, whether you're looking to make money, save money, experiment with new styles, or discover new people and brands. we built every aspect of poshmark to make selling so easy that anyone with a closet and a smartphone could do it. by empowering everyone to sell fashion directly from their closets, we're transforming shopping online.
this has driven our growth for more than a decade. the unique dynamic of poshmark is that over time, sellers become buyers and buyers become sellers. and by the fifth year, there is over 40% overlap between buyers and sellers. our community of highly engaged and loyal users is our competitive advantage.
and by serving and supporting them, we drove profitability even as we cut down marketing in the first half of 2020. as we mentioned on our last earnings call, we're focused on making poshmark the no. 1 destination for sellers by empowering them with the tools and support to grow their businesses and making our marketplace the most trusted destination for buyers. now let's discuss our second quarter results.
we're pleased to report that our second quarter performance exceeded our initial expectations due to our strong focus on execution. we reported a strong quarter despite a tough consumer environment, growing revenues 9% to $89.1 million, beating our expectations for the quarter. second quarter gmv grew 8% to $483.5 million, while on a two-year basis, gmv grew by 34% and revenues grew by 33%. our growth is driven by poshmark's approach to making buying and selling fashion simple, fun, and sustainable.
our users continue to choose poshmark as a top destination for selling items from their closets and shopping the closets of others. this, combined with our boutique sellers, continues to make poshmark or top destination for fashion, as demonstrated by 14% ttm active buyer growth to a record 8 million in the second quarter. we continue to evolve our marketing strategy to navigate the impact of apple privacy changes and a volatile macro environment. we're drawing attention to poshmark as a sustainable fashion destination, particularly for style and value-conscious shoppers who are feeling more constrained due to inflation, and as a place to make money from your closet.
our april marketing campaign focused on earth month and storytelling, highlighting secondhand styles and vintage trends. this resonated particularly well with our gen z and millennial customers who are shopping vintage and secondhand for eco-friendly purposes and nostalgia. during the second quarter, shoppers came to poshmark for their fashion needs and to discover the latest trends while saving money. our marketplace continues to reflect the lives' interest in changing needs of consumers.
during the second quarter, luggage and travel bags were up 50% y-o-y as shoppers embrace vacation and business travel again. as people return to work, shoppers are turning to resale in their hunt for formal workwear to make their budget stretch further. during the second quarter, blazers and suit jackets grew 61%, and sales of ties were up 45% year over year. the evolution of business casual into business comfort is driving a huge spike in sales for comfort sneaker brands like on running and hoka.
while orders for birkenstock sandals and flip flops were up 30% y-o-y during the quarter. zara flare jeans and abercrombie straight leg jeans were up 97% and 64% y-o-y in may, demonstrating that we continue to be part of the seismic shift in fashion as silhouette changes to elastic waist, relaxed fits, and flared bottoms. the power of poshmark's community makes selling and shopping simple. social interactions, combined with our marketplace platform, which provide all the tools a seller needs, make selling and shopping simple and fun.
sellers and shoppers and their engagement with our marketplace drove 70% year-over-year growth in social interactions to a record $57.5 billion during ttm q2 '22. social interactions range from duration to likes, comments, or offers on the platform. this social engagement drives community connection and ultimately conversion as more than 80% of all purchases are preceded by a social interaction, such as a like, comment, or offer. poshmark's social experience and inclusive community is a key differentiator as experienced sellers who are often posh ambassadors voluntarily reach out to help new sellers and provide mentorship.
poshmark sellers continue to not only share their own inventory but curate inventory from the closets of other sellers. after two years of lockdowns and virtual events, we have been overjoyed to return to in-person community events, which are an important part of helping our sellers grow their businesses. this important growth activation engine introduces the poshmark community to new sellers, fosters loyalty and connection at the micro-community level, and grows our highly engaged user base. these events create one-of-a-kind opportunity for our community to come together to socialize and share success stories and advice on how to build their businesses on poshmark.
we held 87 of these events in the second quarter, up from 35 in the first quarter, attracting community members from across the u.s. we're excited to host poshfest, our fashion and entrepreneurship conference and the biggest event of the year at the end of september. this two-day event focuses on educating attendees about merchandising, business planning, branding, and data to help sellers grow their businesses on poshmark. as our first poshfest back in person in three years, our community is ecstatic to once again have the opportunity to connect with one another and gain valuable expertise to increase their sales and have an immersive posh experience.
looking at the second half of the year, we continue to focus on growing our core fashion categories by continuing our product innovation to enhance both the seller and buyer experience. fashion-related categories, apparel, shoes, packs, and accessories, which is the core of poshmark, drives more than 90% of our gmv, and we remain focused on strengthening this core in 2022 to increase our wallet share gains with consumers and drive market share gains and gmv growth. higher contribution from premium-priced product continues to be one of the factors that drove year-over-year aov growth during the second quarter of 2022. we remain committed to growing our market share in premium-priced products and have started testing various applications of the technology from our suede one acquisition to drive innovation in our current authentication processes.
we intend to expand our authentication services to price points below 500 by the end of the year. we have a very seller-centric marketplace, and seller success and liquidity is where everything starts at poshmark. thus, we remain focused on product innovation to give sellers better ways to market, merchandise, and sell their listings and new ways for buyers to discover trends and engage with our marketplace to drive conversion. we continue to deliver innovative and easy-to-use solutions that contribute to the long-term growth of our sellers by helping sellers of all sizes easily manage their poshmark closets and connect with customers in new ways to drive sales.
in may, we updated my shoppers, our crm that we launched in october 2021, which enables sellers to communicate with shoppers who have engaged with their closets and make offers to group of potential buyers. we continue to make these powerful tools available to all our sellers with the focus on making selling simple and accessible to everyone from a seller with a few items in their closet to large resellers with thousands of items. this new version has seen higher adoption by sellers and resulted in an increase in seller offers. in june, we introduced closet qr codes, making it easy to scan, share view and engage with sellers' closets with a quick scan of your phone, which will be particularly useful with the return of in-person events, making it simple for sellers to market their closet to buyers and increase their number of followers.
personal closet qr codes can be used as an identifier on sellers' social media accounts printed on flyer and business cards are included in the packages they ship to buyers. we continue to be excited by the opportunity for brand closets to contribute to the growth of our core fashion categories. though still small, brand closets gmv during the second quarter of 2022 grew 1.5x compared to the first quarter of 2022. we continue to have a strong pipeline of interested brands and retailers.
during the second quarter, we launched our integration with channeladvisor, another milestone in making it easy for high-volume sellers to sell at poshmark, providing them with the ability to integrate our marketplace to synchronize product, inventory, and order information with other e-commerce platforms. as a style destination where shoppers come to discover, follow and shop, product innovation enables us to drive the treasure hunt for fashion. we continue to innovate our shop by trends feature and introduced trend guidelines in april. this feature allows sellers and buyers to see more details about trending products down to color, brand, and keywords.
it provides sellers with more ways to strengthen their trend-related listings and drive conversion. at the end of june, we added a new buyer protection banner to help drive trust and confidence with the new buyers. poshmark offers an amazing protection policy to all buyers, but not all buyers know about this policy, which includes refunding orders that do not match the listing description. initial tests of this new feature have shown an increase in buy-now orders, first-time buyers, new use orders, and new user gmv.
looking beyond the core, we view international expansion as a strategic long-term growth opportunity. in may, we celebrated poshmark canada's three-year anniversary. over the last three years, we have built and grown a community of over 4 million users across all provinces and territories in canada. these secondhand lovers and entrepreneurial sellers have listed close to $1 billion worth of inventory on poshmark.
over 2.6 billion total social interactions have been made on poshmark canada since launch. and our canadian community has attended over 100 virtual and in-person events. during the second quarter, we rolled out adyen as a new payment service provider in canada, which enabled us to process payments locally in canada instead of cross-border to the u.s., which saves in card network, cross-border costs. for the second half of 2022, the majority of our international investment continues to be focused on driving growth through advertising, community development and shipping innovation to grow our seller base.
in conclusion, our focus remains becoming the world's leading social marketplace and the no. 1 destination for sellers around the world. we're focused on what we can control and continue to innovate for the future, so our sellers can succeed. by tapping into our sellers' entrepreneurial spirit, we are positioning ourselves to emerge from any potential economic downturn stronger than ever.
we empower millions of sellers to easily turn their closets into shops and connect with customers, resulting in a flexible frictionless marketplace that's ready to meet the ever-changing needs of shoppers. we help poshmark sellers control their destiny through good and challenging economic times by providing them a reliable and supportive lifeline to help them pay their bills, build emergency funds cover college costs, and go after their dreams. our competitive advantage is a loyal community of fashion lovers who believe in our new way of shopping, one that is simple, social, fun, and sustainable. now i'd like to turn it over to rodrigo to dive deeper into the financials.
rodrigo brumana -- chief financial officer
thank you, manish. as we mentioned on our last call, we overcame tough comps in april and had a strong start to the quarter. in the latter half of the quarter, we experienced anticipated seasonality as consumers shifted their attention from cleaning out closets to preparing for spring and summer vacations, which was more pronounced in june. despite this seasonality, headwinds for inflation, and a slowdown in consumer spending, we still beat our revenue guidance range of $86 million to $88 million.
in q2 2022, gmv grew 8% to $483.5 million, up from $449.6 million in the second quarter of 2021 or 34% growth on a two-year basis despite a tough comparison. net revenues grew 9% to $89.1 million, up from $81.6 million in the second quarter of 2021 or 33% growth on a two-year basis. this result was ahead of our guidance of $86 million to $88 million, driven in part by a better-than-expected take rate and a 14% growth in trailing 12-month active buyers to a record 8 million, up from 7 million in the second quarter of 2021. on a two-year basis, trailing 12-month active buyers grew 32%, thanks to our continued marketing investments in product innovation.
our take rate in the second quarter was 18.4%, up slightly from 18.2% from last year, ahead of our expectations for flat year over year due to a better-than-expected cancellation rate. that more than offset the pressure from continued mix shift toward orders greater than $15. mix shift continues to be a take rate headwind as orders less than $15 have a higher take rate due to the flat fee of $2.95. cost of revenues of $15 million in the second quarter was 16.8% of revenues, an increase of 17% from the second quarter of 2021.
adjusted gross margin was 83.2% of revenues in the second quarter, down from 84.4% from the second quarter of 2021 due to higher hosting costs and the lapping of a nonrecurring credit in transaction payment processing fees, which was a 40-basis-point benefit during the second quarter of 2021. marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, or sbc, of $42.6 million in the second quarter was 47.8% of revenues, up from 38.6% in the second quarter of 2021. this result is in line with our guidance of high 40s. market increased 35% from $31.5 million in the second quarter of 2021 due to higher cpu, more in-person events, and community building initiatives, though cpus have improved slightly from their peak in january.
we remain supportive of our continued investment in marketing to introduce more users to our social experience, which promotes a strong cohort retention and loyalty over time. moving to other operating expenses, ops and support, excluding sbc, of $14.6 million in the second quarter was 16.4% of revenues, which is up from 14.9% in the second quarter of 2021 and is slightly better than expected due to lower cancellation rates and a slowdown in hiring in certain areas. r&d excluding sbc of $12.8 million in the second quarter was 14.3% of revenues, up from 11.5% of revenues in the second quarter of 2021. this was due to planned increasing hiring as we have previously discussed, as we continue to invest additional resources across a number of strategic initiatives.
r&d was slightly better than expected due to delays in vendor spending and a slowdown in hiring base. g&a excluding sbc of $14 million in the second quarter was 15.7% of revenues, up from 11.4% in the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to the ongoing costs of being a public company. stock-based compensation was $12.1 million in the second quarter, up from $8.1 million in the second quarter of 2021. adjusted ebitda, which excludes sbc, was negative $9.8 million, down from $6.5 million in the second quarter of 2021.
adjusted ebitda margins were negative 11% compared to an 8% margin in the second quarter of 2021. compared to last year, the decrease in profitability was primarily driven by investments in marketing, r&d, and g&a. however, it's important to note that these numbers were at the midpoint of our guidance of negative $9 million to $11 million. we will continue to focus on balancing marketing efficiency and investing for future growth.
operating loss, excluding sbc, was negative $10.8 million in the second quarter with operating margins of negative 12.2%. that compares to $5.7 million with margins of 7% in the second quarter of 2021. net loss to common shareholders was negative $22.9 million in the second quarter compared to negative $2.5 million in the second quarter of 2021. cash and cash equivalents were $581.2 million at the end of the second quarter or about $7.41 in cash per share.
moving to the cash flow statement for the six months ended in june 30, 2022. free cash flow was negative $3.5 million compared to $25 million for the six months ended june 30, 2021. we are focused on driving growth and continue to optimize our investments in product innovation and marketing to drive gmv growth for the future. we remain confident that our asset-light and high gross margin business model positions us to grow market share.
we help our community get more value for their money while meeting their wardrobe needs as they attend more in-person events and travel. and we are a relied-upon destination for consumers who want to supplement their income by unlocking the value in their closets. however, the current macro environment and the unpredictability of consumer spending behavior in the face of inflation leads us to be cautious in our outlook for the third quarter. we also continue to navigate changes in the digital advertising landscape and expect idfa to maintain pressure on cpu rates in the second half of 2022.
given the macro environment that could impact our top line, we have begun evaluating our cost structure in the third quarter and expect to begin rationalizing our spending, which is reflected in our outlook. now on to guidance. looking to the third quarter, we saw typical seasonality return in july as consumers focused on summer vacations. we remain cautious that inflation may continue to pressure consumer spending.
as such, we expect third quarter revenues of $85 million to $87 million, resulting in a growth of 7% to 9%. on a two-year basis, growth is expected to be 24% to 27%. we expect our third quarter take rate to be slightly higher year over year due to lower cancellation rates. we are focused on driving growth while managing our cost structure and expect negative adjusted ebitda of $9 million to $11 million in the third quarter as we continue to invest in r&d to drive product innovation, g&a to build the infrastructure necessary to evolve as a publicly traded company and marketing to grow our community of users.
we expect adjusted gross margin to be down slightly from q2 2022 due to higher hosting costs and as we lap 120 basis points of a nonrecurring credit in transaction payment processing fees during the third quarter of 2021. ops and support, excluding sbc, in the third quarter is expected to be 18% of revenues as we continue to invest in customer support and authentication services. r&d excluding sbc in the third quarter is expected to be 16% of revenues as we continue to increase our investment in product innovation to give sellers better ways to market, merchandise and sale their listings in new ways for buyers to discover trends and engaging in our marketplace to drive the conversion. g&a, excluding sbc, in the third quarter is expected to be 19% of revenues due to the higher cost of being a public company and as we build out finance, accounting, and legal teams.
we continue to expect marketing, excluding sbc, as a percentage of revenues to be in the high 40s in the third quarter, in fourth quarter as we invest in our brand, diversify our marketing channels, and address higher costs in digital advertising. we have proved that our platform is sticky. our cohorts delivered net positive gmv dollar retention over time. with high gross margins and a strong balance sheet, we have the ability and conviction to continue to invest in marketing to accelerate gmv growth for the future.
in the near term, these investments will enable us to build our community of sellers and grow active buyers, which will put us in a stronger position in the long run. in closing, consistent to what we have shared in our last earnings call, while we expect that macroeconomic factors could continue to impact consumer behavior in 2022, we are focused on our core business and execution. this includes, first, continuing to enhance our product experience to help our sellers grow their businesses; second, continuing to build our brand with the global consumer; and third, investing in marketing, talent, and robust operating mechanisms to improve execution and optimize long-term growth. i'd like to leave you with two final thoughts.
first, we have started the year putting more focus on our core business and improving our execution mechanisms. as we plan for the second half, we have identified ways to deliver more with less. and during the third quarter, we have begun the focus on cost savings where appropriate, as we previously mentioned. we will continue to explore these cost savings opportunities through the second half of 2022.
second, i'd like to remind you of the strength, uniqueness, and the stability of our business. unlike some of our peers that have seen recent transaction volume retracting to pre-pandemic levels, our business remains strong, growing, and we continue to add users to our sticky platform. we are not seeing big swings or volatility in users and gmv as some of the pure e-commerce peers are seeing. we believe our stability stems from a social aspect of our business that continues to attract and retain users, buyers, and sellers, which in turn drives high engagement and stickiness of our cohorts.
that fact, coupled with our asset-light model and a strong balance sheet, reaffirms our conviction to continue to invest in product innovation and marketing because our business model is resilient for the current environment and well positioned to benefit from secular trends in resale, sustainable commerce and consumers looking for value and unique looks. thank you. and i will now turn the call over to the operator so we can take your questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] we'll pause for just a moment to compile the q&a roster. your first question comes from the line of lauren schenk with morgan stanley.
lauren schenk -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you. i guess the 70% increase in engagement year over year is obviously an encouraging number. i guess what can you do to better convert that engagement to gmv? or what levers do you think are potentially the most powerful? and then just one quick follow-up.
just in terms of the macro backdrop assumed in the third quarter guide, are you sort of assuming a stable macro backdrop relative to 2q or perhaps slightly worse? thanks.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
i'll take the first question, lauren. this is manish. in terms of the conversion pieces, some of the core investments we are making on better search, better feed are sort of the core pieces to convert this engagement but also better tools. so some of the work we are doing with my shoppers lead sellers to be able to engage with these shoppers and convert them and activate them into final buyers.
so that sort of -- the key piece is better search, better feed, and ultimately more empowering seller tools that they can use to connect with their shoppers directly. let me have rodrigo give a little bit of color on that quarter.
rodrigo brumana -- chief financial officer
yeah. look, the question about macroenvironment, whether that we saw getting worse or not, let me kind of step back and give you the thoughts on the q3 guidance here. so you see a gmv deceleration from q3 as it relates to future. and number one is because we have seen a seasonal year-over-year growth deceleration from q2 into q3 over the past three years, that started in 2019.
number two, june gmv growth slowed down from may, and we saw a typical seasonality returning in july as consumers focused on summer vacations. number three, we remain cautious that inflation may continue to pressure consumer spending. and number four, we also continue to navigate changes in the digital advertising landscape as we expect idfa to maintain pressure on our revenue growth rates for the third and the fourth quarter, like i said on the call. and finally, when providing guidance, as usual, we are more conservative than historical performance given the current macroeconomic environment and circumstances.
and while our business offers great value proposition for the fashion we believe the consumers are buying fashion as life returns to normalcy. but we are mindful that macroeconomic challenges faced by the community can affect the community, and we have a conservative view in our outlook.
lauren schenk -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. thank you.

alexandra steiger -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. maybe one follow-up on your macro commentary here. can you maybe share like what you're seeing across the different markets and geos you're operating in over the past few weeks and months in terms of like how your customers but also your sellers engaging with the platform? and then maybe second, just on your pro sellers, i was wondering if you can give us an update on your push to grow your pro seller base and what type of tools and services you're focused on to improve that selling experiences for pro sellers. thank you.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
sure. so, what we're seeing in the united states is -- and then in canada, as well as sort of a return back to, i would say, the comps are closer to 2019 pre-covid. so, we're seeing seasonality and inventory mix shift more to pre-pandemic levels. and we've shared a little bit of that color in the commentary.
people are buying more back-to-school clothes. people are buying more luggage for travel. so, what we feel is that the world is slowly but surely returning back to normal. and fashion cycles are generally caused for sort of more turns of your closet.
so that's sort of a high-level picture that we are seeing. but inflation and other things make us cautious as we look into the future. when we think a little bit about how do we grow our gross sellers a lot of the investment we are doing is in scaling and connection. so, if you think of poshmark as a social selling platform, a lot of ways our sellers sell is by curation and connection.
so, we've invested in our bulk sharing tools to make it very easy to share. we also continue to invest in our crm, our customer relationship tool called my shoppers, which allows one-on-one connection between the seller but at scale. and we've added and enhanced these tools by adding prepackaged list of customers, giving them easier way to connect with more people at the same time and allowing them to also create some programmatic rules that they can use to program into these tools. and finally, we continue to look at new ways in which sellers can reach their shoppers and continue to innovate on that front, again, making that connection process that merchandising cost is both faster but also very efficient.
and overall, i think the tools have been received very well. the last piece i would emphasize is that the world is getting back to physical. so, we have also invested in our physical connections back with our sellers. we've started to host not just smaller events but larger events.
we had one of our larger posh party lives a couple of weeks back in l.a. this is the first large-scale event since the pandemic started actually really since 2019. and we have another one coming up in new york next week. and we're extending key pieces of -- key members of our team to kind of be part of that, and we're seeing a lot of our professional sellers and larger sellers come to these events.
and then lastly, our main conference called poshfest is also going to be in person this year in houston toward the end of this quarter. so very excited about all of those formats to also help our pro seller community.
rodrigo brumana -- chief financial officer
actually, i'll just add one thing since the question was also related to macro. the same way that manish is emphasizing the back to normalcy and that was addressing the seasonality in june and july, we also see a stronger start of august, which means back to school and people ending their vacation is also reflecting in our initial numbers as we kind of look through the quarter.
alexandra steiger -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of oliver chen with cowen.
oliver chen -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. regarding the trends that you're seeing in july, i would love to hear if there's continued volatility and how inflation is interplaying there and also on marketing efficiency trends.
rodrigo brumana -- chief financial officer
yeah. look let's talk about the inflation here. first, higher food prices -- higher food and gas prices could be a negative impact on apparel spend overall. however, an inflationary environment could benefit our marketplace, particularly for the more price-sensitive consumer as they search for value.
and on the seller side, we offer consumers an easy and empowering way to monetize their closets and make extra cash, potentially offset the next tank of gas. so we help poshmark sellers control their own destiny in tough economic times and as always. so -- but we have also a pretty big portfolio here. so it's hard to specifically identify the impact of inflation in terms of whether our assortment is increasing the prices or seeing the price increases because also over time, we see the increase in the average order value as customers look for premium priced products.
so it's hard to dissect the impact and, call it, specifically. but you see trends in higher euv impacting our platform and then you continue to see buyers and sellers kind of looking to poshmark. so that's one. in terms of marketing efficiency, like i said, we remain cautious just because the idfa was a step change to the entire industry, not specifically to us here at poshmark.
so we'll take through at least q4 to kind of fully lap it. but there is a positive sign stemming from when we see cpus right now compared to the january peak. it shows that we have been starting to kind of circumvent some of the headwinds, not fully. and there was always a question whether we are ever going to come back to the prior levels from idfa.
but we are seeing improvements on the marketing efficiency as we try different channels such as tv, creator content. and also, as manish said, we're also diverting some of the marketing spend to support the in-person events such as the poshfest. and we think that there is a lot of value on the community to see each other back again in person. we always measure the activity before and after, and there is always higher user engagement, more sales that come out of it.
so from a marketing efficiency standpoint, we are all improving slightly, but to improve year over time.
oliver chen -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you. and best regards.

your next question comes from the line of trevor young with barclays.
trevor young -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks. rodrigo, back to your commentary about the incremental investment and balancing that versus trying to find cost savings. is some of that savings just funding some of these new investments? or should we expect that to flow through to ebitda at some point maybe in the next year? and then bigger picture, given where you stand with cash on hand, how important is it for you to get back to positive ebitda sometime next year versus leaning in on spend as maybe some peers are pulling back?
rodrigo brumana -- chief financial officer
yeah. look, in terms of the ebitda -- so first, in terms of the cost structure, as we look at savings here and there, right now, we are using that to do two things: to continue our path and investing in marketing, especially because we are running the business from the long run standpoint. and we continue to support the market investments as long as our lifetime value continues to be very, very positive and which is the issue that we had with the increasing marketing as a percentage of revenue was essentially on the tax side the cost of acquisition increased because of the idfa. but our cohorts continue to behave well.
they continue to return the net positive gmv dollar retention over time. so with that, we are balanced on containing, let's say, the decrease in profitability but also committed to continue to invest in marketing. and like i said, we are committed to the high 40s at least through the end of the year as we guided marketing q3 and q4. remind me your second part of your question.
trevor young -- barclays -- analyst
just overall, given where you stand with cash on hand, how important is it to you to get back to positive ebitda maybe sometime next year versus continuing to lean to not spend, like you said, on marketing and other areas?
rodrigo brumana -- chief financial officer
yeah. let's not talk about next year, but let's talk about long term. we are committed to run this business toward profitability. there is no question about it.
but we are also an emerging company, and we see a tremendous opportunity in the market to acquire users because we know our platform is sticky. we know that when users come they transact, they engage. we saw 57 billion social interactions there. so we want to bring the users here because we know that long term, we will return on that investment.
so, look, we proved that we can be profitable. a couple of quarters ago we show that more than half of our spend is variable. we can be profitable at any point right now. we can count on the power of our balance sheet, and we can continue to see the positive metrics from the market acquisition.
so, we think that at this moment, building this company for the long run is more important. and then we know that we can count with our balance sheet in any case, and we know that we can be profitable at any time you want.
trevor young -- barclays -- analyst
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of ralph schackart with william blair.
ralph schackart -- william blair -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for taking the question. first, just on retention, i know it's something that you've talked about historically is a growing focus. maybe just sort of an update where you are in that process? how are those efforts been trending? and how are you thinking about this opportunity? and then i have a follow-up.
rodrigo brumana -- chief financial officer
ok. so we're talking about retention. we don't talk specifically on the quarter in terms of what is happening in the quarter. so we don't disclose cohort performance on a quarter basis on a full year basis.
but that said, this is the unique thing about posh. once we acquire a cohort, it delivers that consistent net positive gmv dollar retention. and we continue to see that as we reported the full year. so we will be reporting the full year in a couple of quarters, and we expect that to continue.
our cohorts continue to remain stable. and we see a strong engagement from our users, which is another evidence when we see the 70% growth in social interactions to a record of 57 billion interactions there. so we continue to see it. that's why we are continuing to invest in marketing because the lifetime value from our users is still a return on what we invest there.
ralph schackart -- william blair -- analyst
great. and you kind of referenced the large buyer base on the call. obviously, 8 million ttm active buyers is a large base. maybe talk about the opportunity to reengage this customer base, more specifically to grow wallet share with them, especially given the diversity of products and categories that you offer.
thanks.
rodrigo brumana -- chief financial officer
yeah. actually, even stepping back a little bit, if you look at, we have 80 million -- more than 80 million registered users in a couple of million active users -- so in the 8 million active buyers that we talked about. so the way we think about it is we target the inactive users as well. and we believe that the cost to reactivate the user or to retain a user is cheaper than acquiring a new user.
as i said, we still consider ourselves as an emerging company, but now we are also starting to divert some of the marketing spend from new user acquisition to retention. and there are three areas that we kind of use for this reactivation. number one is promotions. we have incentives and giveaways for both buyers and sellers.
number two is awareness. we have broad-based campaigns through tv, celebrities, and influencers that generate traffic and engagement for new and existing users. that's interesting because the awareness they actually go for both for new user acquisition, but we see pretty good in terms of retention. finally is search.
we have remarketing campaigns through google shopping, seo, and paid search there.
ralph schackart -- william blair -- analyst
great. thanks, rodrigo.

your next question comes from the line of rick patel with raymond james.
rick patel -- raymond james -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. my question is on the outlook for ebitda. your new guidance for the third quarter implies roughly the same amount of loss in the second quarter despite the revenue growth being a touch lower at the midpoint.
i guess as we think beyond the third quarter, and i know you're not guiding the fourth quarter specifically, but i'm hoping we can have color on the right way to think about things because your comparisons do get a bit tougher but you're also getting more aggressive with cost control. so should we expect ebitda pressure to be relatively contained as you exit the year? or is it reasonable to expect a different outcome?
rodrigo brumana -- chief financial officer
well, like you said, you're not guiding beyond q3. but let me kind of share how to think about it. in q3, we have just begun our spend rationalization. and as mentioned on the call, the q3 guidance reflects those cost savings that we are contemplating, but those are not impacting the fourth quarter given it takes time to implement.
but given the macroeconomic environment, we are taking the cautious lenses on the revenue guidance, and that flows through the ebitda. so, like you say, with a slightly lower guidance on the revenue that kind of flows through. again, we are not guiding q4, but high level, it's not a bad idea just to stick to similar levels as q3. thank you very much.

your next question comes from the line of ashley helgans with jefferies.
ashley helgans -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking our question. we were curious what you're seeing on the seller side. i'm wondering if you're seeing more people come to the platform as they look the ways to monetize their closet given the weaker macro backdrop. and then also, any update you can give us on the india market.
thanks.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
sure. yeah. the seller engagement is definitely higher as we've gone into q3. we're starting to see the sellers starting to come back.
i think it's driven by two things. certainly, the inflation and people's desire to make money. but i think it is also -- when you think about what people are facing is that they actually have to rotate their closets. they have to sort of start to refresh that wardrobe.
and in so many ways, people are realizing that when they are thinking about the various dimensions of how they engage with fashion, the answer comes back to their closet. and so in many ways, i think we're excited because we believe the future of fashion is in your closet. and that's super exciting to think about both on a seller and a shopper perspective. going back to india, i think we continue to see very good engagement numbers in india.
both india and australia, i think as the pandemic has receded, we're able to engage more with the community and start to expect that community developing. i think it's going to still take a little bit of time to get the revenue development fully happening, but the community development is starting to happen, and some of the core underlying engagement befits we see are very encouraging in both of those markets.

your next question comes from the line of anna andreeva with needham and company.
anna andreeva -- needham and company -- analyst
great. thanks so much. a couple of questions from us. you guys mentioned a couple of times taking a look at the expense structure.
can you talk about what specific buckets of opportunity that could entail? and then secondly, just a question on take rate. looking out longer term, what do you think is the right level there? do you guys expect that mix shift to above $15 purchase to continue to be a factor? or are there initiatives in the business to help offset that? thank you so much.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
let me just make a comment, and i'll turn it over to rodrigo to give more color. the mantra that we're using is quite simple internally. and it's to do less with more impact. and it's really all about prioritization, choosing fewer projects that have higher impact focusing on the core is the approach we are taking to how we are not just thinking about cost but where investments can be the most effective in the business.
with that, let me turn it over.
rodrigo brumana -- chief financial officer
yeah. with fewer things with higher impact and we have slowed down hiring. we are looking, being very judicious about contractor spend. there are things that are important, but they may not be prudent.
and then over here, the organization is actually helping quite a lot in making sure that we are spending on the highest priority. we want to do fewer and more impactful claims. and your question on the take rate, we do expect the secular trend that we have seen in our business of consumers moving to more premium-priced products might continue. the other thing is, even though we cannot specifically call out but the impact of inflation, even if you do nothing, the value of your closet will increase.
and the value of a new pair of jeans if you buy new will go higher, which means at some point, the market and the sellers react. so, i'm going to say, over time, you should expect a slight pressure on take rate just because of we should expect to see more orders higher than $15 as opposed to lower than $15. and as a reminder, below $15, we have the $2.95 flat fee. that's why the shift to orders higher than $15 will continue to be a slightly pressure to our take rate over time.

thank you. [operator instructions] please limit questions to one. your next question comes from the line of tom nikic with wedbush securities.
tom nikic -- wedbush securities -- analyst
hi. good afternoon, guys. thanks for taking my question. rodrigo, just at a high level, what needs to happen to get this business profitable again? and i know you say that you can do it.
you can be profitable again, anytime you want. but like what is the scenario where like you would be willing to manage the company to profitability again? is it when the revenue base or the user base grows to a certain level? is it dependent on the leverage of the marketing expense? and just trying to wrap my head around how the company becomes profitable again.
rodrigo brumana -- chief financial officer
yeah. well, as your question was high level, i'm going to give you a high-level answer, which is our focus on the core, focus on growing our user base, which translates to a higher seller base, which translates to a higher buyer base. when you do that at scale, that's kind of how we are going to get the best back to profitability. obviously, we could anticipate it, we could influence that sooner.
it depends on -- again, the large majority of our investment is variable. but it comes back to the focus on the core that we started this year and the mantra that manish was talking about fewer things with higher impact. and number three, like i said before, some of the investments we're making in infrastructure systems, procedures and operating mechanisms should drive a higher execution.
tom nikic -- wedbush securities -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of nick jones with jmp securities.
nick jones -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions. i guess just one on the expanding authentication below $500 by year-end. i mean how low will you take authentication? and i guess what are the puts and takes as to kind of the incremental cost to what the value of the product is? if it's a handbag that's extremely used, does it still need to be authenticated? i guess can you just expand a little bit on moving below that $500 price point? thanks.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
the strategy we want to take is to really empower the buyers and sellers to participate in it. and we haven't ruled out the possibility of maybe pricing it slightly but -- for lower price points. so that's the strategy we are looking at. we'll have more to talk about.
but ultimately, we feel that it is something that both buyers and sellers will feel empowered as we launched it so that they can use it based on their needs and not just sort of what we provide today, which is at $500 and higher, it's a free authentication. and the technology that we acquired with suede one allows us to have that leverage over time. so that's sort of the high-level thinking. but details will be fine-tuned as we get to the go-to-market strategy there.

your next question comes from the line of david bellinger with mkm partners.
david bellinger -- mkm partners -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking my questions. two quick ones. just first, following up on the cost controls. are those aimed more at, call it, longer-term initiatives that might not be significant revenue generators today? or can we expect to see some type of slower near-term revenue in gmv just given these expense pullbacks and the related follow-through? and then secondly, just any comments you can make on the traction you're seeing in some of the newer categories like pet and electronics now that those have been on the platform for some time? thank you.
rodrigo brumana -- chief financial officer
ok. look, the cost rationalization that we're doing right now, it should not impact revenue because we are focusing on things that can be deprioritized. and if there is an impact, the impact should be the minimum. and then that has been baked in our q3 revenue guidance.
so again, we are being very judicious here. and we can do that because, again, most of our spend is variable. and number two, we have access to a very strong balance sheet. so we can be very thoughtful about how and when we review our cost structure.
and again, we're in the first innings. and manish, why don't you take that?
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
on the pets and electronics, we're super encouraged by the contribution. both are still new, launched just last year. and just as a reminder, our noncore categories represent only 7% of our gmv, but they continue to grow faster than our core fashion categories in the business.
operator
at this time, there are no further questions. i'll turn the call over to management for closing remarks.
manish chandra -- founder, chairman, and chief executive officer
thank you, everyone, for joining us, and we'll see you next quarter. have a wonderful rest of the summer.
