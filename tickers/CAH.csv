thank you, sir. [operator instructions] . we will take our first question from george hill of deutsche bank. please go ahead.
george hill -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys and thanks for taking the questions. mike, i guess, can you help me square two things here. you talked about the early signs of positive trends that you're seeing in the pharmaceutical business, but i kind of want to square that with the guide, where it seems like operating earnings deceleration is going to continue through the balance of the year. so, i guess could you put a little more color on the positive trends that you're seeing and kind of help me square that with the guide for operating growth or actually operating -- kind of deterioration in the segment?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yeah, -- i'll let you start.
jorge gomez -- chief financial officer
george. thanks for the question. look, i think the way we're thinking about this is, we're really pleased with the first quarter results. i'll start with that, and certainly it gives us increased confidence in the full year. at the same time, i'd say we're very cautious and that we're only one quarter into the year. and we got some pretty significant assumptions out there that are still left open, for example brand inflation and there's also a lot of other key kind of environmental assumptions that we're making that could change. so our view is, this is early stage in the year, there's just no reason to be changing our full year guidance. we'll certainly be in a much better position to do that after our next quarter earnings call.
george hill -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay, that's super helpful. and then maybe just a quick follow-up is, did we see a full quarter of the cvs reprising this quarter. and is there any way to call out the impact of that?
jorge gomez -- chief financial officer
we did see the full quarter. and we have not provided any specificity in terms of the annual impact of that contract renewal.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
thanks.
george hill -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. helpful, thank you.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
operator? next question please.
operator
thank you, sir. we will now take the next question from glen santangelo of guggenheim partners. please go ahead.
glen santangelo -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
oh, yeah. thanks and good morning. mike, i just wanted to follow up on the strength in the medical business. in the past few years, you talked about the challenging market conditions, some of the supply chain issues, it sounds like this quarter, the company did a great job on the cost side. but what else has changed to help drive that performance, so we can maybe think about the sustainability of the results, you posted this quarter?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yeah, thanks for the question. yeah, i feel really good about the mid-segment. they performed a little better than we expected in q1 and really happy with the transition of steve mason in his role. he has done an excellent job of getting up to speed so far, it really surrounded himself with a solid team. sg&a clearly was a component of our performance in the quarter. but there are multiple areas where we are working through various performance improvement. for one example of service levels now are not only back to where they were at the acquisition of patient recovery products, but are actually better than at any time, while we held the business. so we've made a lot of progress in service levels, we're making solid progress on both sg&a and items that will really drive cogs and we're a different innings on each one of those, but really happy so far with what we saw in the first quarter of medical.
glen santangelo -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
thanks, maybe i can just have one follow-up for dave. dave you maintain the guidance for the full year, but you called out specifically that the operating profit in 2q would be lower than q1. could you maybe just help us think about some of the assumptions in that sequential second quarter or some of the seasonal items that are may be driving that outlook in 2q. thanks.
david evans -- interim chief financial officer
yeah, absolutely. so i'd say, first of all, we said modestly lower. and we think about that. we think about a variety of factors that could change from quarter to quarter. one for example would be our sg&a spend. we've got a large inventory of investment opportunities to drive long-term improvements, and those are ramping up. and so the level, the spend, the pace that's spend, we expect to increase in our second quarter. further, we have -- what we've talked about the cvs and to kroger's contract renewal being effective july 1st. we do have other contract renewals, in a much smaller scale, but yet, other contract renewals that will be occurring in the second quarter and throughout the year.
and finally, i would also say that we have some customers that we've experienced difficulty either through bankruptcy or other financial distress, where we're expecting some modestly lower volume in the second quarter than the first quarter and is that volume declines will capture our fair share of that, but we will only capture our fair share of that is our current assumption. so there is a lot more depth in that, but i'd say those are some of the headlines, it gives us some reason to believe that q2 won't be just simply a mirror image of q1.
glen santangelo -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question from ricky goldwasser from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
ricky goldwasser -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah, hi, good morning. my question is related to opioid comments. when we think about that $5.6 billion that you are now reserving, if that is that being the final number and within that 18 year timeframe, would that have any impact on the business, the core business. and if so, do you have the degree of freedom, do you have to offset that with additional streamlining initiatives?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yeah, thanks for the question. it broke up a little bit, ricky. so if i -- if i don't quite get the answer, right. feel free to follow up on that, in particularly. i can't provide a lot of details on it. but, first of all, the settlement is spread over 18 years. and so that's important to know. we continue to believe that settlement is something that will be a consideration as we look at capital deployment, but not a limitation as to when we look at capital employment or investments.
we do believe that the overall settlement framework is something that is supported by a bipartisan group of state attorneys general and is -- does provide a framework by which hopefully we can continue to not only get this behind us, but also get meaningful funds to the people that needed begin looking at the distribution of the free goods, so they're out there and also look at other ways that the industry can work together to improve the overall monitoring of opioids.
so i'll stop right there. and cfo, able to answer your question or not.
jorge gomez -- chief financial officer
no, you did. thank you, mike. let me just have a quick follow-up, or maybe not so quick, but when we think about the long-term financial profile and obviously in the quarter revenue up mid single digits and profit were down, because of the renewal that you talked about it, we'll see throughout the year that when we step back and we think about the industry and a steady state in your assets and once you normalize for the renewals and taking into account all the way streamlining in efficiencies that you talked about in your prepared comment, what type of operating profit growth do you think the business can support long-term with a mid single-digit type top line growth.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yeah, thanks for the question. it's too early for us to give any really comments on '21 and beyond. i would just say that we feel really good about the progress that we made this quarter both in investing in the growth areas that we've talked about specialty at home in our services businesses but also getting after our cost structure.
i think dave made a comment, that's really important is, this isn't just a cost reduction, this is taking entire cost structures out in a way that they won't come back, that the culture and the way the leadership is working is really driving at prioritizing and focusing us on the right things. so we're spending dollars in the right space, taking advantage of digital technologies, robotic automation ai etcetera. in order to really drive our cost structure down. so we feel really good about achieving our overall $500 million, number$130 million number for this year and really have this built into our overall culture and but again it's just too early for us to make comments on '21 and beyond, but we feel that we are not only getting after our cost structure, but investing for growth, which is really important.
next question?
operator
thank you sir. our next question comes from charles rhyee of cowen, please go ahead.
charles rhyee -- cowen & company -- analyst
the cowen. yeah, hey, thanks for taking the questions. mike, just wanted going back to the opioids real quickly your comments. and one of your peers today, it sounds a lot more positive. i would say maybe then the comments from many other companies the other week. anything kind of changed in the last week or two, that kind of increases sort of optimism here in terms of getting, sort getting toward a global settlement?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
i wouldn't say anything change. let me just step back and make sure that we're on the same page, as you know a few weeks ago, we settled with two ohio counties, which by doing that enabled us to move forward with this framework, that was an important component of being able to get that behind us, so all of the parties involved in the global framework could move forward and begin working on. so that's an important thing to know we clearly have a global settlement framework and structure with the $18 billion over 18 years with our component being 5.56 billion.
we've also agreed upon distributing the free treatment medications for 10 years, and we've agreed that when we get this behind us, we could all work together to look at the way states, federal government, distributors everybody work together to monitor opioid shipments and uses so that we can work together. we think the desired how if we can get this behind us how it will bring meaningful relief in both funds and distribution of treatment medication to the people that needed is important, and so we feel positive that folks will work hard on this to get this going so again, nothing specific. but our belief is that the way this is structured that, this is the right accounting for us at this point in time.
charles rhyee -- cowen & company -- analyst
and if i could just follow up. great. obviously if you look at the number of plaintiffs. i mean -- i forget the last count right it's upwards of 2000 [phonetic] or so obviously states are a big component of it, but you have a lot of smaller plaintiffs. i mean as i read some of the comments from [indecipherable] as well as, who speaks toward it, it kind of suggest that not only synergies, but also a lot of the other places.
can you kind of discuss like sort of the participation of sort of the smaller entities kind of in this -- in other words, if you get this framework done, do we still have a long tail of small plan just kind of kind of coming after group of players here or is it kind of the structured in a way, would you think that this will achieve the looking for.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yeah, good question. i would say this, i would put you could probably put them in many, many buckets. when we put them in three broad buckets there is states, there is the political subdivisions, the counties, the cities. and then there's what, we'll call more private plaintiffs which would might be pension funds or individuals and those things. this global framework is put together to settle the first two, all of the state claims as well as the cities and political subdivisions. and the accrual that we put on the books is to represent the global framework we did for those first, two buckets, that third bucket, which there is also still suits out there are very different and it's a mixture of different things. and those are still out there and we think that we will have to address going forward. next question?
operator
thank you. we will take our next question from steven valiquette of barclays.
steven valiquette -- barclays -- analyst
great, thanks . good morning, mike and dave. so, a kind of following up a little bit in that last question, one of your peers has some very different language in their press release this morning about when they make accruals and when they don't, but without getting too much into that. i guess the question is, is there any possibility that cardinals further along or closer to a settlement agreement than some of your distributor peers. and is there any scenario, where cardinal may reach global sentiment, but your peers may not, or is it kind of all three or none around the global settlement. i'm just curious to get your extra thoughts on that. thanks.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yeah, thanks for the question, no, i would say that cardinal is not, it's doing anything different this is just our understanding and belief of lay the global framework is set up, that we believe the accounting that we've done is appropriate for the circumstances in our -- on that.
steven valiquette -- barclays -- analyst
and one of your peers talked about a settlement maybe still be in months away, and that seem to be different than what some investors were thinking, to me i think, and that's still a pretty short time horizon given the number of parties involved, but is there any extra color on when do you think the timing could be nailed down on a settlement.
david evans -- interim chief financial officer
yeah, it's really hard to actually predict timing, but it's not something that we think is going to get done tomorrow, there is work to be done. and as i mentioned, we believe settling the two counties, getting that behind us and allowing the state ag's to begin the process of working with the political subdivisions, plants, attorneys, etcetera, that process has begun and we are fully supportive and we'll do what we can to help in that process and it will take some amount of time, but it's really hard to predict what that will be.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
next question?
operator
we will take our next question from lisa gill from jpmorgan.
lisa gill -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thanks very much. good morning, mike. as we think about the global settlement. i don't think about it from a tax perspective. i'm just trying to figure out what the impact will be to cash flow, you talked about the fact that there'll be some impact, but really shouldn't change how you think about capital deployment. so that would just be my first question was how do we think about the tax implications?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yeah. lisa gill. thanks for the question. the intent of this is consistent with the public policy and guidelines of the irs and the state tax authorities to make this tax deductible. having said that, the details and specifics of this agreement really just aren't current there right now to provide to provide the level of precision that ultimately will have, nor is the complete clarity of the tax code they're at this stage. so from an accounting perspective, we just followed accounting guidance and established what we believe is an appropriate reserve for what will be tax deductible.
with that, i'd say we will continue to become more clear as time marches on and the specifics of both the tax code and the settlement offer become more clear.
and as far as the cash flow impact goes lisa, as you said, while it's spread over 18 years specifically how it will be paid and funded each year is still being worked out. so it's hard for us to give you any real color on the exact timing and impact of cash flows, but as you can imagine we spread it out over time in order to be able to still manage our business effectively going forward.
lisa gill -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and then mike, if i could just sneak one in add policy today thoughts around, reimportation and the potential impact that that could have to cardinal and drug distribution in general?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yeah, it's an interesting question -- it's one of those things that it's probably a little too early to get into a lot of detail. this is something that i could remember working on 15 years ago when we thought it was going to be imminent and working on setting up all of the capabilities internally to help make sure that if it did happen, there would be a safe supply chain. and i think the focus on reimportation has to be on patient safety. and i think that cardinal is as well positioned as anybody that if this were to get some legs that we would be able to work with folks to help make sure that any reimportation was done on a safe basis, it's hard to imagine that it could be material in any way to affect our businesses. but if it did happen i think cardinal was well positioned to help any of the folks that would do that. next question?
operator
thank you. we will take our next question from robert jones from goldman sachs.
robert jones -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thanks for the questions. mike, i just wanted to go back to some comments from the prepared remarks around the financial distress of certain customers. i guess, first, i'm assuming that's the some retail independence but wanted to confirm that. and then could you talk a little bit about what you think is driving this? was it kind of a one-off related to a certain pocket of customers or is there anything more systemic you're seeing in the marketplace around the health of some of your maybe perhaps smaller customers?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
no this isn't -- those comments were not meant. so i'm really glad you asked. we're not meant to talk about the small customers. this was really about the bankruptcy threats and the continuing restructuring of the kmart account and two accounts that we've had that we've been managing over time that we're both generic buyers of ours and as -- as those volumes -- as you decline due to their financial situation that has had some impact on us, but that's really what we were referring to in those comments.
robert jones -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it, got it. thanks for the clarification. and i guess just one follow-up on the medical guidance. you guys mentioned that you're monitoring the medtech -- the med device tech and tariffs as it relates to guidance, and clearly the guidance would imply a deceleration over the course of the year. so i just wanted to maybe get a better sense of what may be the guidance looks like, if in fact those items -- don't in fact come to fruition. and just one point of related to medical, i want to make sure i was thinking about this. i believe you're lapping a fairly meaningful headwind from of supplier charge in 4q wanted to confirm, that that was right as we just think about the cadence around the medical guide for the rest of the year?
david evans -- interim chief financial officer
yeah bob, that's absolutely correct in terms of the second half of your statement. we will be lapping in the fourth quarter reasonable charge that should be non-recurring. with respect to the balance of the year, we have not built in as we said last quarter with the full-year guidance. we've built in nothing with respect to the med device techs. so if it doesn't come to fruition, then that's consistent with the guidance we provide. and clearly, if it does, and that's going to be a headwind we have to manage through.
tariffs are just such a dynamic topic that we've done our best to offset, to tariffs that are in effect now, but that again is changing. so let's say if that would completely seize any further dialog around tariffs then what we've -- what's been announced today, we've more or less been able to manage through that. what i would say is, there are still a lot of other sg&a initiatives that mike talked about, that too have a longer runway and therefore they aren't necessarily all that the cadence isn't equally distributed among four quarters. i'd really highlight some of the supply chain initiatives that have a long runway and won't necessarily bear fruit for it could be two, three years, but we are incurring cost to begin to plan for those this year and as well the sales force restructuring that we've discussed as well is kind of a in flight through the course of the year.
so that's not something you can just kind of ratably divide by four and say it's going to be equal in terms of the cost of the benefits. so, look, i think you're right in that the fourth quarter does have a tailwind this year and the fact that there non-recurrence of the charge. but we just -- we feel, i guess i would say cautiously optimistic for the year based on the first quarter but feels too early stage given all these variables that are out there to call anything up at this early stage.
operator
thank you. we will take our next question from eric percher from nephron research.
dolph warburton -- nephron research -- analyst
hi, this is dolph on for eric. question about the in-kind portion of the potential settlement. is the -- let's just take it. if you take $1 billion of value, is that $1 billion of revenue. and if so, is there, are you able to determine kind of the costs, or i guess the better question is what does an in-kind service really look like for cardinal.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yeah, it's a great question. that would be an area that is still looking to be defined yet, but essentially there one of the folks that's settling in the case is contributing free goods, is the essential idea here and the thought is that the three distributors would agree to distribute those free goods to the people that needed. none of the actual cost of distributing those free goods, because we don't have enough information on that are included in our overall accrual. that being said, we, at this time, don't think that would be material, but don't have enough information to know but the concept is just being able to take those drugs and then using the efficiency of our overall supply chain of the distributors to get to those to the folks that need the most.
dolph warburton -- nephron research -- analyst
great, thank you. and then just the follow-up. the difference between the charge listed in the text of the release and what's listed as an add-back pre-tax. it looks like about $40 million. should -- i assume that's legal services in the quarter or is there something else causing the difference?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
no that the breakdown.
david evans -- interim chief financial officer
we got two components, the primary two components of course that our pro rata share of the $18 billion and then there is the pro rata share of the two ohio county settlements. the remaining small difference relates to something, i believe we may have spoken in the past about, which is in our med supply business. our cordis business ivs product, which we continue to accrue for a loss contingency on that as well. it's a fairly small number, but if you get to the third decimal digit that's what you're going to find is iv soon.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
next question please?
operator
thank you. thank you, sir. we will take our next question from stephen baxter from wolfe research.
stephen baxter -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks for the question. i wanted to follow up on the opioid discussion. really appreciate all the color and insight you provided thus far. i wanted to come back to the outlook for share purchase. so, if we were to treat this settlement like debt, this settlement would point to trailing leverage approaching 4.5 times. so it sounds like you're saying that the settlement framework as currently proposed would not be a limitation on capital deployment? so i'm hoping you can help us square your comfort level with this implied leverage, how you think the debt rating agencies
rating agencies are going to look at this issue and the importance of maintaining an investment grade rating to the company. thanks.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yes. first of all, i would say that we. i wouldn't say that remember -- it is a consideration, we say don't see it necessarily as limitation, but clearly once we understand the flows of the cash over the 18-year period. we're going to have to take that in consideration in all of our capital deployment pieces, but let me turn it over to dave. to give you a little color on our thoughts around the rating agencies and what we could talk about.
david evans -- interim chief financial officer
yeah look first of all, we've good relationships, the rating agencies and we stay in close contact with them. so it's a continuous dialog. second, our investment grade credit rating is very important to us. it's something that we value and we'll continue to monitor and manage to maintain that. what i'd say when you look at the leverage the numbers that you're saying, a couple of factors: one recall this year we've committed externally to delevering by at least $1 billion.
so as we look forward on this of that number will be coming down. and second of all, i'm not sure, i'm not going to speculate on the credit rating agencies are paying and where they're going to land, but i think there is multiple scenarios between saying this is zero liability or it's the book accounting accrual liability, for example you could look at, it's just the discounted future cash flow about the future years payments, which nets you a number, it's quite a bit smaller than the headline $5.6 billion.
so we'll see how the credit rating agencies of apply on this where they land. so at this point i'd say, we'll be focused on this, we will make a substantial bite of the apple this year and we'll continue to monitor this in the broader scheme of our capital allocation policy in the years ahead.
stephen baxter -- wolfe research -- analyst
great, thanks. one quick follow up, i'm just given how you started out the year on cash flow, can you remind us what you're expecting for the full year for operating cash flow or at least some directional context relative to the past couple of years. thanks.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yeah, so, but we have not provided cash flow guidance in the past and we didn't provided this year. so i'm not going to speak to that, it just -- i'd say if you look at the fundamentals, the fundamentals are not structurally different than last year. we continue to work on working capital efficiency initiatives. we continue to drive strong cash flow, you will see anomalies based on a point in time, but i wouldn't say we expect anything materially different year-over-year, without providing a finer point to it in terms of giving you any specific guidance.
kevin moran -- investors and financial media
next question.
operator
thank you. thank you. we will take our next question from john ransom from raymond james.
john ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning. just going back to the stuff we used to talk about a lot, mike and i know you're probably answer this question 18,000 times of your carrier, but it's interesting to us what's happening with the generic cycle in that the pricing at a manufacturer level has certainly upfront. so we calculate deflation having dropped from the high digits to something like the mid single digits, whereas the, at the pharmacy level reimbursement pressure just continue. so you're seeing an accelerated squeeze at the pharmacy.
so i just wonder you guys being a student of the pharmacy and you're already talking about fred's and kmart. how long can this go on without just continued chaos and the independent pharmacy channel.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
well, that's a tough question to really talk about. so i'll give you a little bit of color. a few things come to mind. i'll talk about it from both sides. first of all, i think our, all of our customers are -- a few one offs like a fred's and the kmart. but as we look, our retail independents in general have stated roughly the same number over several years now, they continue to find not only ways to work through the reimbursement challenges, but to continue to find other ways that compete in the marketplace, whether it be through packaging, through additional services through front end, through just the high quality service that they give every day, and i think the chains continue to do the same through automation and other programs themselves.
so i think that that the chains, including the independents, all of the retail pharmacies, continue to be an important component of getting pharmaceuticals to patients and so we're, it's something we're always going to keep our eyes on, but i think they've learned how to compete in this marketplace, as far as on our side, we have seen some improvement as we said in the market dynamics around the sales side, pricing side. remember our generics program is made up before components and we've always said it sales side -- by side launches and overall volumes with our customers because of some of the customers we mentioned, we've seen a little bit of weakness on the volume side than we expected, and the new item launches. as you know, we're always highly fluctuating and can change that's been a little less than we expected so far this year. and all that getting together our generics program came in about as expected.
john ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. and just switching gears a philosophical question. we're all kind of scratching our heads about how to treat this settlement, but if this is going to -- if it's an 18 year settlement and that's just an annual cash outlay, why would that be added back to adjusted earnings. i mean, it's not something like amortizations or non-cash or it's not a one-year one time is, -- isn't this just best thought of as a reduction and adjusted earnings for almost 20 years. why would we had this back.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
well, so the way i'd answer that is, this is -- be a charge to the p&l over 18 years. it's a cash cost. but from a gaap accounting p&l expense perspective the charges recognized initially once and that was what you saw recorded this quarter. and so recognizing 18 year charge, we did call out as a gaap to non-gaap adjustment and appropriately. so , i think we might be mixing and matching cash and expense charges is that, does that answer your question.
david evans -- interim chief financial officer
i mean, if i could just push back on that, it seems like we want to have it both ways in terms of if it's -- if it's helpful we add it back, i mean. yeah, i get you can take the charge, you want, and but it's going to be a reduction of what i would call cash earnings and so yeah, add back amortization that's not cash. i get that or a one-time, but this is an actual reduction. so it just seems like we're having it both ways to take this big accounting charge but then added back to adjusted earnings.
so yeah, the mismatch, it seems like we're -- a little bit, having it both way, that's all.
yeah, i understand your question. i think what i look, when we make gaap, non-gaap adjustments. that's for when we have an expense or credit in the current period p&l that we add back or subtract out to get to non-gaap. in the case of this opioid accrual we won't have a p&l charge in future periods. so there won't be anything to add back to get to non-gaap earnings.
now, i suppose, i think you will look at this from a cash perspective and certainly everyone can model the cash flow impact for the next 18 years, but that's separate from, really it just won't really be in the equation in terms of a gaap versus non-gaap adjustment because it won't be a charge in future p&ls. so it won't be anything add back .
kevin moran -- investors and financial media
next question.
operator
thank you. we will take our next question from erik coldwell [phonetic] of baird. please go ahead.
analyst
thanks, good morning. all of my snazzy questions have been answered already, but i have a couple of technical ones. i think it was. bob did asked about the medical device tax you admitted it's not in guidance, it could come back, what would be the actual impact or best estimate of the impact if it does come back, in dollar terms.
secondarily, commodity cost inputs and fx in the medical segment. i'm curious if you can give us some sense of the impact those had on profit in medical, thank you so much.
david evans -- interim chief financial officer
yeah. so first, with respect to the medical device tax. it's -- we don't have complete clarity on this. so i don't have a precise answer for you, but i would say that on an annualized basis, we believe it could be in the neighborhood of $40 million to $50 million on an annual basis. okay. so if we look at for -- if it's effective in january, the second half of the year, it prorate that. again i'll just kind of caution that that's based on a lack of perfect clarity and information. and so if that were to actually happen we'd be prepared to provide a more precise answer to that stage.
the second question was related to fx. look, we have fx that shows up in different areas of our p&l. we have some that's showing up in the segments, and then you may have noticed an interest another. we have other changed a bit and that's principally driven by fx. i would say that on a net basis, fx in the first quarter was reasonably neutral, was not a material driver positive or negative. i think the team is doing an excellent job in managing this and navigating through this as appropriate.
analyst
and the commodity costs?
david evans -- interim chief financial officer
oh, i'm sorry. commodity costs?
unidentified participant
yeah, mike might [indecipherable] pointed that out yesterday.
david evans -- interim chief financial officer
yeah, i know, i apologize. let me -- so commodities for us in the first quarter, i describe it as a small headwind, we're in a headwind, but not in a material way.
unidentified participant
thanks very much.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
and the next question.
operator
thank you. we will take our final question from kevin caliendo from ubs.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks for -- thanks for getting me in, guys. so my question on the opioids is just how much confidence do you have that 18 billion over 18 years that this will be the final layout, between the levels three or the tier 3 groupings that you mentioned earlier. if this is really going to be the final number for the mdl and for everybody else, and that you can really put this to bed with this kind of settlement.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yeah, thanks for the question, kevin. look, it's still too early to tell. as i said, this global framework does only impact the first two buckets. there is no accrual or ability to even estimate and understand the size of the last bucket that we talked about. but as far as the global framework, we have to separate both the accounting in the likelihood of this getting done in our mind and this framework is something that we support.
we like that it's being supported by a bipartisan group of ags and it's something that we're behind, but it's still too early to tell you whether or not it will be successful but we do think not only is it something that we can support, and it has a support of them, but it is something that's important to the people that needed much most, because it will get dollars, free drugs and some essentially new processes out there that i think all benefit the country.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
sure. and just one quick follow-up, when are out visiting you guys, you talked about a restructuring of the medical sales force compensation. did that impact 3q in any way? or -- and how are you thinking about the impact of what that the incentive program for sales force might have or have had on medical going forward?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yeah, that's something, it's one of the really key things going on in medical that, steve and the team are leading. as i mentioned in the prepared remarks, this structure, restructure is a component of not only compensation and sales incentives, but also around how we go to market to best address selling to the customers, they want to our customers, the way they want to be sold to. so we did a lot of work out talking to and understanding the way our customer base would like us to come to them and how they would like to be serviced. and so this restructuring was highly defined by a lot of detailed work.
we started to -- we put it in place in our q1. and as far as incentives go changing the jobs, interviewing folks for roles, both internally and deciding that in some rules we needed to go externally for the right level of talent the way we want to work and we would expect that that entire restructuring will be done and behind us by the end of our q3 and that we would start to see benefits from that next year in fy '21. so we're really excited about it, and like the progress we're making.
so the next question.
operator
there are no further questions. so i'd like to hand back to your hosts for any additional or closing remarks.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
well, thank you all for joining us this morning. we're really pleased to be off to a solid start to our fy '20 and we look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months. take care everyone.

operator
good day, and welcome to the cardinal health inc's first quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]. at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to mr. kevin moran. please go ahead, sir.
kevin moran -- investors and financial media
good morning and welcome to cardinal health first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. today, i'm joined by mike kaufmann, our chief executive officer; and david evans, our interim chief financial officer. you can find today's press release and presentation on the ir section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com
during the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. the matters addressed in the statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. please refer to our sec filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a full description of the risks and uncertainties.
note that during the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-gaap basis, unless they are specifically called out as gaap. our gaap to non-gaap reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release. we will provide an update to our fy '20 outlook on a non-gaap basis. we do not provide guidance on a gaap basis due to the difficulty in predicting items, that we exclude from our non-gaap results.
during the q&a portion of today's call, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up, so that we may give everyone in the queue a chance to ask a question.
with that, i'll now turn the call over to, mike.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
thanks, kevin. and congratulations on your new role. good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us today. i'm here with dave evans, and i'd like to welcome him to his first call as our interim cfo. dave has done a great job getting up to speed over the past few months. i'm grateful for his leadership and experience as we conduct our search for a permanent cfo.
this morning, we'll cover our progress in our path forward. i'll start with a few high-level thoughts on the quarter and then dave will cover the financials. i'll close with some thoughts on how we will build on the solid start to the year. we remain confident in our strategic direction as we focus on driving both efficiency and growth. our q1 performance validates our short-term progress and longer term path. at the enterprise level, our disciplined cost management is enabling strategic reinvestment across both segments as well is in critical functional areas.
in the pharma segment, we are seeing early signs of positive trends. and although we still have work to do, we are making progress in key areas. in medical, we are encouraged by early traction from our improvement efforts, as well as the initial returns from ongoing investments in our growth platforms. i'll share more about this work in both segments later in my remarks, but first i'll turn today to walk you through our results in the specific milestones, we achieved in q1.
david evans -- interim chief financial officer
thanks, mike, and thanks everyone for being with us today. i'm pleased to join you on my first call. i'll walk through the numbers and highlight a few actions taken in q1 to demonstrate our commitment to long-term growth. overall, i'm happy to report that we delivered earnings of $1.27 per share in the first quarter, which were ahead of our expectations. total company revenue increased 6% versus last year to $37.3 billion. consolidated gross margin increased 1% from last year to about $1.7 billion.
the decline in gross margin rate principally reflects year-over-year pharma distribution contract renewals and products and distribution mix. sg&a, which includes variable distribution related expenses improved 2% despite higher revenue. this improvement reflects sustained organization wide efforts to streamline our cost structure. mike will elaborate more on some of these efforts in a few minutes, but i'd like to say that in just a few -- the few months that i've been here, i've already seen this effort evolve from a cost reduction initiative to a broader cultural mindset of efficiency and improvement.
total operating earnings were $577 million, a 6% increase from the prior year, driven by performance in the medical segment. interest and other expenses were roughly flat versus prior year at $80 million. this reflects a decline in interest expense. our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24%. this compares to last year's rate of 14% which was impacted by changes to our international legal entity structure. average diluted shares outstanding were 297 million, about 9 million fewer than last year.
during the quarter, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program to opportunistically buyback $350 million of stock. we retired 80% of these shares in q1 and expect to complete the program in our second quarter. combining share repurchases and dividends, we returned well over $400 million to shareholders in the first quarter, demonstrating our continued commitment to book to deploying capital on a balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly way.
moving on to cash flow, operating cash for the quarter was a use of $653 million. as a reminder, timing, in particular, the day of the week in which the quarter ends, effects point in time cash flows. this dynamic negatively impacted our year-over-year cash flow for q1, but will reverse in q2. we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.2 billion, which includes about $700 million held outside the us.
so i'll now transition to segment results, starting with pharma; revenue increased 6% to $33 billion driven by sales growth in our pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions divisions. segment profit decreased 3% to $398 million, which reflects the impact from pharma distribution customer contract renewals. this was partially offset by the benefits of our ongoing cost savings initiatives and performance in our specialty solutions business.
as a reminder, we record opioid related litigation expenses in the pharma segment. before i leave pharma, i want to note that our generics program perform roughly as expected. while we continue to see improvements in the market dynamics for generics, i would remind you that several variables impact the net performance of our generics program including sourcing, volume new item launches and sell side pricing.
overall, we're seeing positive trends and good progress in the pharma segment. mike will discuss our ongoing efforts to maintain this momentum. transitioning to medical, segment revenue segment revenue for q1 increased 3% to about $4 billion. this was due to organic growth across the segment led by products and distribution as well as in cardinal health at home, one of our strategic growth areas.
this growth was partially offset by the divestiture of navihealth in august 2018. segment profit increased 26% to $170 million. this reflects benefits from our cost savings initiatives, as well as growth in products and distribution services and cardinal health at home.
as with revenue, these benefits were partially offset by the divestiture of the navihealth business. to provide some additional clarity products and distribution includes both cardinal health brand and national brand products, as well as costs from our global supply chain. our work across the medical segment to integrate our infrastructure, streamline our footprint and improve the customer experience is progressing as planned. mike will discuss, how this work will transition into growth over the longer term.
moving now to our full year outlook, with one quarter's results of one quarter's worth of results behind us, we've increased confidence and our full year guidance. at the same time, we continue to monitor external factors and key assumptions that could impact our forecast. we also continue to track the timing and evolution of internal investment initiatives, examples of external factors could be headwinds, which include tariffs and medical device tax. examples of key assumptions we closely monitor brand inflation in our generics program. considering the potential fluctuation of these and other items. we are reaffirming our guidance along with our corporate and segment assumptions. while we generally don't provide quarterly guidance. i will say that directionally, we expect operating earnings in q2 to be modestly lower than q1.
so before i turn it back over to mike, i'd like to mention significant -- including our gaap results. in connection with the recent opioid-related settlement with cuyahoga and summit counties. and the agreement in principle among the parties involved to a global settlement framework, we accrued $5.1 billion, after-tax in the first quarter.
we believe this global settlement framework will serve as the basis for definitive settlement terms and documentation. and for this reason from a legal and accounting perspective. this accrual is prudent. for cardinal health, the cash component of the settlement framework is up to $5.6 billion over 18 years, if factors change will adjust the accrual appropriately.
let me -- now turn it back over to mike to provide further remarks.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
thanks, dave. this settlement with the twp ohio counties enables to discussions around the global settlement framework to proceed. the global framework, which is supported by a bipartisan group of state attorneys general is designed to resolve all pending in potential opioid lawsuits by states and political subdivisions.
importantly, with the commitment of both funds and the distribution of treatment medications, this framework provides an immediate solution to the communities and families that needed most.
as you know, we have an important but limited role in the pharmaceutical supply chain. we take that role and the responsibility that comes with it seriously, we remain committed to being part of the solution to this epidemic and that is why we are committed to the global framework and continue to be actively involved in its progression.
with that said, if this framework is not successful, we are prepared to vigorously defend ourselves. shifting now to our strategic direction in the focus areas. i mentioned last quarter, i said on our last call that in pharma. we are focused on two things further enhancing our core distribution business and fueling sustained growth in key areas. regarding our core distribution business, we are focused on continuously enhancing the customer experience, improving pricing and contract discipline and reducing costs. we are making significant investments throughout the segment with a longer-term view of the business.
for example, we are implementing digital technologies that will improve visibility and enhance our pricing capabilities. in addition, we recently began a program to improve our e-commerce capabilities and enhance the experience for our customers. beyond investing in our core businesses, we are focused on investing to drive growth in rapidly evolving spaces in healthcare and identifying ways to further differentiate ourselves and shape the future. for example, in specialty, we recently made a multi-million dollar investment to establish a new distribution center outside of nashville, tennessee with a state-of-the-art, cold chain complex including deep frozen technology.
this new facility will enable us to combine two existing distribution centers streamline technologies to drive operational efficiencies and support continued growth in rapidly evolving areas of the specialty industry.
we are also investing in our higher margin services businesses, which we call our connected care offering to build a greater connectivity between manufacturers, payers, pharmacies and patients. we will continue to purposely redeploy capital in these and other areas that aligned to our strategy.
moving on the medical, we are building out our commercial and operational capabilities across the segment and continuing investment in key areas, dave, shared that some of these activities, which include enhancing our commercial approach, streamlining our supply chain and rationalizing our footprint are showing early signs of success.
commercially, we are more closely aligning ourselves with the needs of our customers and incentivizing our sales force to sell cardinal brand products. we expect these enhancements to be complete by q3, and their benefit will begin to materialize in fy '21 as part of our supply chain work we are reconfiguring our north american network.
for example, in california. we are consolidating two of our distribution centers into a modern flagship center, which will enhance customer experience at a lower cost to serve and position the segments for growth.
additionally, with respect to our global supply chain, we more than doubled our manufacturing footprint with the patient recovery acquisition. we are already leveraging some synergies but we see a path to capture significantly more. to that end, within the next quarter we will finalize plans to reduce cost and deliver industry-leading service across our global network. these plans will take some time to execute. so we have a strong governance structure in place and are committed to diligently managing our costs to realize the greatest long-term benefit.
as in pharma, we are making significant investments across the medical segment to improve the customer experience and drive growth in both the products and services spaces. for example, as patient care shifts more toward the home, we continue to capture growth opportunities through cardinal health at home solutions. we are committed to further developing this business in our redeploying some of our cost savings benefits in this area to improve the customer, healthcare professional and patient experiences.
in medical services, another business unit in the segment with sustained growth and strong results. we are building additional digital, and data capabilities modernizing our operating systems and streamlining clinical and operational workflows. this will reduce costs for both us and for our customers, and importantly will improve patient safety. we recognize the components of the work across our products and services spaces will take time to translate into sustained growth and results.
we remain committed to fueling this momentum. on the enterprise level, as dave and i shared earlier our cost savings initiatives are producing tangible benefits across the company. we expect to meet or exceed our $130 million commitment for the year, primarily through sg&a related activities, our initiatives to improve gross margin like those in medical to right right size our manufacturing and distribution footprint, will contribute more significantly to our five year, $500 million savings goal as they will ramp up over the next few years.
with these initiatives, leaders across the company are evaluating internal operating models in identifying opportunities to leverage automation, analytics and additional technologies to not only drive efficiencies and contribute to our savings goals, but to improve insights. one example is our recent partnership with genpact, a global professional services firm focused on digital business transformation, who will help us transform our finance operating model. as part of this partnership, genpact will create a data analytics and fp&a hub here in central ohio to drive industry leading innovation. about 200 current cardinal health fp&a and data analytics employees are transitioning to the genpact hub, next week, alongside a team of genpact's process, finance and data analytics experts.
this is just one of the many initiatives across the company to streamline our processes, leverage our scale and enhance our data capabilities. we will share additional updates on these initiatives as they develop.
as we drive these type of efficiencies across the company, we will fuel growth through balanced capital acquisition allocation. this includes, reinvesting in the business, returning cash to shareholders and improving our financial flexibility, while maintaining our investment grade status. we remain committed to paying down at least $1 billion of long-term debt this fiscal year, which includes the $450 million of debt maturing in q2.
to close, in q1, we generated positive momentum across the company. we are pleased with this start to the year and reckoning that there is more work ahead. we have a strong foundation of scale and industry knowledge. with our talented and dedicated employees. we are committed to building on this foundation to adapt, innovate and lead as our industry evolves.
with that, i'll now open it up for questions.
",2020-Q1,CAH

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we'll take our first question from michael cherny with bank of america.
mike cherny -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning, and thanks for all the color so far. if i can dive a little bit into the pharma headwinds, as you think about the outlook for the rest of the year, how do you think about the trajectory and the visibility on nuclear? and then also the headwinds on generic and when they could recover for you?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks for the question, michael. appreciate it. i guess, really a couple of things to keep in mind. we're really pleased with the resiliency of our pharma segment, both in the pharma distribution as well as the specialty and nuclear business. we do continue to see really covid-19 being the main driver of any headwinds we're seeing there. it's good so far. there are lot of the things that might affect the segments such as brand, inflation, that's kind of off the table from what we've seen in january. we feel like we're executing really well on our initiatives. and also from a cost savings standpoint, we're on track. and then generics, which is always one of the -- could be one of the swing factors, we're not seeing anything inconsistent there from what we've seen in the prior quarter.
so a lot of those swing factors are really off the table when we look at the rest of the year for pharma. but what we really see is covid being the main swing factor, the things i would say there is that we saw a lot of choppiness in the quarter. we would expect it to continue to be choppy for the second half of the year. but we still are expecting to exit at or near pre-covid levels. and as we said, our guidance continues to be low-single-digit growth for the segment.
jason hollar -- chief financial officer
and if i could just add one point, michael, this is jason. in your point about nuclear, we did see the headwind year-over-year be a little bit less than what we saw in the first quarter. so kind of follows -- continues to follow a little bit of what we're seeing with electives a little bit more than other elements of the underlying volume. so not a lot of new news there, but slight improvement sequentially.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from robert jones with goldman sachs.
bob jones -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, great. thanks for the question. yeah, maybe on the medical business, i think we all understand that covid is having significant impacts across the segment. but i was hoping maybe you could help us with what you're assuming in the back half in medical, particularly on the ebit line? it just seems based on the results to date and the updated guidance, you have to see kind of mid-20 declines in the back half versus the front half, and i know there's a lot of moving pieces related to covid. but i think at a high level, mike, i would think as you may be see some of the drivers of the front half potentially fade, you would obviously see the legacy kind of surgery recovery product lines pick up. just trying to get a better sense of what you're assuming that could really drive this kind of back half decline versus what you've seen in the front half?
jason hollar -- chief financial officer
yeah. this is jason. let me start it off. yeah, like you said, we're really pleased with our first half performance. certainly two good quarters here now as well as on top of last year's double-digit growth as well. and then still guiding to low-to-mid 20s for the year, we feel very good about. to the point about the trends, first half versus second half, as we stated in the remarks, we did see some q2 favorability as it relates to our cost mitigation efforts on certain ppe products. so that's an element that was a component in addition to the volume strength that we saw in lab and the volume strength that we saw in ppe that drove medical to actually have a net tailwind associated with covid in the quarter. and so that's just one thing that will continue to vary quarter-to -quarter as we go forward.
the other item that we talked about last quarter as well is that we continue to be very aggressive with our cost control over the first half of the year here, a lot of uncertainty in the underlying volumes. and so we wanted to make certain that we had a lot of flexibility going into the second half of the year. and then the third point i'd make is just that we do continue to make long-term investments in our business. as we've highlighted as our number one capital deployment priority is to invest in our strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities. and so we always trade off our level of spend in that regard as well.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from jailendra singh with credit suisse.
jailendra singh -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thank you. you mentioned a few things you're doing to help with the vaccine rollout. i realize these programs in and of themselves aren't going to move the needle for the overall company. but just curious as to how this work might set the company up for future opportunities for you guys to participate in future phases of vaccine distribution?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
thanks. appreciate the question. yeah, we've been continue to be involved in staying up-to-date in everything as it relates to the vaccine. as we've said, we are working with the state of ohio, helping them distribute the vaccine and we're also a partner with the cdc acting as a network administrator. and so we continue to do that and there are some other areas where we're having some small touch in that area.
at the end of the day, i believe that -- our belief is that this is the one of the most important events in the country's history. of that, bringing the full scale of the distribution capabilities of all the distributors to the market is going to make the most sense over the long-term to be able to effectively distribute and get the vaccines to folks. and so we continue to make sure that we're doing all the things to make ourselves ready to be able to participate and help out however we can.
operator
we'll take our next question from eric percher with nephron research.
eric percher -- nephron research -- analyst
thank you. can we dig into the ppe price dynamics a little bit. i think last quarter you talked about the ability to pass on pricing. in this quarter, i expect that we are going to see some input cost increases. so can you help square that with the pull forward you just mentioned? and maybe more broadly, your price versus cogs q1 to q2 and then what to assume in second half?
jason hollar -- chief financial officer
sure. yeah, thanks for the question. and let me just kind of step back and talk about ppe in general and try to loop in that piece as well. there is -- certainly, the overall demand dynamic here obviously continues to be quite strong. and we are seeing certain components get a little bit more imbalanced between supply and demand. but certainly, cost remains elevated across all categories. it's probably even more extreme in terms of that supply and demand imbalance remaining in exam gloves. so we continue to see that demand is far outstripping that supply, which has created some -- just some supply chain inconsistencies. not only so now we're dealing with just the timing of supply, but we're also dealing with all the different timing elements of the cost increases and price increases.
so it just becomes a bit of an uncertain combination of different influences that have driven some of these cost increases to be delayed then until later quarters. so overall, our key objective remains the same to make sure we're mitigating all these cost increases and working with our customers with the supply assurance program. but the timing is going to vary, as we said last quarter, and we'll continue to manage that as appropriate.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yeah. the only thing i would add is that while the ppe is clearly a driver, our lab business really was a big driver for us this quarter in the medical segment. and we continue to be excited about its growth and its ability to continue to maintain that growth, at least for the remainder of fiscal '21 is our current assumption.
operator
thank you. we'll go next to lisa gill, j.p. morgan.
lisa gill -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks very much. good morning. mike, i just wanted to get an understanding of how you're thinking about utilization as we go into the back half of your fiscal year. one, are you seeing an impact with less cough, cold and flu? and then secondly, you talked about the rx segment in the quarter having an impact due to generics. what are you seeing? is it more of a trend? you said branding kind of came in line or was the positive. is it that new prescription volumes continue to be down, at least based on the data we see with iqvia? is there anything going on with your buying group? just how do we think about utilization? and any other comments you can give us around how to think about the drug distribute -- or the pharma distribution component of your business in the back half?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, lisa. a couple of things i would say. i guess, first of all, it's important to know that sequentially there's really not a lot of difference between what we saw in volumes between q1 and q2 for our pharma business. and also i would say that the -- all the impact that we're seeing on volumes in generics is really from our view just related to covid-19. so we're not seeing any other dynamics such as buying groups or other challenges like that impacting our generics program. it's really just the volumes as it relates to covid-19. so, and as we've said, we expect that to continue to be choppy. we saw a lot of up and down over the last six months. we would expect that for the second half of the year, but do expect to still get back to at or near pre-covid levels by the end of the year.
as it relates to flu, as you know, this has become less and less of a driver in general for us. it can be a small driver. and as far as the flu goes, we've hardly seen much at all. so in terms of -- vaccine distribution has been a little higher, but all of the other type of ancillary products, such as the tamiflus and those types of things, they have been down obviously. but again, it's an incredibly tiny driver for us and was not something that is driving any of the concern or any challenges that we might be looking at in pharma, which again, we just are focused on covid.
operator
thank you. we'll go next to glen santangelo with guggenheim.
glen santangelo -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
yeah. thanks for taking the question. hey, jason, i just wanted to ask a quick question about your share count guidance and your interest expense guidance. it looks like you raised the share count guidance, but you lowered the interest expense guidance. and i appreciate the comments you made with respect to the deferred comp adjustments. but i was just curious if you're changing at all your capital deployment priorities in the near-term? and secondly to that, is the potential opioid settlement at all a consideration in your capital deployment priorities for the balance of the year?
jason hollar -- chief financial officer
okay, great. so in terms of interest, let's start there. yeah, you're right. as consistent with my comments, it's the deferred comp elements is driving the guidance change. and as i highlighted, that's entirely a flip-flop between interest and other and corporate sg&a. so there is no net eps change associated with that. and of course, interest rates, although low, we have a substantial part of our capital structure fixed. so we just don't see a lot of variation as it relates to where rates have been.
and so then -- i'm sorry, there were three parts, what was the second part? share count. okay. so the share count -- was still within the guidance range of what we had before. it is slightly at the high end, to your point, as you can see, in the first quarter, we didn't do any share repo. we didn't do any in the second quarter as well. but the high end of that share count would imply no repo. the low end of this new range would be moderate -- modest amount of repo. so that's what's baked within that assumption.
as it relates to the capital deployment, certainly, we haven't changed our priorities. of course, we work within those priorities. and just to reinforce that, we continue to invest in our business first and foremost as we are really confident with that strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities. and you saw that this quarter with the medical global manufacturing and supply chain work. we're making some great progress there and we want to continue to feed those activities.
the other point that i referenced in my commentary is consistent with the second priority, which is to maintain our strong investment-grade balance sheet. so i did highlight that we intend to reduce our debt by about $1.4 billion as it comes due at the end of our fiscal '22, and we think that's consistent with that priority. and then of course we'll return the cash to shareholders, primarily through the dividend, as our third priority.
after that it is repo and other bolt-on strategic m&a. but we'll continue to look at that opportunistically as we get more confidence on variables such as opioids is certainly one of the elements we look at all the time. and as our confidence increases, we make more progress understanding it what the framing of that looks like. and then we'll continue to evaluate if we can be more aggressive on any of those other components. but we continue to balance all those each and every day.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from george hill with deutsche bank.
george hill -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. i kind of wanted to go back to eric's topic a little bit on ppe pricing. i was wondering if you guys would be willing to kind of call out the positive impact of pricing in the first half of the year. and mike, i guess, i'd be interested in your commentary on how long pricing stays elevated. do we think this is the new normal or at some point in the future are we going to have to worry about ppe price deflation?
jason hollar -- chief financial officer
yeah. so let me start at least with that first part. we're not going to break out explicitly the pricing separately. first of all, it's just really important to highlight that the pricing is meant to cover that cost increase. and so that's what we're balancing there. we did, however, say in our last guidance update in q1 that the vast majority of that revenue guidance increase for medical was due to pricing, which was due to that cost that was increasing.
with this update, it's definitely more balanced, more weighted toward volume increases in the lab business as well as volume increases in ppe and then to a lesser extent any type of price changes. so it's -- i would just go back to the last guidance increase and that gives you a better understanding of what that ppe pricing dynamic is being driven by.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yeah. the only thing i would emphasize, just to make sure that it's clear is this, as the cost of the ppe comes down, our revenue will come down. but again, our goal has always been to maintain margin dollars and work with our customers on an assurance program. and so you shouldn't think about declining ppe cost necessarily being a headwind for us other than revenue. and as jason said, the timing of when you have the actual sale price and the cost as they flow through that can create a little bit of lumpiness in the recognition.
operator
thank you. we'll go next to ricky goldwasser with morgan stanley.
ricky goldwasser -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah, hi. good morning. so two questions here. one on the pharma distribution segment. when we look at the implied growth for second half, ebit is growing faster than revenue. now clearly, there is some easy year-over-year comps versus the same period last year. but as we think -- and i know it's too early to think about 2022. but really if we think about different drivers that expectation that generic volumes are going to come back in nuclear, which is higher margin, is it sustainable for us to think that we go to model ebit continuing to grow faster than revenues for the distribution segment? and my other question was just if you can give us a quick update on opioids and where we stand?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
sure. as far as -- i'll just cover the opioids quickly. as i've said in the past, it continues to be, as you know, complex negotiations. a lot of moving parts, but we're continuing to make progress there. as far as on the pharma guidance goes or thoughts there, obviously we can't talk about at this time '22, but you're right on those components. first of all, we would expect if we exit at or near pre-covid levels that our nuclear business would continue to improve sequentially as it goes forward, and we have a lot of confidence in that business. as you know, i highlighted it in my comments around not only how they're performing well in the current situation, but also the investments we've made to be able to see growth in that business over the mid and long-term on the -- in the theragnostic space.
and then, again, as far as generics go, yes, the main reason that we have seen that our generic volumes are off is because of covid. and so rest of the program continues to be as we expected. we continue to see that program -- all the various components that we have in it are essentially working as we expected with just covid being the driver. so again as covid begins to be less and less of an impact, we would expect to see our volumes on our generics program to grow.
jason hollar -- chief financial officer
yeah. the other thing i'll add is relative to the nuclear comment, ricky, as it relates to the revenue and margin balance there. i think you're on the right point that as we talk to, especially in q4 of last year when the volumes were declining quickly, nuclear is a high margin business. it is also a high fixed cost business. so it creates a very high contribution margins that we saw certainly create a headwind in our fourth quarter.
and so as we anniversary that in this fourth quarter, especially if our guidance is accurate with the at or near pre-covid levels by the time we exit the fiscal year, then you would expect there to be, for that piece of it, an improvement in earnings relative to revenue as one of the key components that probably needs to be plugged into your model to make that whole thing make sense.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from charles rhyee with cowen.
charles rhyee -- cowen & co. -- analyst
yeah. hey, thanks for taking the questions. just on the pharma side, can you talk about biosimilars and to the extent that they've had an impact. a commentary from some of your peers would suggest that it's trying to become a more meaningful contributor. i just wanted to get a sense within -- in the pharma segment, how much that's having an impact? and then -- yeah, that's basically it. thanks.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yeah. biosimilars continues to be an area we're also excited about. we are seeing positive contributions from biosimilar. it just doesn't -- it's not at the level to be calling it out as necessarily a driver at this point in time, but it's something that we do continue to participate in. we're very well positioned to be able to help manufacturers and customers with biosimilars. and we do see that as something that should be a tailwind for us as we look forward going forward.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from steven valiquette with barclays.
steve valiquette -- barclays capital -- analyst
great, thanks. good morning, everybody. so i think in the pharma segment, we're all just kind of looking at the trend line where the segment operating profit grew 1% year-over-year back in the fiscal first quarter, but then they were down 11% here in fiscal 2q. and you mentioned that the nuclear pharmacy headwind was actually a little bit less in the december quarter. and i think you said in the q&a that for the generics you're not seeing anything inconsistent there from what you saw in the prior quarter despite the covid impact on generics. i guess just the question is, is there anything else you'd call out that may have gotten a little bit worse sequentially in that segment or is it just maybe there is something else that made the comp a little bit tougher in the december quarter that we overlooked? just want to get more color on the decline in profits in fiscal 2q versus fiscal 1q. thanks.
jason hollar -- chief financial officer
yeah. as mike mentioned earlier, we saw very consistent type of performance in a number of categories sequentially q1 to q2, and we talked about the covid impacts we talked about generics in general, the consistent market dynamics. so you do need to go back to look at the q2 of the prior year where that's where generics program overall was fairly strong. and we talked at that point about not only volume, but some mix impacts that were going on at that time. so i think it's very much a comp as well as inconsistency within quarter-to-quarter sequential.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from elizabeth anderson with evercore.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi guys. good morning. i just want to ask about the different -- in terms of your home health business, can you talk about how that has been performing in the quarter? and then maybe give us your expectations as we like move through the rest of covid and beyond?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yeah. we continue to be very pleased with our at-home business. we're continuing to see growth in overall number of customers that we're serving, the types of product lines that we're working with and driving our mix. all of those types of things getting after our cost structure. we are making some large investments in our it systems that will be going online here. so a little increased sg&a as we drive to improve our systems there to be able to improve the customer experience and as we grow, be able to do it more effectively. but it's a business that we continue to remain very positive on. we believe the trends continue to be in our favor in that business. and being one of the leaders in that space, i think enables us to invest in various activities and opportunities to continue to grow that business.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from eugene kim, wolfe research.
eugene kim -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you, and good morning. i would like to get some color on cost savings benefit in the medical segment. can you maybe quantify the benefit you saw for the quarter and share how much of that savings are more temporary in nature? and also if you are expecting those temporary savings to come back in the back half? thank you.
jason hollar -- chief financial officer
yeah. so within the quarter, we called out two key items. one is this topic, cost savings as well as and the covid impacts. and they were both the most significant items that are driving our year-over-year performance. so in terms of the order of magnitude, you should think of that as a large driver of this performance and consistent with that other driver. how we break out our cost savings is that they would by their nature be largely permanent. anything that's temporary and only because of covid or covid-related matters, we would put into the covid bucket.
so we do see this as a continuous improvement and deepens our dna and that we aren't just squeezing our cost temporarily, but truly transformational foundational elements. it's within our sg&a expenses. it's within our global manufacturing and our supply chain. and as such, we'd expect it to be permanent.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yeah. and the only thing i would add to that. as jason mentioned earlier, remember that because of some of the strong performance we've had in medical and in the business in the first half, there were some areas in medical expenses where we are investing in the business as we've talked about from a capital standpoint, i just mentioned the it business and the at-home, and we're also looking at some other areas. so we are ramping up some of our expenses that in the area of making investments and growing the business over the mid to short-term. so we would expect them to be a little higher in the second half. but to our $500 million five year goal, those are seen as permanent expenses that come out. but we're talking about ramping back up the type of investments based on how we feel strong -- strongly about the performance of the business for the full year.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from eric coldwell with baird.
eric coldwell -- baird -- analyst
thanks, and good morning. we've been hearing a lot about stockpile-as-a-service or storage-as-a-service in medical and perhaps even in certain areas of pharma or therapeutics, mission-critical items that are often in short supply. i'm just curious, it sounds like you're doing some similar things here. and i'm curious what the model looks like with that business? is this more like a 3plc or how exactly does that work? when does the customer by the product from you? how are you compensated for the facilities, the capital costs, the storage, etc.? thanks.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
i think, a couple of things. first of all, the last thing you said is important is that we would intend to be properly compensated for that to make sure as with any investment or working with customers to make sure that the services we provide we're getting compensated for not only from a income statement, but appropriately looking at our balance sheet and the return. so that's important to know.
to give you specifically on how it work, that's a little more complicated because i think it's -- we're going to see inventory changes across the entire supply chain. i think you're, obviously, one, going to see some supply changes in the way the probably the manufacturers work and the amount of inventory they're carrying to be able to get through these types of things. the location of our supply chain and where we -- the percentage of what we self-manufacture versus what we source. we continue to increase our capacity, for instance, to manufacture our own drapes and gowns. and so the ability to ramp that up store inventory and managing it that way would be one.
and then as i mentioned, we are building some larger distribution centers. so we have the capacity to do that on our end both to make sure our service levels are where our customers expect them to be, but also in certain cases, carry that inventory for customers. but i also believe that customers are looking at what they warehouse and don't warehouse. and that mix of what they warehouse may be more toward these ppe-related items versus other ones and that could create some different opportunities for us to work with them.
so i do think the entire supply chain will adjust over the next couple of years as it relates to inventory. but the important thing to note is that as we work with our customers on this, we would -- and suppliers, we would expect to get compensated from both in order to provide that type of service.
operator
thank you. and we will take our final question from brian tanquilut with jefferies.
brian tanquilut -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. mike, just a question on the vaccine distribution side. i know you said you're taking care of small chain pharmacies and the independent. so is there any sort of sizing that you can put there or in terms of like what your client are thinking in terms of the percentage of overall vaccinations that they will get as a group?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yeah. at this point in time, as you know, it's state-by-state, it changes on a weekly basis. so i don't really have any good insights on how to help you on that. i would tell you that we continue to be there for our customers and continue to help them, be ready to do it. it's not a driver at all for our financial statements one way or the other. so from a financial driver, it's not material. but it would be really hard for me to even give you anything there because of the choppiness of the amount of vaccines that we're seeing state-by-state.
operator
thank you. that will conclude our question-and-answer session. at this time, i'd like to turn the call back over to mike kaufmann for any additional or closing remarks.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yeah. i really want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. and on behalf of all of us at cardinal health, i hope you and your families are safe and well. and we look forward to speaking to all of you again soon.

with that, i will now turn the call over to mike.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
thanks, kevin, and good morning, everyone. i'll start our discussion with a few high level thoughts on our progress so far this year. and then jason will review our second quarter results and our updated fiscal '21 outlook. i'll close by sharing updates regarding our growth areas.
we continue to make progress on our strategic plan as we navigate the rapidly changing global environment. overall, second quarter operating results came in better than our expectations led by the medical segment. in addition, we saw some favorability, including timing below the operating line, enabling us to deliver eps growth of 14% in the quarter. due to our solid first half performance and our improved visibility into the remainder of the fiscal year, we are increasing and narrowing our eps guidance to a range of $5.85 to $6.10 per share.
in the second quarter, we saw varying effects of the pandemic on our business. our medical segment saw a net positive impact related to covid-19 as our lab business and ppe products continued to experience strong demand. and in pharma, although the pandemic continued to adversely impact volumes, mainly in generics and nuclear imaging, areas like specialty and consumer health are recovering and performing very well. across the company, we remain focused on doing our part to support ongoing pandemic relief efforts.
in pharma, we've partnered with the cdc to act as a network administrator enabling retail independent, small chain and long-term care pharmacy customers to participate in the vaccination effort. and in medical, we partnered with the state of ohio to support vaccine distribution through our optifreight logistics business.
regarding ppe, we are utilizing our supply assurance program to manage cost for our customers and provide consistent long-range supply in key product categories. we are seeing improving supply in some of these product categories such as gowns and masks. we'll continue to see a challenging market with exam gloves. looking ahead, we remain committed to supporting our customers, patients, government and communities through the ongoing challenges of the pandemic. and we are ready and willing to help in any way possible.
before i provide some updates on our strategic growth areas, i'll turn it over to jason to share more details on our second quarter and outlook for the year.
jason hollar -- chief financial officer
thanks, mike. good morning, everyone. beginning with total company results, second quarter eps was $1.74, reflecting a 14% increase driven by discrete tax items and strong medical results. total second quarter revenue increased 5% to $41.5 billion, driven primarily by sales growth from existing customers. total gross margin was flat at $1.8 billion. sg&a increased 2% to $1.1 billion due to it investments.
the net result for the quarter was consolidated operating earnings of $628 million, a decrease of 3%, which reflects a modest net negative impact for the enterprise from covid-19. the pharma segment was adversely affected by covid-19 during the quarter, and this was partially offset by a net positive impact in medical. i will discuss these segment impacts shortly.
interest and other expense decreased 33% versus the prior year to $34 million, driven primarily by lower interest expense as a result of prior year debt reduction as well as an increase in the value of our company's deferred compensation plan investments. our non-gaap effective tax rate for the quarter was 13%, which reflects the impact of certain discrete items.
now a quick note on the gaap tax impacts during the quarter. primarily due to the self-insurance loss in our fiscal '20 federal tax return, we will carry back and recover previously paid federal taxes at rates that were in effect at that time. as such, in the quarter, we recorded a net gaap tax benefit of $420 million associated with the recovery of prior taxes. additionally, we have recorded a corresponding receivable of approximately $1 billion, which we expect to receive within the next 12 months.
turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. we generated robust operating cash flow of $1.2 billion during the quarter. as a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point in time cash flows. we ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $3.7 billion and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. we remain focused on taking appropriate action to maintain our investment-grade balance sheet. our next debt maturity is in june 2022 with approximately $1.4 billion coming due. by the end of fiscal '22, we intend to reduce long-term debt by that amount so the exact timing and method may vary as we continue to evaluate the economics associated with early retirement of debt.
now turning to the segments, beginning with medical on slide 5. medical revenue increased 7% in the second quarter to $4.3 billion, driven by a net positive revenue impact from covid-19 and solid execution by our team. as we have previously discussed, we saw higher selling prices and volumes regarding ppe and higher volumes in our lab business, partially offset by reduced surgical products demand resulting from deferred and canceled elective procedures.
segment profit increased 21% to $236 million, driven by a net positive impact from covid-19 and cost savings, which includes global manufacturing efficiencies. the net positive segment profit impact from covid-19 was primarily due to higher lab volumes as well as increased contributions from ppe that were offset by the previously mentioned elective procedure impacts.
as it relates to lab, we continue to experience a tailwind from increased demand for covid-19 testing products. while difficult to predict, we expect this demand to remain elevated for at least the balance of fiscal '21. regarding ppe, we saw both higher volumes and timing favorability related to our cost mitigation efforts. as previously mentioned, we have incurred significantly higher procurement costs for select ppe products during the pandemic. and we expect the timing of selling the higher cost products to vary as we continue to manage our supply assurance program for our customers.
on electives, although procedure volumes continue to be choppy and still below prior year levels, second quarter volumes were generally consistent with our first quarter exit rate, down mid-single-digits versus our pre-covid-19 baseline.
finally, as in the first quarter, we continue to see savings resulting from cost containment measures during the pandemic. and outside of covid-19 impacts, we continue to realize benefits from our efficiency initiatives like our global manufacturing and supply chain transformation, which we expect will continue to deliver strong savings.
transitioning to the pharma segment on slide 6. revenue increased 4% to $37.2 billion, driven by sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers. pharma segment profit decreased 11% to $413 million. this was driven by covid-19-related volume declines in our generics program and nuclear business and was partially offset by a higher contribution from brand sales mix in the quarter.
our specialty solutions business continues to demonstrate resilience, both downstream with providers and upstream with biopharma manufacturers, and again achieved strong overall growth in the quarter. also, our generics program, when excluding the previously mentioned volume impact of covid-19, continue to see generally consistent market dynamics.
next on slide 8, i will review the updates to our fiscal '21 outlook. due to our solid first half performance and better visibility into the back half of fiscal '21, we are raising and narrowing our eps guidance range to $5.85 to $6.10 per share, which at the midpoint, represents 10% year-over-year eps growth. this improvement is driven by strong performance in our medical segment as well as updates below the operating line.
regarding updates to other corporate assumptions, we now expect interest and other in the range of $165 million to $185 million with the improvement primarily driven by the impact of our deferred compensation plan adjustments. as a reminder, deferred compensation adjustments are fully offsetting corporate sg&a and net neutral to our bottom line.
we are lowering our non-gaap etr range for the year to 23% to 25%, which reflects our year-to-date effective tax rate of 18% and higher expected effective tax rates in the back half of the fiscal year due to the timing of discrete items. we also now expect dilutive weighted average shares outstanding to finish the year in the range of 294 million to 295 million.
regarding the segment outlooks on slide 9, for medical, due to the previously discussed drivers, we now expect segment profit percentage growth in the low-to-mid 20s and revenue growth for the year in the range of high-single to low-double-digits. regarding the pharma segment, we are maintaining our current guidance ranges of mid-single-digit revenue growth and low-single-digit profit.
to conclude, some comments on our enterprise covid-19 assumptions for the back half of fiscal year, as we begin to lap the initial impact of the pandemic in the prior year. we continue to expect utilization to be choppy and to exit the fiscal year at or near pre-pandemic levels. and for the enterprise in fiscal '21, we continue to expect a year-over-year net negative impacts from covid-19 the less than originally anticipated due to improved medical expectations.
i'll now turn it back over to mike.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
thanks, jason. i'd now like to take a moment to elaborate on how this unprecedented time has reinforced our critical role in healthcare and how we see this roll evolving as we look toward and beyond the second half of the fiscal year. i said last quarter that we aspire to be healthcare's most trusted partner and create the greatest value for our customers, shareholders, communities and employees. we create this value by efficiently operating resilient business models, deploying capital with discipline and investing for growth, all while prioritizing the health, safety and development of our teams.
first, as we've seen throughout the pandemic, we operate resilient business models that can address today's challenges and adapt for the future. for example, as jason highlighted, our lab business continues to enhance its offerings throughout the pandemic. through our cardinal health brand portfolio and our distribution relationships, we supply instrumentation, reagents and consumables, enabling both independent and acute laboratories to support the health of patients.
we are also enhancing our core medical and pharmaceutical distribution and product capabilities as we continue to adapt these models for the future. we are making strong progress in both segments and our supply chain work streams and generating near and long-term efficiencies. for example, we began work this quarter on a new 1 million square foot medical segment replenishment center near chicago that we expect to be operational in the fourth quarter. this facility is the second of its kind in the last year and is part of our multi-year plan to improve the customer experience, consolidate our network and increase capacity to meet customers' request for pandemic storage.
we are also making strategic investments in our it infrastructure to enhance our customer experience and digital capabilities. at the same time, we are investing in our differentiated portfolio to drive strategic long-term growth in key areas that not only support, but also anticipate our customers' needs. our investments in the areas of specialty, at-home, medical services, nuclear and connected care will enable us to capture benefits from favorable industry trends and to develop specialized customer solutions, utilizing our breadth and scale. recall, i noted at a recent conference that these five businesses represent $25 billion in total revenue. and together, they have a double-digit historical three year revenue cagr.
let me highlight a few of these areas in greater detail. in medical services, which includes our optifreight logistics and wavemark businesses, we are investing in technologies to drive continued innovation that will meet the evolving needs of our customers. for example, with our recently announced totalvue analytics tool and our optifreight business, we are using data to help our customers drive insight and savings in their healthcare supply chain logistics management. and in wavemark, which as a reminder, is a software-as-a-service platform optimizing supply chain and clinical workflow processes for acute care, we have seen growth in both our installations and our pipeline as we continue to go live with additional customers. wavemark has also recently initiated partnership opportunities to explore solutions to help lab managers and supply chain leaders manage the increased demand for critical test kits and lab supplies.
as our nuclear business continues its recovery related to the pandemic, our team remains focused on long-term plans to further strengthen our leading industry position. we continue to build out our center for theragnostics advancements in minneapolis and are excited about the pharmaceutical innovators coming onboard. from supporting manufacturer development of radiopharmaceuticals to commercialization and distribution, we are working together to change the way patient care is delivered.
in addition, our recent customer loyalty survey results were excellent, showcasing our differentiated value proposition in the market. our efforts over the past six years to transform our selling model, strengthen our world class service levels and launch new products and services are deeply appreciated by our customers, and we are excited about the mid to long-term future of this business.
and finally, in connected care, we are making additional investments in technology solutions and actionable data tools to take advantage of the double-digit growth we are seeing and to enable more meaningful, cost effective and outcomes driven connections between payers, manufacturers, pharmacists and patients. demand for these solutions continues to increase with our services currently reaching 60,000 pharmacies, 23 million patients and 60 payers. we are sending more than 400 million texts annually to support medication management. and in the last quarter, we have designed, developed and implemented tools to help our pharmacy customers administer the covid-19 vaccine with more than 2,500 locations already engaged. we will continue to share progress in each of these growth areas and in our core capability initiatives as they materialize over the coming year.
before i close, i want to thank the team here at cardinal health who continue to do a tremendous job adapting and responding to the changing needs of our customers as we navigate the pandemic. finally, i will reiterate that what we do matters to our customers, shareholders, employees and communities. as we move forward, we are using our breadth, scale and expertise to provide products and solutions that create value and improve lives.
with that, i'll pause to open it up for questions.

[operator instructions] and we'll go ahead and take our first question from michael cherny from bank of america. please go ahead.
michael cherny -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning and thanks for taking the question. i wanted dive in a little bit to a comment you made about your expected growth on the ebit ex covid. and i believe you said that would be mid-single digits. by my simple math, if you assume it's 5%, that gets you to roughly $66 million headwind versus the base line. so along those lines, can you break down a little bit within that area, what some of the biggest drivers were of the underperformance? and then in particular, with regards to that question and the generic volumes, any more color you can give us on some of the classes that you expect to continue to contribute to weakness over the next couple of quarters?
jason hollar -- chief financial officer
sure. yes, this is jason. let me start with your first question there. and your math is very accurate. that would represent right around $60 million of overall enterprise impact due to covid. that is entirely in the pharma segment. within medical, there was a very insignificant impact in the quarter due to covid. now there were a lot of moving pieces, pluses and minuses, but netted out for no significant impact within the quarter. as it relates to the pharma business, that driver is driven by the generic volumes that mike referenced in his comments and i referenced in my comments. and i think maybe, mike, you can provide a little bit more color behind the second part of that question.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yes. michael, thanks for the question. and as it relates to the generics, remember, we have -- what we always talk about is our overall generics program and what we're seeing here in our overall generics program is that market dynamics are generally consistent. the only thing that has any real material impact on the program right now is generic volumes in certain therapeutic classes related to covid-19. and it's probably not hard to think about if you've been following the iqvia data and the other day. there are certain classes, particularly around acute scripts where we don't see those getting back to pre-covid levels prior to our fiscal year-end. we think as kids get back to school, more people are masking and all those types of things. we would expect the environment to generally return, but we don't now seeing that set of certain therapeutic classes within generics returning to more pre-covid levels until the end of the calendar year. so overall, again, good market, consistent market dynamics in the generics program really just focused on those few classes related to covid.
jason hollar -- chief financial officer
and i'd just like to add one more thing that $60 million. remember, there was a pull ahead last year. so only about half of it is an adverse impact in the current year. the other half is related to the comparison to the prior year.
michael cherny -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. thanks.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
next question.
operator
and we'll go ahead and move on to our next question from charles rhyee from cowen. please go ahead.
charles rhyee -- cowen -- analyst
yes, thanks for taking the question. if i could follow up on that. when you say certain therapeutic classes related to covid, so are we talking like cold, cough and flu like kind of flu and antibiotics, these kind of generic that might have been -- we're not seeing it because we had a weak flu season and you wouldn't expect that until maybe this coming flu season?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yes, it's a great question, and i'll try to be helpful here. yes, i would say flu season, as we know, has been light. but we've also said in the past, generally, if it were just flu season itself and just flu specific, like focused on just like a tamiflu and some of those, it wouldn't be that big of a driver. it would be a negative for us, but it wouldn't be probably a material driver that we would call out. but you said it well at the beginning, it's really the broader list of categories. so it's antibacterials, antibiotics, antivirals and pain meds, those generics and those categories are what we're seeing that are -- have just not returned the pre-covid levels. and if you look at the iqvia data in these categories, what we're seeing both in our own data per -- as you can imagine, a lot of conversations across the various classes of trade, it's very consistent in what we're seeing in terms of those volumes coming back.
charles rhyee -- cowen -- analyst
and if i could just follow up real quick. were these -- were we seeing these dynamics last quarter? and is it more that -- more of this was prescribed last year during covid versus this year? and so that's what we -- or is it the depression that people haven't been going to the doctors and you don't see people still really going back to the doctor as much that's driving this?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yes. it's hard to know for sure, but i'll give you a couple of thoughts. one is i think it is somewhat related to the physician office visits. second of all, people are masking, social distancing, washing hands. you don't have the people playing like sports at the same level and all those things and having the injuries related to pain meds and all of those things. so i think it's a combination of a lot of those things adding up. we've been seeing this in monitoring all the categories. and we've been saying since the beginning of the year, our assumption for guidance for both pharma and the overall company has been about getting back to pre-covid -- at or near pre-covid levels by june 30. and it's good to note that we're seeing that in brands. we're still expecting that. we're seeing that in the majority of generics, particularly the chronic generics. those are coming back. but we were hoping to see more of a ramp than these other ones. we're just not seeing it. so we believe that it's important not only through march, but we also looked at our april data. so it drove us to make a decision to change our pharma guidance for this year.
charles rhyee -- cowen -- analyst
great. thank you.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
next question.
operator
we'll go ahead and move on to our next question from ricky goldwasser from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
ricky goldwasser -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah. hi, good morning. so my question is still on generic, but on pricing. clearly, it's a big debate for investors now. so mike, what are you seeing in terms of generic pricing? are you seeing accelerated deflation or any other trends? and also, if you can talk a little bit about the sell, buy-side spread?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, ricky. thanks for the question. as you know, it's really hard to get into individual components of the generics program because as we've said for a while now, just calling out sell-side deflation without talking about the buy-side cost improvements or launches or overall volumes, it's -- you're really not giving a complete story. and that's why we've really been focused on just discussing how we see our overall generics program performing. and we really are seeing market dynamics are generally consistent with the only driver in the programs i just mentioned being covid-related volumes in certain categories.
ricky goldwasser -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. and a follow-up question there. when we think about the sell side, i think we also need to think about sort of contract renewals that could change dynamics. are there any contract renewals either for your book of business or across the industry that either renewed recently or that are upcoming that you can point us to, if there are any?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yes. as far as contract renewals go, on the ones that we specifically talk about, our three largest ones, which we have disclosed, those still have a couple of years left on them before there's any renewals of those contracts. and everything else as it relates to contract renewals for this year is generally tracking as expected. it's always one of those headwinds as a year-over-year basis, but everything is tracking as we expected at the beginning of this year.
ricky goldwasser -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and we'll move on to our next question from robert jones from goldman sachs. please go ahead.
robert jones -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thanks for the question. i guess maybe just to move over to medical, mike. obviously, covid has created a couple cross currents in that business as far as ppe and then the lack of utilization. could you maybe just tell us kind of where we are today as we think about those two broad buckets, the benefits that obviously you had and probably continue to see from ppe and testing versus kind of the core business coming back as utilization starts to become more normal?
jason hollar -- chief financial officer
yes. this is jason. thanks for the question. i'll start. within -- let's just kind of step back from a covid perspective overall for the medical business. as i mentioned in my prior answer, overall, for the quarter, there was an insignificant impact in the quarter related to covid, a lot of moving pieces, and i'll get into a couple of the key drivers. as a reminder, just like the pharma comment earlier, there was a prior year pull-forward for ppe volume that we sold out of inventory. so we do have a slight negative year-over-year impact, which is related to the prior year tailwind that did not repeat in the current quarter. so the pieces within the quarter that we saw was ongoing elective volume headwinds. and what we did see in the quarter was a little bit of a deterioration from the prior quarter. so we saw -- in my comments in the prepared remarks, we saw that the utilization went down from 95% in the second quarter to closer to 90% in the third. but as i highlighted, it did improve the tail end and back to the 90%. and that was very consistent with what we saw with the surge in the virus. and so we feel better about how we exited that quarter.
and why we did not change our guidance for the medical business as it relates to this topic as well just that we expected to be at or near pre-covid levels by the end of the year. we did continue to see strength in our lab business, although it was a little bit less than what we had in the prior quarter, but still strength. and that was an offset. and then we continue to see strong volumes with ppe. but again, you're comparing against a strong volume quarter last year. and we did have some favorability still for the timing of the recognition of the pricing cost associated with the much higher cost with ppe. and those dynamics continue to be somewhat fluid, but we do definitely still see higher costs, higher prices for some of the ppe products, especially gloves, some moderation, but generally still elevated. and anything else to add, mike?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
no, i think that sums it up well.
operator
and we'll move on to our next question from steven valiquette from barclays. please go ahead.
steven valiquette -- barclays -- analyst
hey, thanks good morning guys. usually, when there is some negative supply/demand imbalance on commoditized products, it can impact price. so with the softer generic volume on those categories that you mentioned, the antibacterials, antibiotics, etc, i guess for me, i would just visualize that both the buy side and the sell-side pricing would maybe come down simultaneously on those products in conjunction with the softer rx demand. i'm just curious if that's consistent with what you saw. i just want to confirm that one way or the other. so not to beat this topic to death, but just wanted to get some confirmation around that.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yes. that's a hard question to answer in the sense of the level of detail of looking at all of our -- both our buy side and sell side for all those individual categories. nothing pops out to me related to that component of the driver. as i said, really, overall, the generics program market dynamics were generally consistent. it was more just a volume-related item on those categories. nothing stands out in pricing, whether it be buy or sell that i would call out.
steven valiquette -- barclays -- analyst
okay. all right, thanks.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
and we'll move on to our next question from lisa gill from jpmorgan. please go ahead.
lisa gill -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hey, thanks very much and good morning, mike and jason. just really want to try to understand the puts and takes as we think about covid going into 2022 from a comp perspective. can you just remind us what the benefit or what the headwind has been for medical and pharmacy as we think about trying to model that going into next year?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
sure. yes. i can start and then turn it over to jason. as you know, our practice is that we're not -- we don't provide formal guidance on '22 until august, but we'll try to give you a little bit of color to be helpful. i'll start with the fact that we still feel really good about our growth areas. so when we think about specialty, at-home, nuclear, medical services and outcomes, we feel really good about all of these businesses. we think they all have strong industry trends, strong outlooks, complementary capabilities to our businesses and our -- we continue to adapt their offerings to focus on our customers' needs. so i would say we would still expect all of those growth areas to be positive drivers for next year. and then let me have jason give you a little bit of color on maybe a few of the other dynamics.
jason hollar -- chief financial officer
sure. thanks, mike. yes. and to enable -- let me just start with, to enable those types of growth areas, we are making investments in our business, and we'll continue to make investments in those businesses. one thing to highlight is, as we've invested more capital over the last couple or several years, that will ultimately result in increased the depreciation that we would expect to flow through. but of course, we would also expect the benefits of the programs, but we'll have some varying pieces there going forward. beyond that element, again, investing our business being our highest capital deployment priority, we have the other areas like debt reduction and returning capital to shareholders, some of which will be through share repurchases that should have a tailwind associated with it also. getting into your question around covid. that is, of course, where we'll see a lot of movement from a year-over-year perspective. as a reminder, we highlighted in fiscal '20 that we had roughly $100 million headwind associated with covid, which was more than all in the fourth quarter. now this year, and then just in this today's script, today's prepared remarks, we commented that it was a relatively consistent flat impact year-over-year from a covid perspective now in this update.
so that implies roughly $100 million included in fiscal '21. now the key question is exactly how does that roll off down to '22. and i would first go back and highlight that a number of the areas we anticipate getting at or near pre-covid levels by the end of the fiscal year, like the medical elective volumes, nuclear to a similar extent. the brand volumes we've highlighted are also similar. it's those very specific therapeutic drugs within generics will be deferred then until more like the middle of our fiscal '22. so there will be some offset there that will continue on into the next year. now there's going to be a lot of other moving pieces with covid. we would expect there still to be some elevated demand for areas like ppe and the lab business. but we also have the timing elements associated with ppe pricing costs that we continue to track very closely, and it will really be a function of those pricing and cost dynamics as we go forward. so when i think about the two different segments, what that really comes down to is that certainly, the greatest impact -- we have a headwind built into this guidance and that $100 million associated with the pharma business, and we have now more of a tailwind for the medical business.
and so we highlighted that from a year-over-year perspective as well in the prepared remarks that it's a meaningful impact in both this year. and so they will behave then differently next year. and then, of course, the other key piece to think about the puts and takes is the announcement of the sale of cordis. so we do anticipate that being in the first quarter, hopefully, earlier in the first quarter. and we disclosed prior that, that business carries about a $60 million to $70 million annualized earnings rate. and so as we get more specific to exact timing and other details around that, we will provide more color as to what the impact will be for our fiscal '22.
lisa gill -- jpmorgan -- analyst
very helpful. thank you.
operator
and we'll move on to our next question from eric percher from nephron research. please go ahead.
eric percher -- nephron research -- analyst
thank you. question on the specialty business, it sounds like you're expecting that trend to normalizing in that business. i want to ask how the profitability levels have been running in that business, whether you're seeing benefits from biosimilars? and of late, there's been a call out of maybe some of the oral solid products that are more specialty generic and biosimilars. are you participating in economics on those?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yes. i would say there's nothing i would call out that's dramatically changing in our specialty, particularly as it relates to the sales of drugs to the -- into the physician office space that we're seeing generally consistent profitability. we are participating in the various different opportunities in there, whether it be actual generics that are in specialty, the biosimilars. we're participating in all of those activities. we're seeing increased volumes on certain key drugs. and as you know, we've been saying for a while, we have seen oncology come back more quickly than the other areas, but we do expect all the classes of the trade at this point in time within specialty to be at or near pre-covid levels by the end of our fiscal year. and then as it goes to our upstream services businesses like our 3pl, our hub and other businesses, those businesses continue to perform well and compete very effectively in the marketplace.
kevin moran -- vice president of investor relations
next question please.
operator
and we'll move on to our next question from jailendra singh from credit suisse. please go ahead.
jailendra singh -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks and good morning. i was wondering if you could double click into manufacturing efficiencies you highlighted in the medical segment. can you provide some details there? and are any of those efficiencies in the cordis business that will be rolling off versus your core business?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yes. i mean we've clearly had manufacturing efficiencies in our cordis business, like all of our manufacturing businesses. the team there has just done an excellent job across all of our 30 or more global manufacturing plants at driving efficiencies. there's nothing in particular about the cordis efficiencies that would change the estimate that jason just gave you that, that business, when it rolls off, hopefully, in our -- early in our first quarter of next year would have about a $60 million or $70 million earnings associated with it.
jailendra singh -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
we'll move on to our next question from george hill from deutsche bank. please go ahead.
george hill -- deutsche bank -- analyst
good morning guys. thanks for taking the question. jason, you kind of alluded to this already, but have you been able to fully capture the pricing gap that occurred earlier this year as it related to ppe and supplies and the bed business? and i guess also, could you update us on the supply side as we think about your things like access to gloves and gowns to provide for your customers? and then i tack on at the end to relate to jailendra's question is are there any dissynergies from the cordis divestiture?
jason hollar -- chief financial officer
sure. yes. so yes, we have captured the cost increases. the supply assurance program that we've referenced was created to do exactly that, to provide certainty to supply for our customers, but working with them closely to ensure that we're able to cover those costs. what i have referenced, i think, fairly consistently the last couple of quarters is that the timing of when that cost is recognized versus when the price is recognized can be uncertain, can be relatively volatile and that's what we continue to look at and to manage. but the overall economics of the program are as expected and intended, which is to cover that cost. and then as it relates to -- i think your question was about access to the products. it continues to improve, but especially on the gloves side, it's still constrained, but improving day by day. there's clearly capacity that's being worked in to provide more supply. but especially in gloves, it just takes -- it's a longer process to get that supply to market.
as it relates to cordis and any dissynergies, i wouldn't call it dissynergies. there are -- certainly, when we look at just our overall cost structure and stranded costs, there's things of that nature. but when we estimate the $60 million to $70 million, that's the all-in impact that's associated with that. we would not anticipate that there are other issues. in fact, i'd go the opposite way. part of what we've highlighted before about this transaction is that it allows us to focus and to simplify our operating structure around the remaining businesses. and so we think it will create some opportunities for additional synergies more of -- than more of dissynergies by being more focused on the cost efficiencies of what remains.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
the only thing i would add to that, too, to be helpful is we have really invested in our overall own global manufacturing capabilities. and if you remember in my script, for instance, we're a large manufacturer of syringes. we've increased our capacity there by 15 million units on an annual basis. on gowns, we've added capacity to add 20 million-some manufacturers grows a year. and our masks were at 150 million more masks a year annually all in our own facilities, which are all either u.s. or near u.s., they're all north american types of facilities. so we've done, i think, a very excellent job in the medical segment of increasing our capacity and -- which -- what really, i think, strengthens our supply chain. and we've also invested in our sourcing capabilities and broadened our relationships with suppliers. so we feel really good about some of the changes in developments we've made in our overall supply chain in medical.
george hill -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and our last question comes from kevin caliendo from ubs. please go ahead.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
thanks. thanks for taking my question. i just want to go back to the sort of the headwinds and tailwinds for fiscal '22. if i'm sort of netting everything out, it sounds like covid impact for medical is going to be incremental, like you considered an incremental negative. did i think about that right? can we just go through that one more time?
jason hollar -- chief financial officer
yes. for the medical business, i would anticipate that the impact of covid in the fiscal year, so not a year-over-year comparison, but just what's the impact of covid will be a tailwind for this year. so the question is, well, what are those same types of dynamics next year. do we see more permanent longer-lasting ppe volumes, lab volumes. i've referenced the timing associated with the price and cost of ppe that could carry over into next year. but if it goes all -- if everything goes back to what a pre-covid world looked like, it would imply a headwind. of course, we expect there to be a more significant tailwind opportunity on the pharma side, but specifically to the med business, that's the right way to look at it. and just one thing to add additional color to where i'm sure you're trying to go with the question, is that when we think about our full year guidance of the low to mid-20s percentage growth, obviously, we have within that some of that benefit i'm talking about. and just to be real clear, even if you back that out, we do have growth in the medical business, but it is a key part of the growth that we're seeing this year as well.
kevin moran -- vice president of investor relations

mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
thanks, kevin, and good morning, everyone. before i turn it over to jason, i will provide a few high-level thoughts. we remain focused on serving our customers and their patients and continue to advance our strategic priorities. with our resilient business model, we are navigating the effects of the pandemic on our businesses. in the quarter, we continued to see strong demand for lab and ppe products and volume recovery in our nuclear business. medical elective procedure utilization experienced some volatility, and we saw ongoing covid-19 related softness in generics volumes, which we now expect to extend into the next fiscal year. with these updated assumptions, we have revised our pharma segment outlook. despite the impacts of covid-19, our business fundamentals are strong, demonstrated by the underlying growth we are seeing in both segments, and we continue to advance our strategic priorities including optimizing our supply chain and portfolio as you saw in our recently announced agreement to sell the cordis business. as we navigate the pandemic, our customer focus remains central to our activities. we deeply appreciate that it is our responsibility to serve healthcare providers, their patients and those on the front lines. although the operating environment remains dynamic, it has reinforced our critical role in the supply chain, and it highlights opportunities for us to enhance our operation and evolve for future growth.
i'll discuss some of the changes we are making later in my comments, but first i'll turn it over to jason to provide additional details on our results and outlook.
jason hollar -- chief financial officer
thanks, mike. before i dive into the current quarter, as a reminder we are now comparing against a prior year quarter that included a benefit from accelerated pharmaceutical sales and increased ppe demand due to the onset of covid-19. now for our consolidated third quarter results, total company revenue of $39.3 billion was inline with the prior year. consolidated gross margin for the period was $1.8 billion. sg&a decreased nearly 4% to $1.1 billion, demonstrating our enterprisewide commitment to disciplined expense management. the net result for the quarter was operating earnings of $689 million, a decrease of 4% due to the impact of covid-19, primarily concentrated in the pharma segment. adjusted for covid-19, we estimate operating earnings would have grown mid-single digits in the quarter. moving below the line, interest and other income and expense decreased significantly in the quarter, driven by multiple items, including an increase in the value of our deferred compensation plan investments, lower interest expense from prior period debt reduction or one-time investment gains. as we previously mentioned, deferred compensation gains or losses reported in interest and other are fully offset in corporate sg&a and net neutral to our bottom line. average diluted shares outstanding were $294 million. of note, during the quarter, we repurchased $200 million of shares. third quarter eps was $1.53, which reflects an effective tax rate of 31.2%, approximately 5.5 percentage points above the prior year, due to the timing of discreet items. this includes adjustments for the resolution of all and issues with the irs for fiscal years 2008 to 2010 as well as certain transfer pricing matters for fiscal years 2011 to 2014, which also impacted results for later years.
turning to cash and the balance sheet, we generated operating cash flow of $277 million, bringing our year-to-date operating cash flow to $1.8 billion. as a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point-in-time cash flows. we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.5 billion and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. now for the segment results, beginning with pharma on slide 5. pharma segment revenue was flat $35.1 billion. this reflects sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers, compared against the previously mentioned covid-19-related sales acceleration in the prior year. segment profit decreased 4% to $511 million, primarily due to covid-19-related volume declines in our generics program, which was partially offset by a higher contribution for brand sales mix. excluding the volume impacts, our generics program continued to see generally consistent market dynamics. additionally, we were encouraged to see our nuclear business continue its recovery as we saw an improvement in volumes as we exited the quarter. in specialty, we continue to see year-over-year growth and are excited about recent wins in our 3pl and hub business. and the pharma team remains focused on diligent expense management, delivering strong cost savings in the quarter. now, i'm transitioning to medical on slide 6. medical segment revenue increased 3% to $4.2 billion, driven primarily by the impact from covid-19 on products and distribution. as in prior quarters, we saw higher selling prices and volumes in ppe as well as higher volumes in our lab business, partially offset by lower demand for surgical products resulting from reduced elective procedures. segment profit decreased 2% to $174 million.
during the quarter, cost savings including global manufacturing efficiencies were offset by a decline in products and distribution. additionally, segment profit experienced a slight net negative impact due to covid-19, driven by the sell-through of ppe safety stock in the prior year. now, let me step back to help frame our performance sequentially within the context of the previously discussed factors. during the third quarter, demand for surgical products used in elective procedures averaged approximately 90% of pre-covid-19 compared to the 95% average in the prior quarter. we saw choppiness especially early in the quarter, consistent with the evolution of the virus in various geographies, but as we exited the third quarter, elective volumes rebounded back to around 95%. our lab business continued to experience the tailwind from increased demand for covid-19 testing products, though as expected, not quite at the peak level seen last quarter. regarding ppe, we continue to see elevated volumes. in the quarter, we were successful in managing the significant cost increases that we've incurred to procure select ppe products. as we previously mentioned, many of our customers have chosen to leverage our supply assurance program to manage market uncertainties, and we continue to expect timing variability as we support our customers through this dynamic environment. next, on slide 8, i will review updates to our fiscal '21 outlook.
based on our performance to date and increase visibility for the balance of the fiscal year, we are narrowing our eps guidance to $5.90 to $6.05, which continues to reflect 10% eps growth at the mid-point. we are making the following changes to our corporate assumptions. we now expect interest and other in the range of $145 million to $160 million, driven primarily by the deferred compensation favorability to date, which as a reminder, is offset above the line. we are narrowing our effective tax rate to 23.5% to 25%, reflecting the previously mentioned irs resolutions. we expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 294 million shares, which includes the repurchases completed during the quarter. additionally, capital expenditures are now expected in the range of $400 million to $430 million. moving to the segment outlook on slide 9. we are updating our pharma segment profit outlook to flat to down low single digits due to updated expectations for covid-19. based on our third quarter exit rates and what we saw in april, we still expect brand pharmaceutical volumes to be at or near pre-covid-19 levels as we exit the fiscal year, but we now expect the volume recovery of certain therapeutic classes within generics to extend into the end of calendar year 2021.
as for the medical segment, we continue to expect elective procedures to be at or near pre-covid levels by the end of the fiscal year as well as segment profit growth in the low to mid-20s percentage range for fiscal '21. with respect to the enterprise, we now expect covid-19 to be a minimal net year-over-year driver. this guidance assumes a meaningful year-over-year covid-19 headwind for the pharma segment and a similar tailwind for the medical segment. before i conclude, let me take a moment to provide an update on capital allocation. we continue to manage our portfolio and the balance sheet in a prudent manner consistent with our priorities while at the same time driving improved financial flexibility. we expect the sale of cordis to close in the first quarter of our fiscal '22. this transaction, along with the previously announced tax receivable, is expected to generate nearly $2 billion of incremental proceeds in the first half of our fiscal '22. we expect to utilize these proceeds in a manner consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities, investing in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. with respect to our first priority, investing in the business to enable our strong pipeline of organic growth opportunities, we continue to be excited by the projects in flight.
we expect this to remain our highest focus for capital deployment and to continue to prioritize investment in these areas. regarding the balance sheet, as previously communicated, we expect to repay $1.4 billion of debt on or before june 2022. combined with prior repayments, this would represent a total debt reduction of nearly $5 billion over five years. while we will continue to evaluate additional opportunities to reduce debt, we anticipate our future repayments will be more modest as we approach our leverage target. at the same time, we are committed to our dividend, which remains an important component of our capital allocation strategy. with that in mind, our board recently approved a 1% dividend increase for fiscal '22. outside of these three key priorities, we'll continue to evaluate tuck-in m&a within our strategic growth areas and opportunistic share repurchases. as i mentioned, our improving financial flexibility enabled the deployment of capital for share repurchases during the third quarter.
with that, i'll turn it back over to mike.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
thanks, jason. as i mentioned earlier, the last year has highlighted certain opportunities for growth, transformation and innovation, and we're confident that our strategic direction will deliver both short- and long-term success. in pharma, we are excited about the mid- to long-term trajectory of the segment. our business model is resilient. we're expecting strong long-term growth in key areas like specialty and nuclear, both of which are rebounding well from prior covid-related impacts, and we are executing a robust pipeline of initiatives in pd to support our customers' evolving needs. we also continue to invest in new technology solutions that enhance the customer experience and improve patient care. in specialty, our recently launched navista tech solutions uses artificial intelligence to identify and match cancer patients to clinical trials. these insights enable oncologists to improve outcomes and reduce cost as they transition to value-based care. we are also offering digital solutions in the connected care businesses that we recently branded collectively as outcomes. each year, medication non-adherence cost, the u.s. healthcare system over $500 billion and contributes to around 275,000 avoidable patient death. with outcomes, we've created a digital ecosystem that unites pharmacists, payers and pharmaceutical companies to improve medication adherence, drive better outcomes and lower the cost of care. outcomes currently supports a network of 23 million patients and more than 60,000 pharmacy sites nationwide and through continued growth, it's positioned to address the challenge of medication adherence.
as i look toward the future, i am excited about these innovations across the segment that combine our heritage and strengths with new technologies to create unique solutions that support our customers' ever-changing needs and create long-term value across the continuum of care. turning to medical. we continue to enhance our operations to better serve our customers and their patients. for example, we continue to diversify the geographic concentration of our sourcing and invest in our self-manufacturing capabilities. this includes producing 15 million more safety needles and syringes, 20 million more isolation gowns and 150 million more surgical and procedure masks annually in our own north american facilities. we are also supporting customers' inventory needs with stockpile as-a-service storage solution in partnering with the strategic national stockpile to store and distribute 80,000 pallets of critical ppe. we are incorporating robotics, automation and data analytics across our warehouse and distribution process. we are piloting various technologies and being thoughtful about how and where to scale them across our network. we also continue to invest in key areas across the segment. for example, we are expanding our lab kitting services to support home collection for a broad array of lab tests from wellness to infectious disease, and we are coupling these services with capabilities in our cardinal health at-home and optifreight businesses to maximize value and create differentiated solutions.
by meeting the patient where they are, our lab kitting supports testing protocol adherence and detection of early onset disease, ultimately, lowering the cost of care. and in medical services, our optifreight logistics business is launching innovative and comprehensive healthcare logistics offerings like our same-day solutions, which is being scaled nationally to support the time-critical logistics of our customers. together, these work streams across medical position us to support our customers and drive long-term growth. along with these work streams in each segment, we are also focused on enterprisewide investments as well as advancing our capital allocation, portfolio optimization and esg priorities. we continue to invest in our delivery networks, cold chain capabilities and supply chain capacity and visibility. for example, we are partnering with fourkites, the largest predictive supply chain visibility platform to create a cognitive network spanning both pharma and medical that combines real-time supply chain visibility, machine learning and artificial intelligence. this network facilitates inventory flow and gives our customers end-to-end visibility to see products in transit, enabling us to make any necessary adjustments for our customers in real time so they can better serve their patients. regarding our capital allocation priorities, we have strong momentum. we remain committed to investing for future growth, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. we are on track to exceed our savings targets and are continuing to use some of these savings to reinvest in the business.
we also remain focused on optimizing our portfolio. the pending sale of cordis is progressing as expected and this divestiture enables us to simplify our operating model, further optimize our infrastructure and focus on our strategic growth areas where we are an advantaged owner. we are committed to our strategy as a global medical products and distribution leader and are focused on conducting business in markets and areas that align with our priorities. finally, we're also advancing our environmental, social and governance activities. we recently partnered with aep to power our global headquarters and our national logistics center with clean energy. and we remain deeply committed to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion at every level to ensure all of our employees can bring 100% of themselves to work every day. to close, i want to thank each of our employees whose commitment and ingenuity enable us to support our customers, their patients and our collective communities.
with that, i'll pause to open it up for questions.

good morning. thanks so much for the question. i want to dive a little bit more into the capital deployment priorities as you think about into '22. obviously, you have the cordis proceeds that are coming in at $1 billion, i believe. the tax receivable agreement, if i recall, is about $1 billion or so, and i can double check that in the last quarter's transcript. when you think about that, think about your cash position as you sit now and the free cash that you're going to generate this year, even with the investments that you're making, do you think there's an opportunity to be a bit more aggressive either on the buyback given where your stock sits in the market? on m&a, given that you talked about a number of growth priorities of which, i assume with some bolt-on transactions. just curious about that philosophy where you sit now given that the company is in a stronger balance sheet position, as i can recall seeing in a while?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
thanks, mike. i appreciate the question. and we are really excited about the work we've done around that. but i'm going to have jason give you a little bit more color on it.
jason hollar -- chief financial officer
yes. thanks, mike. and first of all, yes, i think we had some really great cash flow this last year. so $2.4 billion of operating cash flow and that resulted in a $3.4 billion ending cash balance, which does include the $500 million debt paydown that we completed in the fourth quarter. so as you indicated perfectly, we are stepping into this year with a lot of flexibility even before the cordis transaction closed, which was just a few days ago, which does add another $1 billion to that balance. as we highlighted in some of those comments this morning, we do expect to paydown the $850 million is coming due by the end of the fiscal year or before end of the fiscal year. so that will be some of those uses. and then, of course, we guided toward the $500 million to $1 billion for the share repurchases, which is a fairly wide range reflective of some of the flexibility that we talked about. and as i think about the cordis proceeds, of course, cash is somewhat fungible. but essentially, that $1 billion, how we're thinking about it is accelerating some of that debt paydown and a portion of that, $500 million to $1 billion. so we feel real good about that as we entered into the first quarter here. you referenced the tax receivable. and i don't think we provided any updated comments on that so far. last quarter, i referenced that we expected by the end of the calendar year. that's still our expectation, like, i think, a lot of different organizations throughout the world right now. i think covid has impacted some of the processes and a little bit less certainty as to the precise timing. but we still feel pretty good that's a good approximate time frame. but when you think about receiving those proceeds perhaps late in the calendar year, there will be less time to actually deploy those to the balance of this year. so that's certainly still a potential opportunity to get us maybe to some of the higher ends of that range. but nonetheless, there's a lot of flexibility that goes along with that. as you indicated, when we talk about the opportunistic uses, essentially, we have increased flexibility here. m&a is always on that list. and it depends on the opportunity, the valuation and what we see is delivering to us strategically. and so that will be another thing that we evaluate along the year. thanks for the question.
operator
up next, we'll hear from kevin caliendo with ubs. please go ahead.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks. i just want to expand on that a little bit. i guess i don't understand why you're not being more aggressive with the buyback versus stock or more? i mean are there any credit issues or anything else that you're concerned about? and also on the buyback, if i'm doing the math right, it feels like your -- like the numbers don't entirely jive to get to that $0.21. is there -- is it just simply the timing that it would happen so late in the year? is why the buyback would be covered the sort of $0.21 of dilution from cordis?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yes. let me start, kevin, and then i'll turn it back over to jason. i'll just comment specifically on the opioid piece and then let jason give you a little bit more information. the opioid, as we said, we're pleased to get to the point where we are right now, where we have a comprehensive settlement out there. but it does have a few more steps left in it. so we do have to wait and see if we get the states and cities and counties to sign on to get enough critical mass in order to make a final decision. and so we do have some time left on that to make sure that we understand exactly with clarity where that's going to be. but we're pleased with where we are as far as an initial step of finally getting something out there for people to consider. and then let me now turn it over to jason to go into a little bit more of the other details that you asked about.
jason hollar -- chief financial officer
yes. and as it relates to the loosen on the quarters that was implied a reference within there, it's just a matter of the timing of what you assume when we pay down the debt and when we would complete the share repurchases. and so there's an opportunity for that to have a reasonable range. and that guidance range, we think, reflects what we think that possibility may be. and -- but the key thing on a pro forma basis is that extra $1 billion will be deployed in some manner. and we will see -- and certainly, within fiscal '23 run rate, there will not be dilution expected for that divestiture. as it relates to yet another question, somewhat as it relates to credit issues. there's nothing there. i mean we're on a gliding path to getting to our targeted leverage ratio. a key part that i referenced last quarter is that this remaining debt that's coming due at the end of this fiscal year is a key part of getting us toward those targets. and i indicated last quarter that i would anticipate the level of debt paydown to begin to diminish after this fiscal year. that continues to be our expectation. there's a lot of factors, as mike just referenced, that could play into that. but overall, that remains our viewpoint, and there's nothing here that is, i'll say, overly constructive from that point, just a little bit of prudence until we get some of these risks and uncertainties defined. and we also need to see underlying performance and cash flow over the course of the year. and then as i mentioned before, we do have some additional flexibility as it relates to the precise timing of the tax receivable.
operator
up next, we will take a question from jailendra singh with credit suisse. please go ahead.
jailendra singh -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks and good morning. i want to go back to your this inventory impact on ppe in the quarter. can you elaborate a little bit more on what products this relates to? and is there a potential that you might have another write-down in fiscal '22? and what kind of initiatives you're putting in place to ensure that this does not happen again?
jason hollar -- chief financial officer
sure. yes. so i'll go and start it. and -- so as mike mentioned, the key thing here is that there's a lot of uncertainties with the pandemic. and we were, first and foremost, going to put our customer commitments in front of us, and that resulted in a higher level of inventory that we carried over that period of time. and that happened while there was obviously increasing demand, higher prices and lower -- longer than normal types of supply chains. and then we step back -- every quarter, we would step back and do our analysis and determine what the net realizable value that is and then make any adjustments that may be necessary. so as mike highlighted, there were some highly commoditized products. so it's a subset of our ppe that -- think of it as those products that would have more volatile type of pricing. we saw that move more dramatically over the period. and given it was a subset of our inventory, it was relatively defined. it was a relatively large percentage reduction within that, but it was contained to a certain subset. and again, we're not going to get into all the details product-by-product, but it was that type of product that has a little bit less of the value add and then therefore, has a little bit easier to get more supply into the market and that drove the prices down quicker than other products. anything else to add, mike?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
only i'd reiterate that our focus has always been and will continue to be on our customer, and it was important to us from the very beginning of this pandemic to acquire critical ppe for our customers. and as jason said, we did ramp up during a period of higher demand and higher prices and longer supply chains.
kevin moran -- vice president, investor relations
next question, please.
operator
next, we will hear from ricky goldwasser from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
ricky goldwasser -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes, hi, good morning. thanks for all the details you provided in your prepared remarks. just a couple of follow-up questions to understand sort of the moving parts in the guidance. so specifically, you talked about the customer renewal. it seems like it's cvs. can you maybe help us quantify what the impact is in 2022? and also if there are any other renewals that we should be considering in the next 12 to 18 months? and then the second question toward at the moving parts are on the investment that you're making? should we think about them as sort of a onetime investment in 2022? or should we now factor just kind of like ongoing levels of investments to support future growth?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yes, i'll start talk about the renewals and then i'll have jason make a comment on the investments. the renewal that we're talking about had the -- red oak renewal is not at all included in what jason was talking about on customer renewals. that's considered in our overall generics program performance, which we expect to be in -- to be something that we would expect to be a tailwind next year, and we feel really good about where we're headed with all the various components of our generics program and excited to continue to partner with cvs, moving forward with on red oak. what jason was talking about in renewals was just the normal renewals. there was nothing unexpected in the fourth quarter customer renewals. they basically came in as planned. and so that was not anything. i would consider it, as we look forward, we don't see customer rules being any different or unusual for us in fy '22.
jason hollar -- chief financial officer
yes. as it relates to the other moving pieces for pharma, that are a part of that underlying guidance. our growth business, as we expect to contribute. as mike mentioned, we expect double-digit growth for our growth businesses, top line as well as bottom line. and for the pharma business, that would be, of course, specialty, nuclear and outcomes. and then we have the the year-over-year covid benefit that i mentioned would be a key part of that. but as mike mentioned, that the customer renewals is not something that we would anticipate to be significantly different year-over-year. and then your question regarding investments. those investments are a mixture of -- we've spent quite heavily over the last couple of several years on the capital side of getting these it systems in place. we are finalizing that multiyear journey now and are starting to depreciate those assets. so there will be elevated depreciation that, of course, is more fixed in nature. but there's also a component of the final testing and rollout launch of these systems tend to be more expense versus capital. and so as we're right in that rollout stage, that expense will be elevated in that part, we would expect to reduce longer term, certainly beyond fiscal '22. but for the balance of this year, we would expect it to be elevated. and then thereafter, some portion of it will come down later on.
kevin moran -- vice president, investor relations
next question?
operator
and up next, we'll hear from eric percher from nephron research. please go ahead.
eric percher -- nephron research -- analyst
thank you. i wanted to ask about the generic volume commentary around certain classes. i know that we saw a clear increase in acute volumes from march into april and the quarter. so what are the classes where you're seeing this? and any other specifics on how that's impacting the generic program?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks for the question. so a couple of things on that. we did see some sequential growth from q3 to q4 on generic volumes. so that continues to be a positive sign. we do expect our -- impact from covid-19 on all generic volumes to be back at pre-covid levels by the end of the calendar year or by the end of our q2. what we're referring to here is we're still seeing, again, ramping up, but we're still seeing some less than pre-covid volumes on areas like anti-infectives, antibacterials, antibiotics, antivirals and some pain medications that we've not seen. our thoughts are as life continues to get more and more back to normal, if that's the right word, kids are back in school, etc., we would start to see those drugs being needed more than they probably have historically been needed. so again, expect them to be back to pre-covid levels by the end of the year, but that's really what we're talking about. very similar to the exact same thing, we talked about last quarter, and it's kind of continuing to play out as we mentioned back then.
kevin moran -- vice president, investor relations
next question please?
operator
and next, we'll hear from steven valiquette with barclays. please go ahead.
steven valiquette -- barclays -- analyst
[indecipherable] repurchased cost categories that are trending above baseline. so i'm curious, if you're seeing those same trends as well? thanks.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
mr. valiquette. i'm sorry, we didn't catch the beginning of your question. so if you could try it again.
steven valiquette -- barclays -- analyst
yes. sorry, i knew at some point it would happen, i would be paying to ask two questions on two calls at the same time, that just happens. so i guess i'm curious to if you could provide more color on the elevated supply chain cost you mentioned for the medical segment in fiscal 4q? you cited that in the press release. i guess i'm curious, geographically, is this cost pressure mainly in the u.s. or is it international as well, in addition to some other color just on mechanically what's happening there? and does the sale of cordis alleviate this in any way into fiscal '22?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
i'll start with your second piece first. really, i don't see cordis alleviating that at least toward the -- what the guidance we set. of course, there could have been elevated costs on some of their raw materials and products. and cordis being more international, obviously, it had more fx potential fluctuation. but don't see cordis being a factor there. as far as the elevated supply chain cost, what we started seeing in the fourth quarter is, i think, which you're hearing a lot of companies talking about, we're seeing increased fuel costs, we're starting to see the cost of, for instance, containers can be three to 10 times what they cost to ship in prior to covid just due to ports being plugged, things like that. so we're just -- wages, etc. so it's just those types of things that we're seeing general elevated supply chain across the board. again, we saw that in q4. we expect that to continue in for the first couple of quarters. and then as things get back to more normal, we'll be able to see some either reductions in those or we'll be able to take some of those costs and where possible that appropriately pass it through to customers if it's a more permanent type of thing. so we'll be monitoring that and keeping our eyes on that.
operator
and our next question will come from elizabeth anderson with evercore isi. please go ahead.
eduardo -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi. good morning. this is eduardo [phonetic] on for elizabeth. can you guys maybe provide some more color on the $250 million of additional cost savings opportunities? and i guess what areas of the enterprise you expect to generate those savings from?
jason hollar -- chief financial officer
sure. yes, i would say it's very much a continuation of what we've done to date. as you certainly recall, our initial target was the $500 million, and we've come close to accomplishing that after the -- just the first three years. and that was in varied areas, everywhere from manufacturing, our footprint work there to our distribution work, all the way up to our functional areas. as we go forward, what we're seeing in this next stage is the ability to go from more of the transactional first order benefits of like rate negotiation in areas like transportation and going further into really redesigning networks and getting into more augmented intelligence and things of that nature. we have -- one area that is allowing us to unlock additional value in this next stage is the cordis divestiture. we talked about the simplification of our international operating structure. that's an enabler for us to continue to go after additional opportunities there, and then just continue on at all fronts given that we've got good momentum in place already for the existing initiatives.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
the only thing i would add is that, just to emphasize something jason mentioned is around the use of digital to really get after being able to use box, ai, rpa, etc., to get after our cost structure. we've been investing a lot of time on that. our it team has done a nice job of building out both people, resources and our businesses and functions are all embracing this as well as making sure we're doing work in the right locations are all in other important factors that we see being able to give us some tailwinds going forward on cost savings.
kevin moran -- vice president, investor relations
next question please?
operator
and up next, we'll hear from lisa gill with jpmorgan. please go ahead.
lisa gill -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thanks so much. good morning. i just really want to understand as we think about normalization in your pharma segment, so beyond the renewal, do you see low single-digit to mid-single-digit normalization in pharma segment profit growth over the longer term? and where are specific opportunities that you see to maybe further accelerate that growth beyond 2022? that would be kind of my first question. and do things like specialty and nuclear that you talk about returning to double digit, i know they're on the smaller side, do they help to accelerate that low single-digit to mid-single-digit normalizations? just any drivers or help you can give around that on a longer-term basis.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, lisa. appreciate it. actually, you hit a lot of it right there in your question, is that we did want to provide a normalized growth so that we could share with you what we do believe on our achievable longer-term growth rates for both of the businesses that we provided, the normalized growth on -- specifically, the pharma, i think you said it well. we do expect continued double-digit growth from nuclear and specialty and our outcomes businesses. we see all of them next year being able to grow top and bottom lines by double digits. and we continue to see those businesses continue to be a bigger and bigger portion of the overall pharma segment. so as they continue to grow at those rates and are a bigger portion of the segment, obviously, they're going to continue to have more and more impact. we feel really good about the pipeline of products in nuclear. and with the work we're doing in our center for advancement of theranostics, we already have a significant amount of manufacturers committed to joining us in the center when we open it and working together on some new both treatments and diagnostics for cancer and other areas. so we feel good about all of those businesses. and then as far as the core pd business goes, we think we are well positioned with some very large and important customers, that you're aware of. we've got eight more years now on our agreement related to red oak, and we feel good about that partnership and that's continued positive impact on our generics program. and so those are some of the things, i would say, make us feel good about that growth going forward.
kevin moran -- vice president, investor relations
next question please?
operator
and next, we'll hear from george hill with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
george hill -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, good morning guys and thanks for taking the questions. i guess mike, first, i would ask you, with the renewal of the red oak agreement, are there any substantive changes to the economics of that agreement? and then number two, you guys called out contingent brand inflation in the press -- i'm sorry, in the presentation. as the business is starting to mix back toward brand growth, are you seeing any changes in the underlying economics of the brand relationships and the amount of profit that's exposed to brand price inflation?
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yes, two very good questions. so first of all, on brand. what we're seeing there is we're expecting the overall inflation rate to just be similar for the last couple of years. so we're not seeing any real changes there. and as jason mentioned, the reason you said getting less dollars is because more of the suppliers that were contingent to inflation have moved to noncontingent, and we've renegotiated a couple of those dsas over the last year so that we will no longer be contingent to inflation. as far as overall rates go, i would say, we continue to feel very good about our overall value proposition. we have very strong relationships with manufacturers. and as you know, when any time there's changes in their portfolios, sometimes that means they should get a lower price when they have higher cost drugs coming out and sometimes they need to pay more fees when they lose, say, a high-priced item to a patent expiration. and so those types of moving parts in terms of volume and average line extension are taken into account with each negotiation, and the team has done an excellent job working with our manufacturing partners and continue to have what i consider to be a fair market rate for that and feel very good about that, being able to be something that we can continue going forward. as far as the red oak, we won't be able to get into any specifics there. but as you can imagine, it's been an excellent 7-year relationship. the team there continues to remain intact. they have decades of generic buying experience. the leadership there and the team has -- just a great group of individuals, again, with experience that continues to bring new ideas together to the market to be able to help us continue to get the best cost in the marketplace. and we continue to partner well with cvs at board meetings, etc., to continue to drive that. so we feel that the -- both companies took into -- in the context all the market conditions on generics when we renegotiate. we feel very good about where we are with our red oak extension.
take one last question.
operator
and our last question will come from charles rhyee from cowen. please go ahead.
charles rhyee -- cowen -- analyst
yeah. thanks. thanks for squeezing me in here. maybe, mike -- maybe a question on opioids and the settlement here. i think there's like 150 days or so that -- for the plaintiffs to accept the terms of the settlement. what's the minimum participation that's required under this settlement for it to go into effect? so in other words, is it like half the participants have to at least participate? and then it's my understanding that the amount that you would pay out would scale down depending on the number of participants. so i just wondered what that minimum requirement is? and what happens if you don't hit that threshold? thanks.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks for the question. so you're right. so the total number that is accrued assumes all 50 state, cities and counties are in. so if any single state or cities and counties within states do not elect to be part of it, the number will come down based on agreed upon proration by state. so it will decline at states not -- and cities and counties do not participate. second thing, to your point, it is multi-steps. there's a point where we get some insights to where the states are. then there'll be another point where we'll get to understand where the cities and counties and the subdivisions are. and after all of that, we will take a look at what we call -- we're calling critical mass. there is no set number. so there's no minimum. our goal has been and continues to be to get 100% participation on all 50 states in order to have the most clarity. that may not happen and anything less than that. and we, as a group, we'll have to sit down and determine if that's enough clarity and participation. it's highly dependent on the states that do and don't participate. so we'll have to really step back and look at it as an overall -- from an overall standpoint and make a decision on whether or not to move forward.
jason hollar -- chief financial officer
one thing i'd like to just clarify, as mike indicated, if not all 50 states choose or we from an arrangement to join, that would mean the cash payments would be lower under that structure. it does not necessarily mean the accrual change. and that would -- we look at the facts and circumstances of the situation to determine what the proper accounting would be at that time. so there could certainly be a difference there that we would need to evaluate.
charles rhyee -- cowen -- analyst
good clarification.
operator
and that concludes our q&a session for today. i will now turn the conference back to mike kaufmann for her closing remarks.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
yes, i want to thank everybody for taking the time to be on the call and for the very helpful questions. i know there was a lot of noise in this quarter, but i just want to end with a few thoughts to keep in mind. we did see -- first, we did see underlying growth in fy '21 in both of our segments, if you exclude covid-19, which gives us confidence as we move forward -- going forward with the impacts of the pandemic hopefully beginning to dissipate. our guidance is for growth next year in each segment. and then also if you take normalized growth in each segment, when you normalize for noise like covid and cordis divestiture, we will grow in both segments. we have tailwinds behind our growth businesses. we really expect all of our growth businesses as a group to really grow at least double digits on the top and bottom line. and we have taken some significant actions such as getting after an additional $250 million in cost savings; closing the cordis transaction, which will enable us to simplify our operating model; and extending our agreement with cvs or just a few of the examples. and as the first question was in jason's comment, we do have very strong cash flow generation, which gives us a lot of flexibility to be more opportunistic in our capital deployment. so with that, thanks again, and have a good day.

good day, and welcome to the cardinal health, inc. fourth quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to vice president of investor relations, kevin moran. please go ahead, sir.
kevin moran -- vice president, investor relations
good morning, and welcome. today, we will discuss cardinal health's fourth quarter fiscal 2021 results along with guidance for fiscal year 2022. you can find today's press release and presentation on the ir section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com. joining me today are mike kaufmann, chief executive officer; and jason hollar, chief financial officer. during the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. the matters addressed in the statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. please refer to our sec filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties. please note that during the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-gaap basis unless they are specifically called out as gaap. gaap to non-gaap reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedule attached to our press release. [operator instructions]
with that, i will now turn the call over to mike.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
thank you, kevin, and good morning, everyone. i will start my comments today by acknowledging that our fourth quarter results were below our expectations and yours primarily due to an inventory reserve adjustment of $197 million. this reserve adjustment was driven by changing market conditions related to covid-19 on certain highly commoditized ppe products. to meet our customer commitments during the pandemic, we carried higher levels of inventory in certain ppe categories during a period of significantly increased demand, higher prices and longer-than-normal supply chains. our analysis at the quarter end of both the anticipated customer demand and projected future sale prices for these products resulted in a sizable inventory reserve that affected a subset of our medical products inventory. in addition, there were a few other unexpected items that affected our results, which jason will cover in his remarks. throughout the past year, we have been taking action to drive performance, and we will continue to move forward with urgency. for example, we divested the cordis business, extended our red oak sourcing agreement with cvs health, identified $250 million of additional cost savings opportunities, restructured parts of our organization to increase accountability and made important leadership changes. we are continually reviewing our business and seeking areas to improve.
with the actions we've taken to date and our plans for fy '22, we feel confident in our strategy and are encouraged by the tailwinds behind our growth areas and strong cash flow generation. in fy '21, we grew revenue 6% versus the prior year and despite an estimated $200 million year-over-year operating earnings headwind related to covid-19, we grew eps. we continue to aggressively streamline our cost structure and surpassed our enterprise cost savings target for the third consecutive year. we generated strong operating cash flow, prioritized returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and took actions to further strengthen our balance sheet. as i reflect on the unprecedented events of the past year, our team has prioritized our customers, maintained continuous operations, partnered with governmental agencies to support vaccine administration and protect patients has further improve the resiliency of our supply chain. before turning it over to jason, i want to highlight last week's announcement that we have negotiated a comprehensive proposed settlement agreement and settlement process designed to achieve broad resolution of governmental opioid claims. if all conditions are satisfied, this agreement would result in the settlement of a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities, and depending on the level of state and subdivision participation, we would pay up to $6.4 billion over 18 years. this is an important step forward for our company. as we've consistently said, we remain committed to being part of the solution for the u.s. opioid epidemic and believe the settlement would be a prudent way to provide necessary leads to our communities and certainty for our shareholders.
with that, i'll turn it over to jason to further discuss our results and fy '22 guidance.
jason hollar -- chief financial officer
thanks, mike, and good morning, everyone. in the fourth quarter, we delivered eps of $0.77, which as mike mentioned, included a $197 million inventory reserve on certain ppe in the medical segment. turning to the pharma segment on slide six. fourth quarter revenue increased 15% to $38 billion, driven primarily by sales growth from large pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers. as a reminder, the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 included reduced pharmaceutical demand related to covid-19, which, to a lesser extent, contributed to the growth in the quarter. pharma segment profit was flat in the fourth quarter at $358 million. this reflects covid-19-related volume recovery in our nuclear business, offset by pharmaceutical distribution customer contract renewals. this impact from renewals was in line with our expectations and generally consistent with prior quarters. however, there were some other items, including inventory adjustments and opioid-related legal costs that were higher than previously assumed. as we've mentioned, we continue to prioritize investing for growth and optimizing our core operations. in the fourth quarter, the deployment of some of these technology enhancements resulted in incremental costs for implementation and depreciation, which we also expect the next several quarters as we continue to deploy new capabilities. i will further discuss our investments as we look to fiscal year '22. as we highlighted last quarter, we continued to experience softer volumes in certain therapeutic classes within our generics program. our generics program continued to see generally consistent market dynamics. with respect to other product types, including brand, specialty and consumer health, we largely saw volumes at or above pre-pandemic levels during the fourth quarter. in medical, depicted on slide seven, revenue increased 23% to $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter.
this revenue increase was driven by a net positive impact from covid-19 on products and distribution, primarily due to a recovery in elective procedure volumes and a positive ppe pricing impact. medical segment loss of $63 million in the fourth quarter was due to an adverse impact from covid-19, primarily due to the previously mentioned inventory reserve, partially offset by a recovery in elective procedure volumes. additionally, benefits from cost savings initiatives were offset by elevated supply chain costs. during the quarter, we were encouraged to see elective procedure volumes effectively return to near pre-covid-19 levels. while our team continued to execute on our cost savings and efficiency initiatives within our global manufacturing and supply chain, we did experience elevated supply chain costs, particularly in the areas of freight, labor and commodities. we are taking actions to help mitigate these impacts. but as we look forward, we do expect some of these higher costs to continue into next year. now i'll transition to full year results, beginning with the enterprise. total company revenue increased 6% to $162 billion with strong top line growth in both segments. consolidated gross margin decreased 2% to $6.8 billion. despite sales growth, sg&a decreased 1%, reflecting the benefits of our enterprisewide cost savings measures. operating earnings decreased 5%, reflecting a headwind of approximately $200 million year-over-year related to covid-19, which was split fairly evenly between the segments. excluding covid-19, operating earnings would have grown in the low single digits in fiscal '21. moving below the line, interest and other decreased 44% to $133 million, driven by multiple items, including lower interest expense from debt reduction actions and increase in the value of our deferred compensation plan and onetime investment gains.
as a reminder, deferred compensation gains or losses reported in interest and other are fully offset in corporate sg&a and net neutral to our bottom line. our annual effective tax rate finished at 22.8%, benefiting from discrete items. we finished the year with eps of $5.57, reflecting growth of 2% despite the net covid-19 headwind. turning to the balance sheet. we continue to operate with high net working capital efficiency, generating robust operating cash flow of $2.4 billion for the full year. we finished the year with a strong cash position of $3.4 billion, with no outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities. as a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point-in-time cash flows. we continue to deploy capital according to our priorities, investing $400 million back into the business in capex to drive organic growth, strengthening our balance sheet to approximately $550 million in debt paydown, which occurred primarily in the fourth quarter and returning nearly $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. as for the segment's full year results, beginning with pharma on slide 10. pharma revenue increased 6% to $146 billion, driven by sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers. pharma segment profit decreased 4% to $1.7 billion due to volume declines in the company's generics program, including the impact of covid-19. this was partially offset by favorable brand sales mix. excluding covid-19, we estimate the pharma segment would have grown low single digits in fiscal '21. turning to medical on slide 11. full year medical revenue increased 8% to $16.7 billion, driven by a net positive impact from covid-19 on products and distribution. as we saw throughout the year, this increase was primarily due to the impact of ppe sales and higher volumes in our lab business. medical segment profit decreased 13% to $577 million due to an adverse impact from covid-19 on products and distribution.
this was primarily due to the fourth quarter inventory reserve on certain ppe products, partially offset by higher volumes in our lab business. additionally, the team delivered strong cost savings, including global manufacturing efficiencies on the year. when adjusting for covid-19-related impacts in medical, we estimate the segment would have grown mid-single digits for the full year. while our fiscal '21 results fell short of our expectations, the underlying growth we saw in both segments, excluding covid-19, gives us confidence as we move into next year and the pandemic effects in our businesses continue to dissipate. turning to our guidance for fiscal '22 on slide 13. we expect earnings per share in the range of $5.60 to $5.90. this reflects incremental technology investments of approximately $120 million to drive growth and efficiencies across the enterprise, the cordis divestiture and other assumptions that we will detail momentarily. we expect interest and other in the range of $150 million to $180 million. we anticipate continued reduction in interest expense with the increase over the prior year, primarily a result of the fiscal '21 capability in deferred compensation not expected to repeat. we are assuming a non-gaap effective tax rate in the range of 23.5% to 25.5%. we expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of $287 million to $292 million, and capex of $400 million to $450 million. transitioning to the segments, beginning with pharma on slide 14. we expect high single-digit revenue growth driven by growth from large customers and continued covid-19 recovery and mid-single-digit segment profit growth. we anticipate covid-19 will be an overall tailwind of approximately $100 million to pharma segment profit compared to the prior year. while we will likely continue to see some choppiness, we expect volume recovery in certain generic therapeutic classes by the end of the calendar year.
as mentioned, we are investing in technology enhancements to drive growth and efficiencies, which we expect will lead to an $80 million segment profit headwind in fiscal '22, including the annualization of the investments made in the fourth quarter. adjusting for the covid-19-related impacts and the incremental technology investments, we see pharma normalized growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. we believe normalizing for these impacts provides a better approximation for the long-range growth trajectory of the business. as for other assumptions, we continue to expect consistent market dynamics in our generics program. we expect increased contributions from our growth areas, specialty, including biosimilars, nuclear and outcomes. we anticipate a similar contingent brand inflation rate as in fiscal '21 with continued less dollar contribution each year. and we expect opioid-related legal costs of approximately $125 million, an increase of $10 million versus fiscal '21. for medical on slide 15. we expect revenue to be approximately flat in fiscal '22, primarily due to the prior year covid-19 comparison with low double-digit segment profit growth. with respect to covid-19, we expect an approximate $100 million year-over-year tailwind to medical segment profit. we are assuming elective procedures to remain at or near pre-covid levels for the duration of the year. we expect moderate headwinds in fiscal '22 related to timing of selling higher-cost ppe products and lower lab testing utilization versus the prior year. and we anticipate a year-over-year comparison benefit related to the ppe inventory reserve. outside of covid-19, we expect an approximate $80 million impact to segment profit due to the cordis divestiture. note, the anticipated reported impact for fiscal '22 is higher than previously communicated, primarily due to exchange rate favorability and other operating improvements within the business in the prior year.
additionally, we expect to invest an incremental $20 million in technology enhancements in our at-home business to drive growth and efficiencies. adjusting for these items, we see normalized medical segment profit growth of mid- to high single digits in fiscal '22. finally, as seen in the fourth quarter, we expect elevated supply chain cost to persist, particularly in the first half of the year. we anticipate these elevated costs will be partially offset by the continued benefits from our global manufacturing and supply chain transformation, which will ramp up throughout the year. now a few additional comments on the expected cadence next year. we expect profit growth to be significantly back-half weighted in both segments. in pharma, this is primarily driven by the timing of the previously mentioned incremental technology investments being more weighted toward the front half as well as stronger expected second half performance in our generics program, including the impact of covid-19. in medical, in addition to the elevated supply chain costs, we also anticipate the total unfavorable fiscal '22 covid-19 impact of approximately $50 million to occur primarily in the first half of the year. as a reminder, we also experienced favorable covid-19 impact in the first half of fiscal '21, which was of a similar magnitude. across the organization, we continue to place a high priority on cash flow generation as well as allocating capital in a balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly manner. our strong cash flow and improving capital position will enable our capital allocation priorities, support our company's obligations and provide increased flexibility and the ability to be more opportunistic in our capital deployment. along those lines, we anticipate deploying the cordis proceeds through a combination of share repurchases and debt paydown, which is expected to offset the earnings dilution on a pro forma basis. we expect share repurchases in the range of $500 million to $1 billion in fiscal '22. in addition, we expect total debt paydown of approximately $850 million, reflecting the completion of the remaining june 2022 debt tower at or before maturity.
with that, i'll now turn it over to mike.
mike kaufmann -- chief executive officer
thanks, jason. to be clear, we are disappointed with this finish to the year and are moving forward for the sense of urgency to improve our operation and execute our strategy. we're prioritizing investments in our strategic growth areas and expect these businesses to collectively realize double digit growth in fy '22. and across our business, we're enhancing our it infrastructure in key areas to increase, capabilities and digitization improve the customer experience and drive productivity. while we expect to benefit from these investments this fiscal year, the majority of these benefits will materialize in fy '23 and beyond. in pharma, we're investing an additional $80 million in technology infrastructure to create additional operational efficiencies, improve data insights and drive cost synergies to enhance our ability to grow and generate better outcomes for our customers. our generics program remains a critical priority. this week, we extended our red oak agreement with cvs health for an additional five years, which takes the term of our generic sourcing joint venture through june 30, 2029. this ensures that we can continue to deliver best-in-class sourcing capabilities for our customers well into the future. we are also investing in data and analytics, including our components of our generics program and expect market dynamics consistent with the last few years. we remain committed to supporting the retail pharmacy community. at our recent annual retail business conference, we connected virtually with over 4,000 retail independent pharmacy customers and launched two new digital offerings, navixrx and e-commerce storefront to help independent pharmacies expand their services and improve healthcare outcomes. in specialty, we're investing in our synxis patient hub where our technology solutions help biopharm customers remove barriers to patient care. in our third party logistics business, we're expanding our cold chain storage space to accommodate the growing number of temperature temperature-sensitive products, including cell and gene therapies.
in nuclear, we received fda approval to use our radioactive diagnostic agent lymphoseek in pediatric patients one month and older. we continue to build out our multimillion dollar center for theranostics advancement in indianapolis and are also investing to expand our pet capabilities. we expect double-digit profit growth in nuclear over the next several years. and in outcomes, we also expect double-digit profit growth as we expand our direct-to-patient digital footprint and implement new patient adherence programs. turning to medical. we have been taking quick decisive actions throughout the fiscal year to streamline and simplify our medical business, and this work remains a top priority heading into fy '22. we've recently restructured our organization to establish clearer value and made some management changes, including appointing a single leader to manage u.s. medical products and distribution as well as a single leader to manage international. with the divestiture of cordis, we plan to significantly reduce our international commercial footprint and have initially identified 36 markets we intend to exit, so we can focus on the locations where we have a competitive advantage and can generate sustained long-term growth. we're laser-focused on enhancing supply chain resiliency, improving business continuity and investing in advanced planning capabilities to drive forward-looking insights to better serve our customers and their patients. in addition, our medical services businesses, optifreight logistics and wavemark continue to enable clinically integrated and digitally automated supply chains. our at-home business continues to focus on enabling and supporting comfortable home-based care for patients with acute and chronic conditions. we continue to see volume growth as care is rapidly shifting to the home. for fy '22, we're investing an additional $20 million in technology infrastructure to create operational efficiencies and better data visibility.
with respect to the enterprise, we're aggressively reviewing our cost structure to continue streamlining our operations and processes and intend to reinvest a portion of these savings to fuel future growth. in fy '22, we plan to launch initiatives that will deliver at least an additional $250 million savings by fy '23. as jason discussed earlier, we take a balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly approach to capital deployment with a focus on investing in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. in closing, i want to thank our employees for their hard work and contributions that make it possible for cardinal health to fulfill its mission of improving the lives of people every day.
and now jason and i will take your questions.
