i'll now turn the call over to ed. 
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, gar. good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. fiscal 2020 was an incredibly challenging year. i'm very proud of our teams' fourth-quarter accomplishments in finishing the year including a positive overall comp, significantly improved top line, and bottom-line performance from our e-com business and improved earnings per share compared to last year's fourth quarter along with a strong debt-free balance sheet.
this was our strongest fourth-quarter earnings per share performance since fiscal 2012 fourth quarter. we believe these results are quite remarkable considering the significant restrictions on store operating hours and customer traffic during the quarter, high overall unemployment in the broader economy, and other operational challenges posed by the pandemic. in terms of merchandising results for the fourth quarter compared to last year, women's and footwear were our strongest departments with double-digit percentage increases in comparable net sales. men's was just shy a flat and girls decreased in the low-single digits.
accessories and boys, decreased by double digits. we believe that an improved overall assortment in the introduction of several new brands drove the strong performance of women's and footwear. weakness in third-party brands and denim were the primary causes of net sales decline in boys. weaker hydration and backpack businesses were the primary causes of net sales decline and accessories.
hard goods including skateboards, bikes, roller skates, and certain snow products were launched in 20 stores during the fourth quarter after being soft-launched online during the third quarter. hard goods represented less than 2% of total net sales during the fourth quarter but we have been encouraged by the customer response to these new offerings so far. in terms of merchandizing priorities for fiscal 2021, we intend to expand offerings of our proprietary rescue brand, which was our no.1 overall brand in terms of net sales in fiscal 2020. this expansion will include new product categories as well as broader sizing and fit offerings within denim.
we also intend to continue to introduce new third-party brands, which we believe will drive additional customer interest in our overall merchandise assortment. we also intend to expand hard goods into 80 of our stores with greater breadth in our product offerings during the spring expecting that the draw of individual outdoor activities will continue to be meaningful throughout 2021. turning to real estate. we currently have seven new stores planned to open during fiscal 2021 that were originally signed to open during fiscal 2020.
these new stores are dispersed among our existing markets in a mix of both mall and off-mall stores. the first store just opened in las vegas on march 1, two are planned to open by the end of april, and the remaining four are scheduled to open in early may. we intend to continue to open a mix of both mall and off-mall stores over time, but we will be very selective and only pursue those opportunities wherein we believe the economics are appropriate to the environment. inclusive of conservative internal sales estimates and good co-tenancy expectations.
with respect to our existing store portfolio, we have addressed approximately 95% of our store leases relative to the rents. we withheld during the pandemic shutdown period last year. in many cases, we have negotiated ongoing adjusted rent while we remain in this pandemic environment. we currently have one known store closure that will take place at the end of march.
turning to the first quarter of fiscal 2021. total comparable net sales have decreased 4.6% through march 8 versus a comparable period last year. comparable net sales were positive in both physical stores and e-com during last year's period before the pandemic began adversely impacting our operations. as a reminder, all of our stores were abruptly closed midway through last year's first quarter and remained closed into the second quarter due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic across the country.
this year, stores have been operating with significant government mandates restrictions on customer traffic, and reduced operating hours compared to last year's pre-pandemic period. assuming our stores and e-com can remain in operation this year, we would expect our total net sales and earnings per share to be substantially better than last year for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2021. however, at this time specifics are impossible to predict with any certainty until we see how our business performs as we begin to anniversary last year's store shutdown period. to further complicate any efforts to predict our business, we've also been experiencing meaningful product delivery delays from southern california ports impacting almost 20% of our planned retail inventory receipts.
during the first several weeks of the quarter, delivery delays have ranged up to a full month at this time across a variety of product categories. we do not currently have good visibility as to when the situation will be fully resolved. as a result of these delays, we may at times temporarily carry higher inventories than last year. we are carefully monitoring events and adjusting to the best of our ability as we get more information.
in closing, we believe we have successfully managed our way through one of the toughest years in recent retail history. we remain excited about the future of tilly's business and dedicated to continuing to push through the challenges posed by the pandemic. although so much remains uncertain for now, we are hopeful that we can continue to position the business for success in the evolving environment as we proceed through fiscal 2021. we intend to remain conservative in our approach to managing our business over the near term in order to protect our longer-term prospects in light of the continued volatility and uncertainty in the retail environment.
i will now turn the call over to mike, to provide details on the fourth-quarter operating performance and balance sheet. mike?
mike henry -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, ed, good afternoon, everyone. details of our fourth-quarter operating performance compared to last year's fourth quarter were as follows; total net sales were $177.9 million, an increase of $5.4 million or 3.2%, compared to $172.5 million last year. total comparable net sales, including both physical stores and e-commerce, increased 2.5%. comparable net sales from physical stores decreased 12.3% and represented 68.9% of total net sales, compared to 80.7% of total net sales last year.
e-commerce net sales increased 66.5% and represented 31.1% of total net sales, compared to 19.3% of total net sales last year. we ended fiscal 2020 with 238 total stores compared to 240 total stores at the end of fiscal 2019. in fiscal 2020, we opened two new stores and permanently closed four stores. gross profit including buying distribution and occupancy expenses was $58.3 million or 32.7% of net sales, compared to $52.1 million or 30.2% net sales last year.
product margins improved by 210-basis-points primarily due to reduced total markdowns. buying distribution and occupancy cost improved by 40-basis-points collectively. occupancy and cost improved by $2.3 million and 170-basis-points as a percentage of net sales compared to last year. distribution expenses increased by $2.8 million and deleveraged by 140-basis-points primarily due to an increase in the e-com shipping cost of $3.1 million associated with a significant increase in e-commerce orders.
buying cost improved by 10-basis-points. total sg&a expenses were $44.1 million or 24.8% of net sales, compared to $43.6 million or 25.3% of net sales last year. the 50-basis-point improvement in sg&a was primarily driven by a $2.5 million reduction in store payroll and related benefits expenses and a $1 million reduction in print, advertising expenses, partially offset by increased e-com marketing and fulfillment cost of $4 million in the aggregate due to the significant increase in e-com activity. operating income improved to $14.1 million or 7.9% of net sales, compared to $8.5 million or 4.9% of net sales last year, as a result of the combined impact to the factors just noted.
other expense was $0.1 million, compared to other income of $0.6 million last year, primarily due to earning lower interest rates on our investments and approximately $0.2 million in cost associated with our new abl credit facility. income tax expense was $5.1 million or 36.6% of pre-tax income, compared to $2.8 million or 30.9% of pre-tax income last year. net income improved to $8.9 million or $0.29 per diluted share, compared to $6.3 million or $0.21 per diluted share last year. weighted average shares were $30.1 million this year compared to $29.9 million last year.
turning to our balance sheet, we ended the fiscal year with cash and marketable securities totaling $141.1 million, including $2.2 million of withheld store lease payments and no debt outstanding compared to $139.9 million with no withheld store lease payments or debt outstanding last year. we ended the quarter with inventories per square foot down 0.7%. total capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 were $8.2 million, compared to $14.3 million in fiscal 2019, primarily due to the reduction in new store openings this year as a result of the pandemic. as of march 9, 2021, our total cash and marketable securities were $138.7 million, including $2.1 million of withheld store lease payments and no debt outstanding compared to $115.5 million as of the comparable fiscal date last year.
as a reminder, in late february 2020, we paid a cash dividend to stockholders of $1 per share or $29.7 million in the aggregate. per the terms of our abl credit facility, we're temporarily prohibited from paying dividends or repurchasing our own stock until november 2021. turning to the first quarter of fiscal 2021. as i had noted earlier, total comp sales have decreased 4.6% through march 8, including a decrease of 13.3% in comparable store net sales and an increase in e-commerce net sales of 40.6%.
comps were negative in february, but have been positive so far in march. given all stores were closed as a result of the pandemic halfway through the first quarter last year, we would expect our total net sales and earnings per share for the first quarter this year to be substantially better in the $77 million in total net sales and loss per share of $0.59 we reported for last year's first quarter as long as stores and e-com can remain in operation. as we began to anniversary last year's store shutdown period next week the unknowable factors include how to store performance will compare relative to pre-pandemic performance levels, and how e-com will perform as it goes up against last year's significant increases we experienced during the store shut down period. these factors are impossible to predict with any certainty and therefore, we will not be providing any specific earnings guidance at this time.
operator, we'll now go to q&a.
",":
operator
thank you. at this time, we'll be conducting the q&a session. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from jeff van sinderen with b. riley & co.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley & co. -- analyst
hi, everyone. first, let me say congratulations on the strong q4 metrics, amazing to see positive comps there especially given the backdrop. as we're thinking about the port delays in inventory. i know your inventory is down a little bit on a comp basis.
but i think you said about 20% of your receipts are impacted by the delays in a variety of categories. i guess i'm wondering, how much of that has impacted q1, and how much of that do you expect to impact q2, and are the delays changing your ordering plans going forward?
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
it's pretty hard right now jeff to quantify whether it's a q1 impact or a q2 impact. but i'm sure it's going to touch both quarters.
mike henry -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, it's shifting. it's shifting as we go.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
and it really is a moving target. so it's really hard to get any kind of visibility. the brands are having just as difficult of time of getting visibility to when it will get better or when goods will come in. so right now, our inventories are in pretty good shape.
so we're pretty good about that. but obviously, the longer the delays go on it will have some impact on us.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley & co. -- analyst
ok. and then i just wanted to know, i know this is also really hard to predict, but just thinking about the e-com business given the comparisons. and i think you're about 30% e-com penetration in q4 or low 30s. how do we think about or how are you -- i know you can't predict about? how are you thinking about where your e-com business penetration might go, 30% the level or do you think it comes down from there as the stores rent back? at this point, what's your best guess? what's your latest take on that?
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
i think, we -- as you know, we have a pretty underdeveloped e-com business going in pre-pandemic and we've created a lot of positive momentum in building that business, and i don't think it's totally just because the stores were closed. i think a lot of it was, we saw growth in areas that out of areas of the state that we don't have any store presence or we have very little. so we feel that e-com will continue to grow in a good way and a decent pace, even with the stores fully operating. so this still remains a pretty significant opportunity for that business to become big, bigger.
mike henry -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think we're thinking it's going to stay somewhere call it maybe the mid-20% best guess. it's not -- it's unlikely to stay at the low 30s with all stores being open, right? because that penetration is going to shift between the two channels. but, we certainly think it's going to be higher than where we ended fiscal 2019 when it was only 16% of total sales. we don't think it's going to revert all the way back down to where it was.
i think we made a lot of progress. we've invested in technologies and capabilities that we didn't have two years ago. so, we do think it's going to remain a bigger piece of the business and it's good to see that through this past year while that increase occurred on the top line we also improved product margins and bottom-line profitability of our e-com business. so it will be a healthier contributor to the overall business than it has been traditionally in pre-pandemic times.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley & co. -- analyst
if i could squeeze in one more. you put up a really strong operating margin of around 8% for q4. i think and i'm just wondering how you're thinking about that within the context of things. i know that last year obviously, there were some unusual things around expenses.
but i guess what i'm getting at is, do you think 8% percent is sort of -- i won't say the new normal for you. but do you feel like you've moved up i guess in terms of what kind of the normal status quo operating margin might be for you?
mike henry -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
over time, we expect to continue to improve the operating margin performance of this business. each quarter is a little bit different under normal circumstances or if you look back at the history of q1, it's the smallest revenue quarter that puts a lot more pressure on cost and leverage points on cost during the first quarter in particular. so 8% doesn't automatically become the run rate each and every quarter going forward as of the change in volume and the mix between stores and e-com. but generally speaking, we still feel like under normal conditions if everything can stay operating all the covid caveats, we would expect to continue to push this business through the mid-single digits and into the high-single digits in operating margin in the future.
we think that's a realistic goal and certainly, part of our thinking in how we're trying to manage the business.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley & co. -- analyst
ok, great to hear. thanks for taking my questions and best of luck.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, jeff.
operator
and our next question is from matt koranda with roth capital partners.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hey, guys. good afternoon. thanks for the preliminary commentary as well on i guess february. i wanted to get things for how we should think about transaction values and any color you can provide on sort of how comparison maybe on a two-year stack going forward in 1q versus kind of more normal plans in 1q 2019, maybe directionally you could help us with traffic and transaction values relative to that marker?
mike henry -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i don't have any two-year stacks for any of that information. thus far, in the first quarter compared to last year, which would have been the last pre-pandemic weeks at this stage. traffics been down 28%. the conversion rate has increased by high single-digit percentage and average transaction value has been up low teens.
so traffic is certainly down on top of a meaningful decline last year in the prior year at the same time. but it seems that we're doing a good job of converting those who come in and they're buying more than they have in the past when they're coming in.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
got it. that's helpful, mike. and then just on the strong gross margins from this last quarter. it seems like you called out marked-down activity relatively low.
how sustainable do you think that is heading into kind of more of reopening or maybe you're competing a bit more for traffic over the next several months? can you talk a little bit about the markdown environment and how you see that playing out?
mike henry -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, this is one of those things, it's a question mark in the current environment, right? depending on how close store performance is relative to pre-pandemic levels. what the mix-e-com is and then further complicated by this port delay situation that we're dealing with. that is also unpredictable of what exactly is that going to mean for when the products come in, how seasonally appropriate are they, when they do come in. the good thing between q1 and q2 is, that's the spring, summer assortments.
there's not a massive assortment shift between q1 and q2. so as long as we can get those products in somewhere in a reasonable amount of time, we'd expect our product margins to remain pretty consistent as they always typically are. they don't tend to move around by more than 100-basis-points plus or minus historically. our q4 performance was a bit outlier to the good.
so all those unknowns in play. i wouldn't expect it will continue to see plus 200-basis-points in product margins going forward. i think if anything there might be a little bit of pressure on that because of those factors that we just mentioned.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
yeah and just to add to that. we're much better at managing merchandise margins and have been for the past year than what was in the past and we've never been bad at it. just that we got better and the inventory management disciplines within the organization are really good as is merchandized margin, and we have not changed nor that we anticipate changing our promotional strategy where we're just not a promotional company. and if you see a promotion out there most of the time it's a planned promotion at a decent margin.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
got it. ok. the last one, this really quickly. you mentioned a bit of distribution deleverage and it looks like probably mostly just e-com mix.
but anything one time in the quarter to call out just in terms of like maybe excess cost in terms of outbound shipments for challenges around partial careers that kind of caused you a little bit of headache there or is that just mix of e-com in that distribution deleverage?
mike henry -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it's primarily the mix of e-com. i mean if you look back at the last several quarters of our performance the very same things have been the same impacts whether you're looking at the buying distribution occupancy buckets or you're looking at the sg&a bucket. it's been the same key things that are primary drivers of movement in the dollar. so while costs were higher for the carriers, it's more the e-com penetration significant increase in e-com activity is what the primary driver of the increase in the cost is.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok, understood. i'll jump back in queue guys. thank you.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
and our last question comes from mitch kummetz with pivotal research.
mitch kummetz -- pivotal research -- analyst
yeah, thanks for taking my question. mike, i think you said on the quarter occupancy dollars were down. i feel like that's been the trend. can you give us some sense of how you expect that line item flow in 2021 from a dollar standpoint?
mike henry -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it will continue to be reduced because of all of the negotiations that we have completed. the specific impact from quarter-to-quarter is really going to move somewhat depending on where comps land out. so i can't get terribly more specific than that not knowing exactly how stores versus e-com are going to shake out. but we should see year over the year some continuing favorability.
because if you think back 12 months, a lot of these negotiations that we did during this past pandemic year hadn't been accomplished yet. so, we should continue to see some favorability through that line for each of the next couple of quarters, not into the second half, i'd say.
mitch kummetz -- pivotal research -- analyst
ok. and hard goods. i think you said penetration was 2% in the quarter. can you maybe speak to how you expect that to ramp through the year and is that largely incremental? i imagine there's some floor space being pulled from other areas.
but do you feel like that's more incremental than not? and again kind of where those percentages might go?
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
it's largely incremental, but -- and i don't expect it to ramp up to bigger, too much bigger numbers. other than the fact that we're going to expand it into a lot more stores. so in the spring. so that -- so far, the initial test we've done in stores has been good, and we'll continue to build it from there.
but i wouldn't expect a major overall change in our merchandise mix assortment in the store by just adding hard goods. there'll be some tweaks to it, but nothing major coming out.
mitch kummetz -- pivotal research -- analyst
ok. and then i guess lastly, there have been some delayed tax refunds. but now we've got stimulus coming. did the tax refund delays do you think that hit february and how are you thinking about the business with the stimulus that is happening later this month into next month.
and are you ready to capitalize on the stimulus given where the inventory is?
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
i think it's hard to tell whether the stimulus impacted february. the fact is, as we stated as traffic has been down. and the shopping is not back to normal yet and our conversion is really healthy. as mike said an industrywide, i mean the traffic has been off.
still significantly off, and i think it's going to be a while before you see traffic started to normalize. so i think that's a bigger challenge and certainly, the tax refunds and the stimulus should help in terms of driving sales.
mike henry -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, in the middle of february where we saw that really severe winter weather snap hit. we did see our business decelerate everywhere. so, we were actually positive comp overall in the first week of february, and then we were down double digits each of the next two weeks when all that severe weather hit. i think we had 43 total stores closed for up to a week at one point, not all of them were closed to a full week.
but varying degrees. and then the fourth week of february got back into single-digit negative and then week one of march was positive. so, we saw a blip there in week two and week three of february partially because of the weather. it's really hard for us to tell how tax refunds or stimulus impacts factor in.
mitch kummetz -- pivotal research -- analyst
got it. totally understand. all right thanks guys good luck.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
all right, mitch. thank you.
operator
ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the end of the q&a session. and i would like to turn the call back over to ceo, ed thomas for closing remarks.

i will now turn the call over to ed.Â  
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, gar. good afternoon, everyone. thank you for joining us today. fiscal 2021 is off to a record-setting start with our best first-quarter net sales and earnings per share since becoming a public company in 2012.
this follows ending fiscal 2020 with record quarterly net sales and our most profitable fourth quarter in the last eight years. we believe these results are being driven by a compelling merchandising offering, an excellent execution by our corporate and store teams, as well as several favorable environmental factors, including increased consumer activity generally, the impact of federal stimulus checks on consumer spending, a return to in-person learning in many schools, the reopening of public venues. i'm going to discuss our fiscal 2021 performance relative to fiscal 2019's pre-pandemic first quarter as a better indicator of how our business performed. we expected our results to be significantly better than last year due to the pandemic-related store closures we experienced in the latter half of last year's first quarter.
but we were pleasantly surprised at how strong our business performance was relative to any quarter of the last several years. both physical stores and e-com produced double-digit positive comps in the first quarter compared to fiscal 2019. store comps were positive in all regions relative to 2019. in terms of merchandising, all departments comp positive in the first quarter compared to fiscal 2019, with women's, men's, and girls posting double-digit percentage increases, and boy's footwear and accessories posting single-digit percentage increases.
the atypical back-to-school timing during the first quarter resulted in an aggregate increase in backpack and denim sales of nearly $5 million over 2019 first quarter. hard goods produced $2 million in total net sales during the first quarter. still very small percentage of our total business, but continuing to grow. hard goods were in 70 stores at the end of the first quarter, and our plan is for them to be in half of our stores by the end of the second quarter.
we launched our sustainability program during the first quarter, which highlights the work we have been doing with our third-party brands to curate a collection of more sustainable products that have a reduced impact on the environment. so far, we have introduced over 700 products on our website from brands like the north face, billabong, levi's, jansport, obey, hydro flask, teva, and adidas that contains sustainability features that increase the use of recyclable materials or support other positive outcomes. we plan to grow this assortment to more than 1,000 products by the end of the third quarter. we are also currently working with our proprietary brand suppliers to encourage the use of recycled materials in certain of our rsq-branded products.
as an update on real estate, we continue to believe there are significant opportunities for us to grow our store footprint over time. we have added two additional new stores to fiscal 2021 since our last earnings call, bringing the total new store count for the year to nine from seven. eight of these stores have already opened. one store opened in early march, one opened in late april, and the remaining six opened in may.
the ninth store is scheduled to open in early november. we are encouraged by the early results of these new stores and intend to continue to open a mix of both mall and off-mall stores over time, remaining very selective as we do and only with what we believe to be appropriate ramp economics relative to the retail environment that continues to produce negative customer traffic to 2019. turning to the second quarter of fiscal 2021, again, relative to fiscal 2019 due to the varying periods of pandemic store closures we experienced last year, total comparable net sales increased 30% through may 31. we have experienced this significant shift in business toward stores and away from e-com over the last several weeks, which has resulted in e-com comps turning negative since april week 2 compared to last year, but still up nearly 85% relative to fiscal 2019.
we are encouraged by the strong performance of our business thus far in fiscal 2021. and we remain excited about the long-term future of tilly's business and its prospects for continuing profitable growth. i will now turn the call over to mike to provide details on our first-quarter operating performance. mike?
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, corporate secretary
thanks, ed. good afternoon, everyone. details of our first-quarter operating performance compared to last year's first quarter were as follows. total net sales were a record $163.2 million for our first quarter, an increase of $85.9 million, or 111%, compared to $77.3 million last year.
total net sales from physical stores were $127.7 million, an increase of $80.7 million, or 172%, compared to $47 million last year, primarily due to all stores being closed for the latter half of the first quarter last year as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. net sales from physical stores represented 78.3% of our total net sales for the first quarter, compared to 60.8% of total net sales last year. e-commerce net sales were $35.5 million, an increase of $5.1 million, or 17%, compared to $30.3 million last year. e-com net sales represented 21.7% of total net sales, compared to 39.2% of total net sales last year.
compared to last year, e-com comps were up 39% in february, up 40% in march, then down 13% in april as a result of the significant shift in business toward stores that ed just noted. we ended the first quarter with 238 total stores compared to 239 total stores at the end of the first quarter last year. during the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we opened two new stores and permanently closed two stores. for additional reference, we're also providing comparable net sales results relative to fiscal 2019 to help clarify how our first-quarter business performance compared the pre-pandemic levels.
in that light, total comparable net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 21.9%, with comparable net sales from physical stores up 11.7% and e-commerce net sales up 80.4%. in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, total net sales from physical stores represented 84.9% of our total first-quarter net sales, while net sales from e-commerce represented 15.1% of our total first-quarter net sales. gross profit, including buying distribution and occupancy expenses, was $54.8 million, or 33.6% of net sales, compared to $1.6 million or 2.1% of net sales last year. product margins improved by 930 basis points, primarily due to the prior-year impact of an estimated inventory reserve of $4.7 million recorded during last year's first quarter when all stores were closed.
setting aside the prior-year reserve impact, product margins improved by 330 basis points on a comparable basis, primarily a resu -- as a result of a lower total markdown rate. buying distribution and occupancy costs improved by 2,220 basis points collectively despite increasing by $1.5 million in total, due to leveraging these costs against a much higher level of net sales this year compared to last year's store shutdown period. occupancy costs improved by 1,700 basis points as a percentage of net sales and were reduced by $0.5 million compared to last year. distribution expenses improved by 450 basis points as a percentage of net sales despite increasing by $1.6 million.
buying costs improved by 70 basis points as a percentage of net sales despite increasing by $0.5 million. total sg&a expenses were $40 million, or 24.5% of net sales, compared to $30 million or 38.8% of net sales last year. the 1,430-basis-point improvement in sg&a as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to leveraging the higher level of expenses against a much higher level of net sales as a result of all stores being in operation for the entirety of the first quarter compared to only half of last year's first quarter. of the $10 million increase in sg&a, $6.2 million was attributable to store payroll and related benefits due to operating all stores for the entirety of this year's first quarter.
$1.5 million was attributable to corporate bonus accruals due to exceeding our budgeted targets thus far in fiscal 2021. $1.2 million was attributable to increased e-com marketing costs. $1.2 million was attributable to increased corporate payroll and related benefits due to being fully staffed this year compared to significant furloughs during last year's store shutdown period. $0.8 million was attributable to increased credit card fees associated with significantly higher net sales.
and $0.5 million was due to increased insurance premiums. these increases were partially offset by a $1.6 million reversal of a disputed california sales tax assessment originally recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 that we were able to successfully resolve in our favor. operating income improved to $14.9 million, or 9.1% of net sales, compared to an operating loss of $28.4 million, or 36.7% of net sales last year, as a result of the combined impact of the factors just noted. other expense was $0.1 million, compared to other income of $0.4 million last year, primarily due to earning lower interest rates our investments and approximately $0.2 million in costs associated with our new abl credit facility.
income tax expense was $3.8 million, or 25.7% of pre-tax income, compared to an income tax benefit of $10.6 million or 37.9% of pre-tax loss last year. net income improved to $11 million or $0.36 per diluted share. also, a record for a first-quarter for us as a public company, compared to a net loss of $17.4 million or $0.59 per share last year. weighted average shares were 30.5 million this year, compared to 29.7 million last year.
turning to our balance sheet. we ended the first quarter with total cash and marketable securities of $157.6 million, including $0.8 million of remaining withheld store lease payments and no debt outstanding. this compared to $111.1 million at the end of the first quarter last year, which included $13.3 million in withheld store lease payments and $23.7 million of borrowed cash under our then existing credit facility. we ended the first quarter with inventories per square foot down 2.6% relative to last year, but up 8% relative to fiscal 2019 as we seek to support the current momentum of our business.
total capital expenditures for the first quarter were $5.5 million, compared to $3.5 million last year. the increase being primarily due to new store openings this year. turning to the second quarter of fiscal 2021. as ed noted earlier, total comp sales through may 31 increased 30.2% versus the comparable period of fiscal 2019.
this result is comprised of a comparable net sales increase from physical stores of 21.1% and an increase in e-commerce net sales of 84.6%. based on current trends and given the varying periods of store closures we experienced during last year's second quarter as a result of the pandemic, and assuming stores and e-com are able to remain in operation this year, we would expect our total net sales and earnings per share for the second quarter this year to be improved relative to the second quarters of both fiscal 2020 and 2019. we expect to have 244 total stores open at the end of the second quarter, which compares to 238 at the end of last year's second quarter and 229 at the end of fiscal 2019 second quarter. we believe that drawing specific conclusions from comparative financial performance against last year's results can be misleading given the various impacts of the pandemic and it is challenging to predict future performance trends with any certainty due to many continuing unknowable factors in the current environment.
these factors include but are not limited to how the pandemic may continue to impact consumer habits, how the continuation or cessation of federal or state and local stimulus payments may continue to impact consumer spending, how store performance will compare relative to fiscal 2020 and 2019 over a longer period of time, particularly against last year's strong results upon the initial reopening of stores which occurred on a staggered basis over several months beginning in mid-may last year, how e-com will perform relative to significant increases in e-com that sales we experienced during the varying periods of store closures during fiscal 2020, whether or not we'll have a more typical back-to-school season this year, which usually begins in late july, and whether any of the first-quarter business we did in traditional back-to-school product categories will represent a pull-forward of typical back-to-school spending, or if these first-quarter sales will be incremental to what we hope will be a more normal back-to-school season this year. in light of these and other uncertainties, we will not be providing any specific earnings guidance at this time beyond our statement that we expect second-quarter results to be improved compared to the second quarters of fiscal 2020 and 2019. operator, we'll go to our q&a session.

thank you. at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question comes from matt koranda with roth capital partners. please proceed with your question.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks and great quarter. just wanted to talk about margin flow through on the 38% comp that you're seeing quarter to date. just maybe if you could discuss it around merchandise margins.
i would assume they stayed relatively strong relative to q1, and then maybe just -- maybe if you could talk about how buying distribution and occupancy costs are kind of moving through the quarter here.Â 
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, corporate secretary
sure. so there's a couple of odd things as we think about last year. i noted in my prepared remarks, the first-quarter impact of the estimated reserves that we took, the $4.7 million when all of our stores were closed and we didn't know yet how long most of them would stay closed and thought we're going to have to be a heck of a lot more promotional than we ended up being in reality. so during the second quarter last year, our product margins were up.
i think it was 360 basis points, which was an unusual favorable movement for us. you know, you've followed us a while. you know, usually, our product margins don't move around a whole lot from -- versus prior year. plus or minus 100 basis points is pretty typical for us.
we tend to have pretty stable product margins. but last year was up 360 basis points. so given the level of full price selling that took place relative to those items we had already reserved in the first quarter, there is an unusually high level of product margins in last year's second quarter. so i do anticipate that our second-quarter product margins will be down to last year and could be -- it remains to be seen what happens the rest of the quarter, but it could be as much as that original 360 unusual swing to the positive.
may or may not happen, depends on how the rest of the quarter plays out. on occupancy distribution, those kinds of things, we should still see -- with the level of sales we're seeing, we should still see some leverage on both distribution and occupancy. the dollars will be up to some degree though. distribution certainly with all stores being open this year versus all stores being closed for the first two weeks of may and a lot on into june before they reopened last year, we've got a full quarter of distribution operations this year.
so those dollars are going to be higher. we have the eight store openings that have already happened that ed referenced in his remarks, so they'll be raw dollar increases in occupancy because of the added stores. and again, because of the operation of all stores all quarter long. you know, occupancy isn't just store rents, it's also things like utilities, and telephone, and security, and other things like that that will cause a dollar increase in those items.
and then just thinking about sg&a, there'll also be a much more substantial dollar increase in sg&a. you know, exact numbers to be seen depending on how sales behave the rest of the quarter, which i can't predict, but it still should be a larger dollar increase in sg&a than what we saw in q1. again, with all stores being in operation. it's a -- the second quarter is typically a larger revenue quarter than the first quarter, even though this this first quarter we just finished was unusually strong.
if that pattern holds, then q2 is a larger revenue than q1. there is going to be an even larger increase in store payroll than we saw in q1. there'll be more bonus accruals coming because we are definitely exceeding our budget targets for the year. so those are some of the puts and takes.
and again, the specifics are just impossible to predict with not knowing all the answers to the list of questions that i called out.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jeff van sinderen with b. riley. please proceed with your question.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley & co. -- analyst
hi, everyone. and let me just say first, terrific work managing through the worst, we hope was the worst of the pandemic. and congratulations on the great metrics for q1.Â 
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, jeff. thank you.Â 
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley & co. -- analyst
i guess my first question just kind of following up on supply chain. is there more color you can give us relevant to what you're seeing in supply chain? i guess where are the challenges if any and what areas are improving and how are you managing inventory for what is usually the, you know, kind of the traditional back-to-school period within the confines of whatever supply chain dynamics you're dealing with at this point?Â 
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
well, the port delays on the west coast still remain an issue. in the scheme of things, overall, materiality is low compared to what the total receipts are expected to be. we don't have much color in terms of when the port situation improves. but certainly, we're monitoring it.
and we did plan on bringing in some inventory for back to school a little earlier than norm to compensate for the potential delays. but i feel pretty good about where our inventory is right now and where it's going to land.Â 
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley & co. -- analyst
ok, good. and then i guess just it sounds like you're starting to see a little bit of a shift here from e-com back to brick and mortar. so i guess how are you thinking about that for the remainder of q2? and then i guess as we kind of think more about q3 also as we wrap up the back-to-school period -- traditional back-to-school period, how are you thinking about that?
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
i, you know, i think obviously, jeff, we are going against huge increases in e-com last year. because of the store closures, we got the benefit on e-com. some of it was due to the shift in buying. but -- so, you know, we expected somewhat of a little bit of a temporary slowdown, but i think both channels will continue to prove as -- improve as we get through the second quarter into back to school.
i'm pretty confident on that. and, you know, traffic -- generally, foot traffic in stores is still down. but we're seeing some really good number -- decent numbers there. they continue to improve.
and i think one of the things that surprised me the most is the new store openings, we didn't know what to expect because it's just not normal out there. and the new stores that we've opened have exceeded plan so far since they opened. so i'm really excited about that. so i think it's going to be a combination of a lot of factors.
and i -- does on our -- like mike mentioned, our full price selling has been really good. so we're not driving any of our business, whether it's e-com or stores through anything unusual promotionally. and we've seen quite a bit of the competition online, in particular, be a lot more promotional than we are -- we have ever been. but i think our full price selling will continue to be very strong.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley & co. -- analyst
well, you don't need to promote when you're merchandise content is as good as yours is, at least not maybe not as much as some others. so just as a follow-up to that, because you're seeing the new store openings exceed plan, is that shifting your thoughts about i guess your plans for a store opening as you think out maybe a year from now? i know you said you had, and i think what was a two stores to your plan for this year. is that changing your thinking at all?
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
it was -- there's definitely -- i'm more -- we are more optimistic about physical store openings going forward. and, you know, we've always had a pipeline, but we really didn't touch much of the pipeline of potential stores during the pandemic. and certainly, we're relooking at that now. we have a decent pipeline.
we want to take advantage of great spaces at incredibly low economics. and, you know, we're going to maintain our discipline a lot. we're still not going to open any stores unless the economics are right. but certainly, i think we're probably in a different mindset now in terms of opening stores than we were six months ago for sure.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley & co. -- analyst
ok, great. thanks for taking my questions and continued success.Â 
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, jeff.
operator
thank you. our final question comes from mitch kummetz with pivotal research. please proceed with your question.
mitch kummetz -- pivotal research group-- analyst
yes, thanks. congrats from me as well and thanks for taking my questions. i guess i just have a couple. mike, i was hoping you could give us for the quarter the two-year comp by month.Â 
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, corporate secretary
do i have that in the -- i don't have that real handy on a stack basis.
mitch kummetz -- pivotal research group-- analyst
do you know if april or march was the strongest month, or april, and obviously, we have the may number. i'm kind of curious how things sort of moved from march, april to may. do you happen to know kind of off the top of your head without having the numbers in front of you?
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, corporate secretary
i don't. i'd have to look at that. there's so many different versions of things we've been looking at, relative to 2020, relative to 2019 as a normal year. i'd have to look up the two-year's comp.
mitch kummetz -- pivotal research group-- analyst
that's fine. ed, could you maybe address how purchasing behavior is changing if at all as we're kind of starting to come out of covid just in terms of what your consumers are buying? is that -- is it going to change at all from, you know, three, six months ago, or is it kind of continuing along the same lines?
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
i think it's starting to get back to the way it was pre-pandemic. so, you know, i think that certainly there was pent-up demand. i think for the young adult and teenage customer, they're hungry for newness, and we've given them quite a bit of newness in both men's and women's. so i think that's helping.
so i don't see it materially changing much.
mitch kummetz -- pivotal research group-- analyst
ok. you mentioned denim in your prepared remarks. i always think of you guys as being, you know, a good denim resource. i'm just curious did you -- are you seeing outperformance in your denim business and you kind of -- can you kind of remind us how denim performed for you through the pandemic? i feel like there was kind of maybe a little bit of a shift away from denim to things like fleece or maybe more comfortable as a sort of lounging around the home, and i'm just kind of curious how those things are standing right now.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
denim is really strong and has been strong. it was ok during the pandemic, but it got stronger as time went on. and, you know, our primary brand, denim rsq, is one of our top two brands of the company. it's broader than -- broader merchandise mix than just denim, but it's very strong and it's good.
so -- and i expect that to continue through back to school.
mitch kummetz -- pivotal research group-- analyst
ok. all right. that's all i needed. thanks, good luck.Â 
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
right. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question is from alex vasti with william blair. please proceed with your question.
alex vasti -- william blair & company-- analyst
hey, guys. thanks. this is alex on for sharon right now. thanks for taking the questions.
and i just said a couple of quick ones. first, could you maybe talk about any of your early reads you have into the back-to-school season given many regions have announced like a full resumption of classes in the fall? anything deeper you have there?
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, corporate secretary
i think so far with the back-to-school data we've been able to confirm, it does look like we may have a fairly normal back-to-school season. that's what we're guessing and planning on at this stage. most stores, we haven't been able to get confirmed back-to-school dates yet, but the ones that we have received to this stage look like they're pretty darn normal in terms of their timing. so i think just given where things are across the country, i think it's probably more likely than not that we'll see something much closer to a typical back-to-school season.
that's my best guess right now.
alex vasti -- william blair & company-- analyst
ok. great. great. and then just kind of i guess following up on that one, given you said that -- maybe there's not much more you could say here, but given you said that the ones that you have been able to see confirmation, is there anything you have on more of a regional basis? i know you said that all the stores are comping positively in all regions over 2019.
but any -- anything specific to call out there?
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
no, not really. i mean, even within the same geographic region, the back-to-school dates are all over the place. so there's nothing that we can look at and say, ok, you know, forecast x based on what we're seeing, but what we are seeing enough -- in enough stores and enough geographic areas, it's relatively positive.
alex vasti -- william blair & company-- analyst
ok. great. that's all i have. thank you, guys.Â 
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
ok, thank you.
operator
thank you. our final question is a follow-up from matt koranda with roth capital. please proceed with your question.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hey, guys, thanks for letting me back in the queue here. for some reason, my call dropped. so just wanted to get a little more color on your thought process on the special dividend. so it seems clear that, you know, cash levels are super healthy here and we've got pretty decent visibility it seems like to maybe a more normalized back-to-school season.
are there any further impediments in your mind to the special dividend beyond just sort of the typical stuff around the revolver and the constraint you have there? and then i noticed i guess the last couple of special dividends that you paid, it looked like, you know, about a quarter of the cash balance was paid out in terms of the special dividend. is there --Â  is that a reasonable rule of thumb to use if we kind of think about if and when you decide to pay one? the -- would that be the way to think about it?
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, corporate secretary
so the last three special dividends we've done were each a dollar per share. and so the aggregate number of shares outstanding is a little over 30 million -- 30.1 million as we sit here today. so if we were to do one and it happened to be a similar rate, it would be somewhere about $30 million to $31 million if the board chose to keep it at the same level that it has been in the last few times. we are officially precluded from issuing any dividends until the one-year anniversary of our abl credit facility, which is november 9, for the time being.
you know, our board talks about these things literally every quarterly board meeting as we look at things. so they'll be discussing this again actually next week as our normal quarterly board meeting and it will be a topic of discussion. certainly, we feel very good about how the business is performing so far in 2021, and certainly, see the strength in our balance sheet. so, you know, there's nothing i can say beyond that at the moment other than i'm sure the topic will be revisited and we'd be able to share more once anything was decided.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. appreciate the color. i'll leave it there. thank you.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer

i will now turn the call over to ed. 
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, gar. good afternoon, everyone. thank you for joining us today. fiscal 2021 has been a record-setting year for us thus far.
our second-quarter results included a record level of net sales and earnings per share for any quarter since our 2012 ipo. on a year-to-date basis, the first half of fiscal 2021 produced earnings per share that exceed the results of any fiscal year since becoming a public company. we believe these results were driven by considerable pent-up consumer demand compared to last year, aided by government stimulus payments, compelling merchandising offerings, and excellent execution by our store and corporate teams. compared to fiscal 2019 second quarter, our total net sales increased by 24.9%, which was driven by a total comparable net sales increase of 18.3% and operating 15 net additional stores.
store comps are positive in all markets and were strongest in our two most recent primary expansion areas, new england and texas, each of which posted comp sales increases over 20% compared to 2019. in terms of merchandising, men's and women's apparel were very strong, led by our proprietary brands, rsq and full tilt, which were our number one and number two overall brands in both the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2021, as well as strong performance from our curated assortment of iconic, global and specialty brands. apparel growth has been driven by new trends in bottoms, a surge in the graphic t-shirt business, and a high adoption rate on newness generally. comparable net sales of accessories and girls increased by a single-digit percentage relative to 2019, while boys and footwear decreased by a single-digit percentage relative to 2019.
hard goods, which we did not have as a material part of our assortment in 2019, produced $2.1 million in total net sales during the second quarter, and portions of this assortment are now in nearly two-third of our stores. we anticipate that all stores will have at least a portion of our hard goods assortment by the coming holiday season. we expanded our sustainable merchandise program during the second quarter, ending the quarter with over 1,000 items from over 40 brands in our sustainability shop on our website that contains features, such as the use of certified recycled materials, certified organic cotton, or reusable accessories. during the third quarter, we have launched over 40 styles under our rsq brand that features similar sustainability attributes.
we also just launched a collection of vintage and upcycle products with over 200 unique pieces, along with selected products in 25 of our stores. these collections currently represent roughly 4% of our total inventory. outside of merchandise, we are continuing to reinvest in our business. we have opened eight of our planned nine new stores for fiscal 2021 and continue to seek attractive opportunities for additional stores in 2022.
we've also launched several initiatives this year designed to improve convenience and efficiency for our customers. these customer experience initiatives include an upgrade to our website platform from our current version of salesforce to their latest more mobile response of sfra version, upgrading our mobile app from a simple ramp of our website to a version that offers greater mobile functionality, including loyalty and in-store experience features and continuing to improve our omni channel capabilities, including in-store pickup, curbside pickup, same-day delivery and ship from store. we are also reinvesting in distribution efficiencies to expand capacity for anticipated future growth. we do not currently expect our total capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 to exceed $20 million.
due to our strong cash position resulting from the strength of our business performance and our disciplined inventory and expense management through the pandemic, our board of directors approved a special cash dividend to stockholders of $1 per share during the second quarter, which was paid on july 9. this represents the fifth consecutive year where we have provided a direct return to our stockholders in the form of a special cash dividend. turning to the third quarter of fiscal 2021, the back-to-school season is off to a strong start. total net sales for fiscal august were up 94.4% compared to last year, partially due to operating 39 additional stores than at this time last year.
thirty-three of our california indoor mall stores were closed throughout august of last year, and we opened six net new stores in the past year. compared to 2019, total comparable net sales for fiscal august increased 20.4%. despite ongoing concerns about the current resurgence of covid-19 cases across the country, retail supply chain disruptions, labor challenges, and increasing costs generally, we remain cautiously optimistic about our business prospects for the second half of 2021. i will now turn the call over to mike to provide additional details on our second-quarter operating performance and to introduce our third-quarter outlook.
mike?
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
thanks, ed. good afternoon, everyone. details of our second-quarter operating performance compared to last year's second quarter were as follows. total net sales were a record $202 million, an increase of $66.1 million or 48.7% compared to $135.8 million last year, partially due to the impact of the various periods of government-mandated store closures we experienced during last year's second quarter, which resulted in only 65% of total store operating days being available to us during that period, but also due to strong consumer response to our merchandise offerings this year.
total net sales from physical stores were $164.6 million, an increase of $80.8 million or 96.3% compared to $83.9 million last year. net sales from physical stores represented 81.5% of our total net sales for the second quarter compared to 61.7% of total net sales last year. e-commerce net sales were $37.3 million, a decrease of $14.7 million or 28.2% compared to $52 million last year, which we believe was primarily due to going up against our peak triple-digit e-comm comps in may and june of last year when consumer spending shifted online during the period of significant store closures. e-comm net sales represented 18.5% of total net sales compared to 38.3% of total net sales last year.
e-comm comps had been negative since the second week of april but turned positive for the final week of the second quarter and have remained double-digit positive since then. we ended the second quarter with 244 total stores compared to 238 total stores, of which 205 were open at the end of the second quarter last year. during the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we opened six new stores in may. total comparable net sales compared to fiscal 2019 second quarter increased 18.3%, with increases from physical stores of 11%, with positive comp sales growth across all markets and from e-commerce of 63.4%.
in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, net sales from physical stores represented 85.9% of our total net sales, while net sales from e-commerce represented 14.1% of our total net sales. gross profit, including buying, distribution and occupancy expenses, improved to $74.7 million or 37% of net sales compared to $41.7 million or 30.7% of net sales last year. buying, distribution, and occupancy costs improved by 800 basis points collectively despite increasing by $1.7 million in total due to leveraging these costs against higher net sales. product margins decreased by 170 basis points due to going up against last year's strong full-price selling upon the initial reopening of stores relative to certain valuation reserves taken on idle store inventory at the end of the first quarter last year when all stores were closed.
compared to fiscal 2019 second quarter, product margins improved by 190 basis points, primarily due to reduced markdowns. total sg&a expenses were $48.3 million or 23.9% of net sales compared to $34.0 million or 25% of net sales last year. sg&a improved by 110 basis points as a percentage of net sales despite increasing by $14.3 million due to leveraging these costs over higher net sales. primary causes of the sg&a dollar increase were higher store payroll and related benefit costs of $10.2 million, primarily due to operating all stores for the entirety of the quarter and serving significantly higher net sales compared to last year, and corporate bonus accruals of $2.7 million due to our strong operating performance thus far in fiscal 2021.
operating income improved to $26.4 million or 13.1% of net sales compared to $7.7 million or 5.7% of net sales last year, primarily due to the significant increase in net sales. income tax expense was $5.9 million or 22.5% of pre-tax income compared to $2.8 million or 34.3% of pre-tax income last year. the reduction in income tax rate compared to last year was primarily due to deferred income tax benefits of $0.9 million derived from employee stock option exercise activity this year and the prior-year impact of the cares act which allowed for operating losses in fiscal 2020 to be carried back to earlier tax years with higher income tax rates. net income improved to $20.4 million or $0.66 per diluted share, which are records for us as a public company, compared to $5.3 million or $0.18 per diluted share last year.
weighted average shares were 31.1 million this year compared to 29.7 million last year. turning to our balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with total cash and marketable securities of $148.5 million and no debt outstanding compared to $148.9 million last year which included an aggregate of $37.6 million of borrowed cash and withheld store lease payments. we ended the second quarter with inventories per square foot up 25.6% over last year's second quarter and up 14.3% over the 2019 second quarter, as we support the current momentum of our business. total capital expenditures for the first half of fiscal 2021 were $8.5 million compared to $4.3 million last year, the increase being primarily due to new store openings this year.
turning to the third quarter of fiscal 2021, total comparable net sales for fiscal august, ended august 28, increased by 20.4% compared to 2019's comparable period with increases from physical stores of 11.6% and from e-commerce of 81%. based on current and historical trends and assuming all stores and e-comm remain in operation throughout the third quarter, we would expect our third-quarter net sales to be in the range of approximately $187 million to $193 million and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $0.30 to $0.34. this outlook range assumes an estimated income tax rate of 27% and weighted average diluted shares of approximately 31.2 million. we expect to have 243 total stores opened at the end of the third quarter compared to 238 at the end of last year's third quarter and 232 at the end of fiscal 2019's third quarter.
operator, we'll now go to our q&a session.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of jeff van sinderen with b. riley. please proceed with your question.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley & co. -- analyst
hi, everyone. and let me say congratulations on terrific results. i guess my first question, if you can just touch on supply chain because obviously, it's been a topic, i think, of concern for a number of companies. you guys don't at least -- you're not seeing it in the numbers.
so i guess, are you seeing any bottlenecks? i'm sure there's some. but maybe if you could touch on kind of particular categories, how supply chain for private label looks for you for rsq, and then maybe if you could touch on how you're planning receipts for the second half. if you're pulling forward, how much you're pulling forward, or any sense of that?
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
sure, jeff. i'll start and ed can add in if he has anything to augment in what i have to say. so we've been dealing with the supply chain issue all year long, even going back to last holiday to some extent. and as you noted, it hasn't hurt our overall results all that much.
there have been particular instances where we might run really low or sell out of an individual style of an individual item here and there. but it hasn't been so prominent so as to really hinder the performance of the business. we are trying to do everything we can to secure inventory for the holiday season as best we can. so we are pulling forward to some extent.
but it shouldn't be anything that creates any kind of unusual distortion relative to the level of business that we expect to do. again, we've been dealing with this all year long and have been adapting to it on a week-by-week and sometimes on a daily basis. our merchant team has worked very hard with all of our key brands, whether third party or proprietary to make sure we're just in constant communication with them to understand what to expect. we really had a constant level of inventory that's been delayed anywhere from two to six weeks, again, all year long, and we've been having to make adjustments for that as we've gone.
we expect to continue to do that, to continue to adapt through the holiday season. but seeing how back-to-school has behaved, very similar situation, back-to-school is a key season for us. there have been instances of particular items, whether it's a backpack or some footwear, things like that, that we might not be able to get quite as much replenished as fast as we'd like. but again, the results speak for themselves.
so it's not so much that we think it's going to cause a major issue for us.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley & co. -- analyst
ok, great. and let me just ask you kind of as a follow-up to that. qualitatively, do you feel like the inventory -- or not inventory but the kind of the supply chain timing or receipt delays are getting better or getting worse or about static at that two to six weeks?
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
what's really interesting is right now, it has gotten better for a little bit here very recently. but we are anticipating that it's probably going to go back the other way as we go over the next several weeks into november. but again, not to such a huge extent that we think it's going to affect the overall season. it just may temporarily impact our ability to replenish some of our best-selling items.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
it's hard to get an accurate read, jeff, honestly, in terms of -- but i think the way mike explained to us, very accurate.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley & co. -- analyst
ok, great. appreciate that. and then, if i could just ask you guys to touch on the gross margin thoughts. i mean, your gross margins were phenomenal in q2.
i guess, how we should think about gross margins going forward, or how we should think about the operating expense line as far as q3.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
yes. in q3, we're not expecting the overall gross margin rate to be quite as high as it was in q2. i think the sg&a range that we're looking at is probably $49 million to $51 million, just to give it a nice tight area there for you. still comparing back to 2019, we think our product margins will be no worse than consistent with 2019 and perhaps a little bit better, maybe not to the extent that we just saw in q2.
we still will have some leverage on occupancy and distribution, maybe not quite as much, just given it's looking to be a little bit lower sales volume quarter based on everything we know right now than what q2 ended up being. so hope that can help you triangulate your model a little bit better.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley & co. -- analyst
it does. ok, thanks so much for taking my questions. i'll jump back in the queue.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
all right. thanks, jeff.

our next question comes from the line of sharon zackfia with william blair. please proceed with your question.
sharon zackfia -- william blair & company -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. a couple of questions. i guess, given the success that you're seeing with some of your proprietary brands like rsq and full tilt, where are those proprietary brands now as a percent of your mix?
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
it's gotten just over 30% now currently, looking at q2 and what we've seen in august so far. so it's inched up a few percentage points from where it's been in recent years and that's just the customer voting. it hasn't been anything overly intentional trying to drive proprietary up to a targeted percentage that customer has just been voting.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
we really don't have any plans strategically to increase the total percentage of private versus external brands.
sharon zackfia -- william blair & company -- analyst
ok. and then on the sustainability shop, are you seeing any kind of increased price elasticity of demand there where your consumer is willing to pay up for that product? so i'm wondering if there's any margin implication. and on the vintage and upcycled product, how are you sourcing that? and i've seen some of it online and you're doing some interesting things with it. i mean, how big could that ultimately be?
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think on the sustainability product, i think it's too early in the game to get a really accurate read of how good or how big it can be. but i can't say we've seen any major price resistance to that. but educating the customer is a challenge for sure in terms of that product category. vintage, we just launched this week and the initial read is excellent.
it's really good. we are sourcing that locally in southern california. and i think it has the potential to become a pretty good part of our business going forward. so just out of the box, the demand looks really good.
sharon zackfia -- william blair & company -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of mitch kummetz with pivotal research. please proceed with your question.
mitch kummetz -- pivotal research -- analyst
yes, thanks for taking my questions. let me add my congratulations on the quarter. inventory, i know that the number you're reporting in the balance sheet is just a snapshot in time, but you're up 14% per square foot from two years ago. i don't have any other companies i cover that have that kind of an inventory increase.
so i'm just curious, like how well-situated are you with that number? is that number -- or should i say, how meaningful is that number in terms of how you feel like you're able to service the demand that you're seeing for back-to-school and further into the quarter?
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
well, we've run with decreased inventory per square foot for a couple of years now consistently. and i think the inventory level, as we reported it, is adequate enough for it to meet the demand than what we're seeing in terms of trends.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
yes. it's still below the sales run rate.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
right.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
we've always managed our inventory level beneath the sales comp run rate, and that remains the case even at this level of increase.
mitch kummetz -- pivotal research -- analyst
ok. and then mike, on product margin, i think jeff asked a question about margins. and you mentioned that you don't expect product margin to be as strong on a two-year basis as you just experienced in q2. and i'm curious why you're seeing that.
is that because of the higher freight cost? or are you not expecting channel inventory to be as lean in the promotional environment not to be as good? what is sort of factored into those thoughts?
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
yes, it's acknowledging that there probably will be some actions that we'll need to take at some point on certain things if the rate of sales begins to slow down. we're thinking about the fact that relative to 2019, q1 comps were up 22, q2 was up 18. we've had a nice start to august during the peak of the back-to-school period, but we are anticipating that that rate of growth probably will slow down to some extent. product margins are still going to be as good or better than 2019.
so that shouldn't get misconstrued as though it's a negative. we think the product margins are still going to be better than 2019. they just might not be 190 basis points better as q2 was.
mitch kummetz -- pivotal research -- analyst
ok. and then, ed, i think you said that rsq is your number one brand in the quarter. i tend to think of that as a denim brand, i know that that's not a fair characterization. but i'm just curious how good denim was in the quarter and how much of an opportunity that might be into the back half.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
denim, it is primarily a denim brand, not exclusively and it has done exceptionally well. and i'm expecting denim sales to continue strong through the balance of the year. so it should be good.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
yes. traditionally, rsq was more kind of solely a denim brand but we really have fairly recently expanded into other product categories, some fashion tops and tees, and fleece. and so it does have an expanded offering compared to what you might remember from two, three, four years ago and longer.
mitch kummetz -- pivotal research -- analyst
ok. and then just lastly, as you think about the balance of the year, particularly going to the holiday season, i know that you're going to be better positioned in hard goods than you were a year ago. but beyond that, i'm just kind of curious what are some of the things that you might be most bullish on as you're heading into this holiday season?
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
well, there's nothing that sticks out. obviously, we're concerned with making sure that we don't run into more headwinds like with the delta variant. and so far, it hasn't been any big impact on our business. but certainly, we are sensitive to the fact that it could occur and it might tighten up things a little.
but the consumer seems to be hungry for newness which i'm very positive about. we have a lot of newness coming into the balance of the year. so that's pretty exciting for our potential. and i think the headwinds will be what we've talked about, the port delays to a certain extent and maybe some tail off in customer demand.
however, lastly, our conversion rate is up really high. it's really improved quite a bit so far this year. and i think what we're finding is, even though traffic is down and is off of prior years, the customer that's shopping is buying. so that's a good thing.
mitch kummetz -- pivotal research -- analyst
got it. all right, thanks, guys.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, mitch.

our next question comes from the line of matt koranda with roth capital partners. please proceed with your question.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hey guys, thanks. and congrats on a great quarter. i just wanted to talk about the trends quarter to date. i think you said, up about 20% on a two-year stack in august, i think the midpoint of your guidance.
so something similar, maybe a slight acceleration from there. just wanted to see if you could kind of comment on your views on the rest of the quarter. and sort of how that transpires? are there some calendar shifts we should be taking into account in the top-line guidance?
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
no, i think we're acknowledging the 20% start we've had for august. it's the largest month of the quarter, usually represents a little over half of the quarter, historically looking at the last several pre-pandemic years, last year being an anomaly of course. as i just mentioned in response to one of mitch's questions, we're also cognizant that now that we're going to be entering the post-peak of the back-to-school season, the rate of growth could moderate to some extent. and looking at the trend line of, again, q1 comps to 2019, we're up 22%.
q2 was at 2018. we had a nice 20% start in august. but as you think about the lower end of the guidance, that's us thinking about, well, if that trend line does cause some moderation in the start that we've had, we're giving a little bit of room for that. but really pleased with how things have started off, certainly has been a much more normal back-to-school season this year than what we experienced last year.
consumer response to what we've been doing has been great. so we're hoping this can carry right on in through the rest of the back half of the year.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. that's helpful, mike. thank you. and then just one more on the gross margins, maybe attacking it from a different angle here.
so i guess the commentary you've made implies a pretty decent sequential dip in gross margins if i'm to get to your eps guidance and using some of the opex commentaries that you gave there, mike. so maybe could you put a finer point on what's hitting gross margins on a sequential basis? because it looks like the promotional environment probably hasn't eroded a whole lot. inventory position looks pretty good so product margins probably don't erode a whole lot. occupancy costs look pretty good here.
is there some more significant erosion in distribution or buying costs or any other elements that we should be taking into account there?
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
no, there's no big issue here. all we're saying is that we don't think product margins are going to be up as much as 190 basis points. we think they're going to be up relative to two years ago. they might be slightly down relative to last year because as stores reopen, the level of full-price selling was extraordinary last year.
it was unusually high. so there's not a problem here as it relates to product margins. if they're down to last year, it's going to be very modest down. it's not like we're expecting triple-digit basis points or anything like that.
it'd be relatively modest and it's likely to be up relative to 2019. so i don't think people should be reading too much into the commentary. it's just that it might not be up 190 basis points. it could be up something less than that but still going to be up relative to two years ago.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok, fair enough. i'll leave it there. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of janet kloppenburg with jjk research associates. please proceed with your question.
janet kloppenburg -- jjk research associates, inc. -- analyst
hi, everybody.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
hi, janet.
janet kloppenburg -- jjk research associates, inc. -- analyst
ed, i got on a little late. did you see a slowdown in july in your school outlook vis-a-vis your back-to-school outlook and then a nice pickup in august? and what are you seeing regionally in august? because others are complaining about late back-to-schools and that impacted some of the late july, early august trends. so i'm just wondering what you guys saw.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
august was stronger than july, janet. so we're consistent with what you're hearing there. and generally, i'd say it was kind of interesting in that it did seem like it took a little longer for our back-to-school waves to kick in. but once they did, they were really good.
so it --
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
and they've stayed good.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
yes. and they've stayed good post their peak. so that's the dynamic we're seeing.
janet kloppenburg -- jjk research associates, inc. -- analyst
do you think it will be in a long-dated season? in other words, you might get some strength in week two september, week three september. i mean, i know you have strength but something above and beyond what historically you would have expected.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
it's possible, especially in thinking about the fact that it seemed like entering into what we thought was going to be the starting point of the waves, it did seem to be a little slower than anticipated that maybe there is something to that. truth will be told as we get through this period but i think that's a possibility.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and some of the early, really early back-to-school stuff have been strong, have continued strong.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
yes.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
post them going back to school. so i'm hoping that it translates into the rest of the balance of jan.
janet kloppenburg -- jjk research associates, inc. -- analyst
right. and other retails that i've talked to -- well, first, just a question on back-to-school. the northeast is the latest market to go back to school, what are you seeing vis-a-vis the company average on comp productivity?
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
well, we don't have that many stores in the northeast but those that are --
janet kloppenburg -- jjk research associates, inc. -- analyst
i knew you're going to say that. i knew you're going to say that. i almost had a point with that. go ahead, yes.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
so next time answer the question before you ask it.
janet kloppenburg -- jjk research associates, inc. -- analyst
can you just help me with that, please?
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we really don't. but the reads we're getting from the few stores that we have are good.
janet kloppenburg -- jjk research associates, inc. -- analyst
ok. that's good. all right. then moving on, how should we think about e-comm sales vis-a-vis last year, given the trends? what does that mean for margins? and the second question is some of the companies that i talked to that have third-party vendors like you do are feeling that their aucs are going up because that incremental freight, the brands are building in that incremental freight into their costs.
can you just address that for me, please?
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
address the e-comm and i'll talk about the brand.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
yes, as it relates to e-comm, we've seen actually a resurgence to stores relative to e-comm here for the last few months. e-comm is sitting right around 18% of the total business. we're really rather agnostic these days about whether it's a store sale or e-comm sale. our e-comm business has gotten so much more profitable going through the covid period and then the things that we learned through that and have carried with us going forward.
e-comm's much more profitable than it ever was. and it's pretty in line with what the average four-wall of stores is, maybe just slightly below, but nothing meaningful. so with all the things that we've done, whether it's ship from store, curbside pickup, same day, all these things that we've invested in to just be as convenient as possible for our customers, we really truly are rather agnostic about which channel they choose to buy from us in. and then you asked about the cost.
janet kloppenburg -- jjk research associates, inc. -- analyst
yes. we are hearing that, yes.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
we are seeing from and hearing from some of our brands about expected cost increases, really more talking about 2022 at this point than in the immediate term. but we are starting to hear those kinds of things as well.
janet kloppenburg -- jjk research associates, inc. -- analyst
and will you be able to absorb that with some select price increases?
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
yes. yes. i mean we'll have to do some select price increases. but we can definitely absorb it, yes.
janet kloppenburg -- jjk research associates, inc. -- analyst
and do you guys have any outlook as to when these freight pressures and logistics supply chain issues may start to wane? do you have any visibility there?
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
no.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
no, not at all. and as you know, we were dealing with a lot of different brands and big brands and smaller brands. they're kind of a little lost in terms of -- they're not seeing a lot of -- they're not getting a lot of visibility to it either. so it's something that we're on every day and we don't really see anything yet.
janet kloppenburg -- jjk research associates, inc. -- analyst
and then, lastly, on store productivity, it's something you and i talked about. can it get back to pre-pandemic levels? what are you thinking?
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i think it can. i definitely think it can. i mean we have to see more consistency in traffic. it's not going to happen with continued declines in traffic throughout the industry.
but that's like i said earlier, conversion is good. so where the traffic is -- the traffic we're getting is a quality shopper, they're actually buying. so that's encouraging. and i think that over time we'll see traffic increase.
does it get back to what it used to be, i don't think so.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
yes, for q2, just to give you a sense, our traffic was down high single digits relative to 2019, but the conversion rate was significantly better and the average sale was significantly better. through the august period, the peak of back-to-school, traffic was actually slightly positive for the first time in a really long time. so that was a good thing to see. we hope that's something that will continue.
i don't know if it will or not but it was at least nice to see in the august period that traffic was slightly positive for us relative to 2019.
janet kloppenburg -- jjk research associates, inc. -- analyst
that's very encouraging and something i haven't heard. so congratulations.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

i now turn the call over to ed. 
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, gar. good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. fiscal 2021 continues to be a record-setting year for us with record net sales and earnings per share for each quarter thus far. we have already surpassed our total net sales for all of last year, and our year-to-date third quarter earnings per share have set a record relative to any full fiscal year.
our third-quarter net sales grew by 47% over last year, with us being fully operational this year in a more normalized back-to-school season. and our comparable net sales grew by 27% over fiscal 2019's pre-pandemic third quarter. our strong operating results over the past year improved our third quarter ending cash and investments position by $30 million, compared to last year, which led our board of directors to approve a special cash dividend -- a second special cash dividend of $1 per share to shareholders of record as of december 7, 2021, with payments scheduled for december 15, 2021. our first special cash dividend of the year, also $1 per share, was paid on july 9.
the back-to-school season in the third quarter were as strong as ever, driven by a compelling overall merchandise offering in a much-improved consumer spending environment. relative to the pre-pandemic third quarter of fiscal 2019, comparable sales of women's, men's, girls', and accessories increased by double-digit percentages, while footwear and boys' increased by high single-digit percentages. hard goods, which we did not have as a material part of our assortment in 2019, produced $1.6 million in total net sales. during the third quarter, we now have portions of this assortment in roughly 200 of our stores.
we expanded our sustainability shop on our website during the third quarter with the introduction of over 40 styles of proprietary rsq-branded merchandise with sustainable features to supplement our extensive selection of such products from over 40 of our third-party brands. we also launched a collection of over 200 vintage and up-cycle product choices that have been well received by our customers. in terms of stores, we opened our ninth and final new store for fiscal 2021 in early november, and we will close one store in late december. we are actively negotiating new store opportunities for fiscal 2022 and tentatively plan to open 15 to 20 new stores next year, assuming we can negotiate what we believe to be appropriate lease economics.
these stores will primarily be located within existing markets, primarily california, texas, and the northeast. we also have approximately 75 existing lease-up decisions to be make -- to make during fiscal 2022 that are coming up on expiration or have lease kick-out options. we intend to use this opportunity to continue to improve upon our existing occupancy cost structure with these pending lease decisions where possible. during our last earnings call, we mentioned several customer-facing investments that were underway.
in november, we upgraded our mobile app to offer greater mobile functionality, including loyalty and in-store experience features that we did not have previously. we expect to continue to invest in improving and enhancing our mobile app experiences throughout 2022. we also expect to complete an upgrade of our website platform to a more mobile, responsive version in early 2022.we will also continue to improve our omnichannel capabilities and reinvest in distribution efficiencies to expand capacity for anticipated future growth. we currently estimate that our total capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million, inclusive of these initiatives, construction of new stores, and continuing it infrastructure investments.
turning to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. we are very encouraged by our strong start to the holiday season, especially considering that last year was our most profitable fourth quarter since 2012. while we continue to contend with delivery delays throughout southern california ports, the aggregate retail value of delayed products currently represents less than 10% of our total inventory already on hand. our merchants made every effort to position us well for the holiday season and we believe we have plenty of inventory to produce a successful holiday season.
these delivery delays may cause the supply of particular items to run low from time to time. but we have been contending with these delays all year long, not just in the holiday season, and they have not stopped us from producing record results each quarter. despite ongoing concerns about the covid-19 pandemic, supply chain difficulties, labor challenges, and increasing costs, generally, we remain optimistic about our business prospects for the remainder of fiscal 2021 and into fiscal 2022 at this time. i will now turn the call over to mike, to provide additional details on our third-quarter operating performance, and to introduce our fourth-quarter outlook.
mike?
mike henry -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, ed. good afternoon, everyone. the third quarter produced record quarterly net sales for us and tied our best quarterly earnings per share, which was just set a quarter ago. details of our third-quarter operating performance compared to last year's third quarter by line item were as follows.
total net sales of $206.1 million increased by $65.8 million, or 46.9%, compared to $140.3 million last year. total net sales from physical stores were $165.3 million, an increase of $60.7 million, or 58.1%, compared to $104.6 million last year, with a much more normalized back-to-school season this year, that was free of pandemic-forced store closures. net sales from physical stores represented 80.2% of our total net sales, compared to 74.5% of total net sales last year. e-commerce net sales were $40.8 million, an increase of $5.1 million, or 14.3%, compared to $35.7 million last year.
e-comm net sales represented 19.8% of total net sales, compared to 25.5% of total net sales last year. we ended the third quarter with 243 total stores, a net increase of five stores compared to the end of the third quarter last year. total comparable net sales relative to fiscal 2019's pre-pandemic third quarter increased 27.4% with increases from physical stores of 18.3% with positive comp sales growth across all markets and from e-commerce of 80.5%. in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, physical stores represented 85.3% of our total net sales, while e-commerce represented 14.7% of our total net sales.gross profit, including buying, distribution, and occupancy expenses, improved to $76.7 million, or 37.2% of net sales, which is a record for us in our history as a public company, compared to $40.7 million, or 29% of net sales last year.
buying, distribution, and occupancy costs improved by 690 basis points collectively, despite increasing by $2.7 million in total due to leveraging these costs against higher net sales. occupancy costs improved by 540 basis points, despite increasing by $0.5 million with five net new stores. distribution costs improved by 110 basis points,despite increasing by $2.1 million.buying costs improved by 40 basis points despite increasing by $0.1 million. product margins were very strong, improving by 130 basis points versus last year, and by 200 basis points compared to 2019 third quarter, primarily due to lower markdowns.
total sg&a expenses were $47.7 million, or 23.2% of net sales, compared to $37.1 million, or 26.5% of net sales last year. sg&a improved by 330 basis points as the percentage of net sales despite increasing by $10.6 million due to leveraging these costs against higher net sales. primary causes of the sg&a dollar increase were higher store payroll and related benefit costs of $7.6 million, primarily due to operating all stores for the entirety of the quarter and serving significantly higher net sales, corporate bonus accruals of $1.8 million due to our strong operating performance this far in fiscal 2021, and increased marketing expenses of $1.2 million. operating income improved to $29 million, or 14.1% of net sales, compared to $3.5 million, or 2.5% of net sales last year, primarily due to the significant increase in net sales.
income tax expense was $8.2 million, or 28.1% of pre-tax income, compared to $1.4 million, or 39.8% of pre-tax income last year. the reduction in income tax rate compared to last year was primarily due to the prior impact of the cares act, which allowed for operating losses in fiscal 2020 to be carried back to earlier tax years with higher income tax rates. net income improved to $20.8 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, which are third quarter records for us, compared to $2.1 million, or $0.07 per diluted share last year. weighted average shares were $31.4 million this year, compared to $29.8 million last year.
turning to our balance sheet. we ended the third quarter with total cash and marketable securities of $155.6 million in no debt outstanding, compared to $125.3 million in no debt last year, which included $12.4 million of withheld store lease payments. we ended the third quarter with inventories per square foot up 29% over last year to support the current momentum of our business and position ourselves for the holiday season amid the ongoing supply chain challenges. we believe our overall inventory levels are currently in a good place relative to business performance, and an expectation that delivery delays will continue.
total year-to-date capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 were $10.9 million, compared to $6.4 million last year. the increase being primarily due to new store openings this year. turning to the fourth quarter. we are off to a strong start compared to last year's period, which was the first full period since the pandemic began, in which we were fully operational, and which was also our most profitable fourth quarter since 2012.
total comparable net sales through november 30 increased by 19.6% compared to last year, with comp sales increases from physical stores of 27.6% and from e-commerce of 3.9%. based on current and historical trends, and assuming all stores and e-comm remain in operation and that supply chain challenges do not have a material negative impact on our net sales results through the fourth quarter, we would expect our fourth-quarter net sales to be in the range of approximately $210 million to $215 million, and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $0.42 to $0.50. although last year's fourth-quarter product margins were 210 basis points better than 2019's fourth quarter, we currently expect our product margins to improve by another 50 to 100 basis points over last year based on an assumption of a lower overall promotional environment amid the broad-based supply chain difficulties this year. we project sg&a to be approximately 26% of net sales, our estimated income tax rate to be 27%, and weighted average diluted shares to be approximately $31.6 million.
we currently expect to have 243 total stores at the end of fiscal 2021, compared to 238 at the end of fiscal 2020. this compares to $178 million in total net sales and $0.29 in earnings per diluted share for last year's fourth quarter. operator, we'll now go to our q&a session.

thank you. ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operators instructions] our first question is from jeff van sinderen with b. riley.
please proceed.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley financial -- analyst
hi, everyone. and let me say congratulations on the strong metrics, it's great to see. maybe you can give us a little bit more color on the digital versus in-store sales that you saw over thanksgiving week. maybe if you could touch on black friday and cyber monday, just kind of curious -- any thoughts around that? maybe how it differed versus the same period in 2020 and 2019? and then also kind of as a follow-up today, i know you're continuing to grow e-comm, which is terrific.
i'm just wondering if you think that that is going to stay close to 20%, or how we should think about that as a kind of concentration of the business as you open more stores and so forth?
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
hey, jeff. how are you?
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley financial -- analyst
all right.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
ok. so, i guess i'll start. over thanksgiving weekend, our store sales were like really strong, so the traffic was good, sales were strong, stronger than e-comm business. but e-comm business remains steady, and mike can add on to whatever i say.
but as far as e-comm, i think it's going to continue to grow, there's no question about it. we are still in the very early stages of e-comm, and a lot of the changes we put in place in the last couple of years have helped grow it. we definitely get the benefit of the stores being closed for a while, but still, we're seeing decent growth out of there and we expect that to continue. my guess is it will be north of 20% of our business going forward.
mike henry -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i would agree with that. you know, jeff, we have to remember as we look at third quarter, we were still dealing with pandemic store closures during that period last year. so, there was a heavier shift toward e-comm last year, and the reverse has happened this year and has been that way really all year long. our stores have just resurged so significantly.
it's been amazing to see. and the same was true through black friday weekend or for the month of november as a whole, stores were strong, double-digits up. e-comm was up single-digits relative to just last year. relative to two years ago, e-comm was nice and strong, and robust still.
so, i think in a more normalized environment, i'd have to agree with ed that, you know, as things settle down and we get back to something that's normal, and i would say nothing is still normal as we exist today, it's hard to predict anything with certainty. but i think it probably will be in the mid 20%, somewhere around 25% makes sense to me. i think the pendulum has swung heavy to stores right now because of just what's going on in the environment. so, it will probably swing back the other way a few points, i would think, as we settle in coming out of this pandemic.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley financial -- analyst
ok, good. and then just as a follow-up, since we are talking about e-comm, i know you mentioned the new mobile app, and it sounds like you still have some more it investments you're planning for 2022. so, i guess maybe if you can frame for us a little bit the benefits that you're starting to see from the mobile app and, you know, kind of where we are, what inning we're in, i guess, around that. it sounds like there's still quite a bit more to come.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we're definitely in early -- we just reintroduce the mobile app last week. so, it's -- we don't have enough experience with it. but we made it more user-friendly, the navigation is better, we integrated loyalty into it, and we'll continue -- we have a number of enhancements that we think we -- that we're going to make in 2022 to the mobile app.but our old mobile app was pretty antiquated.
we hadn't upgraded that in a while, so that -- the first step was to get it upgraded and more responsive. then the other thing that we're investing in that we mentioned was we're upgrading our existing e-comm platform, which is what the best way to describe it is more mobile-friendly. so, that will take place in the first half of next year.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley financial -- analyst
ok, great. so, more positive to look forward to there. thanks for taking my questions and continued success.
mike henry -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, jeff.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer

[operator instructions] our next question is from marni shapiro with retail tracker. please proceed.
marni shapiro -- the retail tracker -- analyst
hey, guys, congratulations. the stores have been just amazing. it's a pleasure to be shopping in them lately.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, marni.
mike henry -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks.
marni shapiro -- the retail tracker -- analyst
so, i'm curious if we could just parse out a little bit on some of the delivery delays. i'm curious if -- i'm looking at your stores and the assortments, are there parts of the assortment that are getting a little bit harder hit? in particular, i'm noticing you guys are turning anything what i would call sexy-pretty very fast, and i wasn't sure if what i was seeing was you were turning it really fast or the inventory was delayed, so it wasn't set quite as high as you want. so, i'm just curious if you could talk a little bit about, you know, across the store where you're seeing that kind of impact the hardest, or no impact and it's just selling out?
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
well, the women's inventory, in general, is too light right now. part of it is because of turning fast and part of it is supply chain issues. but we have enough inventory to continue the momentum through impasse christmas. and i would say that the point delays or more impact -- have a more impact on some of the shoes.
in particular, our shoe business would be -- it's good, but it'd be a lot better if we weren't delayed with some of the big brands.
marni shapiro -- the retail tracker -- analyst
yeah.
mike henry -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i'd say that's exactly right. footwear is the hardest hit from these delivery delays. i mean, honestly, if we could get more nike and converse, we'd take every bit of it we could get, we just can't get it. and they've talked about the challenges they are facing.
marni shapiro -- the retail tracker -- analyst
yeah.
mike henry -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we are turning faster at healthier product margins. you know, i noted in our prepared remarks that we ended the third quarter up 29% on a per square foot basis in inventory. you know, our teams did such a great job of trying to pull as much forward as they could and make sure that we were prepared to go through black friday weekend and the holiday season as best we could. as we sit here today, that inventory is now in the teens.so, you know, we're running at about plus 20 and the inventories is up in the teens.
so, overall, we have plenty enough apparel to have a good holiday season we think. footwear is the most challenging area that -- i agree with ed, if we had enough of the right things, our footwear business would be even stronger than it is. it was up plus nine. it would be even stronger.
marni shapiro -- the retail tracker -- analyst
well, that's impressive. and then just -- i guess following on the footwear where was like jewelry -- you have a really nice jewelry assortment, hair, things like that. at times, i was in there and it was beautifully stocked. at times, i was in there and i was like, ""oh, i wish they had more."" was that hurt, too, or was that just -- it was selling so fast?
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
i think it was more fast, the pace of selling than anything else.
marni shapiro -- the retail tracker -- analyst
i love that answer.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
i wouldn't call that out as a major supply chain issue. so, it had some impact in -- across a few of the brands, but overall, no.
marni shapiro -- the retail tracker -- analyst
oh, that's fantastic. well, best of luck with the rest of the holiday season.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question is from matt koranda with roth capital. please proceed.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hey, guys, thank you, and great quarter,by the way. so, on the outlook for q4, i guess embedded in the guidance, if i'm doing the math right here, is that it looks like potentially gross margins do erode a bit quarter over quarter in the fourth quarter. and i just wanted to clarify, is that the case or is that the base case assumption, and where are the headwinds coming from specifically? because it doesn't look like it's coming from the merchandise margins. you said they were going to be up year over year.
so, any additional clarity there would be helpful.
mike henry -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. matt, historically, fourth-quarter product margins are the lowest of any quarter. that's always been true of our business purely because of the level of promotions that happen naturally during, you know, and normally during the holiday season. so, sequentially, q3 to q4, product margins are lower in q4 than q3.
they always are. there's nothing unusual about that, completely normal, completely expected. in q4, relative to last year and to two years ago, as we noted, we're expecting another 50 to 100 basis points of improvement in our product margins on top of last year, which was already 210 basis points better than 2019. so, you know, we're seeing the healthiest product margins we've seen in many years, if not ever, in the fourth quarter, and it has been a less promotional environment.
now, there are some additional costs in this particular fourth quarter that are different than history that impact distribution in particular. you've probably seen the news about all the shipping surcharges from, you know, the fedex and ups and that crowd, and there's certainly some extra costs this year that was not there last year. we've had to institute retention bonuses for labor protection just to get through the holiday season to make sure we have plenty enough labor to be able to serve the peak need of the holiday season. and then, of course, there are some bonus elements within the buying group that flow through the buying costs that hit gross margin.
and on the sg&a side, there are some of the same things. we've had to implement retention bonuses for store employees to protect the labor force there. we've accelerated some -- you know, any minimum wage increases that we knew were coming as of january 1, we've gone ahead and just implemented them early. and there's been some other compression type of issues with store payroll that we've addressed as well.
so, as you look sequentially, and that's why we say, you know, we're expecting sg&a to be about 26%. and all of you, the analysts, were pretty close before the call. it was -- i think you all have an average of 26.5, so not far off there. but between, you know, corporate bonuses, we're having such a stellar year, and then the things that i just mentioned about store payroll, labor challenges.
you know, there are some added expenses that were not part of the model in the past.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
fair enough. very detailed. thank you, mike. and then just -- i guess on the dividend cadence, i'm curious now that you guys have basically done two special dividends this year.
it looks like, you know, you're going to backfill most of the cash that you pay out on the december dividend within this quarter alone. should we be expecting a two-time-a-year cadence on a go-forward basis, or what's the thought process there? i'm just curious if i could get your latest thinking.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
twice a year is not in the plan. it's something that we discussed -- as we've told everybody in the past, we've discussed it pretty regularly as a board, and discussed what the options are proper use of cash. so, there's nothing -- i wouldn't assume that it's going to be twice a year going forward. but i also wouldn't assume if we do anything, it's going to be in the same form.
so, i don't know yet.
mike henry -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, we've had such a stellar year. obviously, each quarter has been so incredibly strong beyond anything that any historical data would point you to. you know, our board just acknowledged the cash generation has been so fantastic, you know, why not do another one.
and honestly, it caught me off guard, too, that they did another one at this particular time. so, they're just looking at the performance of the business, the cash generation, and decided that, you know, why not do another one now and reward our loyal shareholders for sticking in with us through all this. so, they'll make their determinations as they go forward and can't predict for sure what that might look like.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok, great. one more from me, maybe if i can. maybe i'm saying to ask this early here, but any early learnings or behavioral changes for traffic or anything that you've observed around the new variant? i mean, it's probably just too early to tell, but any new observations?
mike henry -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no. yeah, no, not on this new variant, no. we can't really tell anything yet. it's way too new, it's not as widespread as delta became, or the -- you know, just the initial peak of the pandemic, obviously.Â 
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
and even before the new variant, traffic is still very unpredictable, and it's all -- it can be incredibly good, and it could be incredibly bad, but we're just going to manage our way through it like we have for the last several months.
mike henry -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. overall, traffic is up substantially to last year. i'm looking at some data i have for the month of november. traffic for the month of november was up 38% in stores.
pretty amazing. i've never seen a number like that. relative to two years ago, it was down 1% for us. so, you know, it still lags 2019, but it's very robust compared to last year in stores.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
that's great. very helpful, guys. nice job, and i'll jump back in queue.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, matt.

i now turn the call over to ed. 
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, gar. good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. fiscal 2021 was our most profitable year ever. our fourth-quarter comparable net sales grew by 12.5% and our earnings per share of $0.38 represented our best fourth-quarter earnings in our public company history.
from a product perspective, all departments comped positive in the fourth quarter with accessories, men's and boys especially strong with double-digit percentage increases. as we begin fiscal 2022, we have seen good, early reads from our spring assortment offerings in shorts, dresses, and more fashionable tops. graphic tees with retro content from the 1990s and y2k era are growing in popularity. we've launched a print-on-demand t-shirt initiative through a third-party service provider that is off to a nice start, and we expect this initiative to grow over the course of fiscal 2022 and beyond.
in footwear, global brands are driving growth for us, although adequate and timely supply remains a moving target with the ongoing supply chain challenges. swim has also been hit disproportionately by the supply chain delays, but we still expect this category to be a meaningful contributor to the spring/summer season. the return of in-person school, festivals, and travel has driven a strong bags business. long bottoms continue to do well with the combination of new fits, proportions, colors, and fabrics.
we believe the newness that is available across several departments will continue to be important in driving sales. the positive momentum in our business for the past five quarters continued into the early part of the first quarter of fiscal 2022, although our comparable net sales have recently started to decline relative to last year. given the unique impacts of last year's pent-up demand exiting 2020's pandemic restrictions and federal stimulus payments, which created a significant acceleration in our business for the later half of the first quarter last year, we expect this recent decline relative to last year to continue and get more pronounced. while we continue to encounter risks and uncertainties relating to the covid-19 pandemic, supply chain difficulties, labor challenges and increasing costs generally, we remain cautiously optimistic at this time about our business prospects for fiscal 2022 as a whole to our prepandemic performance due to the newness in merchandise trends that are available.
in terms of real estate, we continue to expect to open 15 to 20 new stores during fiscal 2022, 10 of which are nearing lease execution at this time. we expect 6 of those stores to open during the second quarter and four to open during the third quarter. any additional new stores are expected to open in or around november. on existing leases, we are roughly halfway done with our fiscal 2022 lease decisions.
we have been generally pleased with the results of our negotiations overall. yet in a few cases, we have decided to close stores due to proposed rent increases. our store traffic is still down relative to 2019, continuing a multiyear decline that started well before the pandemic hit. and thus, we remain focused on ensuring our leases make economic sense to us in that environment.
as we noted during our last earnings call, our capital expenditure priorities for fiscal 2022 beyond new stores include upgrading our mobile app and website platforms, it infrastructure and cybersecurity investments, and improving distribution efficiencies. in order to position ourselves for a long-term anticipated future growth, we have also begun evaluating additional potential distribution investments to support that growth. we do not have any specific details to share at this time but anticipate we'll have more to share about this at a future date. in closing, we remain cautiously optimistic about the current momentum in our business relative to prepandemic times and our long-term growth opportunities.
i will now turn the call over to mike to provide additional details on our fiscal 2022 fourth-quarter operating performance and to introduce our fiscal 2022 first-quarter outlook. mike?
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
thanks, ed. good afternoon, everyone. the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 produced our best fourth-quarter earnings per share in our public company history and fiscal 2021 as a whole, produced a company record earnings per share of $2.06, far surpassing any previous fiscal year. details of our fourth-quarter operating performance compared to last year's fourth quarter by line item were as follows: total net sales of $204.5 million increased by $26.6 million or 14.9%, compared to $177.9 million last year.
total net sales from physical stores were $152.2 million, an increase of $29.6 million or 24.2%, compared to $122.5 million last year. net sales from physical stores represented 74.4% of our total net sales, compared to 68.9% of total net sales last year. e-commerce net sales were $52.3 million, a decrease of $3.1 million or 5.6%, compared to $55.4 million last year but still 57% above the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. e-comm net sales represented 25.6% of total net sales, compared to 31.1% of total net sales last year.
consumer behavior in 2021 favored stores over e-comm compared to last year, during which stores were more constricted in hours and customer occupancy limits than this year. we ended the fiscal year with 241 total stores, a net increase of three stores compared to the end of fiscal 2020. gross profit, including buying, distribution, and occupancy expenses, improved to $70.4 million or 34.4% of net sales, compared to $58.3 million or 32.7% of net sales last year. buying, distribution, and occupancy costs improved by 190 basis points collectively despite increasing by $1.9 million in total due to leveraging these costs against higher net sales.
product margins declined by 20 basis points primarily due to higher sales return reserves and reduced inventory shrink favorability than last year, the combination of which more than offset a lower markdown rate compared to last year. total sg&a expenses were $53.1 million or 25.9% of net sales, compared to $44.1 million or 24.8% of net sales last year. primary dollar increases in sg&a were higher store payroll and related benefit costs of $4.5 million; increased marketing expenses of $1.7 million, primarily associated with e-comm; and higher corporate bonus accruals of $0.6 million due to our strong operating performance throughout fiscal 2021. operating income improved to $17.3 million or 8.5% of net sales, compared to $14.1 million or 7.9% of net sales last year primarily due to the significant increase in net sales.
income tax expense was $4.9 million or 28.7% of pre-tax income, compared to $5.1 million or 36.6% of pre-tax income last year. the decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to a normalization of the tax rate after last year's effective tax rate was distorted by low pre-tax losses for the year as a whole. net income improved to $12.1 million or $0.38 per diluted share, which is a fourth-quarter record for us in our public company history, compared to $8.9 million or $0.29 per diluted share last year. weighted average shares were $31.4 million this year, compared to $30.1 million last year.
turning to our balance sheet. we ended the fiscal year with total cash and marketable securities of $139 million and no debt outstanding compared to $141 million and no debt last year. this is after we paid an aggregate of approximately $62 million in special cash dividends to our shareholders during 2021. we ended the fiscal year with inventories per square foot up 17% over last year, generally in line with our 15% fourth-quarter net sales growth rate and our early first-quarter net sales results.
entering this current week, inventories were up 7% to last year. we continue to contend with product delays through the southern california ports and believe this condition will continue to be a challenge for several more months. our merchant team has worked incredibly hard to manage and adjust our overall inventory levels through an extremely volatile and unpredictable period. total capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 were $13.4 million, compared to $8.5 million last year, the increase being primarily due to new store openings.
looking ahead, the current business environment remains subject to many unpredictable risks and uncertainties with respect to, among others, the covid-19 pandemic, the current inflationary environment, continuing supply chain difficulties, geopolitical concerns, and how consumer behavior may change relative to any of these factors as well as last year's historic anomalies of pent-up demand coming out of pandemic-related restrictions and federal stimulus payments. on top of that, we also have a later easter this year. as a result, it is extremely difficult to predict our business results with any certainty given that nothing has been so-called normal for two full years now. that being said, turning specifically to the first quarter of fiscal 2022, total comparable net sales through march 6 increased by 10.4% compared to last year, with an increase from physical stores of 14% and a decrease from e-commerce of 1.3%.
during last year's first quarter, comparable net sales were negative during february, turned positive in march, and then accelerated significantly from march week three through the end of the first quarter following the relaxation of pandemic restrictions and the release of federal stimulus payments. the opposite has occurred thus far in the first quarter of fiscal '22 with a strong february, followed by negative comps in early march. we anticipate a further deceleration in our business relative to last year for the latter half of the first quarter as we go up against the peak performance of last year's first quarter that was driven by the unique environment at that time and the current headwinds i just described. based on current and historical first-quarter trends, we estimate that our total net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 will be in the range of approximately $143 million to $148 million, translating to a comparable store net sales decline of 10% to 13% for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to last year.
we currently expect our earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 to be in the range of breakeven to $0.05 per diluted share with an estimated income tax rate of 27% and weighted average diluted shares of 31.6 million. we currently expect to have 241 total stores at the end of the first quarter compared to 238 at the end of the first quarter of fiscal '21. this outlook compares to $163 million in total net sales and $0.36 in earnings per diluted share for last year's first quarter, which were first-quarter records for us by far, and $130 million in total net sales and $0.02 in earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2019's prepandemic first quarter. operator, we'll now go to our q&a session.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of jeff van sinderen with b. riley. please proceed with your question.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley financial -- analyst
hi, everybody. maybe if we can just circle back to supply chain for a second. i guess kind of your -- as you're looking at your supply chain dashboard, how that looks now, i know there -- i understand there's still some delays going through the ports. and then maybe if you can give us more color on kind of how you're thinking about the inflationary influences on your business.
maybe what you're seeing from vendors in terms of price increases from them and how you're thinking about passing those increases on to your customer.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
ok. jeff, as far as the supply chain goes, there's a couple of categories that have been impacted more than most of the categories. shoes is one where we've seen -- and shoes happens to be a very hard category for us. but we've seen some slowdown in the shoe replenishment area from multiple brands, not just one brand.
and then probably to a lesser extent, some of the seasonal categories, particularly shorts and swim, we've been delayed in getting those receipts. so we have some, but we don't have as much as we normally have. and it appears to be opening up a little. but as mike said earlier, we're expecting that the supply chain challenges will remain for several more months, but it certainly doesn't seem to be as extreme as it had been for the last several months.
so that's kind of where we are with supply chain. i'm sorry, what was the second question?
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
it was inflation.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
inflation. ok.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
pricing for the brands and stuff.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think we've seen some price increases from some of the brands, but it hasn't been across the board. we expected it. and because most of -- our branded goods, they're all on the map pricing.
it's kind of like we're all in the same -- anybody that sells these brands is going to be in the same category. but we haven't seen anything that's really material. and certainly, we'll adjust where necessary -- our pricing where necessary to minimize the impact on gross margins.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
yes. and then i'd just add to that. as you think about the expense side of things from an inflationary standpoint, particularly, i think we're seeing something of a return to a normalization perhaps. and so if we compare to prepandemic 2019, we certainly have a number of areas where costs are just significantly higher than they were three years ago.
obviously, minimum wage is a big piece of that. in 2019, it was $12 an hour here in california. we're now at $15. that's a 25% increase in the wage rate.
insurance costs are more than double what they were three years ago. in the first quarter alone, that's going to cost us about $900,000 additional dollars than it did in 2019. freight costs are significantly higher than they were three years ago. so there's a number of cost pressures in addition to the product cost increases that we've seen from some of the brands.
and yet with a greater sales productivity that we're expecting for this first quarter relative to the 2019 first quarter, we still have a chance to produce earnings that are as good or better than we did in 2019 if we're at the better end of our outlook range. and hopefully, we will be. but admittedly, for all the reasons that i laid out in our prepared remarks, it is just extremely difficult to predict anything with any certainty, just as it has been for two years running now. it's no easier with all these different factors in play.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley financial -- analyst
right. understood. and then just a follow-up on the shorts and the swim area. do you think having kind of a lean assortment or a kind of lean inventory there is earning business in march as we're kind of approaching the typical seasonal spring break and all that? or do you think that's not so much of a factor?
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
it's building. so i think it's getting better and will certainly impact spring. it's -- geographically, it varies because of weather. so as we get further into the spring with the late easter and -- later easter, i think it will get better.
and i'm expecting a slight supply chain for those categories to improve.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley financial -- analyst
ok. and then i think you said inventory was roughly up 7% per foot at the end of the month, maybe, i think, you said.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
no. that was entering this week. so we were up 17% at the end of the fourth quarter. entering this week, that was down to up 7%.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley financial -- analyst
ok. ok. so -- and just in thinking about that -- do you -- i mean i would expect every -- i think everybody's got to get a little more promotional, especially if they have a little more inventory and it slowed down. is it fair to say that you would plan to be a little more promotional than you were at this time last year and i guess how are you --
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
certainly, the last year, yes.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
i don't think -- it's not going to be drastically different than what we historically do. our inventory is really very, very clean and current, for sure. and it's -- i'd rather have these supply chain delays earlier in the spring than late. so i don't think there's much exposure there.
in our category performance, quarter to date is positive across the board. so there's no real major weaknesses in any one category of our business.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
yes. we are expecting product margins to be down relative to last year. but they should be still better than they were in 2019. so it's a little bit different answer, depending on the relativity of which period we're talking about.
we do expect to have a little bit better product margins than we had in 2019. but they'll be somewhat below last year just because we're not anticipating to have the level of full-price selling that we had with the robust environment that existed at this time last year. and we do expect the need to be incrementally more promotional to keep inventories controlled.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley financial -- analyst
and then just one last one, if i could squeeze it in. just thinking about how you're planning inventory going forward, assuming the business is down, i don't know, call it, whatever, 10% on a comp basis this year to last year, do you now start to plan inventory to run negative year over year on a square-foot basis?
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
that is a constantly moving target. so it's difficult to answer that with any -- because quite honestly, our merchant teams have jumped through dozens of hoops to continually adjust our inventory levels relative to what we expect. and over the past year plus, i'll tell you there's -- we've gone through periods where one given week, we're thinking, ""oh, we need to race to go get more, go get more, go get more."" and seriously a week later, we're going, ""oops, we need to quickly reverse gears and go the other way.""
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
i'll add that the supply chain issues were there early on, we made a concerted effort to pull goods forward to combat that. and i think that helped us for sure. it's like mike said, it is a moving target, sales versus inventory. and as you know, jeff, we've -- our comp inventories have been down for a long time.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
relative to sales.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
so we certainly have room to play, but we're going to watch it very carefully in relation to the sales forecast.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley financial -- analyst
ok. thanks so much for taking my questions. i'll take the rest offline, and best of luck for the rest of the quarter.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
all right. thanks, jeff.
operator
our next question comes from the line of matt koranda with roth. please proceed with your question.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks. just as we think about modeling out the rest of '22, i guess i just wanted to -- maybe a few thoughts from you guys just in terms of any other notable areas of exceptional strength in '21. i guess back to school maybe comes to mind.
so just trying to figure out like cadence of the year and how to think about comps for the rest of this year on the top line. and then i got another one on margins after that.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
yes. good question. your guess is as good as ours, quite frankly. at this point, it's difficult to predict the current week, much less any further out.
so what we're doing currently is tracking our business relative to 2019 because that was the last prepandemic period that had stability. last year was a complete aberration, anomaly to the positive following 2020, which is a complete aberration to the negative, obviously. so if our business continues to track along the cadence of 2019, that's what leads to the outlook range that we have currently for the first quarter. looking at our comp performance relative to 2019 and then kind of carrying that forward through the rest of the quarter.
if that cadence of things continues, sales will be meaningfully below last year every quarter. they just have to be. it's almost common sense. so where exactly that lands out, who knows? there's just too many variables around that.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
a lot of it will depend on the macro environment. and we're seeing enough positive category performance where if the consumer is in decent shape and like to spend, i think we'll be in a good position to maybe outperform where we think we were going right now. but it's -- there's too much uncertainty.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
yes. i think just in the broadest context, i'd say we expect to do better than we did in 2019 at this time. but it's just certainly not realistic to think we're going to do what we did in 2021.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
got it. just following up on the consumer comment really quickly and then i'll get to the margin question. but just any discernible behavioral change that you guys can see in the last couple of months? just -- obviously, like a lot of headlines about inflationary pressure weighing on the lower end of the consumer. but just anything discernible that you guys have noticed in terms of product mix or behavioral change, that would be helpful.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
no, we haven't seen anything like that at all. and so traffic's been ok. and conversion is -- was down. and i think that might be somewhat related to some of the labor challenges we've had.
but i haven't seen anything unusual.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
i think if anything, just broadly, we continue to see a channel shift preference for stores relative to e-comm. that seems to be continuing. our store traffic relative to last year is considerably up so far in the first quarter, but it's down relative to 2019. so kind of interesting that -- again, it's one of those things.
it depends on what specific period you focus on. store traffic relative to three years ago is beneath where it was then, but it's meaningfully up relative to last year. and i just think it's with enough time, having been removed from the initial reopenings, coming out of pandemic restrictions, people prefer to be out in stores rather than continue to just sit at home and order online, generally speaking.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
got it. that makes sense. and then just last one on the margin assumptions embedded in the eps guide for q1. just wondered, mike, if you might be able to help out a little bit with sort of gross margin expectations versus sg&a that's embedded in there.
i got the point on sort of merch margins coming down a little bit year over year. i would expect also probably some deleverage on bd&o. and then just you did note, i think, in the prepared remarks some payroll and wage pressure. so where is the bulk of the pressure coming from? is it more on the gross margin side or on the opex side?
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
it's everywhere through the model, quite frankly. relative to last year, we're looking at a sales range that might be up to as much as $20 million below last year while having increasing cost pressures. obviously, that's going to create quite a bit of deleverage with those facts in play. so we do think product margins relative to last year are going to be down somewhere in the 100 to 150 basis points, but still up to 2019 by as much as about 50 basis points.
so depending on how you're modeling, whether you're referencing 2019 or 2021, there's different answers. relative specifically to last year, there will be deleverage in the bdo costs simply as a function of the lower sales. in our range, that assumption on bdo cost is -- it could be up to as close to 300 basis points of deleverage in the bdo combination of costs that's in gross margin. sg&a is going to be somewhere around 29% of sales, give or take a little bit here or there, again, with increasing costs on minimum wage, the insurance costs that i referenced and things of that nature on the lower sales, it's going to create some sizable deleverage there through the sg&a line that could be 450, 480 basis points, just a function of the math.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
gotcha. very detailed. thank you, mike, and thanks, ed. thank you.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, matt.
operator
[operator instructions] the next question comes from the line of marni shapiro with retail tracker. please proceed with your questions.
marni shapiro -- the retail tracker -- analyst
hey, guys. congratulations with the stores in spite of your apparent delivery issues, have looked really good. fashions really -- right and looks fantastic. i'm curious, you talked about sales having fallen off compared to levels last year, but i'm curious what that really looks like.
are you seeing the traffic changed significantly since january and february? or is it just the compares are a lot tougher? is she coming into the store and buying less than she was buying a year ago? sort of more the complexion of it, like i'm trying to assess if your customers' demand has gone away or the demand just looks depressed compared to exceptional demand last year.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
yes, it's all about compares as you think about last year. our february comps last year were negative. and then they started to turn positive in the first week and two of march. and then they really jumped starting in the week three of march and through the rest of the quarter.
so just for example, relative to 2019 now because obviously, relative to 2020 doesn't make any sense, february was down four last year. march was up 39 and april was up 20. and then in march, in particular, we went from a plus four to plus 11 to plus 59 to plus 49 to plus 72. so there's the explosion in rate of business that we're seeing like, ok, that's not going to be likely to happen this year when stimulus isn't in play, pent-up demand isn't in play.
so that relativity, we're not expecting the same kind of flow. and then, of course, with the later easter for a business like ours and the age range we serve, that's going to push some business from march into april as it typically does when easter is late. and it just so happens, fiscal '19 was pretty close within four days of the date of easter. so that's why we continue to look at 2019 as a baseline to evaluate our business.
so far, the average transaction value has been roughly flat year over year. so it isn't that they're necessarily spending less in the transactions that are going on, we've actually had more transactions. it's just the conversion rate is down on higher traffic than a year ago in stores.
marni shapiro -- the retail tracker -- analyst
right, because people are actually browsing again as opposed to coming in and purchasing and leaving and being nervous.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations
yes.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
yes. it's actually been better than what we anticipated. so -- from that perspective.
marni shapiro -- the retail tracker -- analyst
which is a good thing over time that the people are coming back and wandering around again is a good thing because you have more opportunity for transactions if they actually walk in the door.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
exactly. and we're seeing that throughout the whole country. it's not limited to any one area. so that's good, too.
marni shapiro -- the retail tracker -- analyst
and then just a quick follow-up on the footwear conversation because i know this has been a problem all year. i guess when you think about it in '22, do you see -- is there any visibility as to when deliveries in footwear could start to normalize? and is it across all the brands? i know in the past, you've called out some of the nike deliveries being tough, as many people have. just curious if you could put a little color behind that.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
we're getting a little bit more clarity from some of the brands. i wouldn't call any one particular brand. and we're getting more clarity on it. so it's going to -- it's definitely going to get better.
i just don't know when it all comes together, the timing of that yet.
marni shapiro -- the retail tracker -- analyst
right. that makes sense. well, best of luck for the next couple of weeks because it sounds like it's going to be the toughest hurdle to get through.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and investor relations

i now turn the call over to ed. 
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, gar. good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. our fiscal 2022 first quarter operating results were in line with our outlook range for the quarter. last year was an amazing year, fueled by the unprecedented pent-up consumer demand, exiting 2020 pandemic restrictions and the impact of federal stimulus payments.
as we lap those record-setting members amid a highly inflationary environment this year, we expect our fiscal 2022 operating results will be significantly below last year for each quarter. however, relative to our pre-pandemic performance in fiscal 2019, we delivered comparable net sales growth with consistent product margins, improved gross margin as a result of lower occupancy costs and higher operating income in the first quarter despite significant cost increases that have occurred since then in wages, freight, fuel and insurance. despite the challenges in the current environment, we continue planning for growth and further improvement in our business over time. we continue to believe we have ample opportunity to grow our business, both in terms of store count and via e-commerce and are investing to position ourselves for that growth.
near the end of the first quarter, we completed an upgrade of our website platform to a more mobile responsive version of our existing platform with improved customer experience features such as overall site speed, express checkout for returning customers, the ability to save items in your shopping cart and options to receive push notifications. we are also in the process of upgrading our mobile app to allow for biometric sign-in, loyalty card scanning, native search and faster checkout. we are also evaluating potential distribution investments to improve efficiencies and help support our planned future store growth. regarding new stores, we currently have nine leases signed for opening in fiscal 2022 with two stores planned to open in june, four in august, two in october, and one in early november.
we now expect total new store openings for fiscal 2022 to be in the range of nine to 12 total stores. as we've said in the past, we only intend to open new stores that reflect what we believe to be appropriate lease economics relative to the environment we expect. store traffic is down relative to 2019 for lease economics for potential new stores need to reflect that reality. we closed one store in early may as a result of the landlord's plan to significantly increase rent.
there may be a small number of additional store closures as we work through our lease renewals, although none are currently planned. we continue to believe that we have ample opportunities to grow our store count over the next several years, despite current challenges with rising construction costs and inflation generally. turning to the second quarter fiscal 2022, our customers continue to suffer from high inflation and energy costs. total comparable net sales through may 30 declined 17% versus the comparable period of last year as we continue to lap last year's pent-up demand and stimulus impacts.
through may 30 relative to the comparable period of fiscal 2019, total net sales increased by 13.9% with a comparable net sales increase of 8.6%, with comp growth from both stores and online. we believe it is going to be a challenging year relative to last year's incredible record-setting results. however, we also believe that in absence of a significant slowdown in consumer spending or unforeseen pandemic impacts, we have an opportunity to produce operating results that are consistent with or better than our pre-pandemic performance in the back half of fiscal 2019 despite the significant cost increases that have taken place since then. i will now turn the call over to mike to discuss our first quarter operating results and second quarter outlook in more detail.
mike?
michael henry -- chief financial officer
thanks, ed. in addition to discussing our fiscal 2022 first quarter operating performance compared to last year's first quarter, i'm also going to intersperse a few data points relative to the pre-pandemic first quarter of fiscal 2019 for added perspective. last year was incredible, but it was fueled by unprecedented factors that were historic anomalies, as ed noted earlier. we believe that referring to pre-pandemic fiscal 2019 for additional context provides an important perspective on our current operations and certain improvements we have made over time.
total net sales were $145.8 million, a decrease of $17.4 million or 10.7% compared to a company first quarter record of $163.2 million last year due to going up against last year's pent-up demand and stimulus impacts. total comparable net sales, including both physical stores and e-commerce, decreased by 13%. total net sales from physical stores were $117.5 million, a decrease of $10.2 million or 8% compared to $127.7 million last year, with a comparable store net sales decrease of 10.8%. net sales from physical stores represented 80.6% of our total net sales this year compared to 78.3% of total net sales last year.
e-commerce net sales were $28.3 million, a decrease of $7.2 million or 20.3% compared to $35.5 million last year. e-comm net sales represented 19.4% of total net sales compared to 21.7% of total net sales last year. we ended the first quarter with 241 total stores, a net increase of three stores since the end of last year's first quarter. compared to the pre-pandemic first quarter of fiscal 2019, total net sales increased by 11.9% with a comparable net sales increase of 5.8% comprised of a slight decline from physical stores of 0.7% and an increase from e-commerce of 42.3%, reflecting the general shift in consumer behavior toward online shopping over the past three years.
gross profit, including buying, distribution and occupancy expenses was $43.8 million or 30.1% of net sales compared to $54.8 million or 33.6% of net sales last year. buying, distribution and occupancy costs deleveraged by 190 basis points collectively despite decreasing by $1 million in total due to carrying these costs against the lower level of net sales this year compared to last year. product margins declined by 160 basis points, primarily due to a more normalized markdown rate compared to last year when full price selling was at record levels. compared to the pre-pandemic first quarter of fiscal 2019, gross margin was 270 basis points better than in 2019 with lower occupancy costs and 10 basis points of improvement in product margins.
total sg&a expenses were $42.7 million or 29.3% of net sales compared to $40 million or 24.5% of net sales last year. of the $2.7 million increase in sg&a, $2 million was attributable to increased store payroll and related benefits, resulting primarily from wage inflation. our average rate per store payroll hour increased by 6.5% over last year's first quarter. $1.6 million of the sg&a increase was attributable to a credit from the reversal of a disputed california sales tax assessment in last year's first quarter.
partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in corporate bonus expense of $1.6 million due to the lack of any bonus accrual this year. sg&a was $7.2 million higher than in the pre-pandemic first quarter of fiscal 2019 due to wage inflation, e-com-related marketing and fulfillment costs associated with online sales growth and increased insurance premiums. operating income was $1.1 million or 0.8% of net sales compared to $14.9 million or 9.1% of net sales last year. operating income was $146,000 in the pre-pandemic first quarter of fiscal 2019.
income tax expense was $0.3 million or 26.9% of pre-tax income compared to $3.8 million or 25.7% of pre-tax income last year. net income was $0.8 million or $0.03 per diluted share compared to a company first quarter record of $11 million or $0.36 per diluted share last year. weighted average shares were $31 million this year compared to $30.5 million last year. net income was $0.7 million or $0.02 per diluted share in the pre-pandemic first quarter of 2019.
turning to our balance sheet. we ended the first quarter with total cash and marketable securities of $111 million and no debt outstanding. this compared to $157.6 million at the end of the first quarter last year. since the end of last year's first quarter, we have paid aggregate special cash dividend to stockholders of $61.6 million.
during the first quarter, we also repurchased 892,000 shares of our common stock for a total of $8.2 million. we ended the first quarter with inventories per square foot up 12.7% relative to last year due in part to continuing supply chain challenges. recall that we ended last year's first quarter with reduced inventories due to the unexpected net sales growth during that period. the inventory increases are primarily in basic key items within men's and women's apparel and footwear rather than in riskier fashion or seasonal items.
we have been adjusting as we read business results, including canceling late seasonal goods and reflowing key replenishment items. our intention is to get overall inventory levels more consistent with our sales performance by the end of the third quarter without sacrificing product margins beyond what would be expected when comparing to last year's higher overall level of full price selling. total capital expenditures for the first quarter were $2.6 million compared to $5.5 million last year. the decrease being primarily due to earlier new store openings last year.
for fiscal '22 as a whole, we currently expect our total capital expenditures to be in the range of $23 million to $25 million. turning to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, ed shared our quarter-to-date sales performance earlier. we expect the comparable net sales relationship to last year to improve to some extent, given that may was the strongest month of the quarter in terms of percentage increase in net sales last year. however, the relationship to fiscal 2019 slowed from week to week through may.
as a result, based on current and historical trends, we currently expect our total net sales to be in the range of $170 million to $175 million. we expect our product margins to decline by approximately 200 to 250 basis points relative to last year due primarily to going up against record levels of full-price selling last year. we expect the combination of buying, distribution and occupancy costs to deleverage by approximately 270 to 320 basis points, primarily due to carrying these costs against a lower level of net sales and sg&a to be approximately $47 million to $48 million. we expect operating income to be in the range of approximately $6 million to $8.5 million.
our estimated income tax rate to be approximately 27%. and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $0.14 to $0.20, with weighted average diluted shares of approximately $30.2 million. this compares to record net sales of $202 million and record earnings per diluted share of $0.66 for the second quarter last year, which doubled the previous company record for second quarter earnings per share. we expect to have 242 total stores opened at the end of the second quarter, which is a decrease of two from 244 total stores at the end of last year's second quarter.
operator, we'll now go to our q&a session.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from jeff van sinderen with b. riley securities. please proceed with your question.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley securities -- analyst
hi, everyone. wonder if we could just start on some of the, i guess, sort of inflationary pressures that you think are impacting your customers, obviously, higher fuel prices. what are you seeing -- and i know you said traffic is down versus 2019. but what are you seeing in store traffic trends lately? and does the ubt and ads indicate that customers are buying more in fewer store visits versus a few months ago? or i guess, how are you looking at that data when you kind of shift out or shake out the kpis there?
michael henry -- chief financial officer
yes, jeff. so relative to last year, traffic was actually up in the first quarter but it has slipped to negative in may. so our total traffic was up 6% in q1. it's down 5.5% so far in may.
so that's been a little bit of a flip there. the average sale has been higher. the aggregate number of transactions has been lower. so those are the metrics we're seeing in the short run.
and sitting here in california where you are as well, gas is $6 and more all over the place. and that's got to hurt the pocketbook of our young customer, right? i mean more of their pocketbook is going to fill the fuel tank and higher food prices and all those things, it's got to hurt.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley securities -- analyst
sure. absolutely. and then, just wondering about pricing, i guess, maybe you can just touch a little bit more on what you're seeing in terms of what the brands are doing with raising prices for you? maybe touch on private label. i don't know, any advantages to private label or your manufacturers or your sources raising prices for you? and then i guess, how are you thinking about passing along price increases? i know that's hard because you're also comparing to no -- almost no promotional activity last year.
but maybe if we look at it versus 2019, and i guess, how you're thinking about promotional activity. as we kind of get into q3, i know you said you want to get inventory down. so how much of that is inventory receipts? and how much of that is maybe incremental promotional activity?
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
the price increases, jeff, are coming from both branded and private label merchandise. i would say there's no greater than 5% across the board. and we're adjusting pricing as we feel the need to and maintaining our margins. so i think the bigger challenge for everybody has been just the inconsistency of the supply chain delivery.
and as mike mentioned in his comments, we've taken action by canceling some orders and adjusting accordingly. our inventory being up 12.7% compared to what we've seen in a lot of other retailers' report was much higher numbers. we think we're in pretty good shape. it will not require us to do any kind of crazy promotional activity to get the inventory levels in line with sales, as mike talked about, by the end of the quarter.
so i'm not expecting anything unusual in terms of promotional pricing either way. i don't think promotions are driving traffic for most retailers anyway. i think it's more the challenge of inflation, the cost of gas. i think it's those factors that are impacting the customers' thinking in terms of whether they're going to buy another t-shirt or not.
michael henry -- chief financial officer
yes. and then, just to your question on product margins. in the first quarter, our product margins were 10 basis points better than 2019. in the second quarter last year, that was our highest product margin quarter of the year.
in the third quarter, it was only 10 basis points beneath that. so we're going to be going up against our peak product margins of last year in the second quarter and in the third quarter. so that's why we think there's going to be a little bit more deceleration in the margin rate relative to last year than what we saw in the first quarter. and we're still expecting that our product margins to be fairly consistent with 2019 levels.
at the upper end of our range, i'd say we might be able to be pretty darn close to breakeven to 2019. on the lower end, we'd probably see a little bit of decline relative to 2019, but not hundreds of basis points. i'm talking 30, 50 basis points maybe on the lower end relative to 2019. so as we look back to pre-pandemic times, i mean, some of the things we're encouraged about is we are seeing comp sales increases relative to back then, consistent product margins, better occupancy structure.
the challenge, i think, for all of us in the retail world is the rate of increase that's happened in wages since then along with insurance premiums for cyber insurance and property and things of that nature and then the freight charges and fuel costs. we're all battling that, and that's taken away the gains we're having in other areas.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley securities -- analyst
so, i mean, i guess, i would sort of summarize that by saying that if you adjust for the things that you really can't control, right, i mean, some of those -- a bunch of things you just mentioned are really out of your control. you just sort of have to do -- you have to pay what you have to pay people and insurance costs are what they are. but i mean, it strikes me that versus 2019, if you adjust for those other things, the business is really better than it was in 2019 now?
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
that's right. yes. you are right. that's very accurate.
michael henry -- chief financial officer
yes, i'd agree with that with that wholeheartedly. store payroll, for example, that is our biggest dollar increase in sg&a and is going to be all year. we looked at some data points for the first quarter. our sales per hour are actually higher than they were in 2019 on lower average hours per store than in 2019.
the problem is the hourly average rate has gone up 16% since then. so where we're managing more efficiently and effectively on hours usage and we're getting better productivity on sales per hour at a store payroll, that hourly rate is just eating away at those gains.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley securities -- analyst
ok. just one more quick one, and then i'll take the rest off-line. but i was just curious, i know, obviously, with disruption in supply chain and some things getting stuck at the ports or stuck to go on not even on trucks or in trucks or what have you, are there -- is there a merchandise coming in at times that is coming in late that you can then reject or --
michael henry -- chief financial officer
yes.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
yes. yes. we won't take it if it's that late. and if it's within season, yes, we have.
and we've done some of that for sure. so we adjust accordingly. but --
michael henry -- chief financial officer
yes, that's where the supply chain delays, they're tough to be able to effectively manage your inventories the way we normally would, right? you've followed us for a long time. i don't think there's been a single quarter before the pandemic hit us where our inventory level was above the rate of sales in the entire time that ed and i've been here together. it's just made so many things so much more challenging to manage. and so, as we think about the back-to-school season starting toward the end of this quarter, we're trying to make sure that we're in a much better inventory position for footwear, backpacks and long bottoms to go into that season better than we were at this time last year.
we certainly are not going to reject those orders because we need them to serve latter part of second quarter and on into the third quarter business. but at this point, swim, for example, we don't need more of that coming in two months late. so we are making those kinds of adjustments.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley securities -- analyst
ok. all right. good. thanks for taking my questions and best of luck for the rest of the quarter.
michael henry -- chief financial officer
thanks, jeff.
operator
thank you. our next question is from matt koranda with roth capital. please proceed with your question.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hey, guys. good afternoon. i think you sort of addressed this in the prior set of questions, but i just wanted to put a finer point on it. it sounds like you plan to clear a fair bit of inventory in the current quarter here.
are you saying that markdown activity in your stores is supposed to revert to sort of similar levels to where you were in 2019?
michael henry -- chief financial officer
yes.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
how would you compare the general competitive environment, i guess, in terms of markdowns as you observe it in the broader environment?
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
we're not seeing any competitive pricing pressure at this point. we're expecting it in certain categories, but like swim and more seasonal goods and shorts. but i don't think -- we're not anticipating we have to do anything unusual from what we normally do. and the pricing -- generally, the margin should be decent.
michael henry -- chief financial officer
yes. anything that we can anticipate is thought about and how we're thinking about our outlook range for the quarter, certainly. we do think that there's likely to be some discounting pressure, and we are going to have to clear seasonal goods out of the back-to-school season. and everything that we can reasonably anticipate we thought about that in terms of how we've pitched our outlook range for the quarter.
so we think we'll be all right in that regard.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
and it sounds like you aren't really factoring in any further deterioration in traffic or ticket for the remainder of the quarter here, just given what you shared in terms of may-to-date trends and then the midpoint of the guidance. but maybe if you could just speak to that in more detail.
michael henry -- chief financial officer
sure. so it's really interesting, quite honestly. we have so many different ways of looking at this. and quite honestly, we have scenarios that range -- have sales ranges anywhere from the mid-$160 millions into the mid-$180 millions, honestly.
it's just neither in that range i just mentioned, makes sense relative to each other when you're looking at just versus last year versus just versus 2019. so we don't think that that low end that i mentioned of mid-160 million makes any sense because we reported $161.7 million of sales in the second quarter of 2019, and we are seeing a comp increase relative to 2019 with 12 additional stores. so it shouldn't be that low. we've looked at may as a historical percentage of the second quarter.
the last four years, it's averaged 26% of the quarter. that would get you to the low end of our range, that $170 million figure. and we do think that we'll continue to run a positive comp relative to 2019. but as we acknowledged in our prepared remarks, the rate relative to 2019, while still positive every week of may, was slowing down with each week as we went through may.
so the final week of may, for example, was beneath the month to date, 8.6% that we mentioned. so we have thought about that to factor that in. and so, we've kind of squeezed in from both ends of the wide range of possibilities that different methods of looking at this might provide and centered into what we think is the most reasonable expectation for the quarter, and that's at $170 million to $175 million range.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
and then just -- i mean, it seems obvious that inflation has impacted the consumer. but i mean maybe if you could put a finer point on behavioral changes that you guys have observed maybe just in terms of more shift to private label, trade downs, any category shifts that are interesting to call out? just love to get a little bit more color there.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
we haven't seen any material changes in any one category. the business is pretty consistent across the category. so nothing that we've seen there. and geographically, we're also seeing the same results pretty much.
there's some variation, but we're seeing the same results across the country. so we are not seeing anything unusual there. it's like mike said, traffic has been a challenge. but conversion is probably the biggest area we've seen a change in this conversion is that people are buying a little less.
so i'd say that's probably the biggest behavioral change that we've seen.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
and then just maybe last one from me on margin expectations. i think i got you pretty clearly. product margins probably are going to be relatively consistent with 2019 levels. it sounds like occupancy expense is to the good relative to 2019, just given the renegotiated leases, where we're going to feel more pressure would likely be on distribution and buying costs.
are those the kind of buckets that you put the pressure in? and just any help on sort of quantifying that pressure in the next couple of quarters?
michael henry -- chief financial officer
well, in the second quarter, the aggregate of buying, distribution and occupancy dollars are going to be fairly consistent to what they were a year ago, a little bit lower but with a lower level of sales. that's where the deleverage is coming from. it's a simple function of basically having a similar occupancy structure on a lower sales base. so we're not expecting we're going to see the same level of decrease in the dollars year over year that we did in the first quarter.
naturally, the second quarter level of occupancy cost is higher because occupancy is not just store leases, it's also bags, boxes, hangers, supplies, utilities, a bunch of other things that go into operating a store. and as you head into the back-to-school season toward the end of the second quarter, those things spike up in terms of level of cost. so the raw dollars are higher in q2 than they are in q1. but as we look at the second quarter, really looking at a fairly consistent level of dollar spend in that bucket of cost, it's just going to go up against a $25 million to $30 million lower sales figure.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
got it very clear. i'll turn it over. thank you.
michael henry -- chief financial officer
thank you.

ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, gar. good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. as our customers continue to face the highest inflationary environment of the past 40 years, our second quarter results fell just short of our estimated outlook ranges for both net sales and earnings per share. our comp sales performance which began with a minus comp in may declined further throughout june before starting to moderate to less negative comps in the final two weeks of the quarter once the early stages of the back-to-school season began.
all geographic markets comped double-digit negative for the quarter. our merchandise departments comped double-digit negative except for footwear, which decreased by a high-single-digit percentage. swim was particularly weak for us across departments and geographies. customer traffic and conversion both declined by high-single-digit percentages compared to last year.
we believe seeing both traffic and conversion declined to this extent, at the same time as indicative of the impact of inflation on our customers particularly as we lap last year's record-setting results that were fueled by stimulus payments and other pandemic-related factors. supply chain issues have been getting somewhat better by continue to cause disruptions to typical product flows, most significantly in footwear and branded women's and children's apparel. we believe that we have managed through these challenges fairly well under the circumstances. despite the challenges of the current environment, we continue working toward improving our business and generating long-term growth.
our sustainable product offerings continue to grow and represented 7% of our total net sales for the second quarter. we recently added a home category to serve teens and college students which is off to a good start. we believe these offerings can bring incremental business to us over time. we also expect to launch our upgraded mobile app ahead of the holiday season, which we believe will improve customer engagements through an improved mobile shopping experience compared to what has been a simple wrap of our website previously.
in terms of real estate, we now expect to open a total of a 11 new stores this year, four of which have already be opened, two are scheduled to open in mid september, one in mid october and four in november just ahead of thanksgiving. we continue to believe that we have ample opportunities to grow our total store count by ten or more stores per year over the next several years despite current challenges with rising construction cost and inflation in general. however, as we said in the past, we intend to be disciplined in our approach to our new store openings and will only open new stores that reflect what we believe is to be appropriate lease economics relative to the environment we expect. turning to the third quarter of fiscal 2022, which includes the peak of back-to-school season, total comparable net sales through august 30 including both physical stores and e-com decreased by 10.6% versus the comparable period of last year.
the less negative comp trend that began in the latter half of july carried through the first half of august before returning to negative double-digits in the latter half of august. for additional perspective relative to the comparable period of the pre-pandemic third quarter of fiscal 2019, comparable net sales through august 30 increased by 7.5%. while these august comp results represent an improvement compared to our second quarter comp performance, we are expecting the latter half of the third quarter to decrease significantly, compared to last year once the traditional back-to-school shopping period concludes, particularly given the impacts of inflation this year and the early shop -- early holiday shopping that took late last year. we feel good about our merchandise assortment for the holiday season and if the holiday season follows more traditional patterns, we believe we have an opportunity to have a better performance trend in the fourth quarter.
we will continue to manage our business thoughtfully relative to the environment with improved long-term performance in mind. i now turn the call over to mike to discuss our second quarter operating results and third quarter outlook in more details. mike?
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, corporate secretary
thanks, ed. our second quarter operating results compared to last year were as follows: total net sales were $168.3 million, a decrease of $33.6 million or 16.7%, compared to a company's second quarter record of $202 million last year due to going up against last year's unprecedented pent-up demand and stimulus impacts. total comparable net sales, including both physical stores and e-commerce, decreased by 16.4%. total net sales from physical stores were $137.1 million, a decrease of $27.5 million or 16.7%, compared to $164.6 million last year with a comparable store net sales decrease of 16.5%.
net sales from physical stores represented 81.5% of our total net sales both this year and last year. e-commerce net sales were $31.2 million, a decrease of $6.1 million or 16.4%, compared to $37.3 million last year. e-com net sales represented 18.5% of total net sales both this year and last year. we ended the second quarter with 242 total stores, a net increase of two stores since the end of last year's second quarter.
for additional perspective, our comparable net sales for the second quarter decreased by 0.6% relative to the pre-pandemic second quarter of fiscal 2019 despite starting the quarter at high-single-digits on a percentage basis in may, which we believe is another indication of the impacts that inflation had on our customers. gross profit, including buying, distribution, and occupancy expenses was $52 million or 30.9% of net sales, compared to $74.7 million or a then company record of 37% of net sales last year. buying, distribution, and occupancy costs deleveraged by 330 basis points collectively despite being reduced by $0.9 million in due to carrying these costs against a significantly lower level of net sales this year. product margins declined by 280 basis points, primarily due to an increased and more normalized markdown rate compared to last year when full price selling was at record levels.
product margins were down 100 basis points compared to the pre-pandemic second quarter fiscal 2019. total sg&a expenses were $46.8 million or 27.8% of net sales, compared to $48.3 million or 23.9% of net sales last year. the $1.5 million reduction in sg&a dollars was primarily attributable to the absence of any corporate bonus accrual this year compared to $2.8 million included in last year's sg&a and a $0.7 million reduction in e-com marketing expenses this year. partially offsetting these expense reductions were less significant increases in each of our store payroll and related benefits, technology services, e-com fulfillment, and insurance expenses.
our store teams did a great job managing their labor use to average lower hours per store compared to last year, but this was more than offset by a nearly 9% average hourly wage rate increase. operating income was $5.2 million or 3.1% of net sales, compared to a company's second quarter record of $26.4 million or 13.1% of net sales last year. income tax expense was $1.5 million or 28.4% of pre-tax income, compared to $5.9 million or 22.5% of pre-tax income last year. the increase in effective income tax rate was primarily due to discrete tax impacts related to stock-based compensation.
net income was $3.8 million or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to a company's second quarter record of $20.4 million in net income and an all-time quarterly record of $0.66 per diluted share last year. weighted average shares were $30.2 million this year, compared to $31.1 million last year. turning to our balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with total cash and marketable securities of $116.4 million and no debt outstanding. this compared to $148.5 million at the end of the second quarter last year also with no debt outstanding.
since the end of last year's second quarter, we paid special cash dividends to stockholders of $30.9 million in december 2021 and repurchased 987,000 shares of our common stock for a total of $9 million this year. we have just over 1 million shares remaining under our share repurchase authorization, which expires in march 2023. we ended the second quarter with inventories cost of 4.1% per square foot, a significant improvement from being at 12.7% at the end of the first quarter. new inventories were down 1.1% per square foot relative to last year.
as we continue to contend with inconsistent product flows resulting from ongoing supply chain challenges, our goal remains to continue rightsizing our inventories relative to sales performance and anticipated sales trends, while continuing to maintain product margins that are reasonably consistent with our pre-pandemic performance as we've been doing thus far this years. total capital expenditures for the first half were $6.9 million, compared to $8.5 million last year, the decrease being primarily due to earlier new store openings last year. for fiscal 2022 as a whole, we currently expect our total capital expenditures to be in the range of $22 million to $24 million. turning to the third quarter of fiscal 2022, based on our quarter-to-date net sales results and current historical trends, and anticipating some deceleration in the latter half of the quarter as ed noted earlier, we currently expect our total net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 to be in the range of approximately $165 million to $170 million, sg&a to be approximately $46 million to $47 million, operating income to the range of approximately $1.9 million to $4.6 million, our estimated income tax rate to be approximately 27% and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $0.05 to $0.11 based on estimated weighted average diluted shares of approximately $30.2 million.
this compares to a company quarterly record of $206.1 million in net sales and record earnings per diluted share of $0.66 for the third quarter last year, which exceeded the previous company record for third quarter earnings per share by $0.30. we expect to have 247 total stores opened at the end of the third quarter, a net increase of four from 243 total stores at the end of last year's third quarter. operator, we'll now go to our q&a session.

thank you, sir. [operator instructions]. our first question comes from the line of jeff van sinderen, b. riley.
please proceed with your question.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley financial -- analyst
yes. hi, everybody. so, first let me say, really good work getting inventories, your overall inventory down. kudos on that.
i have a multi-part question here if you can bear with me. but given the pace of sales and ongoing supply chain challenges that i think most folks are experiencing, how far do you believe that you are from what in your eyes would be an optimal inventory level? and then, maybe you can speak more to kind of how you are of managing and planning inventory for the remainder of the year, any sort of excess current inventory that you have what that consists of? and then, any areas of merchandize assortment where supply chain remains disruptive and maybe just touch on planned holiday inventory receipt period and stability to adjust, make cancellations reorders around holiday. a lot there i realized.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
hi, jeff. i would say the inventory levels right now are pretty close optimum i think to -- there are where we want to be and as you have seen from other retailers' report to be up single-digits, low-single-digits and inventory is total credit to the whole team here who worked very hard to get it to that number, but also the big challenges make sure that when you adjust to that number there you get the right mix. there is a couple of categories of brands that we wish we had a more inventory in. but overall i think going into holiday at least from what we can see right now, most of the supply chain challenges are behind us will -- i am sure we'll have a few, but i feel pretty good in terms of where we are having an -- we are taking a pretty conservative approach to q4 for inventory but i would expect that we'll be able to manage it within a reasonable number for sure.

yes, jeff, i'd add. i think we expect our overall inventory level to be reduced to some extent by the time we have finished the third quarter here and certainly expect to enter fiscal 2023 at the end of the fourth quarter with reduced overall inventory value. the challenge, as we talk about these supply chain disruptions and delays is, you have certain things that are four to six to eight weeks late but you still want them as a key part of your assortment you've taken in regardless of where the quarter in line is and so we have some of those kinds of distortions that are negatively impacting what would be our normal behavior and performance in what i'll call normalized times and obviously nothing at all over the last two and a half years has anything like i'd call normalized times going from the pandemic shutdown at 2020 to the incredible break out recovery year last year and now into this highly inflationary environment that we haven't seen in 40 years. we just in -- back and forth over the last couple of years and i think the team has done an outstanding job adapting as best we can at any moment and time.
we've been carefully making real-time decisions about what to cancel. we do tend to have cancellation rights if deliveries are meaningfully late past their original swan delivery days. so we've been taking advantage of those situations, making returns in certain other situations and you got also trying to protect, ed mentioned that we feel good about our holiday assortment while make sure we have good ammo to go into the black friday weekend, as well from a merchandizing standpoint. so it's a constant balancing act.
we've discussed it multiple times a week, every single week just because things change that rapidly, but again we both feel like the team has just turned yeoman's work at just trying to keep us as under control as we can under extremely difficult circumstances.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley financial -- analyst
ok, good. and then, i -- just as a follow-up wanted to touch on -- i just -- if you could speak a little more about how you are handling and planning your own promotional levels? obviously, the environment is extraordinarily promotional out there. just any thoughts around that.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
well, one thing as you know, we have been pretty disciplined as the company have not being overly promotional and not getting into the promotion of dame. and that's the whole reason for why -- that's one of the main reasons why we control, do such a good job of controlling inventory of goods. we don't want to have to promote our way out of it. i don't think promotions are driving business for many week hours right now.
honestly, i think it's challenging no matter where they are promotional or not. certain categories turn back-to-school that seems more promotional others was denim. and how long bottom business has actually been pretty good, denim not so great. but we've been able to avoid any unusual promotions and we would expect that to continue through the balance of the year.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, corporate secretary
yes, we are being very surgical about what we need to move to address any problem areas and thankfully we don't have the size of inventory increase relative to almost anyone else i've seen report so far. i had looked at over a couple dozen different companies. there is a lot of really high inventory percentage increases year-over-year out there and thankfully we are one of the very smallest.
jeff van sinderen -- b. riley financial -- analyst
ok. that's all helpful and say, thanks for taking my questions and best of luck as the remainder of the quarter plays out.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, corporate secretary
thanks.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, jeff.

and our next question comes from the line of mitch kummetz with seaport research. please proceed with your question.
mitch kummetz -- seaport research partners -- analyst
yes, thanks for taking my questions. mike, just starting with a housekeeping question, you gave a comp on a year-over-year and also a three year. do you happen to know august sales year-over-year and also august sales to increase or decrease versus three years ago, do you happen to have that?
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, corporate secretary
we gave the august comp through august 30, down 10.6% to last year.
mitch kummetz -- seaport research partners -- analyst
do you have the sales number though? you have the comp, but do you have the sales on a year-over-year and also on a three year?
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, corporate secretary
i don't have specific sales through to a specific date, no.
mitch kummetz -- seaport research partners -- analyst
ok. i was trying to back and do what sort of implied sales you need for the balance of the quarter to get to your range. do you happen to have that?
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, corporate secretary
yes, we are -- i can tell you that raw sales, keep in mind, we are in the very first week of fiscal september. so the books are being closed as we speak. so we don't have final sales numbers for august yet. but at least raw point of sales, raw point of sales plus e-com we did $88 million of sales in august in pre-pandemic years august represented just over 50% of the quarter.
obviously, none of those years have highly inflationary environment and did not have the god of inventory that is in somewhat in place that we have today. we are contemplating a slowdown as we mentioned. our earliest back to school stores have declined by more than 20% here recently. so that gives us some pause about the level of fall off from that business inflationary environment that we could be facing.
and then you think about last year's october, which was historically unusual and how large it was as a percentage of the quarter. it was i think that 25% of total third quarter sales, it's never been that high in any pre-pandemic year. so, we certainly feel like there was a pull forward of holiday shopping last year and middle of the noise and concerns about supply chain difficulties and we had third quarter sales that were higher than our fourth quarter sales. that's never happened in our history.
so, we are expecting a lot more challenges in the back half of this quarter. however, the flip side of that, the positive of that should indicate that we'll have a better performance trend in the fourth quarter assuming that normalized holiday shopping patterns return. so that pull forward happened last year moving that back into the fourth quarter this year should mean that we won't be quite as negative as we were in the second quarter or as we were anticipating being for the third quarter. september and october were even tougher compares than august was last year as it relates to fiscal 2019 in particular.
so we do expect the remainder of this quarter to be tough, but this should mean that we have an opportunity to have better performance in the fourth quarter.
mitch kummetz -- seaport research partners -- analyst
ok. just to clarify your comments, i know you are not giving q4 guidance, but it's something like you expect q4 to be the less negative. that sort of my take away from what you just said, i don't know if that's accurate.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, corporate secretary
yes, that's right. last year, every quarter set records for quarterly sales and records for gross margin rates unlike anything we've seen in our prior history. so, i think, i do believe total sales in the fourth quarter will still be below last year's fourth quarter, but it should be less negative. i think the consensus number coming into this call for the fourth quarter was in the high 180s, i think somewhere in the 180s is a reasonable number to look at it this early date.
assuming there isn't some other leg down economically or with consumer spending or something of that nature. i think that number is probably fair for the fourth quarter. i think the prelim numbers for q4, i think the consensus for sg&a is too light and i think the gross margin rate is too high. we've been tracking fairly close to 2019 gross margin rate.
so if i'd adjust anything for fourth quarter at this point, i'd suggest that the consensus margin rate is too high above fiscal 2019 than what we would reasonably expect.
mitch kummetz -- seaport research partners -- analyst
ok. and then on the inventory, you mentioned, the improvement that you've seen going from last quarter, this quarter on a per store basis, ed you mentioned though that swim was particularly weak. so i guess my question is, within your quarter end inventory, i mean, is there really any seasonal excess or were you able to clear that through in the quarter itself?
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
the inventory is very, very clean. so, we ended the quarter in good shape by category. there is always going to be some pockets here and there and there are. but that we might be -- but we are in pretty good shape.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, corporate secretary
yes, we are very disciplined in every single quarter. from an ageing perspective, we always approve for any and all aged goods, to be honest certain age and below a certain inventory turn rate that has been our consistent discipline for ever and ever anything where we see that kind of risk we have through to that at this point.
mitch kummetz -- seaport research partners -- analyst
ok. and then, last question, i know that store labor has been a pressure point. do you have -- mike, do you have any sense as to what store labor -- the increase for this quarter is versus three years ago or from a margin standpoint how much basis point pressure this quarter versus three years ago?
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, corporate secretary
yes, on a hourly rate basis, we did an analysis of our payroll usage just to evaluate and are we being as tight as we can on an hours basis. and as i said in our prepared remarks, our teams did a really good job managing to average -- lower average number of hours per store, 7% reduction versus last year and versus fiscal 2019. the challenge has been the rate increase from last year was up 9% versus three years ago it was up 19%. so, it's gone up considerably and a lot of that has to do with california.
we are at $15 already here and we've been absorbing dollar a year increases for several years. so you think about roughly 100 of our stores are in california. they are all at a minimum of 15. three years ago, that was 12 and so that's --
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
yes, and i don't see that changing anytime soon. it's -- we are still not out of the woods in terms of the challenges of labor rate increases and availability of labor but the team has done a good job of managing through it.
mitch kummetz -- seaport research partners -- analyst
ok. alright. thanks guys. best of luck.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, mitch.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of matt koranda with roth capital. please proceed with your question.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
yes. so just wanted to put a finer point on the sort of the deceleration that's embedded in the comp guide for the rest of the quarter here. it sounds like you guys are saying it's really a comp issue more than anything and not necessarily some sort of incremental weakness you observe toward the end of august or anything like that?
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, corporate secretary
in my opinion, what we are seeing is, once the need-based period of back-to-school is finished, the stores are really dropping off and i think that for our customer base, i think inflation is having a meaningful impact. as we look back at the second quarter and the cadence of that supposedly june and july were our easier compares, our worst comp of the quarter was in june. we were at minus 17. june was minus 20 with the final week of june being down 25 and then july got a little bit better for the first two weeks and then quite a bit better at the back-to-school season started.
as we went from basically minus 16%, 17% in the first half of july to a minus 11 and then negative single-digits. the first two weeks of august were then negative single-digits and on the latter half of august when most of our stores had finished their back-to-school, we started seeing drop offs down into -- we were 13% down in week three, 16% in week four and we are down more than that here in the first week of september and again, with that very first group of stores i mentioned in response to one of the questions, we seen that erode to a minus 20%. so, we are trying to stick with that.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
our fiscal dates vary significantly by geography but we've seen enough now to be able to relatively accurately forecast.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
got it. is that the regional and demographic difference in terms of that drop off like the store is any different, i guess, demographically or if there is something --
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
it's pretty consistent throughout the country.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. ok. that's helpful guys. and then just maybe a finer point on merchandise margin trends in the third quarter.
obviously, everyone is well aware of the promotional environment across the board is very tough. your inventory is super clean. that's a great positive point. but maybe just talk about what's embedded in the operating profit guide for the finer point on merch margins for us.
any incremental item when that we are expecting and embedding in the guide here or is it relatively similar to 2q?
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, corporate secretary
it's relatively similar to q2. it's really pure dollars getting added in from the fact that we are-sequentially from q2, q3 we are adding five stores going from 242 to 247 and then we also had two stores opened in the latter half of july. so you'll have a full quarter of expense for those two stores. when you think about occupancy which isn't just rents, it's also the utilities and supplies and business license, property taxes and all the things that go into occupancy plus the distribution expenses that go with those.
so, sequentially from q2 to q3 as a result of those five new store openings during the quarter plus the two very late q2 openings, we are going to add almost $2 million in combination of distribution and occupancy expenses in the third quarter that were not there in the second quarter while we are expecting a similar rate of sales and a similar rate of sg&a. so it's pretty directly that movement.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. that makes sense. and then, i just wanted to make sure i understood sort of the inventory cadence for the rest of the year and the expectation there. it sounds to me, mike, and i don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like sequentially it should be down -- each successive quarter it's down sequentially in the third quarter and then down again sequentially in the fourth quarter.
but i guess a lot of -- inventory receipts volumes on demand and the environment, but maybe just speak to that if you could?
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, corporate secretary
yes. that is our internal plan looking at our currently anticipated timing of receipts which i think i will remind you does change every single week things move that are supposed to arrive this week and next week and end up being some number of weeks late. so, the team adapts as best they can but with the current visibility we have, what we know as of today in terms of expected sales, receipt flows, planned markdowns, we are anticipating being in a negative inventory position by the time we finish third quarter and would expect that also to be the case as we finish fourth quarter.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. excellent. maybe just last on -- it looks like, you guys are willing to sort of buy back shares at an average of $9 a share, i just did a rough math in terms of the calculations here. and the stock now in the low $7.
it just seems like the logical inclusion here that we should have is that you'd be more willing to transact on the buy back versus special dividends at the moment but any thoughts you'd like to point on that front will be helpful.
mike henry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, corporate secretary
that's a fair assumption. we've been pretty strategic about it as we saw our business slowing down in second quarter, we, unfortunately had the four thought that ok, we've completed almost half of the buyback at an average price that was $9.10 and given what we are seeing, it's likely that the stock could probably go down based on how things are slowing down. so we did pause for a little bit. i wouldn't be surprised if we took some opportunistic situations to get back into that program.
matt koranda -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. makes perfect sense. appreciate all the time, guys. thanks.
ed thomas -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
