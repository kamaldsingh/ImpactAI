thank you. [operator instructions]. our first question comes from the line of vivien azer with cowen.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi, how are you?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
good afternoon, vivien.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
good afternoon. so my question has to do with the competitive dynamic in the adult-use market in canada. so well understood, covid shutdowns, all of the store opening delays all challenging for you and your peers, to be sure. and then uniquely, perhaps a little bit more for you guys, the comp issue in terms of the 2.0 rollout.
so i think a lot of peers were doing that and the introduction of daily special. all of that aside, though, you know, there's a difference between revenue declines and changes in the market share. and so i'm curious to understand, miguel, is your perspective on the competitive landscape. because it looks like in the high buyer data, which obviously doesn't include quebec, you know, there was sequential degradation in your market share.
and when i look at kind of the top operators in aggregate, you know, this year versus last year, it just seems like across the board, it is smaller operators that are picking up share, presumably later entrants into the market. so kind of how are you thinking about the balance of benefits of being the first mover versus the way you have to compete against smaller second movers who are displacing market share? long-winded question but thank you.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
great. well, it's a great question. let me just address the sort of macro issues that everybody faces because i think it's, you know, covid is the sort of the top-line answer. but i think everyone else has to understand this, you had the provinces, which act as wholesalers making massive cuts to their days on hand as they reacted.
so that's sort of a one-time impact, we're talking about seven and eight-figure pieces. we also seeing provinces that had a massive reduction in terms of new skus that they allowed to be brought to the market. so just to say that, you know, curbside delivery and store are not opening, that's only a portion of the revenue story. and i would say, you know, that is a bit of timing in a lot of good ways.
now, moving to your question about market dynamics, let me take it in two directions. so first and foremost, it is a very dilutive market compared to what i'm used to and maybe what you're used to where you have the top five lps controlling 80%, 90% of a given category. you don't see that in the cannabis business in canada today. so that's first.
you may see top five companies representing 40% maybe 45% of the key category dried flower, pre-roll vape, you know, things like that. secondly, as everyone well knows, market share in isolation is really not a good bellwether. you're seeing a lot of market share picked up by value products and deep discount products, and those margins are way lower than what we're seeing from a premium standpoint. i would say that you're starting to see the early days of premium products start to take hold, we've seen it a little bit, you've also seen some others, you're also really seeing an acceleration of gen two and gen three products in canada.
so if you look over the last 12 months, flower might be up 30% to 40%. if you look at everything else it might be up to three times that. and i think everyone understands that there was a delay in the canadian market with those gen two and gen three products. so when you think about concentrates and vapor and pre-rolls, those are going to have higher margins regardless of that.
lastly, you know, i think a lot of these competitive dynamics are a bit temporary variances as you've seen a glut of what i would describe as, you know, low-cost flowers in the market and that's causing some irrational pricing. i do believe having talked to the provinces, and talking to retailers, there is an interest in holding margins up and people actually making money.maybe it's taking a little bit longer than people would have wanted because of, you know, just the situation wherein with covid. and then i guess lastly, i don't mean to be disrespectful with your question about our market share, i think to be brutally honest, it's taking a little bit longer than i would hope. and so let me talk a little bit about that.
we had to make, you know, as glen mentioned and i talked a bit about massive changes to the quality of our products. and unlike other cpg items, you can't just snap your fingers and flush wholesale, flush retail, so we had to do the provision we saw at 3.2. it takes a while to get that out of retail and you get that in the system. but i think the changes that we've made across the board on potency and with new items are encouraging.
i think gnd and retail coverage is really a no -- not talked about a lot. just as one data point for you -- from our data we see that the no. 1 sku, which i won't say what it is in canada in terms of in-stock is around 60%. so that one sku is only 60% of the stores.
that's an abysmally low number in any sort of traditional cpg. we think someone like gnd that can make three times the number of calls for us, has great data systems as national coverage will be really strong on the blocking tackling. so while we're not -- i'm not happy with the timing of it, you know, we're doubling to see improvements but that really goes to the strength of the other parts of our business, which are way steadier and had way last compression and provide a lot of opportunities.

your next question comes from the line of pablo zuanic with cantor fitzgerald. please proceed with your question.
pablo zuanic -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
good afternoon, everyone. miguel, can i just ask -- maybe following up on the last question. talk about the relationships of aurora with the boards and with the consumer. because of all these issues, how those relationships have been hurt with the boards, with the retailers? and what about the brands? you know, have the brands suffered in -- as a result of what's going on? and i'm asking that in the context of a company that's losing share, right? if you can comment on that.
thanks.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
pablo, when you mean the boards, you mean the provincial boards?
pablo zuanic -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
yep, yep, yeah. so this is like three parties to a story, right? your relationship with the board, your relationship with the retailers, the stores, and then, you know, the relationship with the consumer and consumer brands. because what i -- i'm surprised is that we feel these new little companies being able to list new skus with the boards at the time that they are cutting skus, right? so it just makes you wonder. thanks.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
ok, you are very welcome. so let me see if i can take those in three parts. so obviously, the provincial boards operate as the wholesaler. i would say they are evolving, and i've got a tremendous amount of respect for the provincial boards.
i mean, remember, this thing is only three years old. they're trying to do everything they're trying to do in the midst of covid. and so i think, pablo, we have a good relationship with them. i think in all cases, you always can have it be better.
they really don't play favorites. so whether you're a small manufacturer, a large manufacturer, you have the same opportunity. now what is evolving, which i think will benefit a company like aurora, particularly with my background, is you're now seeing very sort of sophisticated cpg. and in many cases, the decision-makers are coming from, you know, the beverage side.
so scoring manufacturers on fill rates, in-stock conditions, shipping provisions. you know, all of those core things are going to start to make a difference in terms of what skus they take, how they fill them, how are those put out to the retailers. and we're spending a lot of time and effort on that. so i know right now, it just seems like a free for all in terms of everybody's treated the same.
i think that's definitely changing. also, we are hearing from the provincial boards that they are concerned about price compression and starting to put some floors in on key segments, whether that's a 3.5-gram flower or a 28 gram, i think that also benefits bigger pieces. now in terms of the retailers, it's an interesting market. i'm used to, i think, most are a chain business, a significant amount of chain or centrally controlled stores.
and we don't have that today in canada, albeit there are, you know, some smaller chains out there, say, that may number 80 to 100, which is not insignificant. and they are also becoming more sophisticated, which is raising the overall game for us. i think gnd gives us an advantage because of the importance in call coverage, particularly post covid. and we're developing, you know, a series of connected events.
now there is a ban on inducements, which you well know that restricts a manufacturer from, say, a traditional cpg alignment program. but again, they're looking for profitability. and when i mentioned before that the no. 1 sku in the country is only 60% in stock, there's a ton of upside to blocking and tackling, why -- which is why we've made significant investments in our retail infrastructure.
and so i think that's all going to evolve and be in a better place. and i think lastly, your point to the consumers is an important one. you know, today, we really had to step up our game in terms of quality. i will say, though, unlike other mature categories that you all folks cover, we're seeing, say, in the flower business 200 basis points, 300 basis points swing in a week.
we're seeing in vapor 400 basis points. so the consumer is moving around and is respecting quality and value in terms of what they get, as well as innovation. and we are seeing a significant amount of receptivity to new items like concentrates and hash and rosins and resins. and that, i think, will benefit a company like aurora that's made significant investments there.
so you know, i think in aggregate, what you're seeing here is not going to be the future state. i would expect that you'd start to see more traditional trends where the top five lps in the category do 60%, 70%, you're seeing in stocks in the 80s and 90s, you're seeing national execution, and you're seeing a more consistent brand experience, even though there'll always be a place for a regional brand. i just don't think it's at the level it's at today.

your next question comes from the line of david kideckel with atb capital markets. please proceed with your question.
frederico gomes
hi, guys. this is actually frederico chiming in for dave. thanks for taking my question. so we've seen m&a activity has really taken off here in canada.
i am just wondering how do you guys see that environment? what's your game plan there, are you looking at anything m&a-wise in canada, or maybe do you have other plans then? so that's not in the u.s., i mean, specifically for canada.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
so frederico, it's an interesting question. obviously, there have been some notable acquisitions of late. i think what i -- the way i would describe it is this, without giving any specific details. we don't see anything in canada that we got to have.
given the dynamic nature of market share buying or renting a market share, i think right now, is not a great play in canada. now that being said, if we saw something that was accretive, a technology, a management team, or something that was in a category that we didn't need, then maybe it would be of interest. i think, as many of you know, aurora is -- was on an absolute tear in terms of acquisition in the early days. and so whether it's in india as a lab or coasting call marks in terms of ip and technology or manufacturing, we got plenty of infrastructures and have plenty of acquisitions in order to fill it out.
i think given our strength in medical and international medical and with a little bit of softness in rec, we're going to focus in there, but i don't think you're going to see us chase in canada in order to, what i would really describe as renting a market share, unless there was a systemic or a sustainable reason in order to add that to the portfolio. clearly, if we needed to do it through the 525 million, with the 300 million atm, we'd be in a position to do it if we saw it. so that's how i would describe it, frederico.

your next question comes from the line of michael lavery with piper sandler. please proceed with your question.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
good afternoon, michael.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
you laid out some good color on the cost savings initiatives that you've got mapped out. and i guess i just want to maybe make sure i understand how you think about that in terms of gross versus net. and by that, i mean, you also touched on some things like the high-touch approach on the medical side. it sounds like increasingly so.
and you know, some of the things like hand trim. should we expect a 60% to 80% net number to flow through? or is there going to be some, i guess, maybe reinvestment that, that will fund as well?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
i would tell you, michael, we feel confident that we're going to be able to deliver that 60 million to 80 million in straight up in efficiencies. i mean, if you sort of unpack that, we've got the nordic facility that we talked about in the past. you know, it is now producing eu gmp products for europe and for israel, so that creates some redundancies. we've seen some efficiencies in our current business.
obviously, rightsizing the overall infrastructure for the business we have today as well as a little bit going forward, it means we have redundancies and efficiencies. so i would say, from my point of view, the company has had a strong track record of when they say they're going to see straight-up savings. and i expect this to be no different. and it's my expectation that we'll deliver the 60 to 80 in that 18-month period.
and with that, as you know, we don't need to grow our way into ebitda neutral or have to have see anything happen on the margin. so i'd take it as is. did that answer your question, michael?

your next question comes from the line of heather balsky with bank of america. please proceed with your question.
heather balsky -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, thank you for taking my question. i'm curious about your thoughts around your balance sheet and cash and also the comment in your press release about your cost savings getting you, i guess, moving the cash flow metric in a positive direction. i guess, how are you thinking about the timing of getting to cash flow positive in this environment, maybe if the environment improves? and also, how do you feel about the cash on your balance sheet, especially as we hopefully inch closer to federal negotiation in the u.s.?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
glen, you want to take that one up?
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
yep. thanks, heather. so listen, yeah, a few things to unpack there. certainly, what miguel outlined in terms of operational cost savings, we think, is a big part of that.
if we look at q3 and we look where the cash was consumed, there was some still being consumed in operations. so we're not there yet on operations but we believe that if we can achieve these cost savings, and so that equates to maybe $15 million to $20 million a quarter, and you think of our ebitda at minus 16 or 17 this quarter. that gets a long way toward your positive cash flow from operations. working capital, there is a bit of an anomaly this quarter, with the $24 million receivable that we collected just in april.
so let's just say we collected that during the course of march, we would have seen the single-digit investment in working capital. so we think with production and demand roughly aligns that, our working capital should kind of stabilize and start to even out a little bit. so let's just say, long term, will be a little bit of investment in working capital as we grow but we think we've got that well under control and certainly as we manage our inventory tightly now that should be fine. and finally our capex, piece of this.
you know, we talked about how much we've reduced that, i mean as we -- i know you are relatively new to our store but you've done your homework. you know what we were spending on capex a year ago. you know where we're at now, and we think we've got one or two of our projects complete. so even going forward there, we spent 40 million bucks over -- we're on track to spend 40 million bucks this fiscal year.
and i don't see us -- that's the top end for next year of that. so you know, the pieces are in place, and really, what we want to do is execute on these cost reductions in operations and the sg&a just in the way that miguel described it over the next number of quarters, to make sure that we've got a plan to get us there without having to depend on revenue growth. and when we say that, by no means do we want to impart that we don't expect revenue growth? absolutely. our international medical business continues to thrive, plans in canadian medical to grow, as miguel outlined.
and we believe that we've put the pieces in place to get consumers back on track. so we do expect growth, but we want to make sure that we pull the levers as we've talked about in the past, to get us to at least a breakeven on ebitda and cash flow without depending on that growth. so presumably, when the growth shows up, it shows up as incremental earnings and cash flow. so that's the plan, that's how we think about how we're going to get there over the next 12 to 18 months on the back of continued rationalization of costs and then picking up additional cash flows as we see growth.
thanks.

your next question comes from the line of matt mcginley with needham and company. please proceed with your question.
matt mcginley -- needham & company -- analyst
thank you. my question is on what changes about the financial performance in the fourth quarter versus the third. growth in the consumer business seems pretty contingent upon covid disruptions normalizing, but you'd only have about one and half months to make up for any lost ground before the quarter ends. and obviously, the rationalization won't really have an impact, i think, on the fourth quarter.
so should we expect improvements in the fourth quarter? or should we think of this more as like 2022 before we would expect to see improvements?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
glen, do you want to take that?
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
yep.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
no, i guess, here's what i'd say on that. you know, we're -- on the rec side, the trends are what the trends are, but we also have positive trends on different sides of the business. i don't want to get ahead and give guidance in the midst of the quarter. i think you sort of heard what we're saying.
there are other pieces that also are steady. there are other pieces on the cost side. so i'm sorry, i can't give you the exact answer you want, but i think when you look at the aggregate of where the business was going from the point in time in which we laid out for you, plus some other pieces there, you know, i think that sort of is what it is. it's hard, you know, when i talk about the provinces making a change of eight figures on pos i really don't want to get ahead of myself in terms of what happens on that side of it.
and then on the medical and the international side, those trends have been pretty steady. so i think i'd put -- sort of leave it there. glen, anything you want to add to that?
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
no, that's fine. we don't -- we recognize, as you just described, the consumer market there. we're doing what we can but there are things that are kind of dynamic to the market right now. and we've seen, over the last day in our quarter, that the provinces are adjusting on the fly as well.
so we'll focus on the plan we've laid out, which is over the next number of quarters, and continue to just look for improvement each quarter.
operator
your next question comes from the line of tamy chen with bmo capital markets. please proceed with your question.
tamy chen -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi, thanks for the question. miguel, i wanted to ask a bit more on the production pivot and all the changes you've made at sky. so if we just move aside all the covid headwinds because i think that's pretty been well highlighted and that definitely made things very difficult for you guys on the premium pivot strategy. so if we just move that to the side here, could you speak a bit to the consistency now at which sky can produce that high-quality flower? because one of the things we keep hearing, covid headwinds aside, is that in the market right now, there's a lot of the average quality stuff, but there's not enough of the high-quality stuff.
and i just would have thought that, that sort of dynamic, once again, covid aside, would have been that perfect sort of opportunity for your strategy of trying to tackle that apparent whitespace. so can you talk a bit about the production consistency? because i'm also just thinking about your ability right to tackle that whitespace and also the implications on inventory, possible impairment going forward. i know you did the big inventory writedown this quarter, but i really want to understand the level of consistency you can hit in terms of the higher potency and all the thresholds that are required for a premium flower? thanks.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
sure. it's a great question, tamy. so you know, let me go back a little bit. first and foremost, a year ago, the market was one in which you could have sold 16%, 16.5% potency with a low two-level terp, bud quality, moisture, other aspects on quality were not that as important.
and at that time, as everybody knows, sky was hammering out a lot of products. some of that was for daily special, some of that was for some other things. and the consumer, as is in the case in every other market, has moved really quickly. today, as an example, if you look at the wholesale market, you can access 19 potency products, maybe 20 potency products, anything above that is really hard to buy-in.
and you can sell all day long, 22, 23 potency products in the retail market. it is a hard thing to make. if it was easy, everybody will be making it, the flower market and pricing would be great, but it's a hard thing to do. so we have to pivot sky.
now, i'll talk to you about sky in one second but i don't want anyone to lose sight of the fact that we also have other really consistent, high-quality manufacturing facilities, river, ridge, whistler, the organic in-soil production facility in the west coast in d.c., and they've been very consistent. and so tamy, to your question about sky, we've been working on sky. as you know, we announced, we took it down to 25%, and it is a, you know, still working through it. some of the early reads coming out of there are encouraging, but you have to be able to cycle through and be able to see the totality of what you're going to get out of sky.
and to glen's point, it was painful in order to apply those fixed costs across the whole system to ascertain what we can get. we're close to understanding what we have with sky. the good news for us, though, is we have redundancies in our overall infrastructure. and now that we have nordic, we don't need to produce eu gmp domestically in canada.
so we have options regardless of what happens with that sky project. in order to deliver 22, 23 potency products that is enough retail value. and importantly, at a cost structure, that is rightsized for the environment that we're in. so i think, you know, a little bit to follow on that, we expect to give you an update coming soon.
but either way it goes, it's not like we don't have an option because of the historical production at river, ridge, and whistler, which are not at 100% in terms of their overall utilization. and that's why when we talk about, you know, aspects of the redundancy, that's not the only one, but it is one of them.
operator
your next question comes from the line of john zamparo with cibc. please proceed with your question.
john zamparo -- cibc -- analyst
thanks. good evening. miguel, i wanted to follow up on a comment you made -- you referenced competitors' sku and what percent of retail is that. i'm not sure if this is a number you have handy or are willing to share.
and if not, maybe you can just talk directionally. but i'm curious about how you look at your distribution and how many stores you're in countrywide and how that's trended over the past, let's say, year or a couple of quarters? thank you.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
so, john, i come from a world of incredible analytics. our 242,000 stores, i get wholesale -- i mean i had wholesale shipments weekly by sku, both my business and competitive business. i had in-stock conditions, i had retail takeaway. we had it all.
in canada, that information is just starting to come online. you see it with some of the retail information, the provinces are starting to get there. it was one of the core reasons why we went with great north and their significant crm systems. so what we are now -- and you can imagine, you can't just snap your fingers and get it.
we are visiting the roughly 1,540 or 1,600 stores that are open and are selling cannabis. we're visiting all of them on a monthly basis. we'll visit the higher volume stores, which account from anywhere between 70% to 75% of the business twice a month, and we're starting to gather the following information, which i know is going to seem mundane and basic to all of you, but is the beginning blocks of where the cannabis industry is. first is overall distribution, say, most commonly sold 46 to 50 skus.
secondly is pricing, both wholesale to retail and retail to consumer. the third would be in-stock conditions, which in canada will come in two ways. one, what is authorized or listed, which potentially can go to the store. and then secondly, what is physically in the location.
and as you can imagine, with the speed, you know, that's why those weekly calls matter. and then, nice to have would be the timing of new brand launches and signage and share of space. so that information that i quoted to you is an internal piece of information and is not widely available because even the large chains who do have sophisticated data systems, that doesn't encompass the independence where a lot of business is done and therefore, the value of that overall retail takeaway data or crm data. so you know, i think there's a ton of upside in that as a manufacturer.
the other upside is for the retailers who, in many cases, are not having been in this business for a long time because they couldn't have. and so us providing category insights and profitability optimization for new stores and existing stores is a big opportunity. and i think all that, i'm sure, it sounds like the basics for any cpg company, but it's really where we're at. and i think it will be wildly additive for aurora as we leverage that data and insights with our retail and provincial partners, which suit the consumer needs.

your next question comes from the line of john chu with desjardins capital markets. please proceed with your question.
john chu -- desjardins capital markets -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. so maybe just talking on the canadian medical and the european market. you're doing really well on both those fronts. but i guess i find those two markets, maybe kind of small and just a little bit underwhelming at this point in time.
so can you just maybe give us a bit more color in terms of the market size, the market potential. i think the canadian med market is maybe about the 10th of that canadian rec market, if you can give me some indications otherwise? and then maybe just the outlook for europe because right now, just the growth we've seen so far has been pretty underwhelming. so maybe just talk about those two markets in general. thanks.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, john, it's the -- you know, i find it -- i understand exactly the sentiment, but i think if you have to look at the broader picture of medical, so we represent roughly 19% of the canadian medical business, as i mentioned our next closest is half that and there's a ton of upside. we also see a movement from unions and benefits and carriers. so we believe that there is an upside to medical.
the other part of medical is the margins are steady and really solid at 60%. internationally, it's a great business. and what we see is whether you're dealing with germany or france or the u.k., it's a really high bar to get into and there's a deep moat around it and there's a lot of expansion. i think the reason to be interested in medical would be probably threefold.
one is it's going to continue to grow, and the same people that are winning today are going to win tomorrow, and it is really significant from a margin standpoint. secondly is, you know, medical typically is the pathway forward on rec, and it is the same regulators, and if you have tremendous efficiencies in manufacturing, packaging, regulatory compliance, legal, all of those things. and so there are wonderful synergies in having a company that is strong, both on medical and rec. and i think the canadian quarter, this quarter is a great example.
if you were just a rec business in canada this quarter, you would have gotten hammered because of the overall macro environment. medical didn't see that, what happened in rec. and lastly, i really believe that the first steps we're going to see in the u.s. is going to be medical, and i also think it's going to be at the federal level.
i just don't see a scenario where the federal government is not going to have a piece of this taxation revenue. i don't see a scenario where the fda says this is the one category we're not going to regulate and with all due respect to the msos, you have some really large multibillion-dollar global cpg companies that have made big bets that stand to gain from interstate commerce, highly regulated, all of those things. so i think medical doesn't get anywhere near the attention. it's not just because we do well at it, it's just all of those economics, and it is growing, and it is an important part of the rec story, whether it's today's synergies or tomorrow's new markets.
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
miguel, i'd like to add just a couple of things --
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
sure.
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
a follow on about the medical thing. just you're talking about market sizing. so let's -- canada, i would say, maybe 1% of the canadian population are medical cannabis consumers. in germany, it's one-tenth of that.
it's one-tenth of 1% of the german population are currently medical cannabis patients. and so as our leadership in germany would tell you there's 90% of the patients out there don't realize they're medical patients yet. and so it's our job is to go help them understand the benefits of medical cannabis because -- so you talked about growth opportunity, just simply getting the same sort of penetration we've got in canada, you know, we have ten-fold opportunity there. but more importantly, and when we focus myopically on revenue, we miss an important point, 60% margins, and i'll just kind of reiterate that, i don't see anybody in our industry delivering 60% margin.
so to me, 60% margin is worth twice the consumer dollars that somebody operating at 20% to 30% in the consumer market. so we shouldn't lose sight of that, you know, it's a massive part of our business. i think the growth opportunities are excellent. i think the ability to support a cash-generating business is excellent.
and for all the reasons that miguel said, it leads you into future opportunities. so i don't want to sort of leave it as a poor cousin to the rest of the business. it's an incredibly important part of the business. thanks.

miguel martin -- chief executive officer
thank you, ananth, and good afternoon. i'd like to start with some brief thoughts on the quarter including a discussion of our domestic international medical businesses. and then i'll address our plans for the near-term challenges in the canadian adult-use business. afterward, glen will provide our financial review.
finally, i'll talk more broadly about strategy. and while we believe that aurora is the largest canadian pure-play cannabis lp in the market has an incredible opportunity within the global cannabis space. i think it is clear from our results that aurora benefits greatly in how we built a diversified business across domestic medical, international medical, and adult-use recreational markets. this provides us with both stability and growth no matter how the global cannabinoids industry evolves.
first, let me say by talking about our domestic medical cannabis business, which is on very solid ground. we're number one by revenue in canada's medical market, which as you know, is the largest federally regulated medical market in the world. and our estimated market share is nearly double that of our next largest competitor. notably, our international medical business also thrived during the period, demonstrating sequential growth even as many of our peers experienced declines.
it should be mentioned that both of these units exhibited approximately 60% gross margins. the domestic medical business is unique as it represents a direct-to-patient distribution model that is powered by sophisticated technology infrastructure, allowing for an end-to-end patient experience. this infrastructure covers patient querying, onboarding, medical consultation straight through to prescription fulfillment. we are extremely proud of the investment in technology infrastructure we've made in the service to the medical patient base, and it provides a tangible barrier to entry to the medical channel.
in an adult-use environment, with low barriers entry, and provincial middlemen adding a layer of cost and complexity, the canadian medical channel's direct-to-patient model is a welcome, sustainable, high-margin diversification piece to aurora's business. we believe we offer the most expansive product selection and a carefully curated portfolio to ensure wide coverage of patient conditions and a variety of price points. under my leadership, aurora will maintain its focus on providing unparalleled professional counseling and guidance to patients looking for assistance in navigating medical cannabis alternative treatments. this high-touch approach to the medical channel is unique and is not easily replicated in the adult-use retail experience.
further, we continue our civic success, leveraging these core capabilities from canadian medical into our growing international medical platform. we sold medical cannabis in the 12 countries during this quarter and the number of countries exporting medical cannabis continues to grow. we've shown that we can take the expertise we gain in canadian medical and export that internationally. and we continue to believe that this expertise represents a key success factor for aurora as new countries look at launching medical cannabis regimes.
companies with success operating and federally regulated medical systems like those governed by health canada or the german health ministry are going to be an advantage for new markets open up to federal regulations, typically first for medical then for recreational adult use. it should not be overlooked by anyone that on april 28th, in response to a question from the journalist, the white house press secretary publicly confirmed that president biden supports legalizing medical cannabis. in a country like the united states and its federally regulated system, we fully expect the fda does significant influence in the federal medical cannabis program. and we think aurora is uniquely advanced when that happens.
we view our enviable positioning in medical cannabis as a tailwind that over time will translate into success on a global scale. taking this point one step further, as of march 31st, aurora was the second-largest trading lp in terms of global cannabis sales and a leader across multiple markets and segments. we have earned the credibility to pursue incremental m&a opportunities in canada, the united states, and around the world in support of shareholder value creation. still consistent with our peers the canadian consumer business presented challenges during the quarter.
in our view, these challenges were twofold. first, covid-related lockdowns and key problems have made it more difficult for consumers to access products at retail despite the curbside pickup and online ordering delivery is available options. additionally, covid slowed construction in opening a newly licensed store, which should have been expected. second, due to the volatile environment, all of the provincial distributors have become more attuned to managing their inventory to deliver returns, rationalizing our skus, and focusing on profitability per sku.
however, it's undeniable that there is this great retailer interest in having a more premium-focused assortment and therefore taking a more creative approach to the margin as it pertains to 2.0 products versus just low-cost flower. this of course plays well into our strategy even if it will take more time than previously thought. as we have seen in more mature markets a strategy that centers on product quality, innovation, and manufacturing excellence is the best path forward for the adult-use business. our ability to build traction will be more achievable once the current covid-related lockdowns ease and provincial retail inventories are better aligned with product demand.
still, we are not simply waiting for the process out in anticipation of normalization followed by an eventual rebound. instead, we are determined to continue pulling the levers that we can to reduce our cost structure and extract further efficiencies from our operations, and in doing so positioned ourselves for a sustainable cash flow generation. more specifically, we have identified an additional 60 million to 80 million in annualized savings that are targeted primarily at our production cost, facility, and logistic expenses, and to a lesser extent sg&a. these efficiencies are expected to be realized over the next 18 months.
and i'd like to remind you that our previous efficiency initiatives were delivered on time and provide more savings than originally expected. these identified efficiencies are incremental to the approximately 300 million in annual savings already realized and will enable us to meet our financial objectives while the canadian adult-use market normalizes, which may take a few quarters still. we anticipate that these expense reductions will not inhibit any of our strategic growth plans across our businesses or our current revenue opportunity but they will help to reduce our cash burn, solidify our margins, and enhance our overall financial flexibility. to assist in the execution of our corporate plan, we've also hired two highly skilled individuals in the areas of operations in hr, alex miller and lori schick to our team, as we announced this afternoon in our press release.
i'm not going to read their respective bios but i think it's clear that we believe lori and alex will have the requisite experiences and skillsets to positively impact all our business segments. to sum things up, our canadian international medical businesses are performing well and we maintain our confidence in the margin accretive issues we laid out in previous calls. ultimately, we have both the plan and ability to pursue profitable growth opportunities and creating a unique economic model that strikes the balance between where the industry is today and where it's going. this optimism is, of course, anchored by a healthy balance sheet that supports organic growth as well as m&a on an opportunistic basis.
both will position aurora for long-term shareholder value creation. before i turn the call over to glen, i want to address one more item. as many of you know, when aurora's founder stepped down in february 2020, michael singer stepped up and took over the reins as interim ceo, in addition to his continuing role as executive chairman. we all owe michael a huge debt of gratitude for his leadership during that time.
ron funk was the lead independent director over that period and has proven to be a consistent, reliable voice in the boardroom for years. michael would transition back to a more traditional board role and ron would move to independent chairman effective immediately. we look forward to oversight from both of these directors as well as the broader board as aurora continues to grow and expand. with that, i'll turn it over to glen.
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
thanks, miguel. good afternoon, everyone. please note that the figures i'll be reviewing are all in canadian dollars and can be found in the press release we issued this afternoon or in the q3 md&a and financial statements filed today on sedar and edgar. i would also note that the comparative period for analysis today is q3 2020.
we believe this represents the best measure of the company's transformation and improved performance. where appropriate, i will also note the sequential period comparatives. for the context regarding our q3 financial results, i'd like to take a moment to remind you of the plan we outlined to you in december 2020 and february of this year. last quarter we discussed a number of initiatives as part of the transformation of our consumer business.
we talked about a focus on higher-quality, higher-margin products so we reduced the sky production to 25% of its previous run rate to allow for process and cultivation changes to strengthen the flowers standards there. a bit later, miguel will speak about the success of sky so far. but for now, i'll say that we are greatly encouraged by the significant improvement in quality performance at sky and in fact, across all of our operations. the reduced run rate has resulted in the under absorption of certain overhead costs at sky, which then flow through to impact our cost of goods and gross margin in the quarter.
so although it hurts our gross margin in the short term, it's clearly the right long-term shareholder value creation decision. as the improved quality results that we're seeing from sky, it should allow that facility to truly perform as a gem in this industry. in addition to allowing for the transformation of sky into a higher-quality cannabis facility, we noted that the significant reduction in production volumes at sky would allow us to align our overall production levels with demand and we expected our sales to production ratio in q3 to be in the 90% range. in fact, in q3, despite the challenges of the consumer business, we sold 93% of what we produced.
we also discussed initiating targeted product returns in q3 in order to open sales channels to a premium product. we did this, replacing older, lower potency flowers and pre-rolls with the new standards that miguel will explain, including san rafael brands that deliver higher thc potency and a very nice terpene profile without exception. of course, the product swaps did result in the provision of a return of $3.2 million, which impacted our q3 net revenue and margin numbers. we also cleared all cannabis out of our network that did not meet the new specs for thc terpenes and quality aspects.
this action necessitated an inventory writedown that impacted our reported q3 gross margin before fair value adjustments by approximately $88 million. now all of these actions impact short-term reported revenue and gross margins but they provide a sturdy foundation to support higher margins and accelerating cash flows in the coming quarters. so now to actual q3 results, and i'll start with a few high-level comments. q3 2021 revenue demonstrated the importance of aurora's diversified cannabis business.
while the canadian consumer business was being repositioned to a higher standard, and aurora in the general consumer market faced covid and market development headwinds, our leading medical businesses in canada and europe continue to perform exceptionally well, delivering growth and high-margin revenues. in brief, our q3 net revenue, all of it from canada's businesses, was $58.4 million, excluding the product return provisions of $3.2 million. our medical cannabis segment continued to accelerate, generating $36.4 million in sales, and our consumer cannabis business delivered $21.3 million in net revenue prior to the return provisions. demonstrating the value of our diversified cannabis business, our overall average selling price for medical and consumer businesses combined rose to $5 per gram of dried flower, an increase of 8% year over year and 12% sequentially.
adjusted gross margin before fair value adjustments on cannabis net revenue remained strong at 44%, compared to 43% in the comparative quarter. excluding the short-term impacts of unabsorbed overheads at sky and return provisions and the wholesale clearout of low potency cannabis, our normalized q3 adjusted gross margin was 54%. sg&a remained low and well-controlled at $41.9 million, excluding restructuring. so now let me dig a bit deeper into our q3 financial results.
medical revenue was up 17% year over year, primarily because of the strong performance in our international medical business, which was up 134% year over year. and of course, from the continued resilience of our leading canadian medical business, which has delivered stable revenues even in the face of challenges from the opening of the consumer market. not only was medical revenue growth significant, but this segment also carries our highest margins, coming in at 59% in q3, and despite absorbing additional overheads from the reduced cost at sky. our broad european footprint continued to show its strength in the quarter, with germany delivering revenue up 64% compared to the prior year, and the u.k.
and poland, becoming aurora's second and third largest international medical markets, respectively. i should note that while we did not recognize sales in israel this quarter, we do expect further sales to israel to resume in the near term as this market develops. we've been selling in canadian and european medical markets for over 4 years and have seen little to no price compression, delivering over 60% of our revenues in q3 and with exceptional and resilient margins, it's clear that our medical business is a key differentiator for aurora and should be an important driver of future cash flow. looking now at our consumer business, aurora's q3 revenue was $21.3 million before return provisions.
this is down from q3 2020 as we work through the plan to reposition our consumer business and whether the covid headwinds that miguel described. consumer margins were 21%, compared to 28% in the prior year's comparative quarter. and this was mainly because of the company-initiated increase in product return provisions and also because of the under-absorbed overhead cost at sky. adjusting for just the return provisions, the q3 consumer gross margin would have been 33%.
thinking about the longer-term profile of gross margins in our consumer business. with the changes we've made to cultivation and processing techniques and the successful introduction of new immune cultivars coming from our breeding program in genetics bank, we can now produce a high-thc, high-terpene flower at sky without materially increasing the cost to produce that flower. so leaning hard into our expertise in science and cultivation to focus on premium power production, we expect to see the strengthening of our consumer margins over the next 12 to 18 months as we successfully pivot our consumer business to a greater proportion of the premium product. i should also note in the quarter that we did take the opportunity to clear out about 3,000 kilograms of low-potency flower at trim pricing.
this product was at risk of being written off so we elected instead to turn it into $760,000 in cash that did impact reported margins. now to sg&a, which includes r&d. we continue to operate at our targeted low $40 million range, coming in at $41.9 million in q3. this excludes approximately $3.2 million of employee and contract termination costs related to our business transformation.
although we continue to deliver on the run rate that we've previously targeted, as miguel noted, we see a path to further improvement over the coming quarters. so pulling all of this together, we generated an adjusted ebitda loss in q3 2021 at $16.7 million, and that's excluding revenue provisions for restructuring. this represents a continued improvement from the $44.6 million adjusted ebitda loss in the prior-year comparative but is a slightly larger loss than in the previous quarter. however, despite our overall net revenue being down $12.5 million from the previous quarter, the strength of our diversified business and solid margins of our medical business show in the fact that ebitda was only impacted by about $4 million.
so with the continued business transformation efficiencies, we believe we can realize within the next 18 months that we are confident that we can get aurora to a positive ebitda run rate without having to rely on revenue growth and margin expansion. that growth, when it comes, will show up as incremental positive earnings. now a few important points regarding cash flow and cash position. we used $35.9 million of cash to fund operations, excluding working capital, and we used $5.4 million for contract and employee termination costs.
we also paid a net $12.2 million for capital expenditures in q3, down from $83.9 million in the prior-year comparative. so we're on track to reduce capex spending to approximately $41 million for this fiscal year. and that's before taking into account a further offset to come from an expected $9.4 million government grant to be received related to our cogeneration project completed at river. networking capital used is $25 million in the quarter.
with production and demand now roughly aligned, this change in working capital was mainly due to shifts in the levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable, which we expect to settle out over time. finally, as of today, we have a very strong cash position with about $525 million in the bank and less than $90 million of outstanding term debt. in the coming months, we expect to receive additional non-dilutive cash inflows from non-core asset sales and grants, which we plan to direct to term debt pay down. before i wrap up, a couple of housekeeping notes, we received approval from nasdaq to transfer our u.s.
listing to the nasdaq global select market, the highest listing tier on the nasdaq exchange. this is expected to be effective on may 24 after the market close and will not impact our tsx listing, nor the trading opportunity for any of our shareholders. no action is required from any aurora shareholder. this transfer is intended to result in cost savings and to align aurora with our peers on an exchange known for innovative and growth-oriented companies.
we also announced today that we intend to file our new atm supplement for a u.s. 300-million-dollar program. we do not expect to need the atm for our current business operations. but we do believe we need to be prepared for strategic acquisition opportunities, including u.s.
exposure as we identify those opportunities. so to wrap up, what i believe people really need to take away from our q3 financial results is the following. aurora's financial health and path to growth and profitability are on track. we have had great success in our high-margin medical businesses and the transformation of our consumer business that while facing industry headwinds, which may take some time to pass, is well under way.
we've also taken important steps in rationalizing production, sg&a remains well controlled, and we reiterate our focus on cash flow and on maintaining a strong balance sheet. i'd now like to turn the call back over to miguel.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
thanks, glen. as i referenced earlier, aurora's underlying strength is that we are a diversified business that can be broken down into four parts: first, the canadian medical business, number one in fact; two, international medical business; three, a u.s. cbd business; and four, finally, our canadian adult-recreational-use business. the latter is clearly facing some near-term covid-related headwinds but we're confident that when these conditions abate we will have a strong business across all four key platforms.
although we are already the number one medical cannabis company in canada by revenue, we still believe that we have significant growth still ahead. first, i'd like to highlight that the top five lps in the canadian medical channel represent less than 40% of the market, with aurora being roughly half of that. this means that there are plenty of lps out there that make up 60% of the medical market and that's a lot of potential for us to grow into. second, there are further opportunities to leverage technology in our patient intake and user experience, lower wait times, improve service levels and increase product choices.
we have made the requisite investments in infrastructure and have the necessary regulatory experience and compliance systems that effectively create a moat around our business and supporting key patient groups while enabling us to sustain approximately 60% gross margins for the foreseeable future. our national medical segment generates revenue across 12 countries and has been a consistent winner. we have a leading position in germany in dried flower but are also bullish on the large and growing oil market there. additionally, we have made inroads in israel through a strategic supply agreement with cantek.
we are also involved in the french medical cannabis tenure program with our partner at bfarm where we won three of the nine tenders representing all of the dried flower tenders awarded to supply the french medical pilot program. as you know, senator chuck schumer says on the senate floor that 4/20 is the unofficial american marijuana holiday. and he now supports legalizing cannabis on a national level. as i referenced before on that same day, the white house press secretary was asked this very question and replied that while the president supports leaving decisions regarding legalization for recreation use is up to the states.
at the federal level, he supports decriminalizing cannabis use, automatically expunging any prior criminal records, and legalizing medical cannabis. in a federally regulated medical framework, i feel confident about aurora's chances for success. we, of course, do not know the timeframe for if or when this will happen but i can say with certainty that aurora's ability to operate within a highly regulated framework, supported by our commitment to science, testing, labeling, and eu gmp compliant cultivation puts us in an enviable position to actualize this likely opportunity. that's not to say the msos don't have their own advantages but canadian lps like aurora that have been successful around the world, have the wherewithal and experience to be successful in the u.s.
as well. turning to our u.s. cbd segment. reliva is the top-ranked cbd brand from nielsen, and the largest cannabinoid market in the world.
we are supplying some of the largest retailers and wholesalers nationally and have a footprint, spanning over 23,000 stores. we've also recently extended our product line with a new brand focused on the sports market, and now will launch on shelves this quarter. in the near term, we think this new distribution would offset softness related to covid disruption affecting the u.s. c-store channel.
however, long term, we believe that the single greatest sales catalyst for reliva going forward, given its already established critical distribution, regulatory experience, and relationships in the u.s. market is fda regulation and the potential placement of cbd within a dietary supplement framework. so whether the u.s. cbd business is cad 2 billion or cad 10 billion a year over time, we believe that reliva will be advantaged under fda protocols because of our regulatory expertise operating in brick-and-mortar stores even in the age of e-commerce.
let me also add that we would not be surprised if the non thc parts of our portfolio and are ultimately as big as the thc parts of our portfolio, particularly with positive fda action in the u.s. moving on to the canadian consumer market. our three-step approach to winning is as follows. first, we've made significant investments in improving the quality of our products.
this includes the addition of hand trimming, hand drawing techniques, and innovative packaging. importantly, we have also improved the minimum potency specs of our two largest brands. today, our daily special dried flower has a minimum of 20% potency, up from 16%, and we've increased both potency and terpenes on some of our best-selling san rafael straight tubes. secondly, leading with innovation.
we continue to make increased investments that meet the rapidly evolving needs of our consumers. over the last 6 months, new product launches have accounted for over 18% of total revenue and we are excited about new launches throughout the generation two and three categories over time. and third, optimizing our manufacturing and production network. this includes leveraging third parties as needed across our supply chain to increase speed to market, the ramp-up of aurora nordic to streamline eu gmp shipments to our key european medical business, and the closing of inefficient cultivation and manufacturing facilities.
we are now going even further with today's efficiency initiatives to reduce complexity in our operations. we like our top-line strategy, which we believe is appropriate for the current and future state market. to accelerate our progress, we have a new head of marketing and a new head of brand management to lead these initiatives. they will be working closely with the team at great north distributors, a new contract sales force, who is the no.
1 national broker for cannabis in canada. before we wrap up, i want to take a moment to talk about our strategy to commercialize our deep intellectual property and science program. the production and isolation of cannabinoid molecules is a topic that generates a tremendous amount of airtime, particularly as it relates to biosynthesis. we believe the use of cannabinoid molecules, including minor cannabinoids will be huge as the regulations globally evolve.
in fact, our reliva business in the usa today sells products to consumers that use cbd isolate, and we are deeply interested in the evolution of other cannabinoids and the ability to commercialize them. with this, it is important to highlight to our stakeholders, aurora's connection to the biosynthetic production of cannabinoids, which goes back to the work carried out by our plant science team on the discovery of plant pathways, and licenses for this ip was brought to aurora through the acquisition of anandia. through licensing deals, aurora and 22nd century group together share the global intellectual property rights to key aspects of cannabinoid biosynthesis. the two companies are working closely together to both defend our position on this ip from parties infringing on it as well as actively exploring commercial development opportunities.
this technology promises to be tremendously valuable as it potentially unlocks more efficient means to produce cannabinoids, particularly minor cannabinoids, which typically occur in the plant at very low levels, less than 1%. let me end with this. since first announcing our business transformation about a year ago, we have accomplished a great deal. specifically, we said that we would cut g&a and delivered 60-plus million in quarterly sg&a savings.
we said we would align our production to current demand. we delivered that in q3 with a sales to production ratio of 93%. we said we would leverage external expertise in our supply chain. we've achieved that with multiple external cultivation sources onboarded and bringing in the great north contract sales force.
the upshot of all these initiatives plus the new expense reductions we announced today, will enable us to reach breakeven ebitda in the coming quarters without having to depend on incremental revenue. thank you for your interest. and now we'll turn it over to the operator for questions. operator?

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of vivien azer with cowen & co. you may proceed with your question.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. thank you. good afternoon. miguel and glen, i was hoping to dig in, please, on the consumer cannabis segment.
i would like to hear how the quarter settled out relative to you're going in expectations and if there are any key call-outs in terms of form factor or price point drivers as it relates to the 8% sequential revenue growth? thank you.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
yeah. good afternoon, viv. so let me kick it off, and then i'll share it to glen. i made the comment that it's a tale of two cities.
if you look at the margins of discount flower, in many cases, a better breakeven in some cases in certain big provinces, they're negative. and so that's just -- as this whole thing shakes out, chasing that and chasing overall market share at the cost of profitability really is not our strategy. that's not to say it may not benefit others. where we're going is the higher-margin premium flower and the higher-margin concentrate.
that's a place where consistently, we're seeing almost 2x margins. and if you look at that coupled with a rec business because, again, if you can use the same products in both rec and medical, there are efficiencies, and we've seen a big uptick in patients looking for premium products. i think there's a lot of value there. so it's going to take a bit longer, but i think in order for that discount flower business to shake out as people try to compete on price and it will.
i mean, there's no way that's sustainable long term. at that point, we've got some great brands, and we've got some great capabilities. but at this juncture, we're going to focus on making money. glen?
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
thanks. yeah. we are starting to see -- i mentioned in my remarks, i know miguel echoed this. we are starting to see some of the data that shows us that we are seeing that shift, for instance, our san raf or even just during the summer, has been picking up.
i think in quebec, we picked up at least 1% or better market share. and i know it doesn't always show up in the data, like the headset data and things like that. quebec, i don't think you get good info, but our average selling price in quebec is 80% higher than ontario because of the shift into san raf, we've always done well there. so we are seeing it.
i think it will take a little bit. you certainly didn't see it in q4 as much in terms of the revenue. but there's a lot of stuff happening under the covers there where we see our core and premium brands picking up and certainly, innovation that we launched in -- during the summer and is coming up as well. we have strong expectations for, but to miguel's point, we would also see some revenue fall off as we exit unprofitable segments.
and i'm confident, i mean, at the gross profit level. so that's the kind of what's happening there. but we're seeing the data. we're seeing some of the traction, but i think it will be reflected in our financials over the next several quarters.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. so -- and i don't have any follow-up. so just to clarify, relative to your expectations, maybe just on the premium side, was the premium side of your business on consumer cannabis in line with expectations?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
yes, viv. i'll take that. listen, i'm never satisfied. innovation accounts for the vast majority of products.
i mean if you look at the data, and i know you know this better than anybody, the majority of products that's sold in the last 30 to 60 days didn't exist more than 12 months ago. so our full-year '22 innovation calendar includes 80 new skus versus 85 we put in the market. so would i like to see more progress in san raf? and i would say, they're absolutely. am i confident that we have the right plans in place and the right amount of infrastructure to meet what we need to do? i do.
and so i think that's a long-winded way to say, we're pleased with where we're at, but we could always be hungrier to push faster.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
of course. thank you.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question comes from the line of pablo zuanic with cantor fitzgerald. you may proceed with your question.
matthew baker -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
good afternoon. this is matthew baker on behalf of pablo. we have two questions today. so firstly, can you discuss which of your cultivation facilities are currently operational? and in the case of aurora sky, how many rooms are currently operational?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
matthew, we've made the announcement post rationalization that we're going to have -- i'll talk about sky in a second. we have sky. we have whistler. we have river, and we have ridge, and then we have the nordic facility in europe.
that is an incredibly strong, not only portfolio of manufacturing centers of excellence. right now, as we've talked about, sky is operating at about 25%. there's a lot of good work. it is one of the largest facilities in canada that carries a cumcs certification, which is quite a challenge and is a requirement for israeli shipments.
and so listen, we have plenty of capacity if we needed it, but we have also the flexibility with those facilities to be able to rightsize them as we need to be. glen, anything you want to add to that?
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
just the second part of your question on sky. it isn't a matter of room. we're actually using most of the rooms. we've just changed some of the cultivation habits that we've got in there to produce a higher quality plan.
so we're -- as miguel said, we're operating at 25%, but we have plenty flex capacity to service israel, other export markets or any other growth needs that we have. so we feel quite confident. i will add, we've also got our outdoor facility, which is called valley. we saw commercial sales out of valley last year, and we're just taking down the harvest a couple of weeks ago from the first set of -- the first harvest is another one yet to come in the fall.
and we expect that we would see commercial or consumer grade to cannabis coming out of that facility as well. so that's a real win for us.
matthew baker -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
all right. thank you for that. for our second question, we wanted to know how you guys feel about the outlook for your export business and if it's reasonable to assume that this revenue flow could double in full-year 2022 compared to full-year 2021?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
let me judge a little bit about israel, and then i'll kick it to glen who can talk about the aggregate. israel is a very challenging marketplace. the imca, which is the regulatory authority in israel. it's one of the strictest in the world.
we have a wonderful relationship with the lead regulator there, [inaudible]. and he is quite a leading regulatory figure around the world. they've really taken a hard stance in terms of what it takes. it's beyond cumcs.
it's a variety of different pesticides they look for. so we're not giving guidance on israel because it continues to move around. we feel really confident that as long as the border is open for imports, we'll continue to be almost unique in our ability to navigate that with high-quality, highly regulated, and compliant cannabis products. and for a country of 9 million people with over almost 100,000 patients, i think we've done an excellent job, which really sets us up well for new markets coming on.
i mentioned in my prepared remarks about germany, we're thrilled with that election. and having the no. 1 flower business with also a very challenging regulatory environment sets us up well for that market. glen?
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
yeah. i'll add. europe for us, and this is important, though. we're operating 12 countries.
we're actually selling and seeing strong growth in a number of really important countries for us, the u.k., poland, of course, germany. so when we project over the next year, and we're not guiding on this, but our opportunity for growth is certainly the german market, but it sees other markets as well. i mentioned some sizing from bds and where they expect certain european markets to be by 2025. and that's just as a reminder, that those are sizable markets, well worth our investment.
love that we are leaders in europe about $3.5 billion market in just those countries i mentioned by 2025, gives us tons of room for growth. and our team there has continued to deliver for quarter after quarter through a number of years now. so i have a great deal of confidence in our international medical business.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from michael lavery with piper sandler. you may proceed with your question.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
good afternoon, michael.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
you touched on the ip that you have just before the q&a and some of the royalty opportunities or ways to monetize that. can you give us a sense of timing or what we might be able to expect there in terms of how that could unfold?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
yes. it's a great question. so the company had spent a lot of money on this previously, and these assets came out of the anandia acquisition. and as we mentioned, we partnered with 22nd century, a company that we all know well.
right now, we're sort of in the early stages of it. all indications are, though, that the biosynthesis and the ip around those pathways are some of the more important ones for the cannabinoid molecules. we know some of our peers are doing good work in that space. we also know that in other categories, it's a significant piece of business, particularly for those companies that don't want to be vertically integrated.
so, michael, i think we're probably -- you'll start to see us defend ip, which we've started to do, you'll start to see us talk a little bit more specifically about it. we're excited on the analyst day to share with you some of the new talent that we brought into that space, both on the science side as well as on the business development side. and i think with that, you'll have a better sense on the timing and scope of it. clearly, if you look at almost any other category, that is evolving like this.
there's a significant amount of ip. i would also say that the legal construct to defend it is quite strong. i mean this is not pie in the sky that the companies are going to be able to defend this type of ip. obviously, the u.s.
is stronger than some other markets. but globally, there is a very consistent and well-tread pathway for companies to defend their pathway. it's some biosynthesis and a variety of things. so we're excited about that.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst

our next question comes from andrew carter with stifel. you may proceed with your question.
andrew carter -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hey. thanks. good evening. i know you've mentioned the kind of stores opening, but i guess what we're seeing right now from stores is canada is beyond saturation and stores aren't getting into some areas where it needs to.
the other thing we're seeing is kind of the retail inventory levels are pretty high relative to where they started the year. so could you just kind of help us understand how your portfolio is positioned kind of to grow with the market? i mean, we're at the end of this quarter. so should we see another sequential increase, taking a lot of heavy lifting, cleaning up the portfolio? just help us with that. thanks.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
be happy to, and it's a great question. first and foremost, the retail environment, and this is no disrespect, anybody that's connected to it is unlike any other regulated product you've ever seen, out of stocks, marketing principles, the inability to have merchandising programs because of the inducement provisions. the differences between province to province, the low penetration of chains, there's some very good ones, but the overall store count and then to your point, things coming online and saturation. and so, i think we're in the early days, andrew, of a real optimized retail environment.
the provincial buyers and decision-makers are also catching up to -- as we come out of covid. and when you see out of stocks from primary brands in 30%, 40% at the time and when you see the no. 1 sku in canada, only being in about two-thirds of the stores, you see a lot of opportunity for execution. so you asked two -- you asked one question and i'll tack on a statement to it.
how do we see our portfolio? we feel really good about our portfolio because we're now putting out high potency, high turf products, both for us and for some of our partners. i know you're aware of north 40 and the great work they've done. they use some of our genetics with a product called farm gas. that got almost a 30 potency.
and so, that's a big win. secondly, we are partnered up with what i would say is probably the best-brokered network in canada through gnd, a division of southern glazer, where we're able to make three times the number of calls we made previously and really develop and lever their excellence around that. and so, i'm bullish on our category in the prime areas. i will say, though, we're not going to chase market share.
if a company right now wants to be top five, they'd have to have a significant piece of discount flower, and it's just not a priority for us. i also don't think it's a priority for our retail partners who are looking to hold on a margin and to sell products that move off the shelves. so we're going to be consistent in that. we're going to make money.
and i think the market will normalize. and we've seen our competitors also sort of pivot to a less race to the bottom on price and try to focus on some margin accretion.
andrew carter -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thanks. i'll pass it on.

our next question comes from heather balsky with bank of america. you may proceed with your question.
heather balsky -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. thanks. this is heather balsky. so i'm just curious, putting some of the comments together that you've made with regards to consumers' demand for value versus premium.
and i think you mentioned that it's taking a bit longer than you originally expected. i'm just curious, what you're seeing in terms of now that markets are starting to open up, people are going into the stores more. are you seeing changing trends? any interest from the consumer. we've heard that there's been a fair amount of turnover in the budtender -- i guess, in budtenders in general, just how that's impacting demand for value versus premium? just anything you're seeing as markets are opening up?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
sure. i'd be happy to, heather. so i think it's a couple of things. one is everybody is trying to figure out what the new normal looks like.
and the reality is, particularly on a 28-gram discount flower, it's a challenge to make money on that format. we also see similar to what you see in colorado and california, that over time, there is absolutely a strong group of consumers that will pay more for premium. this is not going to be the one regulated category where all that is sold as discount and this deal aligned from one of my peers. this isn't going to be like everyone just goes and buys moonshine in the alcohol business.
johnnie walker, tito's, they're valuable brands. is it taking a bit longer? yes. now you bring up a really interesting point about the budtender. and i think to be fair about the environment.
when you have an environment where there's massive out of stocks, when you have an environment where you can't have formalized merchandising programs, and you have a market where each of the manufacturers are trying to figure out exactly what is their specific approach and with half the sales -- 60% of sales being something that didn't exist a year ago, the budtenders hold an incredibly powerful hold over the consumers and what they are. many of the companies like us are starting to develop educational tools from a category standpoint, not just in the self-serving way. and i know the chains are also trying to bring category management principles to it. so i think you're going to see an evolution of it, particularly as we get into concentrates in gen 2 and gen 3 products that take a little more explanation.
and clearly, like i keep saying, this is not going to be the one geography in the world and the one category where there's not premium products sold for a premium margin.
heather balsky -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
all right. thank you.

our next question comes from john zamparo with cibc. you may proceed with your question.
john zamparo -- cibc -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon. i wanted to follow up on a comment you'd made, glen. really just trying to reconcile what we're seeing from data providers at the retail level with the commentary about san raf improving and just a modest decline in daily special? and what have you seen in f q1 to date that gives you the confidence that you are turning around in terms of the consumer market?
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
let me start, and then miguel will add i'm sure. i just -- i think i wanted to make the point that most data that is out there doesn't -- because quebec owns the retail distribution, you don't necessarily get direct data from them in these data sources. they sometimes extrapolate from the rest of canada or france. so that's always been a strong market for us, particularly for san raf.
in fact, most quarters, we sell more flower in quebec than we do in ontario. and i made the point that if we're selling the higher-margin stock like at the san raf flower, you have an asp of 80% -- over 80% greater in quebec than ontario. so i think that was the only point. it just -- i know we've asked you to look at the data, but the data is still evolving as well, right? so it's relatively new.
and there are challenges, i think, in interpreting that. i'm not trying to overplay this, but it's just one of our more important markets that's not necessarily reflected ultimately. but we have seen -- miguel talked about innovation being incredibly important. i think we've finally got our pipeline plugged in really well and introduction of these three new cultivars under san raf launched in quebec in august and in ontario line and a few other provinces in september.
we're seeing a really nice reaction to this stuff that's unique, unique terpene profile, mid-20s for several of them in terms of thc potency and then, farm gas through north 40 partnership with a couple of batches that are hitting up at 30%, incredible terpene profile. so we've got the science and the genetics side plugged in nicely to kind of drive that innovation and quite an innovation launch plan over the next number of quarters. so that's really where we see that sort of continued shift, i think, into the shift into the premium side of the market. miguel?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
yes. i mean, i guess, the only data point i'd mention is when you look at competitors, when you put out a high-quality product, whether it's new or whether it's an extension, and what do i mean by that? north of 22 potency in a format that's interesting, potentially high turf levels, it almost uniquely does well. and so, it's not a secret recipe in terms of what is required here in order to meet the consumer needs. clearly, someone who's played a lot with market shares in the premium category, it's not where i'd want it to be.
but i think to glen's point, if you look what we were able to do and get over $1 million in revenue out of three brand new fkus in a couple of core provinces, i think we're on the right track, and we'll keep pushing on that.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from frederico gomes with atb capital markets. you may proceed with your question.
frederico gomes -- atb capital markets -- analyst
hi. good afternoon, guys. thanks for taking my question. i just wanted to touch on your cbd segment.
i know you guys had an impairment there. but can you provide an update on reliva and the strategy for that segment? do you guys plan to grow that business or invest any money? or is this not a priority right now? thanks.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
it's a great question. today, we launched a secondary line called kg7, that's got more of a sports orientation to it and absolutely has a better price point on gummies, which is the largest segment. we continue to have, if not the largest, one of the largest amount of store distribution in the u.s. and while we are a bit frustrated with the progress that we see at the federal level, we did see what may be the most important state that has lapped california passed an important piece of legislation that will allow cbd to be sold there.
so i continue to think that our positioning of the brands of choice for mass retail throughout the country and the responsible and compliant way will play dividends for us. i would also mention it's such a highly variable model that you're just not seeing losses like you see from some of our competitors in that space. so it's a one real piece of optionality. we're also starting to see some international markets be interested in what continues to be the #1 nielsen ranked brand in cbd, and that would be additive to the overall financials.
frederico gomes -- atb capital markets -- analyst

our next question comes from tamy chen with bmo capital markets. you may proceed with your question.
tamy chen -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. good evening. thanks for the question. i just wanted to ask, what's the plan for sky? and you mentioned it's still operating at 25% capacity.
i would assume that's not the level of capacity you'd like it to be running at for the status quo in going forward. so what's the plan with that facility? and can you just confirm with respect to your san raf sell in? is that all coming from internal sourcing? or do you procure from third parties for some of that? thank you.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
great. so sky, as i mentioned, we have about 25% of the capacity online. but when you have margins in the israeli business and the international business, it very quickly is an additive piece. as that -- those businesses come more online and the difficulties in getting cumcs certification, sky is really important.
also, we're seeing some of those new cultivars, i just mentioned, now being grown at sky and seeing a real progress in terms of the overall potency. that's a nice to have. and if we can get there with the cost structure of sky will be totally additive. so we like what we've done there.
it gives us, i think, the best of both worlds in that facility, and we'll sort of see where it goes. glen, do you want to take the second part?
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
i mean, sky operating at current levels with the type of business that we're driving out of there is actually quite a nice cash flow generator. so that i don't get thrown off at the 25% because that's not a kind of a low-margin facility anymore. it's delivering the stuff that brings higher margins with us, which was really an important part of the repositioning and the improvement in the quality of potency coming out of that facility. and sorry, your second piece of your question?
tamy chen -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
i just wanted to ask if for your san raf supply, if that's all coming from internally produced product? or do you wholesale some of it?
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
i would say acquire. we've acquired a couple of small batches from some craft growers that are launched under our grower's stash brand, but san raf itself, the three cultivars, that's all being driven out of our new genetics out of our coast facility that genetics coming at the coast.
tamy chen -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you.
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
yeah.
operator
our next question comes from doug miehm with rbc capital markets. you may proceed with your question.
doug miehm -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yes. good afternoon. the question just has to do with the craft growers and what you see in the canadian marketplace. we know that earlier in the year, they did quite well.
they were taking market share from the larger lps. and i'm just wondering if you're seeing that being sustained? or do you see yourselves and maybe some of the other larger competitors taking that share back from the craft growers?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
yes. doug, it's a great question. listen, i think there's always going to be a place in the super premium segment, albeit not a lot of volume for a very craft regional grower, similar to what you might see in microbeer or see in the spirits business. i would say that the large lps and aurora really leading the way, have up their game in terms of delivering what the consumer wants.
i think you're going to start to see, like we saw with san raf, the advantages of a large lp, whether that's listings, whether that's retail execution, whether that's innovation, whether that's science are going to come to bear. it's not -- i keep going back to this. it's just not going to be the one category where the large lps -- the top seven only represent 35%, 40% of the business. it might take a little bit longer than we all like, but there are inherent advantages that we all, and i think particularly aurora has that will allow us to grow profitable market share.
now like i said, if someone wants to chase a bunch of discount flower and get 300 basis points, 400 basis points, 500 basis points and lose money, particularly on a 28 gram, they can have it. but i think in that core, in that premium space, you're going to see companies like aurora do very well, particularly as the consumers start to expect more and get more from those large lps.
doug miehm -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. thank you.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer

our next question comes from adam buckham with scotiabank. you may proceed with your question.
adam buckham -- scotiabank -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions. so i wanted to touch back on israel. i guess i have two parts.
the first one is thinking about the two large sales that you've made, first in july and then, i guess, the upcoming one. can you maybe talk to how much of this is the relieving of the bottleneck that's occurred there? and then secondly, are you able to comment on how many canadian lps are supplying israel currently?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
yes. i don't -- i mean, i don't think it's a bottleneck. i was out there in july. the reality is you've got local israeli companies that are high quality, they're growing cannabis.
as i mentioned, the imca, which i have a tremendous amount of respect for, and i had the pleasure of spending a lot of time with, it expects that israel is going to have some of the most stringent regulatory requirements of any market in the world and be a leader in regulatory compliance. that's really hard. so a lot of people would love to access israel and the margins. i think in order to do that, first and foremost, you have to have excellence in regulatory compliance.
secondly, you have to have a really strong partner that can execute on the ground, and we're really pleased with our partnership with cantek. and third, i think you have to make a commitment as a company long term. and we're -- couldn't be happier with all of those things coming together. i would -- i don't know all the different lps that we try to get into israel.
i can imagine with that margin structure, everybody would love to be able to get into israel, but cumcs, all the pesticide testing, everything that i mentioned is not easy. and so, it's been a handful of companies that have been able to navigate it. i might argue we've done it better than most, but we'll stay on it, and we're thrilled about it.

greetings, and welcome to the aurora cannabis inc. fourth-quarter 2021 results conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to your host, ananth krishnan, vice president, corporate development and investor relations.
please go ahead.
ananth krishnan -- vice president, corporate development and investor relations
thank you, john, and thank you all for joining us for aurora cannabis fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 conference call. this is being recorded today, monday, september 27, 2021. with me today are aurora's ceo, miguel martin; and cfo, glen ibbott. after the close of markets today, aurora issued a news release announcing our financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal-year 2021.
the release and the accompanying financial statements and md&a will be available on our website or on our sedar and edgar profiles. in addition, you can find a supplemental information deck on our ir website. listeners are reminded that certain matters discussed in today's conference call could constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties related to aurora's future financial or business performance. actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.
the risks to risk factors that may affect results are detailed in aurora's annual information form and other periodic filings and registration statements. these documents may be accessed via the sedar and edgar databases. since we're conducting today's call from respective remote locations, we may experience technical issues. we thank you in advance for your patience.
following the prepared remarks by miguel and glen, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] for retail and institutional investors, we will review questions through the chat function of the webcast link. with that, i would like to turn the call over to miguel. please go ahead. 
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
thank you, ananth. we made significant strategic and financial progress during fiscal-year 2021. in fact, as of fiscal q4, i can safely say we're in the best shape the company has ever been in. while there's certainly more work to do, aurora is on the right course to build shareholder value, particularly from these levels.
building value starts with profitability on an adjusted ebitda basis. the entire team is focused on the separate and additional facility closures we announced last week is another proof point to show that these actions are well underway. building on that, let me speak to a few more data points that underscore our progress into 2021 and how that sets the table for value creation in 2022. first, aurora is and remains the no.
1 canadian lp in global medical cannabis revenue, with margins over 60%. this is nearly double what we see in the adult rec segment. for that reason, we will happily continue to allocate resources to the canadian, european, or israeli medical markets, where our regulatory expertise, science, testing and compliance combined to create a portable and profitable model. the second lever we're pulling is expense reduction.
as you know, we're on track to deliver another $60 million to $80 million in incremental cost savings, and it's important to note that these savings won't affect any planned growth initiatives. these additional savings will also clear our path to being adjusted ebitda positive by the first half of our next fiscal year, even if revenue was to remain constant with our fiscal 2021 fourth-quarter levels. that said, we do not expect revenue -- that said, we do expect revenue growth in 2022. another value creation data point that complements our p&l is the balance sheet and a growing, dynamic and fragmented market, our regulatory expertise and no.
1 position in canadian medical are further advantaged with a strong balance sheet. i'm pleased to say that we have vastly improved ours with approximately $400 million of cash as of friday, no secured term debt, and access to $1 billion of capital under our shelf prospectus. we've also gotten better at managing our operating cash flow, reducing the need for incremental capital. we also expect to leverage our significant investments in r&d and monetize a world-leading science and innovation program.
the foundation of this is what we believe to be the world's largest dedicated cannabis breeding and genetics facility located in comox, british columbia. and lastly, we've strengthened our executive team by bringing in two highly skilled individuals in the areas of operations and hr, alex miller and lori schick, respectively. with that as a backdrop, i want to remind our listeners that aurora is comprised of four distinct, yet complementary components. first, a no.
1 ranked canadian medical business by revenue and the largest federally regulated medical market in the world. second is our international medical business, which ranks as the second-largest canadian lp by revenue. net revenue from these two businesses increased 18% during fiscal 2021. third is our science and innovation business unit.
we are monetizing our intellectual property in genetics and biosynthesis. and finally, fourth, our canadian adult rec business, where we've already made progress, although challenges remain. let's take a deeper dive on medical cannabis as it really serves as a solid foundation for our future. domestically, we represent about a fifth of the canadian medical market, but only about 1% of the population are currently medical cannabis patients.
while our market share is roughly double of our next closest peer, the top five lps within the canadian medical channel represent less than 40% of the market. this gap represents aurora's opportunity to expand our presence, and we have done so through significant investment to help doctors and patients fully appreciate the benefits of medical cannabis. that outreach includes education. aurora's investments in sophisticated technology, coupled with unparalleled professional counseling and guidance in navigating medical cannabis alternative treatments, have enabled us to provide an end-to-end patient experience for a growing clientele of recurring canadian patients.
about 80% of our canadian medical cannabis net revenue is constituted by cannabis insured and/or subsidized patient groups, which sets up the medical channels a very solid core revenue growth. also our infrastructure to support a direct-to-patient distribution model, which begins with patient clearing and then transitions to onboarding, medical consultation, and finally prescription fulfillment across a variety of price points, all being a key factor of our success. to improve our canadian medical business further, we are now leveraging technology in our patient intake and user experience to lower wait times, raise service levels and increase product choices. this is a key driver of margin.
in its totality, our market position in canadian medical, our innovation, and tactical execution have created a tangible barrier to entry, which is good news for shareholders as we grow other parts of the business. in terms of international medical, we're leveraging core capabilities from canada as new countries look at launching medical cannabis. this is a distinct advantage over our peers, creating a deep moat around our business. a data point here is our leading position in germany in dry flower with a growing share of the oil market there.
in france, aurora and ethypharm were selected in october of 2020 by the national agency for the safety of medicines and health products to supply the entire medical cannabis pilot program with dry flower. we won three of the nine tender lots, which included all available dry flower lots and just delivered our first shipment in august. in israel, we delivered an $8 million cannabis shipment in july as part of our supply agreement with cantek. we believe this is the largest single shipment of cannabis that israel has received.
speaking of israel, we are excited to announce an extended supply agreement with cantek, under which we just received appeal for a further $9 million shipment, which we expect to deliver in fiscal q2. our compliant expertise was responsible for the extension, all good news. of course, our expertise in medical cannabis and ability to operate within a highly regulated framework gives us a great opportunity to expand in the global adult rec. history demonstrates that medical regimes eventually evolve to adult rec as companies like aurora that have a proven ability to operate in federal regulated systems will have an advantage when new markets open up.
let's pivot to canadian adult rec. those who follow the market are well aware of industrywide challenges, but i'll bring up two points. first, while fixing this segment will clearly take longer than expected, we did grow 8% sequentially compared to fiscal q3 and are seeing early signs that our focus on higher quality, higher potency, higher-margin products is beginning to pay dividends. specifically, our sales mix was positively impacted by a growth of about 400 basis points in same ramp, offset by a modest decline in daily special.
the growth in san raf represents over 20% increase in dollar terms. we believe this momentum should continue with additional premium product introductions and a focus on innovation throughout all categories. second, we believe the adult rec segment is in the process of bottoming out and is now poised to rebound given the new store openings and rising consumer demand. the dried flower rec category in canada is a tale of two markets.
first, the high-margin premium dried flower category where margins are 50% or higher; and second, the discount flower category, where many skus are breakeven or even negative margin. our strategy centers on our premium category. we are not going to be chasing unprofitable market share. we're going to be chasing profit pool dollars.
furthermore, our focus on product innovation and manufacturing excellence is squarely aligned with the expectation of our retail partners. so there's segment discussion out of the way. let me pivot to our p&l, and our primary goal of adjusted ebitda profitability. aurora has identified cash savings in the midpoint of our previous guidance of $60 million to $80 million.
we plan to deliver $30 million to $40 million of those savings within the next 12 months and the remainder within 15 months. we expect approximately 60% of the savings will come from asset consolidation, operational and supply chain efficiencies. for example, last week, we announced internally a plan to centralize much of our canadian production at our river facility in bradford, ontario, and the resulting closure of our polaris facility. we expect the remaining 40% of savings to be sourced through sg&a.
and keep in mind that these efficiencies are incremental to the approximately $300 million of total cost reductions achieved since february of 2020. again, expense reductions, margin improvements, and sustainable cash flow generation won't inhibit our growth plans. to be clear, to reach adjusted ebitda profitability by the first half of the next fiscal year, we do not expect to any revenue growth in the q4 2021 levels. but i hope you can tell, we are positioned for top-line growth in 2022 and with that, adjusted ebitda profitability should follow.
with that, i will turn the call over to glen.
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
thanks, miguel, and good afternoon, everyone. i appreciate you joining us today and your patience with our slight delay in getting earnings out as we finished up the last bits of our audit. before i get to our q4 results, i'd like to take a moment to review the success of our business transformation program over the past year. as miguel referenced, our financial fundamentals are in better shape now than they have been for several years.
our balance sheet, after having paid off the $90 million secured term debt in june and having invested approximately $30 million into our new insurance structure in september, still sits at around $400 million of cash as of friday. that is excellent considering we started q4 of $520 million and paid out $120 million in debt reduction and investment. and the debt and insurance actions will save us almost $35 million in annual cash flow. our core medical businesses continued to deliver overall growth and enviable margins that generally sits at 60% or better, with the result in gross profit dollars being an absolutely critical driver of our path to positive ebitda.
and of course, our sg&a and capex are a fraction of what they used to be, which is clearly good news for our investors. so now to q4 results, which i believe demonstrated the importance of aurora's diversified business in both consumer and medical markets across 12 countries. overall, q4 net cannabis revenue before provisions was $55.7 million. our medical cannabis segment continues to excel, generating $35 million in sales and a gross margin of 68%.
this represents about 63% of our q4 revenue and almost 80% of our gross profit. our consumer cannabis business delivered $20.2 million, excluding provisions and a gross margin of 31%. so overall, q4's gross margin was 54%, with just north of $30 million of gross profit. this makes aurora one of the leading, if not the best, gross profit generators in the canadian cannabis industry.
sg&a remains well-controlled, resulting in an improvement in adjusted ebitda, excluding restructuring. while still negative of $13.9 million, it is heading in the right direction. now a bit more detail on each of our business segments. our canadian medical revenue was $26.4 million in q4, essentially flat quarter over quarter despite the impact of competition from continued store openings in the consumer market.
our canadian medical patients can be segmented into two groups: those with cost reimbursement coverage and those without the reimbursement program. our success is really driven by our high-value insured patient groups whose reimbursement makes some recurring buyers. and this is why we have made patient groups with reimbursement coverage, a high focused priority in our medical business. that said, we may see some migration of price-sensitive non-reimbursement patients from the medical channel to the adult rec channel as that market continues to develop over time.
our international medical revenue was $8.6 million, down slightly quarter over quarter, but up 88% versus a year ago. in q4, this business delivered a 72% margin, beating our mid-60s expectations. this exceptional result was driven mainly by country mix. our q4 international margin also benefited from the transfer of almost all of our european supply to our nordic facility in denmark.
and while there were no sales to israel in q4, as miguel noted, we did deliver approximately 8 million of medical cannabis to israel in early july and have a further $9 million shipment plan for next month. bds analytics estimates a market size of about $3.2 billion by 2025 for just germany, poland, u.k., france and israel. with that context, this is clear why international medical is worthy of our focus and investment and why our leadership internationally is an important driver of long-term shareholder value. our q4 consumer revenue of about $20 million, including provisions, was an increase of 8% compared to q3.
we are seeing signs of our shift to the higher-margin core and premium segments that will underpin our future success in this market. miguel noted, q4 saw a step forward for san rafael '71 brand, and this contributed to an increase in our average net selling price per gram of dried cannabis. now for sg&a, which includes r&d. it remains well controlled coming in at $44.8 million in q4, excluding restructuring, a 30% decrease compared to last year.
and while we have made a lot of progress in driving down sg&a over the past 12 months, as miguel stated earlier, we are implementing further measures to take out costs that should get us well below a $40 million quarterly run rate at the time we exit the fiscal year. so pulling all of this together, we generated an adjusted ebitda loss in q4 2021 of $13.9 million, excluding restructuring one-time costs. this represents about an $18 million improvement year over year and a $2.6 million improvement from the prior quarter. to help investors think about our path to ebitda profitability, i'll provide some thoughts on how the cost reduction plans that miguel described will flow through the p&l.
approximately 60% of cash savings are expected to be realized in cost of goods as inventory has drawn down. this should occur over several quarters as our lower production cost structure shows up in finished goods. we expect the remaining 40% of cash savings to show up in sg&a. these savings will be seen as they are executed, beginning with q2 of this fiscal year.
i noted earlier that we are financially stronger today than we have been for several years, particularly with respect to our materially improved balance sheet and financial firepower. we started q4 with $520 million of cash. during the quarter, we paid out our term debt facility using almost $90 million to do so. this frees us from restricted debt covenants and results in principal and interest savings of approximately $6 million per quarter, which moves us further toward positive free cash flow in the coming quarters.
despite paying off our term debt, we still ended the quarter with $440 million of cash. additionally, we have the usd1 billion shelf prospectus, including the full amount of the usd300 million at the market facility still available. these are available as financial firepower as we prepare for strategic and creative opportunities. so to wrap up, what i hope you take away from our q4 financial results is the following.
aurora has a clear path forward to being adjusted ebitda positive by the first half of our next fiscal year through actions that we control. and we have significantly strengthened our balance sheet with more cash and working capital and having eliminated secured term debt. now, i'll turn the call back to miguel.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
thanks, glen. before we go to q&a, i want to talk briefly about our science and innovation business group, which we feel is a real differentiator. we launched this group last may with the goal of commercializing patented and patent-pending technology, which we believe will be key to developing cannabinoid production in biosynthesis and the plan itself. through licensing agreements, aurora and 22nd century group share the global ip rights that are key in commercializing key aspects of cannabinoid production and biosynthesis and plants.
we believe the long-term market for cannabinoid molecules, produced biosynthesis where the plant will be incredibly profitable, and we have seen global market size estimates of $10 billion by 2025. as i said, this is a long-term effort, but one that we believe will ultimately allow companies to bring a wide array of new-generation products to the market. when someone else is using the technologies and infringing our rights, we expect to be compensated, either willingly or through legal action. in addition to ip, our industry-leading genetics and breeding program is positioning aurora to win in the flower and concentrate consumer categories.
this program is expected to not only drive more revenue by injecting rotation and variety into our product pipeline, but also greatly improve the efficiencies of cultivation through higher-yielding plants, higher cannabinoids, and better disease resistance. our team has been able to screen over 7,000 unique cultivars in 2021 alone. in august and september of 2021, aurora launched the first three new proprietary cannabis cultivars in our san raf brand, all of which have distinct terpene profiles and high thc potency. we are already seeing the results through nearly $1 million in sales since their launch.
the genetics and breeding program, which is an asset-light business model, is always expected to generate high-margin revenue through license agreements. so to wrap up our call today, i'd like you to take away the following. first, we are the no. 1 canadian lp in the global medical business by revenue, which is a huge and growing total addressable market.
second, the expertise here will transfer to adult rec as medical-only jurisdictions continue to open up. aurora will be the partner of choice. third, despite cost savings that will get us to profitability, we are still developing proprietary and protected premium product that is being sold and licensed. innovation will be the lifeblood of success in this industry, and positive cash flow and a strong balance sheet will be required.
not all of our competitors have this, but aurora does. lastly, canadian rec will come back. that time line won't impede our strategic or financial progress. aurora has shown an incredible agility over the last two years.
the final leg of our transformation is well underway and with the unique attributes that we bring to this dynamic opportunity, i've never been more confident in where the company is as we head into fiscal 2022. we look forward to sharing further progress on upcoming calls, and that concludes our prepared remarks. before moving to analyst questions, i will answer a few questions from our retail shareholders who are invited to submit questions ahead of today's call.
ananth krishnan -- vice president, corporate development and investor relations
thanks, miguel. prior to analyst questions, we will be addressing three questions from our retail shareholders. so, miguel, the first question is, when will you be ebitda positive? and why should investors now believe that the time is right to be ebitda positive they've been waiting for profitability?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
and first and foremost, i can absolutely sympathize with the frustration around past milestones not being achieved. but there's a big difference between what we're seeing now and what we said then. those forecasts were based on assumptions of revenue growth, and that's not what we're seeing here now. we've initiated aggressive cost-saving measures and then when fully implemented, we expect we'll get us to ebitda profitability.
none of our core businesses need to grow revenue or increase their margin from the q4. i think it's also important to understand that we do have a history of delivering on our transformation plans. we've got sg&a from over 100 million a quarter to the low 40s. we've aligned production to sales.
we reduced complexity in our network and sold a number of facilities. we've significantly cut capex and improved working capital. and also, we have a completely new team that is executing this plan. i mentioned lori schick and alex miller, but we have an incredible new talent up and down throughout the company.
so as i mentioned, we are relying on revenue growth to get us there. and -- but we still expect to be able to deliver it. so i think that's the [inaudible] confidence in this versus what's been said in the past.
ananth krishnan -- vice president, corporate development and investor relations
great. thank you, miguel. so our next question is, should we expect to see any acquisitions anytime soon given where the market is today and the recent consolidation seen in the cannabis sector?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
ananth, we're going to be really consistent on this point. our primary objective is to be ebitda positive and nothing is going to take our attention away from this objective. so i know there are some people that want us to be bigger and to chase market share, but we're not going to do a deal that sacrifices profitability in order to be a bigger, less profitable cannabis company. so there's been criticism in the past about the way the company has handled this space, and we're going to take a diligent and patient approach to m&a.
i think if you look at what's happened in the environment recently, i think being patient and diligence is absolutely the right path. so we're going to continue to look. and if there's something that makes sense that has a strong strategic rationale and that can bolster our ability to make money, we have the balance sheet and we have the ability to do it. but we're not going to risk shareholder capital without a strong business case.
ananth krishnan -- vice president, corporate development and investor relations
ok. great. and one last question from our retail shareholder base, miguel, before we kick it over to the analysts. we've seen many of your canadian lp competitors structure deals to enter the u.s.
thc market when it becomes federally legal. why has aurora been slow in addressing this key growth market?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
well, first and foremost, i would say we haven't been slow. we've been saying for a long time that the u.s. is going to take longer. many of our peers thought it was going to happen faster, and these investments would make more sense.
i think investors don't want a company to make a structured deal that may or may not transition into a profitable situation. that doesn't mean we're not looking at the u.s., but a couple of things there. first is -- and i'll keep saying it, our goal is to be a bit profitable. that is the unique position, the no.
1 canadian lp in terms of medical, the no. 1 global company in terms of all the things i've mentioned and profitability. that's our goal. and so flushing that all down the drain to chase something in the u.s., i don't think, is important.
secondly, we just had a big election in germany. and it's a big world out there, and i understand the interest in the u.s. and i've got a tremendous amount of respect for the msos and my canadian lp peers. but if you look at germany, if you look at israel, if you look at france, you look at these markets, there is a lot of money to be made, and we're doing that.
and we're doing, i think, an exceptional job of that. what the learnings are in those markets absolutely are applicable to the u.s., and we continue to believe that the path toward the u.s. will be through medical, will be through federal legalization and decriminalization. and clearly, if you look at the capabilities of aurora, both in canada and around the world, we will have a lot of options when the u.s.
does open up.
ananth krishnan -- vice president, corporate development and investor relations
that's great. so at this time, john, i'd like to turn it back over to you to open up the queue for analyst questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] the first question today comes from vivien azer with cowen. please go ahead.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. thank you, good evening. i wanted -- as important as the medical business is, and we've talked a lot about it on prior quarters, i actually wanted to focus on your consumer business in canada because the mix shift is apparent and it's certainly a positive evolution of your portfolio. and then in looking at the hifyre data, it looks like you're having some similar success and sequential market share gains for your portfolio.
so miguel, one question, but two parts. the first is, as you look at the components of your market share gains, and perhaps you can comment through the end of october since we've already closed out that month. which was the bigger driver, san raf or whistler? and then as a follow-up to that, how do you think about these third-party craft brands sitting in and driving not just top line growth, but also not being dilutive to your margins? thank you.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
you're very welcome. so viv, if you look overall in the canadian rec business, just a couple of points. one is we're only three years into it, and it's a bit of an irrational market. most of the market share gains from competitors are coming from the large pack size, which is really a value play.
and as we've talked about, we're focused on premium. so as an example, the discount 28 gram, which in some cases might even have a negative margin in certain provinces, people are chasing because of excess inventories and a bunch of other things. we're exiting that. when you look at quebec, we see extremely strong response.
so specifically to answer your question, we're seeing most of our premium growth in san raf. and this was a strategy we announced about a year ago, and you're definitely seeing others follow it. if you want to have really large market shares, i just don't think it's a profitable strategy in the short term. this market will rationalize a bit.
the other thing, as you talked about hifyre data and clearly, syndicated data is evolving and is getting better, but it's just not there yet in a way that maybe others would look to say in the u.s. of iri, nielsen or in tobacco like msa. and so while we look at hifyre data, it's only 50% coverage in ontario. it's only 30% to 40% coverage in a.b., b.c.
and saskatchewan. and there really is little coverage in the sqdc where we see a lot of our overall business. so i don't think it's the end all to be all. at the end of the day, there are places where you can make money in canadian rec premium aspects, in some of those premium categories definitely are that, we're focused on that.
and i think for those that are really of their hard set or looking at overall market share, i just don't think there's a direct correlation between overall market share. so we're going to stay focused on san raf and whistler. we've seen great response there of our new cultivars. we also then can take some of those assets and put it into medical.
and i do think if you look at colorado and california, as an example, you do see premium categories start to evolve and really articulate. i got to believe that we're going to see that in canada. it's just not there yet. so we're not going to chase down the rabbit hole with lower margins, particularly in the discount category.
operator
the next question comes from pablo zuanic with cantor fitzgerald. please go ahead.
pablo zuanic -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
thank you. i'm going to focus on the export business. you talked about the stickiness, right, compliance, your science, your innovation. but can you just discuss more the cost side of things? i mean, your -- my understanding is you're shipping in europe from denmark, right.
we hear other producers that claim to be low cost and that they could enter europe. i'm sure it's not as simple as that. but just talk more about stickiness because the idea that compliance -- being compliant with the regulatory framework in those countries is a key competitive advantage makes me wonder whether others could easily emulate that and just break in with lower cost and maybe more distribution than you have. if you can expand on that, please.
thank you.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
sure, i'll be happy to, pablo. so it's absolutely an advantage and you have -- take a look at germany. the reality is the standard in germany is you have to have within a 10% deviation on the core components, particularly potency. that's a really hard thing to do.
and so you have to have a pretty advanced facility in order to be able to consistently meet that. that had a big role in us gaining almost a third of the entire flower business. so that would be one example. the second example would be israel.
i talked about the imca, and yuval landschaft's leadership. they have the highest standards of anyone in the world and include about 44 pesticides that no one else has even tested for. so it's not only having cumcs certification, which is a pretty unique certification beyond eu gmp, but also your ability to test, package, ship and have all of that has made a significant difference in israel. i don't think even though that there are places around the world where you can produce cannabis cheaper, that the overall certification, reporting, consistency of production and entering those markets make that as viable.
i mean, remember, we're talking about medical patients. we're not talking just about recs. medical patients and their clinicians and their physicians will find an item that they like. they want it to be of the highest possible quality and consistently available to them.
and so that is the same situation over and over and over. and there's a reason why the same companies are being successful in germany, u.k., france, netherlands, israel and it's about compliance, regulatory forward, all of that infrastructure that you need. and while -- and maybe in the short-term, there's a little bit that you can do on low-cost products, is not there. and i will say also that this is a place where like-minded companies agree.
and so while we may be competing against some of the larger other lps, we all agree that having a proper regulatory framework and adherence to compliance measures make sense. so there's no disagreement on that. so there's absolutely a high bar to get in. it makes a huge difference, and it's obviously the reason why we've done so well in some of these key markets.
you mentioned shipping costs. yes, we do ship from our denmark facility, and in some cases, particularly with israel, we ship from canada. it's not insignificant, but it's not a prohibitive cost because in many cases, you're shipping bulk and getting into finished goods in market.
operator
the next question comes from michael lavery with piper sandler. please go ahead.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. good evening. actually, i just want to go back to the rec business as well. and just to understand some of the context and outlook and specifically, with san raf and whistler, in particular, having 29% sequential growth and all of medical, even with the international boost from israel, being up, i think, 17% sequentially.
it was clearly a really strong performer in the quarter. you've made it very, very clear, your emphasis on the medical side. so i guess just how to think about this? is it just that you can walk and chew gum or was there some more one-off things driving that that aren't as sustainable? can you just give us a sense of, is rec really just a question of premiumizing and that you can do that and it's the focus within that piece? or is it just a little bit more lumpy and medical is really the focus?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
well, i think, michael, right now, clearly, if you look at margins and you look at overall profit opportunities globally, it's medical. so margins in the mid-60s really sticky, meeting all the infrastructure, high hurdles to get in, all the compliance stuff i mentioned internationally, medical takes a unique skill set, and that's one that we have. i think on rec, it really -- right now, you have to remember that in canada, we're only three years into this experiment. and in the discount arena, which is a decent part of the overall business, it really is a commodity.
and so pricing is really driving all of those major decisions. and so we're just not going to chase that at the expense of profitability. in the premium categories, new differentiated and innovative really matters. and so those unique cultivars make a big difference.
and we see that articulate itself with whistler and san raf. the benefit of our system is we also can take those same products and put it into the medical business. and so you'd find whistler products, which we've now put into our medical channel doing exceedingly well with our patients. you see the same thing with san raf products.
so there are efficiencies. so the point of chewing gum and walking at the same time is clearly an opportunity to get benefits out of both. but i think if you're laser-focused on profitability and sustainability, you're going to focus on those areas that are more consistent, which are right now is medical. now we're not taking our eye off of rec.
i just think rightsizing and doing it an appropriate way and also finding areas where they're more asset light. the genetics business that we've invested in historically is wonderfully accretive. biosynthetics and other aspects of genetics, we think will be really important in a global environment as people are looking for that. so i think as we weighed out our strategy, we're right on track where we want to be steady as we go.
and i think over time, the rec business in canada will become more rational. and in that, the efficiencies that companies like us will have will come more to bear. but right now those that are chasing the discount business, i think they're in for a little bit of more of a rocky road, but the premium business is rational. and for those that say that the rec business is broken, i would ask them to take a good look at colorado and california, which appear to be about 18 months ahead of canada, and you are seeing good success not only in margin-accretive categories, but in premium brands.
operator
the next question comes from andrew carter with stifel. please go ahead.
andrew carter -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
i wanted to ask about the canadian medical business. i think it was down 8% year-over-year. so i know that there are some patients that are sticky, the government reimbursement, some that are more fluid. but could you kind of give us a sense of where that business should stabilize and you should see that start to grow from either market share or patient growth standpoint? thanks.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
sure, i'd be happy, andrew, and thank you for the question. so i'll kick it off and then let glen come in on the back side of it. but right now, we're seeing a little bit of interaction, as glen mentioned, between the rec business and the medical business. i think it's mostly in those that aren't receiving reimbursement, most evidenced by the fact that we grew share, yet you saw a little bit of a decline.
it's hard to say what the steady state is. we're hearing some positive news about unions and different groups that will be bringing cannabis on. right now it's only about 1% of the adult population in canada is connected to that system. so we do see an opportunity to not only see [inaudible] grow a little bit as things normalize, but also continue to grow share.
glen?
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
yeah, thanks. quarter-over-quarter, the sales to the reimbursement groups, in veterans in particular, was absolutely consistent. i think there was $3,000 difference quarter-to-quarter. so it continues to be very strong.
a little of the decline that you talked about are, well, all of the decline is in some of those non-reimbursement patients. so we -- as miguel mentioned, there are groups out there that we have targeted. we continue to work toward kind of really into contracts in that way. we're also launching a number of products and innovations that we believe will appeal to our existing patient population, particularly the reimbursement ones.
so you might have seen something launched, i think, in the last couple of days as the pac system, a nice bundle for veteran patients, [inaudible] and great pricing to continue to reward and engage those that are -- really important patients for us. so we think we can get more out of the current patient population and then continue to look for some of those stepwise changes in bringing in associations and unions.
operator
the next question comes from john zamparo with cibc. please go ahead.
john zamparo -- cibc world markets -- analyst
i was hoping you could help us better understand how you expect the netherlands market will play out. and generally, miguel, you prefer medical-only markets. but it sounds like you're excited about the netherlands transitioning to rec. i would say your performance globally has been better in medical markets than in consumer.
so is the reason for excitement on the dutch system that it seems like its limited license with barriers to entry? and can you talk about your confidence in why it will stay that way over the long term? thanks.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
john, it's a great question. so i had the pleasure of being out there and spending time with our teams, spending time in the market and more importantly spending time with our partner, which is the growery. i mean, as i think everyone knows, this is -- the cannabis experiment in the netherlands is 50 years in the making. the reality today is it's a very sort of formal and legalized structure for the coffee shops, the over 600 retail outlets, but the production parts has been sort of a black hole.
the government particularly wants to clean that up and create much more of a legal market. so i get excited when there's financial incentives. there are only 10 licensees in this experiment, and we're one of them. and we're excited about the partner that we have.
clearly, there are going to be advantages for those 10 at a time in which we expect this goes legal. all the economic incentives line up. and yes, we do like a medical-only market given our expertise and given sort of how we've gone about it. but i believe that medical is a step toward rec.
when you have a strong relationship with the regulators, you can understand the marketplace, you have a sense of what product portfolios are doing well. it gives you a significant advantage. this is a massive market. we've talked about it being when it all goes potentially even as big as canada and there's going to be a clear advantage for those that participate early.
so for that reason, we're excited about it. we clearly have a lot of infrastructure in that part of the world and success. and so i clearly believe that countries like this success begets success in a lot of different ways. and so this is an example, i think, of where we are bullish and the opportunity to have it, participate both in the medical and rec business.
and so more to follow on that, but this is really one of only 10 licensees. we've got one of them. we've got a great partner. it's a big, big market and all the incentives from the government, the regulators, the retail owners all line up well here, and so we think we're in a good spot.
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
i'm going to add just a couple of comments. so as miguel said, 50 years in the making, this is an established market. so there's not sort of guess work on how big the market will be. there's a number of cities that are required, all the coffee shops and most of these are required to participate in this trial.
and one of the things i like is this is right on strategy for us. i mean, it is, we'll call it premium margins, premium pricing. so this is typical pricing, international pricing and markets for us. so it's a very compelling opportunity, and we're excited to be -- we think one of the leading companies involved there.
operator
the next question comes from tamy chen with bmo. please go ahead.
tamy chen -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thanks. good evening. the 29% sequential increase of sales in your premium consumer brands, i mean, that's pretty impressive. but can you help us understand, like is this growth from activating more store funds to carry our new cultivars? or, i guess, some of this growth in new orders because these products are seeing good consumer traction.
and i'm also just curious like when do you expect to actually be in a state of sequential growth in your consumer segment? because i know the decline of daily special sort of puts an offset to your premium strategy. thank you.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
you are welcome, tamy. thanks for the question. i'll take the first part and let glen take the sequential quarters. so i would say that there's -- as with all things with the consumer product, there are probably four primary reasons why we're seeing growth.
first and foremost, the products are better. so if you look at the uniqueness of the attributes, if you look at the potency, if you look at the genetics and those new cultivars and what we're seeing on san raf across the board are better. takes longer than i would like for this reset to take hold. but so the overall proposition, i would say, is more compelling.
secondly, you correctly brought up distribution. we've partnered with what i consider to be the best and largest broker in canada that has national coverage. southern glazer does a wonderful job for us. and every month, we're able to touch about 90% of the volume, which allows these new brands to get in.
third is, as you know, navigating the provincial buyers is hard. and so the fact that these new cultivars are differentiated, unique, higher potency has given us a higher success rate of getting them through that process, which particularly in ontario, i think it's a challenge and you hear from everyone. and i think, lastly, the overall sort of consistency and as we see new being the most important thing that people are buying, the steady sort of rollout of these and seeing that not only in flower, but other brands, has started to bring some of the shine back to san raf, particularly with budtender and store owners. and so we're going to continue to roll this out.
we're really pleased with the coverage, so to speak, of our genetics. you're going to see everything from continued new cultivars and new genetics from san raf and whistler, but you're also going to see a lot of seasonals and you're going to see what we call collaborations. the north 40, for those that are familiar with gord, and that company, they are one of the preeminent craft growers. and for him to select farm gas and to be so positive about it and do so well, speaks to our ability to produce cutting-edge genetics.
and i think for a lot of people that thought that big cannabis can't grow great, niche, high-quality flower, i think that's a testament that we absolutely can and will. glen, do you want to pick up on the run rate from quarter-over-quarter?
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
yeah. sure. tamy, we were up in most provinces, a good 50% or more in alberta, b.c. and quebec is a strong point for us, for sure.
i think 33% of our consumer revenue came out of quebec in q1. ontario has been not the crack, obviously. and i think we've put a great foot forward with the recent product call and the innovation that miguel was talking about, i think is the route forward there. so i expect that as miguel has outlined it, it's a continuing challenge in the consumer market.
but the innovation that we've been putting forward and the success that we've seen with that innovation to date, i think, is positioning us well to get this back on track over the next little while. and again, i think ontario is the key for us because we are seeing the pickup in the other provinces where we've been able to get the product into market. quebec, for instance, is interesting in that if you're selling it in quebec, it's in all of the stores. and it's all also -- there's not as many lps in quebec, it's just a different market and there's certain constraints and only certain lps can operate in quebec effectively.
so great market for us. san raf has been there since the beginning and has a great reputation. so when we put -- when we renew the brand with new cultivars and especially the type of cultivars we put in there, we see the pickup and we see the response, you see it in social media and things like that. so that's the route forward for sure.

the next question comes from doug miehm with rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
douglas miehm -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yeah. good evening. my question just has to do, you talked about the stickiness of the international medical business. and i'm just curious, the $16 million or so and with the large order coming out of the israel during the quarter, is this sustainable? or are we going to see a little volatility over the next several quarters? or are we going to have a benefit from other countries offsetting maybe a decrease in israel quarter-to-quarter?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
yeah. so it's a great question. so certain markets are steadier than other markets; germany, u.k. are steadier.
when you see other markets, say, like poland as an example, this last quarter, we saw a bit of a regulatory hitch for a lot of companies, including us, and that caused a delay in timing. israel is a bit of an evolving market. so it's hard for us to say it's going to be steady. but when it's open, we do extremely well.
so we don't really give guidance on israel. now to your point about other markets opening up, we always hope for that. you'll know about the big ones. so france is obviously in their process.
we talked about the netherlands. and so i can't give you an exact sort of guidance quarter-over-quarter there. but what i can tell you, though, is that it is the same conditions that either open or close the market. can you meet the standards? what's happening with the overall product specs? what's going on with the packaging? what's happening with the testing? all of that is sort of consistent.
so when you win, you win consistently. and while there are timing points or hiccups or whatever you want to describe it, we've done really well. we -- i think more so than almost anybody, when there are profit opportunities to be had, we're there. israel is a really good example.
i've spent time in tel aviv, i have incredible respect for yuval landschaft, who's the lead regulator with the imca. we were one of the first companies to be able to navigate that process and ship what we think is the largest amount of cannabis in israel, three of the nine flower tenders in france. and so i wish it was steadier and sort of more formulaic about us being able to project it out. but i think if you're bullish on the macro theory of global cannabis and you understand the high regulatory hurdles, and you understand that these regulators all talk to each other and there's a lot of interaction.
you're going to see the same companies win time after time after time. and i absolutely believe the fda is going to be running a similar process, and they're going to take a deep interest in what's happened with agencies such as the imca in israel or health canada in canada. glen, anything you want to add?
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
doug, the diversification of the country, so miguel alluded to it. it's really important to have a basket of countries as they're all developing. poland, for instance, where we sold almost nothing until last quarter, as we had to reregister our danish production facility for shipments into poland. and now we've got that registration and shipments into poland restarted in october.
but that -- so poland down, but the u.k. was up 50% and australia was up 50%. so for us, the diversified basket of international markets is important as they develop, to your point doug, some will offset others as we grow. and it makes it a little bit more predictable, a little bit more consistent to have that portfolio.

the next question comes from frederico gomes with atb capital markets. please go ahead.
frederico gomes -- atb capital markets -- analyst
yup. good evening, guys. thanks for taking my question. i just want to go back to your investment in the netherlands.
when should we expect sales to start there? just how long will it take for your partners there to start operating? and then in terms of margins there as well. i know you touched on the premium strategy there, but i imagine that those margins, they wouldn't be as good as your -- as your international medical shipments. thanks.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
glen, do you want to kick it off and then i'll --
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
yeah, i'll start. yes. thanks, fred. yes, it's a very -- listen, i'm really interested in this market.
i think it's really cool to see a well-established market like that that will actually have aurora brands in the coffee shops when you go to amsterdam or some of the cities that are participating there. so i look forward to that. we expect sales to start in calendar '23, so a little over a year from now. and in between now and then, the licensees, they're getting their final sort of approvals and building out their facilities in countries.
so that's what's happening before. so it starts kind of beginning of calendar '23, we expect to see sales just after that. the margins are similar to the type of international margins. we see that the pricing, like most regulated markets, is fairly strong.
and we expect to get healthy -- think about kind of medical like margins, which is why we're keenly interested in it. it's not a consumer market like you see in canada or more of a premium. so that's how i think of margins and timing of the revenues.

this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to miguel martin for any closing remarks.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
well, i want to thank everybody, and i hope you and your families are safe this season. we're all excited about where we are as a company. our transformation plan is on track. we look forward to sharing that success with you as we come in the upcoming quarters, and we appreciate everything that you do and covering aurora.
all the best. thank you.

greetings, and welcome to the aurora cannabis inc. first quarter 2022 results conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, tuesday, november 9, 2021. i would now like to turn the conference over to your host, ananth krishnan, vice president, corporate development and investor relations.
please go ahead.
ananth krishnan -- vice president, corporate development and investor relations
thank you, betsy, and thank you all for joining us. with me today are aurora's ceo, miguel martin; and cfo, glen ibbott. after the market closed today, aurora issued a news release announcing our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal '22. the release, accompanying financial statements and md&a are available on our ir website and via sedar and edgar.
in addition, you can find a supplemental information deck on our ir website. listeners are also reminded that certain matters discussed in today's conference call could constitute forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our future financial or business performance. actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements and the risk factors that may affect actual results are detailed in our annual information form and other periodic filings and registration statements. these documents may be accessed via sedar and edgar.
following prepared remarks by miguel and glen, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. for retail investors, we have compiled questions submitted to us prior to the call. for analysts, we will ask that you limit yourselves to one question and then get back in the queue. with that, i would like to turn the call over to miguel.
please go ahead. 
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
thank you, ananth. we are pleased that our track record of strategic and financial progress from fiscal 2021 has carried into the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and in our efforts to build shareholder value or gain momentum. our transformation plan is on track, and we continue to expect to achieve adjusted ebitda profitability sometime in the first half of fiscal 2023. we focus on four areas to achieve this goal.
first, we're the no. 1 canadian lp in global medical cannabis revenue with leading margins of over 60%. this is nearly double what the industry generates in adult rec. it's our competitive advantage, and it's why we're allocating further resources to the canadian, european and israeli medical markets.
long term, we see medical continuing to expand globally, and we strongly believe the leader in medical will be the key beneficiary of recreational cannabis when legalized. second is redesign the company to create a more efficient and effective enterprise. a big part of this is expense reduction. we've already achieved run rate savings of approximately $33 million from our announced plan in september, which puts us on target to achieve $60 million to $80 million in cost savings without impacting planned growth investments.
third is our strong balance sheet and improved cash burn of only $16.6 million this quarter. this not only supports our organic growth, but also provides us with the means to evaluate m&a opportunities. to be clear, if and when we make an acquisition, it will be accretive with managerial talent we don't currently possess and align with our premiumization strategy. fourth, our science and innovation business unit.
this business unit is focused on launching a strong pipeline of new releases globally to leverage our intellectual property in genetics and biosynthesis. but first, let's briefly discuss medical cannabis and adult rec. in canada, we represent about 23% of the medical market, almost twice that of our closest peer, but only 1% of the population are currently patients. given the fragmented nature of this channel, we have a clear opportunity to expand our presence through education and by helping patients navigate medical cannabis alternative treatments through our proprietary end-to-end experience, and this represents a great long-term opportunity for us.
our international medical business continued to show exceptional growth, growing by 146% over the prior year comparative period. we shipped a total of $8 million during q1 to our partner in israel, cantek, which we believe is the largest single shipment of cannabis that israel has ever received. while we may still see month-to-month fluctuations of purchase orders from our israeli partners, this is a tremendous vote of confidence in the quality of aurora's products and is a proof point of our ability to profitably navigate a complex and evolving regulatory environment. also contributing to international medical during q1 was our continued success in germany, where we have a leading position in dry flower and a growing share of its oil market.
we also saw over 50% sales growth in both the u.k. and australian markets this quarter, which we expect to become significant profit drivers for us in the future. in france, we delivered our first shipment in august for their pilot program, under which we will supply the entire medical cannabis dried flower range. our expertise in medical cannabis and the ability to operate within a highly regulated framework gives us a great opportunity to expand in the global adult rec when those markets open up.
this has been proven repeatedly over time, and now we are seeing this in the netherlands, which based on today's global regulatory framework, we expect to become the largest federally regulated recreational market outside of canada. yesterday, we announced an agreement to invest in netherlands-based growery, one of 10 license holders entitled to participate in the controlled cannabis supply chain experiment, the ccsc. although we are providing growery with a secured loan to construct a facility and fund early operations, our cash investment upfront is minimal, and the remainder of our investment is dependent on achieving certain milestones. during the ccsc, approximately 80 out of the nearly 600 coffee shops in the country will only sell legally produced cannabis from the 10 approved federally licensed producers.
should the trial be expanded on nationally, we estimate a market size of about $10.8 billion annually, which is about the same size of the canadian market. on canadian adult rec, we believe this segment is still in the process of bottoming. that's why our focusing on rec is on higher quality, higher potency, higher margin products that drove a 29% sequential revenue increase in our premium and super premium dry flower products. in contrast, the overall segment was relatively steady in q1.
it's important to note that the discount segment of receive is largely a commodity, almost completely driven by price. this will certainly create issues for the foreseeable future, which is why we're pleased to have focused on premium rec. but more generally, a strategy that centers on high-margin, high-growth medical that's a key differentiator. and finally, in terms of our science and innovation business unit, we believe it provides aurora with a strong right to win in premium consumer categories.
within this unit is our world-leading genetics and breeding program, which we expect to become a real differentiator for aurora with the ability to bring new high cannabinoid cultivars to market that are more customer focused, sustainable and profitable. the breeding program located at aurora coast, the state-of-the-art facility in vancouver island's comox valley is expected to drive revenues through genetic rotation into our product pipeline and greatly improve the efficiencies of cultivation through our higher yielding plants, higher cannabinoids and better disease resistance. we are also expecting revenue growth through genetic licensing agreements for these novel cultivars. four new proprietary cannabis cultivars with distinct terpene profiles and high thc potency have already been developed.
these include our three san raf cultivars launched in september and farm gas, which we launched licensed in north 40, the saskatchewan-based premium micro-producer. while we are just building out this part of our business, and you'll hear much more about it soon, we view genetic licensing as a capital-light long-term revenue growth opportunity for aurora and one that will ultimately bring a wide array of products to the market. finally, we also believe that our intellectual property includes the most efficient pathway for cannabinoid biosynthetic production, which puts us in a pivotal position with nearly all cannabinoid biosynthetic work being undertaken in the industry today. we're actively working to build, partner, enforce and protect as valuable intellectual property.
i would now like to turn the call over to glen so that we can provide his financial review.
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
thanks, miguel, and good afternoon, everyone. i appreciate you all joining us today. i will now review our q1 2022 financials, which i believe show both the distinctive strengths of our business and our progress on our business transformation program. let me point out a few of the highlights.
we have one of the stronger balance sheets among canadian lps. this consists of approximately $424 million in cash, no term debt and access to $1 billion through a shelf prospectus, including a $300 million. our capacity to raise capital is available to us as financial firepower to be used for strategic and accretive m&a opportunities. our cash flow also continues to substantially improve year-over-year.
in q1, cash use was $16.6 million, down from $142.8 million in the comparable period a year ago. we have plenty of cash to fund our operations as we move toward profitability and positive free cash flow. our core medical businesses continued to deliver overall growth and a normalized gross margin in the 60% range with 64% in q1 2022. this strong margin profile has held steady over the past few quarters and is an important gross profit driver that both distinguishes us from our competitors and is critical to reaching positive ebitda.
of course, our sg&a is also a fraction of what it used to be in prior years. and upon continued execution of our business transformation plan will be coming down further. at a summary level, our q1 results benefited from our broad diversification across international medical, domestic medical and adult recreational segments. overall, q1 net cannabis revenue was $60.1 million, 10% higher than last quarter.
our medical cannabis segment continues to excel, generating $41 million in sales and a gross margin of 64%. medical represents about 68% of our q1 revenue and about 81% of our gross profit. our consumer cannabis business delivered $19.1 million and a gross margin of 32%. overall, q1's adjusted gross margin before fair value adjustments was 54%.
this compares favorably to 48% a year ago and 53% last quarter. the increase in adjusted gross margin is due primarily to a shift in sales mix toward medical market, which delivers higher average net selling prices and margins. on a related note, our average net selling price per gram of dry cannabis rose 21% to $4.67 from $3.86 in q1 of last year, reflecting the increasing prominence of our medical cannabis business. now a bit more detail on each of our business segments.
our canadian medical revenue was $25.1 million in q1 and reflected the consistent performance in the face of the continued consumer retail industry rollout. as we have said previously, our canadian medical patients can be segmented into two groups: those with cost reimbursement coverage and those without a reimbursement program. our success is really driven by our high-volume insured patient groups, whose reimbursement makes them consistent and reliable buyers. and this is why we have made patient groups with reimbursement coverage a high-focused priority in our medical business.
that said, we may see some migration of price-sensitive non-reimbursement patients from the medical channel to the adult recreational channel as that market continues to develop over time. our international medical revenue was $15.9 million, and that reflected a 146% growth versus the prior year and 84% sequentially. q1 revenue included $7.9 million of sales to israel. as i said on our last conference call, bds analytics estimate the market size of about $3.2 billion by 2025 for just germany, poland, u.k., france and israel.
clearly, international medical is worthy of our focus on investment and demonstrates why aurora's leadership internationally is an important driver of long-term shareholder value. our q1 consumer revenue was $19.1 million, which was relatively consistent compared to the prior quarter. our premiumization strategy gains traction as evidenced by a 29% sequential revenue growth in our premium dry flower category, largely driven by the launch of three new cultivars. consumer margins were healthy at 32%, up over last quarter as we saw the shift in our sales mix toward the premium margin side of our portfolio.
put it together and we see the directional change we'd like to see with consumer gross profit up 5% from last quarter, benefiting from our purposeful mix shift toward premium. now for sg&a, which includes r&d, it remains well controlled coming in at $44 million in q1, excluding restructuring and prior period adjustments. and while we've made a lot of progress in driving down sg&a, we are also implementing measures to take out further costs. these efforts should get us well below our $40 million quarterly run rate by the time we exit this fiscal year.
so pulling all of this together, we generated an adjusted ebitda loss in q1 2022 of $11.5 million, excluding $600,000 of termination restructuring charges. the $4 million decrease in ebitda loss, as compared to last quarter was primarily driven by q1's 10% increase in revenues, while adjusted gross margin remained strong and steady. for clarity, in our adjusted ebitda, we do not include the benefit of $14.4 million of government wage subsidy grant that we report in other income as this program has now been phased out by the canadian federal government. now let me remind you of the timing along our path to ebitda profitability.
approximately 60% of cash savings under the business transformation program are expected to be realized on the p&l and our cost of goods as inventory is drawn down following the implementation of our lower production cost structure. we would expect to see those savings in our p&l beginning late this fiscal year and into the next. the remaining 40% of cash savings will show up in sg&a as they are executed beginning with q2 of this fiscal year. so to wrap up, two key takeaways from these financial results.
we have a clear path forward to being adjusted ebitda positive by some point in the first half of our next fiscal year through actions that we control. and our balance sheet remains strong with a healthy cash balance and improved working capital and cash flow. now i'll turn the call back to miguel.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
thanks, glen. before we go to q&a, let me leave you with these final thoughts. we are very pleased that our transformation plan is on track, and it's important to note that the foundation of that plan is medical cannabis where we expect continued revenue growth with very high margins. aurora remains the no.
1 canadian lp by medical cannabis revenues globally, and we've been able to differentiate ourselves in canada through investment in our proprietary end-to-end patient infrastructure, which create barriers to entry in a sticky insured patient base. we expect to be a market leader as jurisdictions around the world continue to open up. our no. 1 position in medical also paves the way for success in global adult recreational cannabis.
as medical-only jurisdictions evolve, our most recent proof point is in netherlands, but others will surely follow. our regulatory compliance, testing and commitment to science, make aurora the ideal partner in both medical and rec over the next decade. as far as adult rec in canada, we believe the market is in the process of bottoming and we are encouraged that our premiumization strategy is gaining traction. we also expect continued innovation in our product pipeline, supported by our science and innovation program.
most importantly, any softness related to the discount segment will impede our ability to reach profitability. to that point, we've already achieved $33 million run rate cost savings, but more on the way. this positions us to achieve ebitda profitability in the first half of fiscal 2023, and our team is aligned and energized to get there. thanks for your time today.
we're excited about the secular opportunity that continues to be very significant. we look forward to updating you on our progress. before we take questions from our analysts, i will turn the call over to ananth to ask a few questions from our retail shareholders who were invited to submit questions ahead of today's call. ananth, please go ahead.
ananth krishnan -- vice president, corporate development and investor relations
thanks, miguel. let's begin their questions. the first one here is the following. when do you expect to enter the u.s.
market?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
so ananth, it's a great question. first and foremost, know that we are spending a lot of time focused on the u.s. and paying attention to the u.s. i personally have over 25 years working in the u.s.
with the fda, atf, dea and have a very keen sort of perspective on this topic. what i will say is that our strategy of being thoughtful and being patient has clearly paid off. if you look at assets in the u.s., they have declined in overall value by 60% to 70%. and so taking our time from a valuation standpoint clearly has been the right play.
and secondly, the biden administration has been consistent, medical first plus decriminalization. and so with that, we expect that the no. 1 canadian medical company and one of the largest canadian lps medically globally will have something to say about that. so when you think about our overall goal of ebitda profitability, we're not going to put that into risk by looking for a nontraditional investment.
that being said, with the right opportunity, we have the balance sheet and financial flexibility to be opportunistic when we see the right transaction. and so as we go forward with that, we'll continue to keep an eye on it. we understand the news of this week and what's been put forth. and obviously, we'll pay attention.
but i'll leave you with this. the work that we do in germany, the netherlands, the u.k. and israel, all around the world in excellence, in a regulatory compliant framework is what best positions us to be successful in the u.s.
ananth krishnan -- vice president, corporate development and investor relations
great. thanks, miguel. our next question is; can you tell us more about your upcoming product launches and new innovation initiatives.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
absolutely. so first and foremost, as a company that has a globally diversified business, we get benefits out of innovation, out of our scientific progress, both in the medical business, but also in the rec business, which is probably more of the gist of your question. if you look at our full year 2022 innovation calendar, includes over 80 new skus. in q4 full year '21, we delivered 25 compelling new products to the market, followed by another 22 skus in q1 of 2021.
and this has clearly been our most significant and successful innovation push since legalization. those innovation skus are doing extremely well. and right now they're driving almost 40% of our wholesale revenue, reflecting really strong customer and consumer interest. those skus are heavily skewed toward new flower rotations that are powered by our genetics breeding facility that i mentioned previously, as well as new concentrate and edible skus that have been driven by historical investments in new capabilities and competencies.
beyond that, we're also seeing great value in limited runs and seasonal offerings. and this winter we'll be offering a canacane mints and cranberry vape for the holiday season under our drip rain that we think will be received very well. and we're also introducing hash for the first time, which we've relaunched under the whistler branding with new packaging and price points and are planning on releasing a whole new lineup of rotational genetics that come from our coast facility. so overall, there's a big focus on innovation.
we get benefit out of it, both in our rec medical businesses, and we see it as a key component of our premiumization strategy.
ananth krishnan -- vice president, corporate development and investor relations
perfect. and our third and final question from the retail shareholders is; which international markets do you view as the most important for the business? and how are you planning on staying ahead of the competition in those markets?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
well, ananth, yes, that's a great question. i think everybody has been so focused on the u.s. that people forget that there's a huge world out there with positive cannabis legislation and regulations evolving. we've talked about germany.
we've talked about u.k. we've talked about key markets like australia. but the reality is these are really big markets with huge opportunities. but each and every market has these core conditions, highly regulatory, be compliant, significant hurdles in everything from manufacturing to packaging, the sales and marketing.
so we see huge potential in our ability, and we've seen great success historically. but there are a couple of -- several core markets that we're really excited about, and i mentioned some of those on the call. israel was a large driver for us in q1. and we continue now the bulk sales that we'll have with our partner, cantek, to continue.
also, our partnership with one of the most forward regulatory agencies, the imca under the leadership of yuval landschaft has been really important. and we think the investments and work we've done with yuval and his team definitely will pay dividends globally. we've also announced our entry in the netherlands yesterday, which we expect to be significant, about a $2.8 billion market in the future. and in terms of european medical, which is set to become about a $5 billion market by 2025, we're really excited about our leadership in a couple of key areas.
the no. 1 supplier of flower in germany is of september, almost a 35 share, growing share of the oils market, and we've doubled that share since september. we also believe we're the no. 1 in the u.k.
dry flower business where we had an exceptional quarter. and as we've mentioned, we're the exclusive flower supplier, three of the nine tenders in the french medical cannabis pilot program. and as to what sets us apart from the competition, our consistent regulatory expertise, science, testing and compliance have been recognized all around the world as our ability and a real differentiator in our ability to succeed in those key markets. we're not going to rest on our laurels, and we're aiming to maintain and grow our market share as these markets develop.
and we know that the expertise and experiences that we have there will play well all around the world and including the u.s.
ananth krishnan -- vice president, corporate development and investor relations
that's great. thanks, miguel. so that's the end of the retail shareholder questions. operator, i'll turn it over to you for questions from the analysts.
",2022-Q1,ACB
0.9795,0.7586,,,":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from vivien azer with cowen. please state your question.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi, good evening.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
good evening vivien.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
so, i wanted to focus on medical, no surprise there, very strong results. but in particular, your canadian medical business, miguel, the call outs during the prepared remarks, around the benefit of insurance coverage were really interesting to me, and i would love for you and glen to expand on that. so one question, two parts. first, you just level set on the scope of insurance reimbursement as it stands today? and then part two, what the opportunity is to expand patient coverage from a reimbursement standpoint? thank you.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
got it. so first, i'm going to talk more of sort of a macro level, and i'll address your point on opportunity. i'll let glen walk you through the reimbursement numbers, the percentages and sort of the key stats, and we can obviously follow up for all about key components and that. in medical business in canada is a really good business.
and again, remind people, i know it's a bit older than the rack business, but it really is starting to develop a sophistication. it really is a dtc business. it's the direct-to-consumer, and we've done a lot of things that i think most people would expect out of the customary dtc business, but it's harder to do in a medical cannabis. and all of these things and really been focused on not only increasing the basket size, but also acquiring new patients.
and while our overall revenue was flat, as we mentioned, we grew market share. we have almost 23.5 market share today of the medical business, up from '19, next closest is half of that. and after that, it gets pretty dilutive. first and foremost, we've added significantly to the portfolio of products and premium products, and we have found that our patients are particularly interested in premium cannabis products.
i think most people would understand that with medication, but it's coming a little bit later into the overall cannabis business. secondly, the service for not only the patients, but the clinicians and the physicians has consistently improved. and so when you look at that, there are a lot of reasons to think that we will continue to grow share in that critical category. the other two points i'll make on that is that the infrastructure to service the medical patient both acquire, retain and move through that process is incredibly expensive, requires an incredible amount of effort, which is why you see so few competitors doing well.
the other part is, it is completely portable a lot of that same infrastructure and knowledge and experience with patients in the canadian market is directly applicable, and why we are dominating in other key markets such as u.k. and germany and france. the other point is the regulators have a common set of understanding. so health canada has an outweighed impact on the regulations in western europe, as well as in israel and other markets.
so again, muscle memory, expertise, portability, all play in to grow the overall medical business, not only in canada but internationally. now in terms of growing the pie, i would mention a couple of things. you're just starting to see clinical trials, peer-reviewed science and many of the customary metrics that you would see in medications and prescriptions that expand the pie for medical cannabis companies. clearly, like with other medications and the prescriptions, products that have been on the market for a longer period of time, and have a longer, what we call advocacy ladder would be advantages demands in that type of situation, so we think there's upside to that.
we talked a little bit about our genetics and science business, which clearly is of interest not only to our own patients, but those of other lps that get there so we can grow the pie that way. and then lastly, you're seeing a growth in insurers and union groups and the overall portfolio of companies that are considering cannabis for those patients. right now, it's 1% of the adult population in canada participates in that system, that's quite low. and germany just for perspective is 0.1.
so there's upside to grow the pie well in canada internationally. glen, maybe you can touch on some of the key metrics to answer this question.
glenn ibbott -- chief financial officer
thanks miguel. yes, it's a great question. like first of all, i'd say a minority of our patients do the majority of the ordering and deliver the majority of the gross profit, and they're the reimbursed patients. now there's a significant portion of our patients.
i think we've got the highest number of veterans and first responders in the country in their critical group. obviously, this is a really important medical treatment for them if you give the ptsd, whether it's you've been in a war zone, you've been on the front lines of healthcare or in front lines of policing. this is a really important treatment for you. through some of the coverage programs that some of these folks qualify for, they are reimbursed.
and what we're working on is that it's direct reimbursement they are reimbursed for up to high single digits per gram on cannabis. and so they become a little less price-sensitive and much more city in getting the right medicine which is a really critical component of this. so i think they're a great group. it's an important treatment for them, but it's strictly financially they really drive repeat orders at a high average dollar per gram.
for the growth that miguel was alluding to, we've told you in the past that we've invested in technology to support our medical business. this is a key part of it as employee or employer benefit programs and some of the insurance providers that run those programs offer up medical cannabis as an option than you do under host bending accounts. we've got the infrastructure now to connect directly into their system. so a patient can order medical cannabis and not have to go out of pocket on it and be directly covered through the insurance program through their work.
so if you add $500 a year through a health spending account or alternative treatments account, we've become positioned as, i'd say, a supplier of choice. so that's an opportunity for us to continue to work on the reimbursed or the insured patient group, which we think probably provides the best stickiest highest-value patients and also, quite frankly, near and dear to our hearts, and that we actually are making a difference in their lives. thanks for the question.

you've touched before on how medical and international medical is attractive in part because of the high margins and price points. can you just help me reconcile -- you talked about international sales were up 24% sequentially in the quarter, but then your companywide average selling price was down 10% sequentially, was any of that pressure from international? or what are some of the pricing dynamics there? how should we understand what that looks like?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
yes. i mean, michael, the pressure was not international. it was domestic. we -- i'll let glen walk you through the numbers, but we had pressure from some opportunistic wholesale selling, which as opposed to destroying product.
we sold it at a very low point. we also had some pressure in the rec business, and some of that was offset by mix. but the international margins are really haven't moved it all and they're incredibly strong. and so that's not there.
i mean, the reason why -- and i'm always surprised there's not more interest in it. medical cannabis is the fastest-growing segment of cannabis internationally. and you're seeing huge markets really being put on the path of thoughtful legislative process to bring cannabis forward, and we don't need to list of all the countries. we're in 12 countries and some big ones.
and the margin set up because it's really medications and runs through a federal construct does not have the same market pressures and clearly is a much more of a challenge to get into the business. so i mentioned that a year ago, in canada, there were 125 lps. today, there's 250. there's only a handful of cannabis companies that can meet the incredibly strict requirements internationally.
i mean germany, as an example, you have to be within 10% of spec for both potency and turf levels. and people will say, ""well, gees, that's pretty broad spec,"" but it's not when you have like a balanced product, it only has a 10% thc number, a 1% variance on agricultural products on a core item is really hard. so international is where the growth is. international is really hard to do well.
same companies are renting time after time. the margins are great. they're not moving and you're seeing steady progression and a consistency in how the countries look at it. i mean, glen, anything i missed on the margin?
glenn ibbott -- chief financial officer
no, great talking about the margins or insight into the margins, mike, specifically about average selling price, yes, there is a little bit of pressure in the consumer market. our average price in our canadian medical market came down as we sort of actively adjusted a couple of key products down to that reimbursement level i talked about, just to make sure that there is no impediments to these first responders and veterans ordering. so we actually picked up the velocity even though the asp was down slightly. i don't know overall.
internationally, listen, we had some very high asp markets come on this quarter. but the israeli sales are bulk sales. and so the way they show up in our average selling prices, they may actually look like they're decreasing the asp, but the margins are extremely high because we're just shipping a big bail of cannabis, there's no post-harvest handling, there's no bottling that stuff. so margin is great, even though the average selling price per gram, if you will, is down.
and i think for -- it's a great question because i think in the future, we'll have to peel that out a little bit for you to give you the transparency on the impact of large international bulk sales in our asp because quite frankly, if we pull that out, you'll see our asp going up.
mike lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from pablo zuanic with cantor fitzgerald. please state you question.
pablo zuanic -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
thank you. congratulations on the quarter. look, it's just along the same lines in terms of international markets. can you talk more about the stickiness that you're talking about, right? because when i hear bulk shipments to israel, i wonder that buyer there could switch to another supplier next quarter, right? i'm sure they cannot buy from colombia yet due to regulatory issues, but -- so i want to understand the control that you have of the supply chain there, whether are they selling your brand? do you have your own salespeople on the ground? or you're pretty much your shipping from canada and then they take control of the value chain because that means that it will not be so sticky.
and then the second point, when you talk about this unique ability to navigate complex regulatory environments and quoting from the press release, that sounds great. but it's -- in germany, when only 0.1% of population are patients, i wonder how unique is that really? i mean, i suppose other companies as domestic patients grow in germany could also have that skill set. if you can expand on those two points. thank you, miguel.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
sure, i'd be happy to. israel is unique, and i've spent a lot of time with that situation. so what you have today in israel is you've got roughly 100 local growers, including growers that are on the , and they hold really an outsized political influence. and the situation in israel right now of a country of nine million people and a tremendous hub of all things, cannabis right now is that locally, they've not been able to grow the quality of cannabis that they need in that market.
and it's a very high-margin market. i mean, a 10-gram increment is going for about 360 shekels. so pablo, what you're referencing is the least sticky of all the markets. and why is that? because right now, canadian lps and others that can meet the spec.
now the spec is incredibly hard to meet. cum cs, the imca, which is the regulatory agency in israel, a very thoughtful agency, led by a wonderful man, name yuval anchat, has created what may be 1 of the strictest of not the strictest barriers to get into pesticide testing that no one else sees. but if you can meet that standard, you can get your product in and import permits goes through of hot and cold. and because cannabis is so hot right now, there's not a lot of brands, what i would call equity.
with the possible exception of a local grower such as maybe intercure, i'll let you benefit something like that. but there's not that much stickiness for the canadian lps because the brands haven't developed themselves if you can meet the standard, you can get your product in and because there's such demand, you can get there. i think over time, israel will get stickier. i also think over time, the local growers who really are wonderful and are getting better each and every quarter, we'll have a larger percentage, if not the majority of the sales in israel, which is why we talk a lot about to be successful internationally, you have to diversify your business.
in the early days, you're going to see quarters like we had this quarter where we shipped the largest shipment ever in israel. we held the other record, too. and we're saying that in the quarter we're currently in, we're not going to have a shipment. so it's going to go hot and cold.
now stickiness outside of israel is absolutely sticky. getting into germany is a year-plus challenge, and it requires a significant investment in filings, in packaging and product production and naming conventions, and those clinicians are pretty steady with what they picked. australia is another one. if you have a new sku in australia, it takes six to eight months even to get it registered.
that's not the case in israel. france is going to be a very sort of thoughtful process. so israel is unique. the other markets are absolutely sticky.
people cannot get in. and i think if you look at the concentration of those companies that are successful, it's the same companies, france, u.k., germany, on and on and on, and they all have the same common elements. history in medical, strong product portfolio, exceptional regulatory excellence and a commitment to a significant amount of investment that takes a couple of years to return. and that's not unlike other regulated markets and other categories.
so i think israel is a bit of a one-off, but all the other markets are there. you also don't see the margin degradation as we talked about in these medical markets because there is really no incentive to do it.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from andrew carter with stifel. please state your question.
andrew carter -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi, thanks. good afternoon â good evening. i wanted to ask, so you said -- so i guess, instead, i want to ask about the canadian consumer business. you've reiterated the positive ebitda.
what does that consumer business have to do? does it have to stabilize, or conversely, could you just go with a 100% medical focus? and would you be able to -- with some incremental savings and be profitable? thanks.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
great question. so right now, as we mentioned, the canadian rec business is completely irrational. you're seeing core skus that are selling a significant negative gross margin you're seeing exceptional amount of over inventory and you're seeing a situation like with quebec right now with the vaccine mandate where you're seeing 16% to 20% drop in sales. so it's a weird market.
i talked about the 250 lps that are there. and so then the question becomes, why stay in it. and i believe, and we were one of the first companies who recognize that overall market share was not the arbiter of success in the canadian rec business. it's the share of the profit pool, which is something i was always trained.
the issue in exiting the rec is that there are other ancillary benefits that we opt out. so i want to stay in the rec business, albeit at a proper size for a couple of reasons. first, it's going to get there. it might take nine or 12 months, but it's not sustainable.
and when that happens, it's going to be for a smaller group of companies, and we're going to be in a really strong position. secondly, that experience in the largest federally regulated rec market is invaluable in other places, i.e., in the netherlands where we're going to be going into a rec market there and at some point in the u.s. and there are a lot of learnings that you only get by staying there. it's only four years old.
we've talked about that. and also when you think about the market potential, there is going to be a slowing of that legacy market. right now, the legal market represents 53% of sales and the legacy market is 47%, that continues to move. and i think with all of that, there are still some places where you can find some profitability, premium flower, concentrates, extracts and all those make sense.
the other point is we got efficiencies from being able to share products, share facilities, share regulatory, share genetics and some of that overall fixed overhead for our medical business by having at least some of the rec business. now right now, we have roughly a 4 share of the rec business. it's about right. i think share of profit pool is more important.
so those are all the reasons why you just don't get out of it, but you don't chase unprofitable share, and you don't rent unprofitable share, and you use your resources to spend against growth areas which for us is canadian medical and, more importantly, international medical.
andrew carter -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst

our next question comes from frederico gomes with atb capital markets. please state your question.
frederico gomes -- atb capital markets -- analyst
good evening guys. thanks for taking my question. i just had a question on your atm. so you guys finished the quarter with over $200 million in cash.
you have one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector. so could you just provide some more color on the rationale for raising that much money after quarter end? do you have any specific use in mind for those proceeds? is it m&a, or was it more about building that war chest further? thank you.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
sure. frederico, essentially great question. so just a couple of things. i want to tack a point on to your question.
bert, i also want to highlight that we also bought back about $20 million, $20.5 million of convertible debt. that was, i think, important for us, and we're going to continue to be opportunistic when we can do that, we bought it below par and we'll continue to monitor the convertible market. why is that important as you mentioned, the balance sheet. and as i talked historically, just to go back in time, when i first got in the seat, i thought it was critically important that the company had a proper cash position to really be there and sort of weather the storm of this whole situation.
and clearly, we did that. you mentioned the specifics of us raising it to over $440 million, and what we've said previously on the restate, so it's going to be a bit of an unsatisfying answer for you, frederico, but i think it will get to it. we consider the atm to be utilized for strategic purposes. we're always looking for deals that are accretive on ebitda basis.
everything that i'm focused on is the sustainability and the focus on this being a profitable and sustainably profitable company. and so that ebitda is always important. and so the cash is also looking at significant strategic or operational upside. this is an important line, and i know people always want to hear it, but i think it's important for people to hear from me constantly.
we do not expect to use any of the cash from our atm program to pay for the day-to-day operational expenses of the business. we're in a strong position today to consider strategic m&a. but i think our restraint, particularly as it pertains to the u.s. should give shareholders a good indication.
i mean the valuation of assets that people have purchased in the u.s. are a fraction of what they were a year ago. so we're cautious into that, and we're going to continue to be sensitive to purchase price valuation and always making sure that there's a strong strategic rationale and any potential target. but things are moving fast.
we want to be able to be opportunistic, and that's really why the cash position currently.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from john zamparo with cibc. please state your question.
john zamparo -- cibc -- analyst
thank you very much. i wanted to ask about the new science program and your ability to license genetics and ip to others. and specifically, have you started monetizing this to date? and if not, when do you take that might happen? and could you give us a sense of how material that might be for the business? thanks.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
sure. so john, it's a great question. we have started to monetize it, albeit in a small way, and we expect that to accelerate. so let me give you some specifics around that.
first, you saw the announcement about our biosynthetic assets and the partnership with cronos. we're thrilled about that. we believe that we have the most efficient pathway as it pertains to biosynthetics, those ip assets pertain both in the plant and outside the plant. so there were -- there was compensation connected to that.
secondly, we have had some small deals with some smaller craft companies. we announced north 40, which is an extremely well-known high-quality craft grower, which we sold genetics under the cultivar named farm gas. we utilized that both as a sale, as well as a marketing tool, and we're now selling farm gas into the san rafael. we'll continue to announce the sale of genetics.
we believe we have the -- one of the largest, if not the largest genetics library and many, many people are looking for high-quality, high-potency genetics, and so we'll continue to do that in a variety of different ways, and i think you'll see that. we also have the ability through our facilities to grow for others and economic scale, and so we'll continue to do that. so the short answer is we've had a couple of deals. if you look at other folks and you look at the people that we brought on to staff up oco, they come from other categories where it's clearly a relevant and material piece of their overall financial profile.
and clearly, the margins are -- will be significant given that we've already made all those investments. so that's where we are today, a lot more to evolve. we'll continue to announce deals, both large and small as they come out. but genetics will be a big piece.
the only thing the other piece i'll add to that, john, is there is a misconception, let me say, among growers and lps, both domestically and internationally, that you cannot protect or own the genetics around, in particular, cultivar. that's completely untrue. and so we are licensing unique genetic markers of these cultivars that we develop, and we are able to identify those that are infringing upon that. and clearly, the law is very clear on this issue, and we'll have a very strong case.
you'll start to see litigation around that as well as those that we believe have infringed on some of our biosynthetic assets, and that's also an additional revenue stream for the company.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from tamy chen with bmo capital markets. please state your question.
tamy chen -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi, thanks. i was just wondering, at one question on the consumer business. your volumes, i think the press release said was down 18% sequentially. and i'm just thinking back, i think the last two, maybe three quarters, your consumer business was holding in decently.
so i was just wondering if you could elaborate on what drove the 18% sequential decline in volume? thank you.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
so tamy, i think the simple answer is we're not going to chase. you're seeing an acceleration of irrational pricing, particularly on discount flower, and we've made the determination that we're going to get out of certain categories that don't make sense and lose money, and we're also not going to chase. so if you look at the asp, and i know you follow all that, and you can see your body day or headset data, the average pricing, you've seen that dramatic decline across some key categories, particularly in the value segment. and so again, overall market share is not as much of a focus for us.
so we're going to really spend most of our time in looking at those categories that are problem where there's margin, but where we see certain categories where it's single digit or in certain provinces like ontario where you see negative margins, you're not going to get there. and because that accelerated in the quarter, and we didn't chase that's why you'll continue to see that. listen, if people want us to sell a lot of cannabis and lose more, i think we're the wrong company. i'm not saying that's what others are doing, but it is going to take a bit longer for these inventories to rightsize, and in that place, i think you see a lot of folks willing to sell stuff at a significant loss as opposed to just taking it out or giving it away.
glenn ibbott -- chief financial officer
tammy, i'll just add -- just second to that. i said in prepared remarks at san raf, i mean in using it as an example of investing in the right places. san raf is quite profitable for us. and we saw an 18% increase in pre-rolls and flower over the last two quarters because we launched some nice new cultivars into that.
and as miguel stated in his remarks, we've got a lot of innovation coming, a number of new cultivars under a bunch of different brands and then profitable category. so we're focused there where the profit pools are. if that means market share going away, fine, but gross profit is what's going to drive us to profitability overall, and that's our focus. so i think we're trying to get away from that, what's the market share and what's happening on the revenue side and really focusing on driving in the areas -- winning in the areas that allow us to be profitable in the canadian consumer market and add that to the existing really strong portfolio we've got in the medical market and create quite a company here.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from glenn mattson with ladenburg thalmann. please state your question.
glenn mattson -- ladenburg thalmann -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking the question. so just building on some of that stuff on consumers. so you talked about why you want to be there for a variety of reasons or for when you move into new markets or where the market turns around. but more maybe to the one of the second parts of andrew's question was like, can you give us some sense of like how you see that market just kind of shaping up over the medium term? i know it's maybe irrational now, but you lay out kind of the idea for profitability in fiscal '23, first half in your forecast that you have internally, do you have that segment kind of growing or still shrinking, or what's your general sense for how long that this continues?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
sure. so glenn, i think first and foremost, let me highlight the critical province for canadians is quebec. they have a vaccine mandate in order to go in either an alcohol store or cannabis store and sales in quebec are down 16% to 20%. now the province is indicated by the end of the month, some of that stuff will be listed.
so the current market is continue to be impacted by covid. and obviously, the lps also have impacts because of labor. short term is defined by the next three to six months, you're seeing an acceleration of pricing downward. you're seeing that in discount flower, you're seeing that in vapor.
you're seeing that in a lot of the core segments. as glenn mentioned, there are bright spots, premium flower is holding up and concentrates and resins and rosins and things like that, there is still decent margin to be made as defined by, i don't know, 35%, 45%. and i think this market given we just went through the harvest and a variety of different things, i think you're going to probably see this go on for the next six to nine months. and it will only be with the absence of capital, which we're starting to see for some of the midsized to smaller lps and with some repricing.
but again, 250 lps, 125 a year ago, that's a bit of a challenge. there's really no barriers to entry. now i would also mention that the provinces are making some subs and changes. we've been encouraged by what we've heard out of the interim ceo of the ocs, steve lobos, good guy about where ontario is starting to go.
we are seeing some acknowledgment about some different aspects on the retail side that will create a bit of a healthy environment. but until pricing gets normalized, and you're not seeing big brands that have 100 basis points or 200 basis points of sale being sold at a negative margin, i think you're going to be in this irrational sort of situation. so our methodology, and i've been really pleased to hear some of our competitors echo this, that people are going to start to focus on profitability and thoughtfulness. now why do i hope that any of this is going to turn around because it's not dissimilar to what you saw in california and colorado in the early days.
and by all indicators, they seem to be 18 months ahead of us. you're seeing brands articulate, brand equity scores go up in those markets, you're seeing premium market shares be much more relevant. you're seeing manufacturers make money, and i know the economics are different in the u.s. but i think the canadian rec business is going to get there.
it's just too big a business, is growing too much to not get there. i just think through all of those things plus a greater focus on the legacy market, and you're going to see a probability. the point is timing. and i think chasing right now doesn't make any sense.
you're seeing market shares move 100 and 200 basis points in a week. i'm used to seeing that move in a quarter. and so in that market, you don't need to be first, you can wait a little bit. and so we're rightsizing our effort.
we're focusing on those things that we can bring to both the patient and a rec consumer, as well as internationally, and we're going to have our spots. and when we come out of it, there'll be a much smaller subset of lps. there'll be much better operators, and there'll be a really large market where people can make money. it's just going to take a bit longer than i think some would hope.
operator
thank you. and that's all the time we have for questions today. i'll turn the floor back to miguel martin for closing remarks.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
well, first and foremost, let me thank everybody for taking the time and the coverage that you provide to our stock. we really appreciate it. we're really pleased with the quarter. once again, we've put a plan out our transformation plan has three key components, which is growth in the markets where we can make money, particularly in medical.
we've done that, focus our cost structure on the opportunities as they present itself, and we've done that, raising our guidance on the $60 million to $80 million, and three, everything we're doing focused on being sustainably ebitda positive, and you've seen that progress with the 22% compression from last quarter to this quarter. so we really appreciate it. i hope everyone is safe and well, and i look forward to seeing people in person in the near future. all the best.

greetings, and welcome to aurora cannabis second quarter 2022 results conference call. [operator instructions] please note that this conference is being recorded. i will now turn the conference over to our host, ananth krishnan, vice president of strategic finance. thank you.
you may begin.
ananth krishnan -- vice president, corporate development and investor relations
thank you, diego. and we appreciate you all joining us this afternoon. with me today are ceo, miguel martin; and cfo, glenn ibbott. after the market close, aurora issued a news release announcing our financial results for the second quarter of our fiscal 2022.
the release and accompanying financial statements and md&a are available on our ir website and via sedar and edgar. in addition, you can find the supplemental information deck on our ir website. listeners are reminded that certain matters discussed on today's conference call could constitute forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our future or business performance. actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.
the risk factors that may affect actual results are detailed in our annual information form and other periodic filings and registration statements. these documents may be accessed via sedar and edgar. following prepared remarks by all and glenn, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. for retail investors, we have compiled questions submitted to us prior to the call.
for street analysts, we will ask you to limit yourselves to one question and then get back in the queue. with that, i will turn over the call to miguel. please go ahead, miguel. 
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
thank you, ananth. we're very pleased with our transformation plan, and we're tracking adjusted ebitda profitability in the first half of fiscal 2023, and that's less than a year away. here's why, first, we remain the no.1 canadian lp in global medical cannabis with strong sequential sales growth and margins exceeding 60%, roughly twice that of our competition. we continue to see growth in a number of countries, including the u.k., israel, australia and poland, and our experience and process-driven approach gives aurora leg up to profit and a significant opportunity.
second, and this is great news, we continue to rationalize our expenses to the current environment and manage the company with far greater efficiency. through q2, we achieved annualized run rate savings of $60 million that is nearly double the $33 million we referenced back in november. and i'm pleased to report that we now believe that we will achieve the higher end of our targeted $60 million to $80 million savings annually by the first half of fiscal '23. importantly, none of these cost savings will impact planned growth investments.
third, our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry, and we continue to be smart in allocating capital. moreover, our capital structure supports both organic growth and provides us with the resources to evaluate strategic m&a. fourth, we recently launched our science and innovation business, known as oco, which we intend to use to deliver a continuous stream of innovation to the market. this business already has one of the largest catalogs of high-quality and high potency genetics and ip and biosynthesis available for licensing.
we have already commercialized several cultivars with other lps, as well as long as three under our own san raf brand. we currently have more than 30 high-quality cultivars, not available anywhere else in the market that are ready for a media trial and exclusive licensing. bottom line, this is a capital-light long-term revenue growth opportunity we're really excited about. let's now discuss our medical business, which is no.
1 by revenue internationally and in canada. i'm proud of the team for continuing to find ways to profitably grow the medical cannabis market globally. what sets us apart from the competition in international medical is our regulatory expertise supported by our compliance protocols, testing and science that are recognized and highly regarded worldwide. these attributes put us in the pole position for success when these markets open recreationally.
during q2, we demonstrated exceptional growth of 24% in international medical revenue compared to q1, with success stories in the eu, israel and australia. in poland, we delivered a total of 290 kilograms in the quarter, which included the largest shipment of any lp into the country. to date, according to the chief pharmaceutical inspectorate. we expect for this success to continue as we look to launch new cultivars there in q3, accompanied by a marketing push.
in australia, our revenues have doubled year over year. through our exclusive supply agreement with medrelief australia, we offer medical patients in eu gmp certified range of products, including dry flower, oils, softgels and plan to shortly expand our offering to include vapes and gummies. 2021 was an excellent year for the australian market, driven by more mainstream acceptance from patients and doctors and ongoing growth in authorized prescribers. we anticipate continued growth in 2022 as australia's strength and import requirements, which aurora qualifies for and continues to ease patient access regulations.
in the u.k., we continue to surpass expectations with our revenues increasing more than fivefold compared to q2 last year, with the growth driven by a rapid increase in patient numbers. we've already built a leading position in the flower segment and continue to see growth in patient numbers with no erosion in pricing. while the u.k., australia and poland are still in the earliest stages of development, we would expect all of these countries to bear more significant profit drivers for us in the future. in germany, we have the no.
1 and no. 2 best-selling products in dry flower for all of the last calendar year and a growing share of its oil market following the recent launch of our balanced extract. while we did experience some softness in q2 due to some competitive pressures and slower-than-expected market size growth, germany remains the largest market in the eu with 83 million citizens, and we are extremely bullish on our future there. given the new coalitions plans to legalize adult rec cannabis and improve medical patient accessibility.
while the time lines and regulatory framework are yet to be announced, our leadership position in medical puts us in a very strong position when that milestone occurs. in france, we are preparing our third shipment for the pilot program, where we are the exclusive supplier of dry flower, having secured all three of the available dry flower tenders in the french medical cannabis pilot program. in the netherlands, we invest in growery, one of 10 license holders involved in selling only legally produced cannabis and approximately 80 out of 60 -- 600 coffee shops in the country. we expect to recognize revenue beginning in calendar 2023.
and over time, this is predicted to be a $2.8 billion market. we continued our success in israel by shipping over $10 million of cannabis to our partners there in q2. as of today, we do not expect to recognize revenue from israel in q3, but we remain committed to the israeli market and our partners there as they grow their business in the coming quarters. in these developing markets, predictability of revenue can be affected by regulatory complexities, such as timing of government approvals and import permits.
however, our reach in the multiple jurisdictions hedges us against us. i want to be clear here, we believe the growth story of the next several years in canvas will be that of international medical and recreational, and we expect a domino-like effect as acceptance grows. where there is money to be made in a federally regulated structure, aurora will be there, and we will win because of our agility and unique set of capabilities, which i mentioned earlier. some estimates put the cannabis market in the eu alone at $5 billion by 2025, and we expect to grab a sizable piece of this.
this will ultimately help drive us to sustain profitability and generate shareholder values as markets develop. turning now to the canadian medical market, which we see as a competitive advantage for aurora and is our most profitable business segment. our overall revenue was flat in q2 compared to q1 and although our market share expanded to 23.4%, up from 19.8% in the same period last year. most importantly, our insured patients made up 72.7% of our domestic medical sales up to 7.6% in q1.
we are excited to see some opportunities for growth in attracting medium groups, employee insurance programs as well as opportunities to pick up market share with our best-in-class patient experience. we have also launched a number of products and innovations that we believe will appeal to patients. regarding canadian adult rec, our q2 revenue decline reflects the ongoing macro challenges. there's a lot of excess inventory and increased pressure on older skus, which together has resulted in price compression.
this irrational market is unsustainable in our view, and we're not going to chase unprofitable market share at any cost. our focus is on how to maximize profitability by leveraging our low-cost production facilities and selectively entering categories that have higher margins. we have the scale and resources to outlast the current environment. and once the market consolidates, we will be in a strong position.
in q3, our innovation pipeline consists of 25 new skus, which benefit both rack and medical channels. highlights include three new cultivars from our breeding program launched under our refreshed drift brand, our first offering of infused pre-rolls in hash and a bevy of new vape edible and concentrate flavors which we expect to hit the market in march. our full-year 2022 innovation calendar includes over 80 new and high potency skus, which would be our most significant and successful innovation push since legalization. i would now like to turn the call over to glenn, so he can provide his financial review.
glenn ibbott -- chief financial officer
thanks, miguel. good afternoon, everyone. we'll now review our fiscal q2 2022 financials. these results clearly demonstrate the inherent strength of our business model and how well we are executing our transformation program, which is ahead of schedule.
so let's begin with a few key highlights. we have one of the strongest balance sheets among canadian lps, including approximately $445 million in cash as of yesterday, no term debt and access to a usd 1 billion shelf perspective. this prospectus includes a usd 300 million atm, from which we have recently drawn down nearly usd 90 million, meant to position us to take advantage of strategic m&a opportunities in the future. our cash flow continues to improve with $20.3 million used in operating working capital in q2 compared to $67.3 million in the same period of last year.
and we continue to progress toward our ebitda-positive milestone, reducing our loss this quarter by over 20% from last quarter to $9 million, as we begin to see the cost savings from our business transformation plan flowing through the p&l. in short, we have more than sufficient cash on hand to fund operations, and we are moving closer to profitability. q2 net cannabis revenue was $60.6 million, a slight increase from last quarter. net revenue would have been 4% higher, but was reduced for a $2.4 million provision, reflecting past and current international shipments that had batches that were outside of targeted potency range.
this provision is not expected to recur regularly. our leadership in medical cannabis continued to deliver robust overall growth, along with consistently strong margins above 60%. this enviable margin profile has held steady over the past few quarters and is a key gross-profit driver for our business that both distinguishes us from our competitors and is critical for us in reaching positive ebitda during the first half of fiscal 2023. sg&a and r&d also remained well-controlled, down 10% quarter over quarter as we continue rightsizing costs.
these expenditures are already a fraction of what they were in years past and will be reduced further as we proceed through the implementation of our business transformation plan. clearly, our overall q2 results benefited from aurora's broad diversification across the international medical, canadian medical and adult rack segments. so now let me address each of our core businesses in a bit more detail. our leading medical businesses in canada and europe continued to perform exceptionally well, generating $45.7 million in sales and a gross margin of 62%.
medical represented about 75% of our q2 revenue and about 89% of our gross profit. canadian medical revenue was $26 million in q2, up slightly but really reflecting a consistent performance compared to q1 even as the consumer retail market continues to roll out. as we have said previously, our canadian medical patients can be segmented into two groups: those with cost reimbursement coverage and those without a reimbursement program. our success in canadian medical cannabis is really driven by our insured patient groups, whose reimbursement makes them consistent and high-volume buyers.
while we have seen some migration of price-sensitive non-reimbursement patients from the medical channel to be our direct channel, we have been able to attract more insured patients, resulting in a steady sequential revenue and an overall market share increase. our international medical revenue was $19.8 million and reflected 67% growth versus the prior year and 24% sequentially. q2 revenue included slightly over $10 million in sales to israel, and what is believed to be the largest export of medical cannabis seem to the israeli market. excluding the onetime $2.4 million provision, international medical revenue was up 87% year over year.
sales to israel do not recur every quarter, but to give you a sense of the underlying international business, excluding the impact of israel sales in q1 and q2, international revenue was up 41% sequentially. recall that bds analytics estimated a market size of about $3.2 billion by 2025 for just the medical markets in germany, poland, u.k., france and israel. so clearly, aurora's leadership internationally is an important driver of long-term shareholder value creation. our q2 consumer revenue was $14.8 million, which reflected a 22% decline compared to last quarter.
consumer cannabis represented about 24% of our q2 revenue and about 11% of our gross profit. the revenue decline is primarily attributed to price adjustments in our core and premium products, intended to improve sales velocity by reflecting the continuing price compression in the market. the average selling price decrease was partially offset by a 5% positive shift in the company's brand mix from daily special to san rafael '71 as aurora continues to pivot toward premium offerings. in fact, san raf pre-roll and flower revenue is up 18% over the last two quarters, driven mainly by the new cultivars launched in our q1.
while we saw an increase in mix toward our premium brands, our consumer gross margins declined to 24% in q2 from 32% last quarter. this was driven by downward pricing pressure of 6%, partially offset by 2% improvement from the shift toward premium. also negatively impacting margins this quarter were opportunistic bulk sales, which depressed margins in the quarter by 4%. turning now to sg&a, which includes r&d.
it remains well-controlled coming in at $44.6 million in q2, which included approximately $3.7 million in restructuring and other onetime costs. so sg&a is $40.9 million excluding those costs. we have already made progress in driving down sg&a, but are certainly not done. in fact, we expect our quarterly run rate will be well below $40 million by the time we exit this fiscal year.
in q2, we also recorded a $31.6 million inventory provision as a result of facility consolidation and clearing out of obsolete inventory balances. this provision included a noncash net realizable value adjustment of $11.5 million, driven by price compression in the market. so pulling all of this together, we generated an adjusted ebitda loss in q2 2022 of $9 million. the $2.5 million improvement in adjusted ebitda loss is compared to last quarter was primarily driven by the $3.1 million decrease in sg&a, while revenue and gross -- adjusted gross margins remained relatively steady on a consolidated basis.
let's review our path to adjusted ebitda profitability. approximately 60% of cash savings under the business transformation program, now estimated to be close to $80 million, will be reflected within our cost of goods as inventory has drawn down following the implementation of our lower production cost structure. we would expect to see those savings in our gross margins and logistics costs beginning late fiscal 2022 and into next year. the remaining 40% of cash savings will show up in sg&a as they're executed, and we see that now beginning in q2.
overall, we executed q2 having executed plans. we exited q2 having executed plans that result in annualized run rate cash cost savings of $60 million. so we're well on our way. this concludes my remarks, there are three key takeaways from this financial review.
first, our balance sheet remains strong, supported by a healthy cash balance and improved working capital and cash flow. second, our medical business is in canada and internationally. so clearly differentiating us from our competitors are a critical part of aurora's target of sustainable profitability, having delivered 89% of gross profit this quarter. and finally, we're ahead of schedule with the transformation plan and now expect to be at the high end of our $60 million to $80 million total annual cost savings range.
this reinforces our already clear path to adjusting positive adjusted ebitda in the first half of fiscal 2023 and through actions that are within our control. now i'll turn the call back to miguel.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
thanks, glen. before q&a, let me share some final takeaways. aurora is laser-focused on ebitda profitability and long-term growth, and we're making significant progress on both. first, we're getting to the high end of our cost reductions, which is great news.
and our medical cannabis revenue growth globally shows tremendous promise given our regulatory expertise and the trend of medical converting to rec. in canada, the rec market will eventually correct, likely with fewer players, which will provide us without an opportunity, and our science innovation program adds another capital-light opportunity to our portfolio. lastly, our balance sheet is in the best place it has ever been, which positions us for continued organic growth and strategic m&a, and the transformation plan is firmly on track. we appreciate your interest and time today before we take questions from the analysts that cover our stock.
i'll turn the call over to ananth, so we can ask a few questions from our retail shareholders. we're invited to submit questions at of today's call. ananth, please go ahead.
ananth krishnan -- vice president, corporate development and investor relations
thanks, miguel. our first question is regarding the stock price. what are your plans to improve the stock price and perhaps reassure shareholders?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
well, obviously, it's a question we get a lot. i think, first and foremost, you got to go back a little bit in time and understand that there was incredible exuberance about the growth of the global cannabis business. that starts with the u.s. we've been saying for a year that the u.s.
is a ways off. we also believe and strongly, and i spent my entire career working in the u.s. with regulated agencies that it's going to be a medical focus, with the fda regulating the product with decriminalization and then we'll see a pathway toward raf. that's what we're seeing in other markets, and we'll see it there.
canada and the challenges in canada around the rec business, i know many people are incredibly focused on the rec business as opposed to the medical business, which i'll talk about in a second. but the right business in canada is only three years old. you've got roughly half of that business is still in the legacy market, and you've got international marketplaces we've spoken about. there's 250 lps today that's twice as many as they were.
a year ago, you got excess inventories and people having negative gross margins on key products. that's not sustainable, and that's going to turn around. we, quicker than almost anybody else, rightsize that rec business so that we could be in a situation to not have that overstepped incredible success that we've had in medical. so i think first and foremost, for investors is really focusing on the long term versus the short term.
and the long term for cannabis is incredibly right. if you look at key markets such as germany and france and the u.k. and israel and on and on, those are big markets where you're seeing medical cannabis grow in a significant place. also, you're seeing the same companies win time after time after time.
secondly, we've done the things we said we were going to do. we are focused on shareholder value. we're focused on being profitable, and this was another good quarter of making progress. the ebitda progress was a 22% improvement over last quarter, and we are reaffirming the guidance to be ebitda positive by the second half of our fiscal 2023.
and things that we've done are setting up for shareholder value in the future. we've talked about the balance sheet. we talked about the cash position, and we are properly allocating the capital to high-growth, high-margin opportunities. and lastly, when you think about long-term benefits, aurora has significant assets that haven't been monetized yet.
ip, biosynthetics, genetics, all of which play a significant role in agriculture products all around the world. so i understand the question, and i understand the history, but i think if you look forward and take a longer view, you see that there are a lot of things traditionally that you look at most companies that aurora has.
ananth krishnan -- vice president, corporate development and investor relations
great. thank you. our next and last question pertains to our path to profitability, miguel. what gives us -- what gives you confidence that we're on track to meet our stated ebitda time-wise?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
well, i think, john, you're looking at a company and seeing can you believe what they're saying it's what have they done? and if you look at our history of announcing additional $60 million to $80 million in cost efficiencies, we're already at 60%, and we're really commenting today that we're going to be a high side of that. secondly, is there progress being made so far. ebitda does not positive ebitda doesn't happen overnight. and we've made progress once again this quarter.
when you look at aspects of what would be a drag on that projection, we quickly moved out of those less than profitable areas such as key components of the adult rec business in canada, markets that we may have participated in that didn't have upside and yet still found the cash and the investment to do innovative deals such as the growery and netherlands, where even though legally, we can have a majority position, we can consolidate and recognize the revenue as early as 2023. so we're on track. we've demonstrated that what we say we're going to do, we do, do. and i think we're always keeping the shareholders in mind as we make key decisions.
ananth krishnan -- vice president, corporate development and investor relations
that's great, miguel. thank you. operator, that concludes the retail q&a session. you can turn it over to you to open up to the phone lines.

thank you, sir. [operator instructions] the first question we have is michael lavery from piper sandler. please go ahead.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. good evening. 
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
good evening, michael.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
so it's no surprise to see aurora sky finally get closed all the way. i think it has capacity several times what you're selling at the moment, but it's a big facility. it was sort of a showpiece of the portfolio for a while. how much of the incremental sales are driven by that? is that really the majority? is it all of it? is it just one of several pieces? and a little bit related to that, to understand how the savings flowed through it? could you maybe touch on the sequential deterioration in ebitda margins from last quarter to this one? i know it's always a little bit lumpy, but what was some of the drivers there? and how much of that is -- how should we think about the savings really hitting fiscal '23 versus starting to see them in the fourth quarter this year?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
sure. so let me kick off on sort of a top-line point, and then i'll let glen go into some of the modeling points. you know, michael, i think as you're well aware, and many people are aware that these massive facilities that were built, particularly in canada, really were built with this idea that you could grow cannabis, particularly flower, in canada, and ship it and all around the world, including the u.s. and parts of eastern europe.
so that was obviously has not come to be. secondly, consumers very quickly evolved into, being very discerning, we're seeing that, not only in canada, but we're also seeing it in the u.s. and you're starting to see as well, in western europe. these massive facilities that employed a significant amount of automation, just we're not built for purpose for this environment.
and one of the things i think i would mention here is aurora has been very aggressive in proactively right sizing the company for what it needs. so most recently, as we've announced, aurora sky was down about 25% capacity, the carrying cost on fixed and what that means across your system was just untenable, and we did everything we could to try to find locations, to be able to sell that type of flower cannabis, and it just didn't work. so i think that should be an indication that it's everybody that we will continue to make the tough decisions that we need to make in order to have the proper, sort of overall footprint. secondly, when you have such a complicated network, with facilities all over canada, it creates a lot of excess cost in the overall sort of simplicity of that system.
and so there's added benefits, not just because of the carrying costs of aurora sky, but also to the simplification, or the closure of other facilities that we've announced as well, which will have a significant impact overall. and so, i think those are all sort of important points. i mean, glen, do you want to grab the second part of michael's question in terms of the flow through? just the one thing i will mention, michael is that we're really proud of how quick and how fast the savings are going to hit our balance sheet, and i think you'll see him quite quickly. but glen, if you could talk about the modeling and the timing?
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
sure, mike. so the initial tranche of savings that we announced last year that we're pretty much getting toward the end of executing were mainly driven by operational centralization. and so, for instance, polaris was just finally shuttered in april on the manufacturing lines that have been moved back east are just up and running now. sorry, external noise here.
so the timing on those, you should start seeing a lot of that, the positive impact on cash flows starting to come through in the next quarter. now, that additional tranche of savings that we have announced is combination of both shuttering of some facilities that miguel talked about in sg&a cost reductions about 50-50 on that additional tranche of savings. the sg&a cost reductions are expected to be executed over the next couple of quarters. so we'll see them hitting immediately.
and the sky reduction, i mean, our current plan is to have sky shut down by the end of summer. so i think the next couple of quarters will be telling in terms of cash flow savings. obviously, the production side, as it hits our cost of good takes a quarter or two to flow through following that. so we expect to see the margin improvement coming through toward the last quarter of the calendar year, maybe even a little bit in the september quarter as well.
so we haven't really seen it mike impact other than the sg&a savings. we haven't really seen the stuff impact our financials yet but it's coming.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
i mean, michael, one other point i would make is for example, closing sky will save us $7 million a quarter in cash savings. so it's significant.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok, great. thanks so much.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
you're welcome.
operator
thank you. the next question we have is from andrew carter from stifel. please go ahead.
andrew carter -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yes, thanks. good afternoon. so i just want to ask you have upgraded the target by $90 million and your adjusted ebitda loss was $12 million in the quarter. so multiply that by four, $48 million loss.
you've got $90 million of cost savings. are you saying that we should be getting to a $40 million ebitda run rate, that's not even including thrive and, or the tail end of the old savings. i just want to make sure i'm squaring and thinking this correctly. thank you.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
glen, do you want to walk through the staging and then i'll talk about how to think about the timing?
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
sure. so...
andrew carter -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
not, not really timing guys. i was just -- i was actually saying, is that just an out of bounds, absolute number to think about that 90 plus or 48 million annualized loss, 45 over the next two years. thanks.
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
i'm having a little trouble following your question there. our sg&a, we expect to take it down on a quarterly basis to low 30, and we expect our margins to continue to be where they are at or improve over time through the centralization, just more efficiencies coming out of the operation. so in between the two, as you can see taking our sg&a down from roughly the 40 that it's at now down below 30 is going to take us most of the way on the cost reduction that we need to get deposit of. but even without depending on revenue growth.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
yeah, i mean, i guess andrew, i would, the only piece i'd add is, if you took q3 and you made the presumption, particularly as it pertains to gross profit and adjusted ebitda of what the rec business is up to. and you, i think presume a bit of steadiness to the other two pieces of business and you drop the sg&a savings. the glen has mentioned you're there. i don't think -- i don't think it flips to a plus 40 and i would not want to profess that, but that's sort of the back of the envelope, math on why i think people should have some confidence in the adjusted ebitda target.
andrew carter -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok, thank you.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
thank you.

[operator instructions] the next question we have, which is vivien azer from cowen. please go ahead.
unknown speaker -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. this is actually victor on for vivien azer, and hank you for taking the questions. 
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
of course, victor. how are you doing? 
unknown speaker -- cowen and company -- analyst

miguel martin -- chief executive officer
good.
unknown speaker -- cowen and company -- analyst
so given the recent comments by germany's health and finance ministers on accelerating adult use legalization, can you frame the adult use opportunity there and offer your thoughts and the timing? can you also offer some color and how you look to leverage your current competitive position in medical market to approach the opportunity there? thank you.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
sure, i'd be happy to. so i think that the first thing with all of these countries whether it's germany, or whether it's netherlands, or you pick any of these eu countries. it's a similar regulatory framework in terms of the regulators, and they start with production, and they get into manufacturing protocols, and all eu gmp and the different pieces of it. so those companies that have had success, and we're clearly one of them.
in germany, we'll have the inside line on racks. the folks that are making that decision are the folks that were involved in medical. and i think we were a bit pleased with the speed in which that announcement was made. so it's really hard to pick timing in this.
but it doesn't change your strategic sort of approach, because everything that you're doing for medical will apply to what we hope is a quick rapid turnaround. and so you talked a little bit about modeling. right now, the percentage of the adult population in germany that's using cannabis is one-tenth that at point 1%, what we see in canada, and so i think if you multiply that times the population, i think you can see the possible upside. but i think the thing we're most pleased about is we've had very productive conversation with the regulators, and a very conservative compliant approach, particularly on the production side, for germany has bode well for us.
one, this little nuance about germany that i'll share as to why it's so hard, their deviation provision on potency is only 10%. most places in the world will allow a 20% deviation to label while you might have a 25 potency product, and you say, well, miguel, that gives you plenty of sort of buffer of 2.5. balance products are becoming quite popular. in many cases, they'll have a 10% thc number, which only gives you a 1% variation, which is a very difficult challenge for germany.
so we think the leaders in germany and they said we're one of them, we'll have the inside line. when that goes rack and we think it'll be subjective. we also would point out that there are a lot of eyes on germany as the largest economy currently looking at it. and we think if they do go, it's going to have a halo effect on the other markets around that look at them from a regulatory standpoint.
operator
thank you. the next question we have is from john zamparo from cibc world markets.
john zamparo -- cibc world markets -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon. i wanted to ask about m&a especially following the drive acquisition. it seems as though companies in the space are generally more capital constrained and in the past and they're seeing valuations compress more.
does that give you more appetite to be active on acquisitions and keeping in mind you're going to look for human capital and brands that have connected, but is there any appetite to maybe accelerate the m&a strategy at this point?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, john, it's a great question. so there's really been sort of two areas of m&a activity. one is the u.s.
and, i think we've been on record about, our play in the u.s., which is, a really clear one, that everything that we're doing around the world is going to have access points to the u.s. with an fda regulation and with a thoughtful sort of approach. so i think we've been smart about not chasing in the u.s. on those really high valuations, around that.
second piece is what you're mentioning is around canada and this sort of question about, what type of companies do you go after? and with this credit markets, what do you get there. i really seen the dynamic nature of the business and renting market share, and buying companies just for their market share really is not, i think, a positive approach. and to the point you're making human capital does make a significant difference. and so, we are interested in finding teams that are really thoughtful, that are margin accretive, and that are focused on sustainably making money.
thrive was one of those teams. and i think different than others it was my intent to find a great high functioning team, and then put them in charge of our rec business. and so, the ceo of that company, jeff, uber, who's a wonderful talent with his team, they're now going to run our canadian rec business. and not only, i think they'll do that at a high level but also they bring a significant amount of innovation in genetics, that we can plug both into our rec business, international medical business and our domestic name business.
so as glen mentioned, we've got a lot of flexibility on the balance sheet. and i think as things get tighter, access to capital is a key strategic advantage for any company, but particularly the cannabis company. and as things get, more affordable and make more sense, we would be there, particularly possibly around medical assets. and we really, without being too boastful, consider ourselves being one of the best if not the best, international medical cannabis company out there.
and so you know, those type of things are unique interest to us.
operator
thank you, sir. the next question we have is from andrew bond from jefferies.
unknown speaker -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi, good evening, andrew bond on line for owen bennett. thanks for taking our questions. so just around israel, definitely appreciate timing of shipments can be lumpy, but, the market still looks like it's going well. just wanted to see if you could give a little more detail around how you see shipments trending for the rest of the year, if there's been any shipments since the end of the quarter today? thank you.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
yeah, i'll be happy to. i have spent a lot of time in israel. and i've really had the honor of having worked in israel a lot in my career. and so, i was most recently there.
a couple months ago, the situation with israel is an interesting one. first and foremost, i think you have one of the most progressive and thoughtful regulators, globally, a very smart and thoughtful gentleman, yuval landschaft, who runs, what's called the imca, the regulator of cannabis in israel. and you're starting to see, a lot of interest and obviously many of our competitors, shipping canadian flower in israel, and i've done that successfully, but you're also seeing a significant growth of local growers in israel that are becoming successful growing their own cannabis. and i don't need to name the name of my competitors, but i was there and i've seen many of those grows and been respectful that.
so what you're seeing is in a country of 9 million people with about 130,000 patients that there is probably more supply than demand currently of good to great quality cannabis. and so, while it is always a challenge to navigate the very sort of high bar of the imca to get products into israel, the results also now the internal pressure of having local grows, putting out high quality flour, particularly into that market. and so, we have said to everybody that, when we have a shipment to israel, we will announce it. and so, in that statement, we have not had won yet this quarter.
but what i will say is that, the international market beyond israel does go hot and cold as these regs are there. when you have a diversified business like we do and you can offset shipments that didn't happen to israel, was shipping the larger shipment anyone's ever shipped into poland or into czech republic or the significant growth you have that we have in australia, you were able to balance out that. and i understand, from an analyst standpoint, it's hard not seeing that regular cadence into a market as important as israel. but we think that when you have such breadths internationally overall it's going to smooth out.
and we have been pretty good at guiding toward how we think our international medical business is going to do. and that's, without some of the new markets that are coming online. so that's sort of it on israel and i have great respect for what's going on there. and i think israel beyond a place to sell canadian cannabis will be a leader in genetics, in seed propagation, and starting at some point in export.
and so, i'm hopeful for that. and obviously there is a long history in israel of biotech. so we are bullish, we're active in israel. we at this point, don't have a shipment to tell you about.
operator
thank you. the next question we have is from frederico gomes from atb.
frederico gomes -- atb capital markets -- analyst
yeah, good afternoon, miguel and glen. thanks for taking my questions. just with the asset rationalization that you're doing right now, closing sky. could you remind us about the facilities that you have last right now? i mean, what's the capacity there in terms of cultivation? how much of that capacity are you currently utilizing and then as well what are your plans for sky? are you looking for a buyer for this app? does can even have a market for selling facility that size given the conditions that we are seeing right now? and also some of your other facilities as well that you plan to close.
thank you.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
sure. so i'll go as a top-line overview and i'll let glen correct me if i go astray in terms of the exact numbers on production clients by facility. so our primary facilities are river and ridge. they are historical facilities.
they produce extremely high-quality cannabis. and as we focus on premium products, both domestically, internationally, rec and medical, they are proven facilities both with historical cultivars and new cultivars. we also retain the whistler facility in bc that we all know produces some of the highest quality organic craft cannabis that is always done very well. and then staying in the canadian market, we also are thrilled what we get with the thrive acquisition, both are a tremendous indoor grow and a focused on concentrates as well as a significantly important outdoor grow that has a wonderful, cost of goods impact, particularly on fresh grows and for extracts and concentrates.
internationally, we have a facility in germany that we talked about. we also have our nordic facility as well as our partnership in the netherlands. and we feel confident that both in our internal network as well as the partnerships that we have with others, that we have more than what we need in terms of current demand with a proper sort of fixed cost. in terms of overall sort of we look at all that in terms of disposition, it's my expectation that edmonton market, particularly around that airport authority, that sky, we'll have a great buyer and we'll obviously work with our business partners, both at the municipal level, like we have with the polaris facility.
and the same thing would happen valley is in a tremendous location from agriculture, and there'll be no issues in terms of finding a great buyer there. and we'll have to see what happens from cros and others on interest on the md&a. glen, you want to talk a little bit about maybe production quantities or clean the rest up for fred.
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
yes, yes, fred. so i mean, we have disclosed before the capacity of like river ridge, whistler, etc. and then they run in the neighborhood sort of like, i guess, stated capacity at river about 30,000 kilograms a year, ridge above 5,000 kilogram a year, whistler is about the 2,000 kilograms a year range. but more importantly, that's total biomass.
what we've been focused on in cultivation again, more and more expertise is obviously the yield and pass rates and specs for producing a 25% flower. you want all your batches to be hitting 25% flower certainly for value. so some of the -- one of the reasons that we're really focusing in river and ridge is the exceptional pass rates, just hitting high levels of thc on a consistent basis, sometimes 100% of the batches in a particular period will be hitting there. so that's all really important for producing high-quality flower.
so it's great to state 30,000 kilograms. our focus has been getting as much as possible at 30,000 to meet the high-quality specifications. what we're thrilled about with the thrive team is this is like one of the best brands in canada, and that's really obvious when you look at the company and their performance. but what's under the covers is just exceptional expertise in the cultivation side.
in the cultivar selection and your growing technique, it's a very scientific method that's backed up by decades of legacy growing experience. you get some folks that kind of came over as part of that team that are getting yields sometimes twice what we've been getting as the high-quality stuff. so we're excited to see even more coming out of our whistler and ridge. we think we've got plenty of capacity there.
and as far as it goes in europe, i think you're asking about whether we could use the capacity there. in fact, we're starting to be concerned about capacity constraints in a couple of years, and it's not a problem. we've got expansion capability there, and we certainly can continue to export from canada. but i put it in the other.
don't fall asleep on the european opportunity there. we need everything we can get out of our european facilities, and we're still going to need to supply from canada over the next couple of years. so no problems with the international facilities at all.
operator
thank you, sir. the next question we have is from matt bottomley from canaccord genuity. please go ahead.
matt bottomley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
good evening. thanks for taking the questions. i just wanted to go back to one of the questions. i think andrew was asking just about the change in the increase in the anticipated savings.
apologies toward the end there my line was cutting out, but i think i caught most of it. the guidance on reaching a run rate of positive ebitda, it hasn't changed, but you're adding at the midpoint about 90 million of savings. so i understand that, from a standpoint of what you previously telegraph, maybe that sort of breakeven by sort of the midpoint of adjusted ebitda, but adding those 90 million of savings. and when you say annualized, is that the last month or the last week of that particular point in time, let's call it midway through fiscal '23, when that will be achieved, and then the actual cash part of it will be lagging or are we expecting some sort of step function increase into the adjusted ebitda at that point in time given the significant increase in these initiative?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
glen, you want to start?
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
yes, i'll start to unpack that a little bit. so when we see annualized run rate, we're making a number a series of decisions, some of them happening today, some of them happening in june, and then etc., through the summer, and they execute a the shutdown facility obviously takes a number of months. so what we were targeting is that by the time we have to q2, that all the decisions are done, the saudis are shuttered that are set to be shuttered. and everything's been executed so that we're running at a rate that is ebitda positive and that the savings have been captured by them.
so looking forward, i think it's the right way to look at this on a run rate basis, annualized savings. how it differs from before? as we resize this to get to positive ebitda even at current revenue. so if we took our q3 revenues of $50 million, just to be dead certain we can hit this ebitda target we said, what do we need to do to the business to make sure that even at a rate like this, which we don't expect to persist, but even at a rate like this, what would it take to be positive? so it's a bigger step, and we take that before. a lot of this shows up in cash savings, or why we're telling you the big numbers, is that's all cash savings.
obviously, when you cut it out of operational savings, miguel mentioned sky it's 7 million a quarter. so there's almost $30 million annually of cash saving face shattering that facility. so that's, i think, if you want to think about this sort of the run rate here. we've got a couple quarters here of continuing hard work, to execute all these savings, but we've got an exceptionally crisp plan and we're executing on it.
so cost of goods, obviously, the margins will start to improve, you would expect over time. there's definitely headwind in the market, you know that inflation, etc., etc. but we think we're going to at least cover that if not more through these cross rationalizations and the sg&a cuts to get us to positive ebitda in a quarter that looks like q3.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
yes, i guess the other couple points i would make is one is, why you hate to do these things. this is a team that has a bit of experience now doing it. it's also a team with some new leaders in place that come from a background, whether that's our new head of operations, who comes from kraft and png, or a new head of hr, who comes from hilton, amex. so they're -- this is a different management team that's running through this.
the second part is, we're going to continue to give updates the best we see it. and i understand while some people may say, well, miguel, geez, i understand these enhance savings, why wouldn't you increase your raise your guidance overall. and i'm a bit sensitive to the history of the company saying, it's going to do something, particularly around profitability and savings and not getting there. then glen's right and talking about the structural differences of this based upon the current revenue.
so that's why i want to see a little bit of the execution. i want to see a little bit of the timing. it's a bit of a a wonky time period with inflation and some other aspects going on. if we get closer with greater clarity, of course, we'll be transparent and then people know that, but we want to be a bit conservative here in terms of how we provide guidance on this, because i am sensitive to how people have looked at historical statements on the company.
operator
thank you, sir. so our final question comes from doug miehm from rbc capital markets.
doug miehm -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yeah, thank you. i just wanted to go back to this so that i'm sure i understand aurora sky. so it's operating at 25% capacity today. i'm just curious then, what is it making and what are the revenues roughly coming out of that site? and is it losing $10 million to $20 million a year or even more by the sounds of it?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
so doug, let me go, i mean, put up with this a little history bit. sky was originally created as many people on this call know better than i, to be the one of the largest global automated, almost completely automated facilities to grow, what i would call mid-tier flower. and the reason that was ok, because at that time a 16 or 18 potency product was more than acceptable for the canadian market and some other markets. as the consumer evolved very quickly, bud quality density, moisture, all of those things, and then potency and terps and all these other sort of core character attributes did not lend itself to automation.
and we are not the only one that sort of talked about that. so sky had to be retrofitted very rapidly. and as you might imagine, a facility of that nature has a different sort of profile genetically of cultivars that do well. and so, when you couple the rapid sort of expansion of what a consumer wanted, particularly in the rec business and with the need for new cultivars scale of that size became a bit of an impediment.
and so, we pivoted sky and made massive improvements and absolute kudos to the folks that worked there, in order to find a home for that product, particularly internationally, where you would have higher margins that would sustain the overall fixed cost of that facility. and as you might imagine, whether it's utility cost, whether it's maintenance, whether it's all of those things that were created under a past sort of scenario, sky became really untenable. and so, we took it down to 25%, and yes, it was losing a significant amount of money as we had to allocate the overall costs of that facility against the product that was created there, which was almost entirely flour. and as flour prices, particularly in the rec market cratered for everybody, it became this ongoing piece.
and then, when israel particularly became a little bit more, i would say, less consistent, it really became untenable. and when overall we took our rec business down to what we think is sustainable in terms of focus on premium, it just didn't make sense. and so, that's really how we got to where we got to. and i think, we have been pretty proactive in reducing our footprint, whether that was sky, whether that was previously with sun, and valley and others.
and we continue to do what i think most would say is the right thing for the business to have the right cost structure overall for the amount of cannabis we need. and lastly is, as you see an expansion into other items, concentrate, infuse pre-rolls, vapes, ingestible in the canadian market, massive facilities, just producing flour, just don't make sense to the tune of millions and millions of dollars of losses, if you keep them open.
operator
thank you, sir. ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. and i would like to turn the call back to miguel martin for closing remarks. please go ahead, sir.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
well, i want to thank everybody for taking the time to continue to listen to aurora story. we've never been more confident about the targets we have in front of us. hopefully, people understand we continue to make the tough calls based on what we think is right for the shareholders. if you look at the balance sheet, if you look at our core cannabis business, which is international medical, they've never been stronger.
and so we're excited about the quarters and we appreciate all of your coverage and interest in aurora. thank you very much.

please go ahead. 
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
thank you, ananth. in an environment defined by political upheaval, record-setting inflation, and market volatility, we are intent on controlling what we can control and delivering on our target of reaching a profitable adjusted ebitda run rate by the first half of fiscal 2023. in fact, i'm very pleased to tell you that, our plan is working and we are in better position to hit this goal than we were a quarter ago. the foundation of our confidence is our global medical canvas business, which is both defensible and stable with margins that exceed 60%.
these are highly desirable characteristics in today's volatile economic environment. and in addition to being the number one canadian lp in terms of medical cannabis revenue over the last 12 months, the business continues to grow in other parts of the world, especially in europe and australia this quarter. the second reason for our confidence is cost savings and we are pleased to have identified additional opportunities. recall from last quarter, we said, we'd achieved the higher end of our targeted $60 million to $80 million savings annually, by the first half of fiscal 2023.
today, we are announcing that we have identified an additional $70 million to $90 million of savings within that same timeframe, for a total of $150 million to $170 million of savings annually. importantly, our total cost savings won't impact plan growth investments, but we expect them to materially reduce our cash needs. our third reason is the balance sheet, which remains among the strongest in the industry and puts aurora in a position of strength, particularly in challenging times. we currently have approximately $283 million in cash, inclusive of our early repurchase of $141 million in convertible debt for further strategic and value accretive opportunities, and about $190 million u.s.
remaining under our atm program. fourth, oco, our science and innovation business has one of the largest catalogs of high-quality genetics and ip in biosynthesis available for licensing. oco represents a capital-light, long-term, revenue growth opportunity that we believe makes aurora unique and can drive success by enabling our licensing partners to deliver a continuous stream of innovation to the market. let's take a deeper dive on our medical business.
during q3, international medical revenue was up 55%, compared to last year. but down from q2, because of our large shipment to israel last quarter, which we did not expect to recur this quarter. as you know, predictability of revenue, especially in developing markets can be affected by regulatory complexities, such as timing of government approvals and import permits. we are currently selling medical cannabis products in seven eu countries, germany, malta, poland, czech republic, u.k., denmark and france.
and are either the market leader or in the top three in all of those countries. we estimate today, there are around 150,000 patients in the eu, but if it were to reach similar adoption levels as canada, i.e., 1% of the population, the patient pool could expand to $3.5 million patients. in poland, revenues grew threefold year over year, as we followed up last quarter's record breaking shipment with another strong quarter. we have established a leadership position in the polish flower market with an estimated 70% share, and expect the success to continue, as we launch new cultivars in q3, accompanied by a marketing push.
in the u.k., our revenues increased 60% compared to q3 last year. growth was driven by a rapid increase in patient numbers as more evidence has come out and more physicians prescribe cannabis. while there is no reimbursement currently, which is a barrier to growth, we've not seen any pricing erosion. we are also preparing to launch extracts in q4 and have already completed the first delivery to our import partners.
in germany, we had two of the top three best selling products and dry flower for all of calendar 2021. and currently estimate we are number two in market share. our market share has grown steadily in the extract markets thanks to new product innovation. while growth in patient numbers is moderated due to slow prescriber adoption, germany remains the largest market in the eu, and 83 million citizens and we're bullish, given the new coalition's plans to legalize adult rec cannabis and improve medical patient accessibility.
in france, we have completed three shipments to date for the pilot program where we are the exclusive supplier of dry flower. early estimates have us generating revenue as early as march 2023. in the netherlands, we partner with one of 10 license holders to sell legally produce cannabis in approximately 10% of the country's coffee shops. the netherlands is roughly half the size of canada, which recall is a $5 billion retail market.
and like france, we expect sales here to begin in calendar 2023. finally, in australia, our revenues rose 300% year over year, driven by record numbers of patients. through our exclusive supply agreement with medrelief australia, we offer medical patients in the eu gmp certified range of products, including dry flower and recently released vapes. let me reiterate that we believe that the cannabis growth story over the next several years will center on international medical and recreational.
while the eu is currently a medical only market several governments have announced plans for recreational schemes, most notably germany. the eu cannabis market is expected to be $6 billion by 2025. and we expect to grab a sizable market share given our regulatory expertise, compliance protocols, testing and science. these attributes for placing the pole position for success.
turning now to the canadian medical market, we not only have a competitive advantage, but our direct-to-consumer approach drives our industry leading margins. overall revenue was mostly flattened q3 compared to q2 although our market share expanded 200 basis points to 26%. we attribute these share gains to the best in class patient, clinician and physician service we offer along with the launch of a number of premium products and innovation. our insured patients made up 79% of our domestic medical sales, up from 73% in q2.
this is a key to stability and we believe bodes well for the future. the infrastructure to acquire, retain and move the patient through the process requires significant resources and experience. and the truth is that a lot of that same infrastructure and knowhow the patients and the canadian market is directly applicable to our success in other key markets, such as u.k., germany and france. regarding canadian adult rec, our q3 revenue reflects persistent macro challenges including excess inventory and pressure on older skus.
as we've said before, these dynamics are unsustainable, but we have the scale and resources to navigate through this industry consolidation. in the meantime, our focus remains on maximizing profitability by leveraging low cost production and further rationalizing facilities and no longer makes sense, and we have also entered higher margin categories. from april to july, we plan to launch 40 new products with respect to benefit both wrapped and medical channels. these include our first infused pre-rolls, and hash offerings, brand new cultivars from our breeding program, and a bevy of new vape edibles and concentrates flavors.
our full year 2022 innovation calendar includes a significant number of new products, and we have established a regular cadence of new product innovations. finally, i want to conclude with our recent accretive acquisition of thrive. thrive is most widely known for its award winning flagship recreational brand greybeard cannabis company, which was recognized as the number one brand recommended by canadian bud tenders in 2021. this transaction will place the talented management team, who thrive in charge of our canadian rec business, which we expect will drive improvements in our cultivation practices and premium products offerings.
this team has been able to build a profitable premium business with limited resources that will immediately contribute ebitda to bottom line. and with that, i would now like to turn the call over to glen.
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
thank you, miguel. good afternoon, everyone. i'll start off with a few key highlights. we take pride in having one of the strongest balance sheets among canadian lps.
at quarter end we had $480 million of cash and no term debt. during q3, we repurchase $13.4 million in principle on our 2024 convertible debt at a total cost of $11.8 million, including accrued interest. and in early may we repurchased another $128 million in principle on our convertible debt at a total cost of $122.9 million including accrued interest. as of today, we have usd 229 million of principal remaining on our convertible debt.
we believe that debt reduction, even though maturity is still almost three years out, is a prudent and defensive capital allocation decision. this debt reduction will save annual cash interest costs of $8.5 million. also, in early may, we closed the thrive acquisition for which we paid mostly cash, about $26 million cash up to $38 million price. we continue to have access to a shelf perspective, with usd 887.6 million still available on direct, including usd 187.6 million remaining under our atm programs.
as we have stated before, we don't need this capital for operating purposes, consider it as available for strategic m&a, and other value creation opportunities. our cash flow continues to improve with $39.3 million used in operations and working capital in q3 compared to $66.2 million in the same period of last year. and based on the additional targeted cost reductions in calendar 2022 that miguel described, we expect cash flow to continue to improve. we are also progressing closer to our ebitda positive milestone as we reduced our loss by $8.6 million versus last year.
however, compared to last quarter, our adjusted ebitda loss increased by $3.2 million. this is purely due to revenue differences, as i'll explain shortly, as gross margins remain strong and healthy, and sg&a expenses continued to decline further as part of our business transformation plan. q3 net cannabis revenue was $50.4 million compared to $60.6 million last quarter. the change was mainly due to variable cadence from quarter to quarter of shipments in israel, and partially due to lower consumer cannabis net revenue because of competitive pressures across the portfolio, coupled with retail store closures during the quarter in key provinces that impacted our premium offerings.
so let me address each of our core businesses in a bit more detail. canadian medical revenue was $24.8 million in q3, down slightly from q2. as we have said previously, our canadian medical patients fall into two groups, those with cost reimbursement and those without it. to build on what miguel said earlier, we have purposefully repositioned our business to focus on the insured patient population, which should allow us to further improve our bottom-line.
our international medical revenue is $14.6 million, and reflected 55% growth versus the prior year, and the decrease of 26% sequentially. now, i will remember that q2 revenue included approximately $8.5 million in net sales to israel. excluding the impact of the q2 israeli sales, net international medical revenue increased sequentially by 29% and was driven by growth in important markets, including germany, poland, u.k. and australia.
so taken together, our leading medical businesses in canada and europe performed well, as usual generating $39.4 million in sales and gross margin of 64%, up slightly from the prior quarterly. medical represented about 78% of our q3 revenue and almost 90% of our total q3 gross profit. this segment distinguishes us from our competitors, and the stability of the gross profit generated in the businesses is a critical component for us in reaching a positive ebitda run rate by the end of the first half of fiscal 2023. our q3 consumer revenue was $10.3 million, which reflected a 28% decline compared to the last quarter.
consumer cannabis represented about 21% of our q3 revenues and about 11% of our gross profit. as i mentioned before, the revenue decline is primarily attributed to price pressures across our portfolio and was exacerbated by covid-related store closures in january that impacted our premium brands. it is important to note that, even as our consumer cannabis net revenue fell, our consumer gross margin improves 600 basis points to 29%, as we continue to shift toward the higher margin product portfolio. in march for the first time in our history, san rafael sales were greater than data special revenue.
this shift is important for our path to positive ebitda, and combined with the acquisition of thrive, we expect to see this move to premium margins accelerate. as an example of the importance of this shift, in q3, despite revenue being off $4 million quarter over quarter, gross profit was only down $280,000. sg&a, which includes r&d, came in at $42.3 million in q3. and this included $2.7 million in restructuring costs and prior period accruals.
excluding these costs, adjusted sg&a was $39.5 million, our lowest level in almost four years, which was prior adult use legalization. while our sg&a is already well controlled, we are certainly not done with the efficiency and expect to make significant additional progress as part of our updated targeted range for cost savings. so pulling all of this together, yes, we generated an adjusted ebitda loss in q3 2022 of $12.3 million, $3.2 million change in adjusted ebitda loss as compared to last quarter was primarily driven by the lower level of sales in the israel, and was partially offset with a $2.3 million decrease in adjusted sg&a expense. now, i'll give you a bit more color regarding our revised cost savings target of $150 million to $170 million on an annualized basis.
we plan to have executed all of the necessary changes, before the end of calendar 2022 and expect these savings to be evenly split between cost of goods sold and sg&a. they should be reflected in our p&l either as they occur over the next three quarters for sg&a savings or as the inventory is drawn down following production related savings. and of course, all of it positively impacts our cash flow the changes are executed. today's announcement of the closure of our aurora sky facility in edmonton is part of our business transformation plan.
this decision is in keeping with our strategy in the canadian adult rec market to focus on higher margin premium categories and to move away from purposefully producing for the low to no margin categories. we are working toward a leaner more agile operating model and is expected to provide strong upward ebitda leverage as future revenues increase. resulting from the strategic business transformation changes, we recorded a number of one-time non-cash accounting charges in q3. goodwill in the canadian market segment was written down completely charges $741.7 million.
and we recorded specific asset impairments of $176.1 million, and an inventory provision charges $63.6 million. so summing up, there are three key takeaways from my financial review of q3 2022. first, our balance sheet remains strong supported by a healthy cash balance, reduced convertible debt levels, and improving working capital on cash flow. second, our medical businesses in canada and internationally provide us with a competitive advantage and are critical to us generating sustainable profitability.
and it's worth noting we generate more gross profit for our medical cannabis businesses than any of our canadian lp competitors do from their entire cannabis businesses. and finally, we've worked hard to increase the target range for cost savings. these are expected to have material positive impact or bottom-line and cash flow and reflect a leaner operating model that positions as well for future growth. so thanks for your interest in aurora.
i'll now turn the call back to miguel.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
thanks, glen. before q&a, let me share some final takeaways. we expect to achieve a positive adjusted ebitda run rate by the end of the first half of fiscal 2023. second, our medical cannabis business continues to be a smart business to invest behind, particularly in environment of war in europe, high inflation and possible recession.
it has defensible characteristics, high margins, and in our view, no one does it better both domestically and internationally. third, we expect the rec market in canada to correct and when that process is complete, we will have added opportunity for market share and pricing. our focus in the meantime is rationalizing our footprint and driving cost efficiencies. fourth, our science and innovation program adds another capitalized opportunity to our portfolio.
and our strong balance sheet positions us for continued organic growth and strategic m&a. on that note, we have already demonstrated considerable patience and discipline in evaluating acquisitions, seeking targets that not only fits strategically, but are also rationally priced. the accretive m&a is a vital part of our plan going forward, and we believe we're in a great position to create shareholder value over time. so in closing, we're delivering on our stated goals, most notably our business transformation plan, which is squarely on track.
we appreciate your time and interest today. we're energized for the rest of the year. and now, i'll turn it over the operator to open the lines for questions.

thank you. [operator instructions]. and our first question comes from the line of vivien azer with cowen. please proceed with your question.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. good evening.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
good evening, viv.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
so, i just wanted to dig on -- dig into some of the revenue versus volume dynamics that you guys experienced in the quarter. maybe it's as simple as fx headwinds, which we're very familiar with covering large cap staples. but usually your revenues and volumes, at least directionally, move in tandem, and it seems like there was a bit of a divergence there. so, i'm wondering if there is any geographic mix or other price mix considerations to call out, please.
thank you.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
you got it. glen?
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
viv, i think what we saw was a bit of a mix change between consumer and medical. our european medical did take a step down in the quarter, particularly in germany as there is a cultivar there producing ran into few production problems. they are correctable. they are in process of being corrected.
but -- so, what we then saw, if you're looking at our average pricing, it's something -- is that consumer particularly with the addition of driving stuff, it's a greater impact from the consumer pricing than we normally see in the mix. so, that might be what you're looking at. but other than that, i think it was just kind of business as usual in terms of volume. so, you get that impact from more volume right through on the consumer business and lower average pricing.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst

our next question comes from the line of michael lavery with piper sandler. please proceed with your question.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. good evening.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
good evening, michael.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
i just wanted to understand some of your thinking on the portfolio strategy a little bit more. the greenhouse synergies with bevo makes sense and take advantage of just your particular situation and obviously add -- help add some ebitda. but are there any other adjacencies you'd be considering or that are on your radar, i guess just one part of it? and maybe related is just also as you think about the ebitda target, is any more expected to come from m&a?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
yes. i mean -- so let me try to unpack that a little bit. i think as it pertains to m&a, our center of the play to where we sort of live is medical cannabis, global medical cannabis. and so, for that reason, certain things that have been of interest to others are probably not as much of interest to us.
secondly, our position on the u.s. i think is one that's been validated. it's going to take longer. i'm of the strong belief that it's going to be a -- if it's federal, it's going to be a medical construct with the fda involved.
and clearly, given our dominance internationally on medical cannabis would have a lot of options there.  so, if you take the u.s. out of the mix and you take maybe some other things out of the mix, you find certain things that maybe are more attracted to us than others. we liked thrive and we've talked about that because of the management team and the ability to really support what i think important synergies between rec and medical. bevo, we think is just an absolute diamond in the rough, incredible propagator of science, has a really clever use of tax benefits as it pertains to sky and has a big upside of growth for what we thought was a fair value, both for us and for their shareholders.  so, i think, michael, we'll continue to look at things like that.
we've been terribly patient. as glen was pretty eloquent about the balance sheet, it's important to me that we have a really strong balance sheet, so we're not going to chase there. but if things come up, we've got the fire power to go after them. the only other place that maybe is of more interest to someone like us than maybe others are those things that connect into medical cannabis.
it's my opinion, and i think it's been proven out that you can make investments around medical cannabis, and those investments in some cases are portable around the world, infrastructure, systems, understandings around patients, and science, which is something we've made a lot of investments in, and they now are just starting to pay dividends. so, steady as we go. i think, we're pretty good shape. in terms of the ebitda part, the reality is if we can hold revenues and margins flat from the current level and we can get sg&a under 30, you get there.
and so, we expect to reach that type of sg&a by q2, and we've shown a lot of progress. and i think, while some may have other questions, when we've said we're going to do something around efficiencies, we've done it. and that sg&a would clearly be consistent with that.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst

our next question comes from the line of pablo zuanic with cantor fitzgerald. please proceed with your question.

thank you. good afternoon. miguel, i'm looking at a press release tilray issued on september 6th, and it says ""tilray initiates roundtable with german regulators to kick-off draft legislation, to legalize adult-use cannabis in germany."" and i'm wondering when i saw the press release, i said, well, i mean, i suppose that aurora will soon issue a similar press release. so, i guess, the question -- the very basic question is, can you tell us, or give some color about your lobbying capabilities, your people on the ground, your potential seat at the table in helping draft the german program.
because again, i was surprised, tilray issued a press release, and we didn't hear from you. and if it may add, a part b to the question, where do you guys stand today in terms of whether germany will allow imports or it's going to be initially mostly just domestic production? thank you.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
you got it. so, the first thing is i'm not here to comment on anybody. i have tremendous respect for my competitors, and what they do is what they do. but -- so i don't really have any comment on that.
in terms of the german market, we've made a significant investment in germany. we have what we think might be one of the leading government relations, government affairs executives in germany. he is having good conversations with the regulators. i've spent my whole career working on things like this in both, tobacco and alcohol, and they're never a straight line.
i think, as it pertains to germany, there's two things going on as you well know and you've written a lot about, is both enhancements to the medical business, which we're very excited about as one of the leaders in medical cannabis in germany, and secondly, is the legalization of the rec business. so, my understanding and our understanding is that industries -- what industry needs in order for that to be successful is being considered. the german government is -- almost always are being very thoughtful about the stakeholders and the timing in which this can be done in a compliant way. i would expect their learnings from medical will color how they so go about the implementation of rec business, which is why we think those companies that have facilities with the medical business advantages in rec, and as we said earlier, one of only three companies that have a license to produce in germany.
now specific to your question about in-country, i think the going in position i think for most folks should be that because of the un conventions and just because of the way the regs are going to work for rec is that the most obvious path for rec would be in-country manufacturing. now, clearly whether the number is 200 tons or 300 tons or 400 tons in order to service that rec market, that is significantly more capacity than three of us have. but clearly, that would be an opportunity there. we also would say that while rec most likely would be an in-country production exercise, medical continues to be allowed with an eu gmp certification to have products brought into germany.
we do that successfully today from both, our nordic facility as well as our canadian facilities. and we think it's one of our core competencies. so, more to follow in germany, i understand the interest in it. i think what i would tell people is it's going to move thoughtfully.
it might not always be a straight line, but we have tremendous respect for the regulators there in what we've seen from the medical business. and i think, my expectation is that it will be a robust rec business. i just can't predict when, but at the time it will be compliant companies, experienced companies and thoughtful companies will have an advantage in germany. and then clearly germany implements this, that will be a beacon for other key markets around the world in terms of how you can go from medical cannabis and to recreational cannabis.

our next question comes from the line of andrew carter from stifel. please proceed with your question.
andrew carter -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yes. thank you. focusing on the bevo business, which we certainly have experience with covering site one. number one, do you see this platform to go deeper in this, given that this is a very fragmented space, and you now have a team to run that? and then, the second you have the decision to repurpose sky versus selling it, which -- that's an opportunity cost that if you will kind of adds to the cost of acquisition.
what kind of timeline are you giving the bevo team to get this up to speed, achieve a return, versus if it didn't go well, kind of returning to that original selling the facility and also getting rid of all of the costs associated with it? thanks.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
you got it, andrew. so, first on bevo, bevo is a tremendous business, and you guys did cover it and so did others. i think it is a fallacy to say that bevo didn't work in that previous construct when it was connected to another cannabis company. bevo did work.
it's just that combination did not work. we are not combining bevo with aurora from cannabis assets and non-cannabis assets. so, there's that. secondly, bevo is a tremendous business.
they have significant big box contracts, both in canada and the u.s. and there is a lot of opportunity right now in north america for them to expand that business, both in canada and the u.s. because of shipping costs. and many of the items that they produce are produced offshore in asia and southeast asia.
and so, they have tremendous opportunities there. and we're excited about that, particularly since it can be done in a very capital-light manner. it's not going to draw down cash resources from aurora that would expand that.  and the team that has so successfully run it is going to continue to run it. this is not -- aurora does not pretend to have excellence in orchids or propagation.
so, it was key for us to have those key folks, leo and andrew and those key guys over there to run it, and we are thrilled about that. as it pertains to sky, listen, i don't want to get too pumped-up about this. but the combination of the tax benefit, the repurposing, the changes in the tax designation and the upside that it presents very quickly for bevo was a way better deal than being caught up with everybody else trying to sell cannabis assets. and at the end of the day, if they can't get there, we can always sell it in that key edmonton market.
but the beauty, if there is such a thing, of all the money that's been spent on sky, is there is not a lot of capex or opex required by bevo in order to generate revenue. so, as glen mentioned, the bevo business is a bit seasonal and it contributes more in our q2, q3 than it does in q1. but to answer your question, i think we'll know, in say next nine to 12 months exactly what sky means for bevo. and if it doesn't work out, we still have that optionality.
but the offset of all the things i've mentioned make that play significantly a better advantage for aurora than just selling it for pennies on the dollar.

and our next question comes from the line of andrew bond with jefferies. please proceed with your question.
andrew bond -- jefferies -- analyst
hey. good evening, andrew bond on the line for owen bennett. thank you for taking our question. so, from us, on the international segment, can you give us some more detail on performance between markets? not looking for an exact breakout, but i think last earnings call, you all discussed plans to launch extracts in the uk in 4q and also some top market share positions in the other key markets like australia, germany, poland.
so, any detail on where sales came from in 4q and where there might have been some weakness relative to 3q? and if i could just sneak in maybe more broadly, how you would characterize growth ahead in fiscal '23? thank you.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
sure. let me take a top-line comment about international and some of those key markets, and i'll glen get into some of the details about it. so, as we said in our prepared remarks, it is really important to be operating in a lot of countries. you got to operate in the right countries.
and so, the reason for that is, these sales are still a bit lumpy. we've all seen that in what's happened with israel. but whether it's import permits or shipments or the regs sort of evolving, you get these, sort of, months where these sales and you have these months you don't. secondly, a lot of these investments can play out and really generate incremental margins and revenue, if they are laid over a broader system.
so, the same production system, the same cultivars, the same genetics, the same a lot of things are similar to what we do in germany, czech republic, poland, on and on and on.  now, you have to have different distribution models to take advantage of those different pieces, and we have done that. and so, in most markets, we are just the manufacturer, but in other markets, we have a sales force and a wholesale piece. the western european or the international market as a whole is absolutely growing and clearly is the fastest growing segment of global cannabis, which is this medical piece. and i will say that the regs are quite similar, whether that's packaging, stability testing, manufacturing, eu gmp, there has been this sort of consistency and evolution that advantages a company like us.  now, in terms of the actual specifics on the country breakouts, glen, i'll turn that over to you.
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
yes, thanks. so, i mean, we keep calling out the same countries as kind of the dominant ones for us in our network and that's germany, poland, uk, and australia. but to miguel's point, they definitely are lumpy, like australia for instance in q4 was up 75% from the previous quarter. but then as i look at q1, it'll come down again and q2 looks good again.
so, it's very -- we've called it a lumpy or something, and that's why it's really important to have that portfolio, because for the most part our international business is fairly predictable, but country by country, as they develop and as they find where those barriers are that need to be knocked down, patient access, things like that. and that was definitely the story in australia a year or two back when they had to improve patient accessibility, and then the market seems to be really kind of taking off.  in terms of our extract in germany, we did launch in q4 -- late in q4. so, we don't see much in terms of revenue in germany, in q4, but it is an important part of the competitive landscape there. so, we are in that market now, and we'll report more as we go forward on how that piece of our business is going.
so again, germany, australia, uk, poland, being the predominant international medical markets for us right now. but i'd say, there's probably at least four or five others that are contributing revenue in q4.

our next question comes from the line of matt bottomley with canaccord genuity. please proceed with your question.
matt bottomley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
good evening, everyone. thanks for taking these questions. just two questions for me on the revenue side of things. first just on the consumer sales in canada, there's a bit of a divergence i think was noted with respect to aurora sales relative to the macro level data on some of these point of sales subscription services we all look like.
so, glen, you had mentioned some of the headwinds related to maybe the ocs website or some others. so, i'm just wondering if you can give us a little more color on that. and the second question on revenue is just related to your international sales is the current $11 million to $12 million that you did in q4. if that just stays flat for the sake of argument, is that sufficient to get you to your profitability targets on an adjusted ebitda considering a lot of your margin does come from those sales.
thanks, guys.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
yes. let me comment on syndicated data, and then glen can obviously give you the background. one of the gaps in some of this syndicated data that everybody looks at is quebec. quebec is our largest province in terms of sales.
and so, it underweights what we're doing. i think, generally the rec business overall for an lp is generally challenging. it was referenced before what happened with the hack, unfortunately in the ocs that caused about two weeks of disruption. they did an unbelievable job to get back up and running.
we also saw the strike out in bc that had a pretty significant effect for a long period of time. that's been cleaned up as well. i think, the combination of that, and retail stores feeling a lot of pressure plus compressed margins overall means you really have to be sort of focused in where we went and the thrive team's done a tremendous job. and you can still -- there's still places you can find to make money, premium flower obviously, but vapes, concentrates, and some of the other things that they're particularly good at.
so, i think, we're going to be in this wash a little bit longer in terms of what the macro sort of issues are with rec. but when it comes out, there is tremendous amount of efficiencies for someone that does as well as we do in medical and rec to have some of those items, particularly as patients are starting to look for more premium items, and clinicians are starting to be more open to variety. so, glen, you want to pick up the rest of it?
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
yes. thanks very much, miguel. yes. so certainly, consumer revenue at the current levels would be more than adequate to get us to our profitability goal.
if you -- certainly picking up the message that most of our gross profit is being generated out of our medical businesses. so, 86% in q4, and that was a quarter where our international medical had a little bit of a pause. so, normal, the quarter before say q3 was 90% of our gross profits were coming out of our medical system. so, absolutely as we see growth picking up again in europe and australia over the next number of quarters, canadian business, the objective is to stabilize it, getting on good footing and give it a launch pad for growth in the future.
but the short-term plan is to really get to our profitability goal on the back of our medical businesses.
matt bottomley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst

our next question comes from the line of frederico gomes with atb capital markets. please proceed with your question.
frederico gomes -- atb capital markets -- analyst
hi. good evening. thanks for taking my questions. so, just on the international side, we are seeing some increased competition in some markets, namely israel, several other lps and international companies exporting to different markets.
so, can you talk about how you see that competition coming? are you seeing any margin pressure in international? and what sort of advantages do you have to compete in your main markets, like germany and poland? thank you.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
sure. so, listen, i've spent a lot of time in israel and israel is obviously a key market for a lot of folks. the challenges we've talked about in israel is they have a significant amount of local production. and clearly that has advantages.
so, the import permits and the process, and the certification of israel is sort of an evolving one. what we've said about that is that we're not going to give any forward-looking guidance on israel. but when we have a shipment, we always let people know because of the size of it. i'm not -- we haven't had a shipment in a bit on israel.
i don't think that's a forever situation. but right now, it's not as big a focus because -- and to your point, there has been a little bit of margin compression and a lot of people are fighting for that, including the local growers that have a lot of advantages. and i've got tremendous respect for that. overall, internationally, because of the medical setup, we haven't seen the type of margin compression that you've seen in the canadian rec business or in the u.s.
overall. and these are really hard markets to get into. germany, which everybody talks about is about a six to 12-month process in order to even qualify a cultivar. the variance on the potency can only be 10% in their lab, which is a very difficult standard to get to.
and there's a significant amount of other work that you have to do around stability testing and whatnot.  the other piece of this is the fact that patients are quite sticky. once they find something they like, whether it's ours or a competitive product, unlike rec where you see massive share movements between top skus, you don't see that in the medical business. and there's clearly first mover advantage, there's clearly a consistency advantage to those companies that can keep stuff in stock and are rolled out of the medical market.  so international cannabis, in most markets you're seeing maybe four companies, possibly five companies making up the lion share of sales. as we've all talked about, canadian rec as an example of top five companies do less than a third of the overall business.
and so, i think the international business has proven to be sticky. and as you go forward with the advent of things such as clinical research, partnership with clinicians, these systems getting bigger, i think you're going to still see in most markets, big markets like germany that three or four companies will do the lion's share of the business for a long time, and we expect aurora to be one of them.

our next question comes from the line of john zamparo with cibc. please proceed with your question.
john zamparo -- cibc world markets -- analyst
thanks. good evening. i wanted to get back to bevo. and if we think about the evolution of aurora over time, it used to be a pretty broad, expansive business as multiple segments, then narrowed down to be purely cannabis.
and bevo is certainly outside the core strategy of what the company was. but what i'm wondering is, should we view this as bevo was trying to optimize the decision with sky, or do you want to further diversify the business away from pure cannabis at this point?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
i think, john, and sorry, i know we talked about -- i missed you and your folks this week. here's how i would think about bevo. everything that we do is about being a global leader in medical cannabis. in order to do that, there are two things that we have been innately focused on.
one is profitability and secondly is strengthening some core underpinnings that we think will be an advantage to that pursuit of global leadership in medical cannabis.  bevo was really interesting to us for a couple of reasons. one is about sky. and so, the tax option there, the use of sky, the ability for it to very quickly, without capex, produce a significant amount of predictable, profitable revenue was important to us. secondly, there are synergies and efficiencies.
we haven't gotten into them yet and we are not going to do it in a disruptive way. but propagation has always been this sort of interesting play in cannabis. and while it's done in the u.s., it's not really done in canada. and so, the excellence of 80 plus years around propagation, science, there will be things that will come out of the bevo system or the aurora system that will be additive.
and as we look at agriculture, as a general sort of play and things around it, we do see it's additive. now, i don't -- the concept of adjacency, i do believe in staying close to the core. but, if there are things that are profitable, there is a good value for our shareholders and is additive both financially and thematically, particularly from a science standpoint to our overall mission, i think we're going to be interested in that. and i'm pretty proud of this deal for a lot of different reasons, but proof's in the pudding and i don't want to get over my skis too much on it.
but this is a really great team, a really good use of assets, capex light, and produces a lot of strength for us. so, we'll see.
john zamparo -- cibc world markets -- analyst

and our last question comes from the line of tamy chen with bmo capital markets. please proceed with your question.
tamy chen -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. thanks for squeezing me in. my question is on the science side, particularly the licensing of genetics. miguel, i was just curious, this particular aspect of the science business, how do you see that fit within the overall aurora business? like, is this an area that you're very focused on you do want to expand? like, what's the opportunity size that you see? and i guess, the last part of the question i have is, whatever genetics that do come out of your r&d and innovation that are good, i'm just wondering like why don't you just keep that for yourselves and grow it for your own business, whether it's your own medical or consumer segment? thank you.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
you're very welcome. so, it is something we're focused on. aurora has spent an inordinate amount of time and effort on this. and it may be, i don't want to say it is, but it may be one of the largest genetic facilities connected to cannabis in the world.
and so, as it pertains to that, there are significant advantages, not just around variety and uniqueness of the cultivars, say chasing potency, and terp levels. plant health, i referenced yield, farm gas is twice, 2x, the yield per square meter than some of our historical cultivars that totally changes footprint and all types of different things that are going on. there's incredible work being done on things like powdery mildew. and so, what i've seen is that when you look at other agricultural categories, there are companies that are not branded that are not participating from a manufacturing standpoint of selling their items, but they're genetics, their science, and they are participating in those markets.
and we're all familiar with them. no, one's really doing that today on a global scale, and we think there's a space there. i also don't view it as a conflict. we have about a three share in the rec business.
we have a 24 share in the canadian medical business. and we have enough assets in order to serve our pipeline, both domestically and internationally as well as sell that. and some of these licensing deals are very innovative and to be honest are not overly creative. and you see them in other categories such as soybean and vegetables and tomatoes and other things that were around because of some of our partnerships.
and so, like i said, we're excited about this. the last part of this, while there are some lps doing this, there is a huge gap from particularly canadian lps and accessing world class genetics. they just haven't done the work, and it's not something you can snap your fingers and start up. this is a five or 10-year process in breeding and genetics and in training in order to be there.
and so, we're excited about what it means for us. and you see some of those -- some of that stuff in the market. we're also excited about what it means, from -- for being able to sell it and generating revenue streams. because the reality is we're not going to have a 50 share of the rec business.
and unlike some of my past businesses where we've been having these massive market shares, so there's plenty of place to do it. and as this stuff evolves, it's our hope we'll be able to sell genetics internationally as well. so, i think it's a great play. almost the entirety of that spend is already accounted for.
and we think there's huge upside in not only for us, but for others in accessing those genetics and those incredible sort of science innovations.
tamy chen -- bmo capital markets -- analyst

we've focused on those areas of the business that is profitable. and we do see an upside. and as these markets continue to come online, it's been medical first and then rec, and we think aurora is in a great position. so, we appreciate your support.
we appreciate your interest. and we look forward to sharing our progress as we move forward. best to all and your families, wish you all the best. and we'll go from there.

miguel, please go ahead. 
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
thank you, ananth. before discussing the business more broadly, let me begin with a brief discussion of our latest acquisition, a controlling interest in bevo, one of the largest suppliers of propagated vegetables and ornamental plants in north america. this transaction first and foremost underscores a disciplined approach to capital allocation; and second, is consistent with both our immediate needs and our vision of becoming a leader in global cannabis. bevo will be managed by its existing management team who have over 85 years of agricultural experience and have consistently demonstrated growth in revenue and earnings over the past decade.
collectively, they retain a substantial equity ownership position as they embark on a robust growth plan. as part of the transaction, we have identified a profitable opportunity to repurpose the aurora sky facility, orchid cultivation, and vegetable propagation with minimal capital investment. this will greatly increase bevo's production capability and extended shipping range in canada and the united states. it will also enable us to generate incremental revenue and adjusted ebitda, while saving on previously announced wind-down and selling costs.
the transaction is immediately accretive to aurora, adding approximately $9 million of annual adjusted ebitda, and importantly is another tangible step toward our goal of adjusted ebitda profitability on a run rate basis by december the 31, 2022. we are pleased to have bevo as our partner and expect our investment to drive significant shareholder value over the long run. beyond the acquisition, we feel very good about our position in the market. our optimism is based on the inherent strength of our global medical cannabis business where we remain the number one canadian lp.
medical cannabis remains the best segment to invest in as is both defensive and stable in turbulent times and commence amiable adjusted gross margins that consistently exceed 60%, two times that of consumer cannabis. and while our canadian medical cannabis business is steady, our international business saw revenues increased by over 70% this fiscal year with notable progress in germany, poland, the uk, and australia. the second reason for our enthusiasm is we continue to excel our rationalizing the business to the current environment. as you know, our annualized cost savings of $150 million to $170 million will be completed within the next two quarters; and once complete, will materially reduce our cash needs and get us closer to ebitda breakeven.
our balance sheet is also a key differentiator and has enabled us to repurchase $155 million in convertible debt during q4, which will result in considerable savings on cash interest costs. additionally, we have approximately $370 million in cash as of yesterday, which makes aurora one of only a handful of companies within the cannabis industry to have a net cash position. finally, we feel great about our investment in science, which is beginning to pay off. specifically, our breeding program has delivered nine new proprietary cultivars through our product pipelines since june of 2021, delivered meaningful improvement to yields and is expected to generate incremental high margin revenue through license agreements for these genetic innovations to other licensed producers.
in fact, i'm excited to announce that we signed our first agreement to license genetics, to a major canadian lp during q4, and we expect more to follow. so, let's take a deeper dive into our global medical cannabis business. during q4, international medical revenue was up 35% compared to last year as our regulatory expertise, compliance protocols, testing and science capabilities supported our leadership position. while revenue contributions for individual countries can certainly ebb and flow as these new markets develop due to various factors, including the timing of government approvals and import permits, we believe our exposure to nearly a dozen countries outside of canada affords us relative insulation as it relates to the economic climate and conditions in specific countries across europe, israel, and australia.
in poland, revenues nearly doubled year-over-year and we maintained our number one market share position. we continue to invest in marketing efforts there to support our planned launch of new flower and extract products. in the uk, our revenues increased by 25% compared to q4 last year, and we believe we're the market leader in the flower segment. uk witnessed rapid growth in patient population over the last year, and we hope to see this continue as new clinics open up.
turning to germany, we received eu gmp certification for our state-of-the-art domestic medical cannabis production facility in may and made our first shipment to german pharmacies that same month. recall that we hold one of only three licenses in germany and are number two in medical flower with a 17% volume share. our market share is also growing steadily in the extract market, thanks to new product innovation. during q4, we also launched three sizes of dronabinol making our first step into that category.
while growth in patients has moderated during the year, germany remains the largest market in the eu with 83 million citizens with only about a 100,000 to 120,000 medical cannabis patients. we are certainly well aware of some of the economic challenges that germany is facing at the present time as it grapples with the war in ukraine and the impact that is having on energy prices and inflation. still, we are hopeful the growth will pick back up this fiscal year, even against this backdrop, driven by doctor education and a simplified reimbursement process. we expect to begin generating revenues in france in 2023, where we are currently the only supplier of dry flower in the pilot program.
finally in australia, our q4 revenue rose 700% year-over-year, driven by record number of patients. let me reiterate that we believe that cannabis growth story will center on international medical and recreational over the next several years. right now, we believe there are about 150,000 patients in europe alone. and if the countries that have so far legalized medical cannabis were to reach similar adoption levels to canada, 1% of the adult population, the patient pool could expand to 3.5 million people.
this fiscal year, we expect a number of new medical markets to come online. and several governments have announced plans for recreational schemes, most notably germany. so, it's a massive opportunity. we believe our success in medical cannabis provides us with a significant first mover advantage and our leadership will be portable to rec markets as they open up.
turning to the canadian medical market. our leading market share was over 24% while insured patients comprised 81% of our domestic medical sales, up from 79% in q3. our net revenue per order and per participating patient have both significantly increased over the past year due to a shift toward higher value insured patients, while our direct-to-consumer approach continues to drive industry leading margins. overall revenue was flat in q4 compared to q3, but we attribute our share gain to the best-in-class service we offer along with new premium products and innovations.
we note that acquiring, retaining and moving the patients through the process requires significant resources and experience, and much of that same infrastructure and know-how with patients in canada is directly applicable to our success in europe. switching to canadian adult rec, our q4 revenue increased by $2.3 million as compared to the prior quarter. the increase was primarily due to our strengthened product offerings in certain categories, along with seven weeks of results from thrive. their premium consumer cannabis net revenue added about $1.4 million.
while the environment of canadian rec has seen prolonged macro challenges, we are beginning to see signs of stabilization, and we remain focused on maximizing profitability through low-cost production and by entering higher margin categories. the market also continues to highlight the importance of innovation and the sku lifecycle, with the typical sku generating 80% of its lifetime value in the six months following launch. 13 skus were launched across our rec and medical channels in june alone, and we have a stack pipeline that should serve us well over the coming quarters. more broadly, we believe that our scientific leadership in cannabis breeding and genetics provides aurora with a unique advantage that drives value in all tiers of the consumer and medical categories.
our breeding program has delivered nine new proprietary cultivars to our product pipeline since june of 2021, as well as bringing new products to consumers, they deliver meaningful improvements in yield, which will allow us to boost top quality flower and industry leading margins. for example, our new farm gas cultivar delivers nearly double the yield of our traditional staple cultivars and does so at an average of 26.5% thc. and with that, i would now like to turn the call over to glen for our financial review. but let me quickly say that we've made incredible strategic progress during the year.
we are on track with our transformation plan. and we feel very optimistic about the future of the business.
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
thanks, miguel. good afternoon, everyone. we're proud to have one of the strongest balance sheets among canadian lps, and i'm pleased that we strengthened it even further during q4. but at the same time that we've been executing our cost reduction plan, we also repurchased $155.3 million in principal on convertible notes, with a total cost of $149.2 in cash and that's including accrued interest.
as of yesterday, we had approximately ca$370 million of available cash and we have $209 million principal remaining on the convertible notes. we believe that debt reduction, even though maturity is still more than a year out is a smart and defensive capital allocation decision that reduces balance sheet risk, especially important during turbulent markets. the debt reduction executed so far saving us cash interest cost of $9.5 million annually. we continue to have access to a shelf prospectus with $713.7 million still available including $186.2 million remaining under our atm program, which we may utilize from time-to-time for strategic purposes.
our cash flow continues to improve with $22.5 million used in operations in working capital in q4, compared to $39.3 million in the prior quarter. q4 includes restructuring and severance payments of $6.8 million. we're moving closer to our positive adjusted ebitda target, as we have reduced our loss by $8.9 million versus q4 of last year. if we compare to last quarter, q3, our adjusted ebitda loss increased by about $1.5 million and that's driven mostly by a change in the company's sales channel mix.
as miguel mentioned, we also expect a positive contribution from our controlling stake in bevo, which delivered ebitda of $9 million for the year ending june 30, 2022.  i should note that the bevo business has a strong seasonal cadence with the period from january to june expected to deliver roughly two-thirds of the full annual revenue and ebitda. so overall, aurora remains on track to achieve a positive adjusted ebitda run rate as we execute it. q4 net cannabis revenue was $50.2 million, and that's compared to $50.4 million last quarter. q4 revenue included the non-routine $1 million provision for returns from prior period.
so, excluding that prior period adjustment, revenue was $51.2 million. medical cannabis fell modestly, while consumer cannabis rose, due mostly to contributions from our thrive acquisition. so, let me now address each of our core businesses in a bit more detail. canadian medical revenue was $24.9 million in q4, up $118,000 from q3 and reflecting the stability of this business.
our focus and traction with the insured patient population is certainly beneficial to us as it provides greater consistency to the segment in any economic environment while the higher margin nature of this business compared to the consumer cannabis business contributes substantially more to our bottom line. our international medical revenue was $11.6 million, and that reflected 35% growth versus the same quarter a year ago, but a 20% decrease sequentially. the increase compared to q4 last year was due to our strong presence in key international growth markets, including australia, poland, and the uk. the decrease relative to last quarter resulted from the temporary situation of limited supply of high demand cultivars in europe, coupled with a weakened euro.
we expect these supply issues to continue through q1, but to improve in the following quarters. taken together, our leading canadian and global medical businesses performed well, generating $36.6 million in sales and adjusted gross margins of 62%, down only slightly from 64% in the prior quarter. medical represents about 73% of our q4 revenue and about 86% of our adjusted gross profit. this segment best distinguishes us from our competitors and is critical to aurora's path to deliver a positive adjusted run rate as we exit december 2022.  our q4 consumer revenue was $12.6 million, a $2.3 million increase compared to last quarter.
consumer cannabis represented about 27% of our q4 revenue and about 14% of our adjusted gross profit. the revenue increase was due mainly to $1.4 million from the addition of thrive's consumer business, starting may 6th and the relative stabilization of our canadian consumer business. now, that being said, we do expect some short-term disruptions to q1 consumer cannabis revenue due to the cyber-attack on the ontario cannabis store distribution system and a significant labor strike at bc's liquor and cannabis distribution centers with our revenue exposure from these events being as much as $3 million in q1. we do not expect this to impact our timelines to profitability.
as i just mentioned, our medical business is responsible for about 86% of our adjusted gross profit. sg&a, which includes r&d, came in at $49.3 million in q4. however, this included $6.7 million in restructuring costs and $2.3 million in prior period employee-related accruals. this restructuring related to significant staffing reductions we took in june 2022 as part of our business and cost transformation plan.
so, excluding these costs, q4 sg&a was $39.1 million. and this is our lowest level of sg&a in almost four years. ultimately, we expect to drive sg&a for the existing cannabis business to below $30 million with a meaningful reduction expected in q1 and the full savings being realized by december 2022. so, pulling all of this together, we generated an adjusted ebitda loss in q4 2022 of $12.9 million, compared to $11.4 million in previous quarter.
this is driven mostly by a change in the company's sales mix to more consumer revenue and sales in q4, which yielded lower average net selling prices. looking forward into q1 fiscal 2023, we do expect to see an improvement to adjusted ebitda, but that will be driven primarily by a reduction in sg&a to under $35 million in q1. i would like to reiterate our commitment to annualized cost savings of $150 million to $170 million. these savings are evenly split between cost of goods sold and sg&a, and we are seeing them reflected in our p&l, either as they occur for the sg&a savings or as inventory is drawn down for production-related savings.
with the decisions we have taken, we are working toward a leaner, more agile operating model, and that is expected to provide strong ebitda leverage as future revenues increase. during q4, we also recognized non-cash impairment charges of $505.1 million. this is relating to goodwill, intangible assets, and other tangible assets. the impairment represents the full remaining goodwill balance associated with aurora's cannabis operations and the impairment was partially due to changes in cannabis market conditions but most importantly, the changes in the current capital market environment, including higher rates of borrowing and lower foreign exchange rates.
now, finally, just a minor housekeeping item. our upcoming fiscal year 2023 will only have three quarters as we are changing our fiscal year end to march 31st. and that's in order to achieve certain internal cost and staffing efficiencies. these include -- there are three key points from my financial review that i'd like to reiterate.
first, our balance sheet is stronger than ever, supported by a healthy cash balance, reduced convertible debt level, and improving working capital and cash flow. second, our medical businesses in canada and globally provide us with a competitive advantage and are critical to us generating sustainable profitability. and finally, we've taken the actions to meet our targeted range for cost savings by december 2022. these will have a materially positive impact on our bottom-line and reflect a leaner operating model that positions us well for future growth.
so, thanks for your interest in aurora. and i'll now turn the call back to miguel.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
thanks glen.  here are four brief takeaways before we take your questions. one, we're better positioned than ever to achieve our goal of a positive adjusted ebitda run rate as we exit the quarter in december of 2022, and we have listed out several data points that support that here today. two, our medical cannabis business is a formidable force in the industry, both domestically and internationally. it remains the smartest cannabis segment to invest behind today, given the long-term growth opportunities, the high margins and the defensive nature of the segment described earlier.
three, the canadian rec market is in the process of correcting. and as the recovery is complete, we will have added opportunity for market share and pricing. four, our science and innovation program represent another high-margin opportunity that's just started. to conclude, we are making significant strategic progress with each passing quarter, we're nearing the completion of our business transformation plan, and have done so while strengthening our balance sheet.
in addition, we've made two acquisitions in the past few months, thrive and then bevo, which underscores our ability to grow organically and through m&a, and we feel confident that we can create significant long-term shareholder value, particularly from these levels. we appreciate your time and interest in aurora, and now be happy to take your questions. operator, please open the lines for questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from the line of vivien azer with cowen. please proceed with your question.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. thank you. good evening.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
good evening, viv.
vivien azer -- cowen and company -- analyst
so, i wanted to dig in on medical cannabis gross margins, please, down a little bit year over year and sequentially. clearly, it was not an impediment to you guys hitting your target for positive adjusted ebitda, which is really, really nice to see, and congratulations on that. but given the call out that the margin dilution was coming from frontier market, do you see the kind of current gross margin levels for that business are an appropriate run rate? it seems like you've got a lot of opportunity ahead of you and your mix to frontier market might kind of stay at these levels and or climb a little bit until there's a real catalyst in germany?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
yes. i mean -- so as it pertains to medical cannabis, i think structurally we don't see the margin compression that maybe you would see in the rec market. we're up to about 25% of the canadian business and the reimbursed market, which represents about 80% of our revenues in canada is at a healthy number that is part of the overall system. some of that was mix, as you sort of mentioned in canada.
but structurally, we don't see anything there. when you look internationally, you also don't sort of see those impediments. and yes, there will be places maybe where lower cost items gain a little bit of traction, but because the model is structured in a manner that most of the supply chain takes their margin off of a percentage of the wholesale list and because you see reimbursement in those markets, there's not a structural reason to see margin compression. secondarily, in the rec business in canada, you're competing against hundreds of manufacturers and, in some cases, some that need to sell their product at a lower number.
in most of the international markets, you really are competing against three or four other manufacturers because of the significant barriers to entry. so you don't see that competitive aspect where you play on price. and lastly, you really are seeing value from clinicians and physicians and patients as they are interested in quality, which comes at a cost. so overall, we see this as a steady business from a margin standpoint, and we see consistency in market to market.
and while there was a little bit of mix change that affect the overall margins, there's nothing there structurally that gives us pause.

thank you. good afternoon.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
good afternoon, michael.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
just wanted to come back to the atm. you mentioned you've got the remaining amount to go there. and if i caught it right, i think you also said you would anticipate renewing that. can you just give us a sense, given where your balance sheet is already, what the thinking is? and i guess, some amount of how much is enough, is there a point at which you would feel like you've exhausted what you need out of atm? or is that something that you feel like has got a longer runway? how are you thinking about that?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
yes. i think it's a great question because it's so much a point of interest right now, which is runway, use of cash, what's the right amount of cash. i think, first and foremost, people should look at a company's actions, maybe more so than even what they say. we've been very, very conservative in our balance sheet.
right from the beginning, when i got -- became ceo, the company worked extremely hard to have a strong balance sheet, and we saw a lot of this disruption and clearly understand what using the atm means and what that means to others when you look at it. but first and foremost, we believe that it was important for external stakeholders to see the company to have enough cash to be able to run the business. and obviously, that goes into how much cash you're burning. so we worked extremely hard, and we've seen a progression from at one point, the company at over $100 million a quarter in sg&a now to below 30%.
i'm sort of beating the drum about our cost savings. but overall, it is my belief that the company has to have a certain amount of cash, maybe more so the normal to give people the comfort that we will be here for this inevitable upside for global cannabis. i think there's no question that at some point, you're going to see a significant amount of profitability opportunities around the globe, we believe in medical first. and the question is, who's going to be there? and we think we're going to be there.
so, the use of the atm is used strategically. i think people have seen us been good stewards of the cash. we have sold assets quickly and at good prices. we've taken converts down in many cases below par.
and michael, i think we'll continue to do three things. first is, always focus on having a strong balance sheet, so that we will have the wherewithal to be there when these opportunities hit, as well as be there when potential m&a and other things happen, such as bevo, which we thought was a great play. secondly, we will be very judicious in our use of cash. and hopefully, people have seen that here.
and third, where possible, we will use it to find margin accretive and profit opportunities. and we were really thrilled this quarter, if you look at our sort of cash use and where it went, in each of our four key businesses, we saw growth. and so, i think you put that all together and you can sort of see that the future will look very similar to how we've used cash in the past.
operator
and the next question comes from the line of andrew carter with stifel. please proceed with your question.
andrew carter -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hey, thanks. good afternoon. so, i guess what i want to know is, do you think you can achieve like strip out candidate adult use, do you think you can be positive ebitda in that business considering kind of the difficult market? and just kind of a separate question, kind of how you, miguel, and the board are looking at the business. i think i've got right now, yes, $274 million of enterprise value.
do you think that captures what the sum of the parts potentially is on the medical business -- canada medical annuity, bevo, which you can do there, and then also just the genetics investment difficult to value in the markets. and is that a consideration and something you keep in mind that potentially is a floor to consider here?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
and i think let me start with your last question first, i think absolutely not. we are strong believers in global cannabis as a macro movement and strong believers that medical cannabis in a regulated reimbursed compliant manner is going to be the first mover of all of that. and we are one of the leaders, if not the leaders, in that globally. so clearly, the valuation and where we see ourselves, we don't think is representative of that opportunity, but we don't have complete control over that.
the medical business that was built in canada and now is finding its way all across the globe in key markets is wonderfully portable, wonderfully defensible and has extremely high margins, as i've talked about. and as we see new markets coming on like australia and switzerland and austria, those are tremendous opportunities that only a small subset of companies will take advantage of and how people value that. so be it the genetics piece and the science piece has been sort of sitting there on the side all along and with having what may be one of the largest cannabis genetic libraries and what may be sort of possessing some of the most important ip around biosynthetics and others, there's going to be value in that, particularly as you get into clinical research and more value. and we'll have to see, but i clearly think our value overall.
now, the rec piece, can you make money in rec as a stand-alone is sort of a tough question, because we see so many efficiencies and learnings and having both. and it would be an easy sort of answer to say, well, why don't you just get out of rec and focus on medical, which is really a strength for us. but you're starting to see that when you're in a market and you have both, there are significant advantages, and we see that with product lines, we see that with innovation, we see that with production. and i think really importantly, you will see that in germany, and we're very bullish on not only the opportunities in the progression of medical, but also in rec, and having that key line of facility and others and being able to be there at the beginning of medical and then transition in rec will offer significant advantages.
and so, again, it's easy to sort of take the pieces of the business and compare medical and rec, but for us, and particularly the manufacturer working with science and genetics, we see significant efficiencies and advantages in being in bulk, even if we're not going to be a market leader in every market, say, in rec where we would be in medical.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of pablo zuanic with cantor fitzgerald. please proceed with your question.
matthew baker -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
this is matthew baker on for pablo. thank you for taking our questions. i have a two-part question. firstly, what explains the stickiness of your market share in the canadian medical market.
and then, on the other hand, why is your medical market share in germany so much less sticky? and then, as a follow-up, what are your latest thoughts of when german rec sales will begin and do you still think imports will not be allowed?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
canada is a hard market. they're all sort of hard, but the reason it's so sticky is, we've made really significant investments in this. we've been in a long time, and we think we're pretty good at it. we have roughly a 25% share.
the next closest competitor is at about a 9% share. so this is a piece of business where you have to make a lot of investments, experience matters, particularly with clinicians and physicians, and we're clinics. and you have to continue to invest, call centers, innovation, support mechanisms, science, engagement with key stakeholders and veterans and others. and so, it's just a commitment we've made, and i think you have to hit on all cylinders.
and i think without being sort of arrogant about it, i think we're pretty good at it, been that in a long time in canada. in other markets, some other folks got there first. and it's not always a first-mover status matters, but i think it takes more time for the benefits of our program. so we're pleased with where we are in germany.
we don't have a 25 share and there are some other good competitors in there, but again it's four or five companies, so it's not like you're competing against 100 or 200. and so, i think, we're really pleased with that and where we sit in the german market. and as i mentioned in my prepared comments, we're one of only three companies that have a manufacturing license in germany, which will play a significant role, we think, as they rollout legalization for the rec. now, in terms of rec, we're really excited about the german process.
i think three primary reasons. first is, they're actively engaging with the eu. and the expectation is, with what they come up with would be applicable in other markets, poland, czech republic and others. and we've heard from those regulators in those markets, but they're looking to what happens in germany and the eu.
so, it might take a little bit longer, but it will be a much more substantive, a much more broad reaching piece of legislation. we expect to hear some more from the regulator in late spring, and we do expect enhancements to both what we've heard on the rec side, but also on the medical side, which not a lot of people are talking about. and the current administration in germany has a big initiative on reducing bureaucracy, and only about 30% of the patients today in germany are able to navigate through their medical qualification process for cannabis products. and if that was cleared up, you'll see a real big change.
0.1% of the adult population in germany is in that system, and that's in canada 1%, so any sort of change there will have really outside benefit. so, more -- we'll know a lot more late spring. and as soon as we hear something, we'll let people know. and we do expect some version of rec sales to happen mid-2025, which is when there is a critical election and there have been some promises made about when this is going to launch.
what that looks like, we'll see, but these things may take a little bit longer, but with a country like germany, it may take a bit and be a little bit more longtime period. but when it happens, it sticks. and so, we're willing to work with them on that.

and the next question comes from the line of frederico gomes from atb capital. please proceed with your question.
frederico gomes -- atb capital markets -- analyst
hi. thank you. good evening. thanks for taking my question.
my question is just on the adult use side here in canada. you mentioned that much of your sales increase coming from higher sales of value brands. should we read into that that -- was that more opportunistic or is there any shift in strategy there, whereby you plan to rely a little bit more on the value segment to grow volume and maybe accelerate growth on the consumer side?
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
no, there's no change in strategy. but i will say one thing that people should take-away from this quarter is that aurora has the unique ability to be opportunistic. so when there is a medical opportunity globally, we can take advantage of it. when there is a medical opportunity domestically in canada, we can take advantage of it.
and so, most of the change in what happened, and glen referenced this in his comments, is we found ourselves in a very interesting situation, where we grew some flower for daily special, and it came in at a 28 or 29 potency, which is absolutely a super-premium potency band. but because it was already registered with the provinces, do we really have the choice? do we want to sell it and see the benefit? or do we want to hold onto it and relist it? we didn't want to relist it. and so, the reality was that product that was in extreme high potency and great quality went out under the daily special brand and had a little bit of compression in our overall margin. so, the thrive team is doing an awesome job, and we do see incremental opportunities to continue to do what we said we're going to do, but where we see things hit in that rec market on the discount play because we're focusing on operating cash flow, we'll take those advantages as we can.
so no change in strategy. it was opportunistic because of the unique situation. and listen, you're thrilled to have that and it's a testament to great genetics and good cultivation that we found ourselves in that situation, and we're thrilled to build out those sales.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of john zamparo with cibc. please proceed with your question.
john zamparo -- cibc world markets -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon. i wanted to ask about the canada health acquisition. i know this isn't hugely material, but $20 million in cash is not meaningless in the space either.
so i just would like an update on what this asset brings to the table and what the financial implications of it have been so far.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
sure, i'll be happy to. i've been talking for a bit. glen, do you want to talk about canada health in that deal?
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
yes. the folks at canada health are very closely attached to some of the key vet influencers in that population. they've been extremely good at building relationships and supporting veteran patients in the medical system, finding the right medicines for them, and just actually kind of almost operating a little bit of a counseling service. we thought that they are a very important part of our supply chain.
and we thought since that business was so incredibly important to our profitability, we needed to make sure that we had that relationship locked up for the long term. so, i think, the acquisition there is really about solidifying the long-term value for our medical business, in particular the funnel of veteran patients and our ability to get very close to those patients, which obviously is critically important to understand their needs. and it has started paying off. we actually launched a new product in our medical portfolio in the last month, a product called valor, which was the cultivars selected by veterans from our coast facility for a terpene profile and various attributes.
they picked the name and it launched and again, just be that close to really critical patient population has been important for us, and that canada health is a big part of that equation.

[operator instructions] and the next question comes from the line of matt bottomley with canaccord genuity. please proceed with your question.
matt bottomley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
thank you. good evening, everyone. just wanted to touch on the adjusted gross margin again. i know, glen, you had some prepared remarks about this.
but when you kind of look at the overall trend over the last three, four, even five quarters, it seems like the ratio of these types of adjustments are still fairly meaningful in relation to the size of your overall revenue. so, i understand the general buckets and categories and you have it in your press release here in terms of what those general categories are. but i'm wondering if you could speak to the changes of maybe what's going-in and out of there. i know historically, it was more inventory impairment.
now, there's more development costs, given that you're in a variety of different growing medical markets internationally. i would expect these types of costs and these types of opportunities and challenges to continue sort of indefinitely. so i'm just wondering how you're anticipating this adjusted line moving just given that your actual audited or reviewed statements have pretty nominal margins from unadjusted standpoint.
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
yes. so, a couple of things going on in the market. there's certainly the mix across the categories. market by market, the margins are holding up quite nicely.
so, we still see a strong medical margin as we've seen over the past several years, a number of quarters in the canadian medical. consumer, the margin this quarter was generally mix-related as miguel just described and opportunistic and certainly incremental, combine the extra gross profit. and then, the other key thing you were referring to, there are a couple of things in there that are hitting margins. what we adjust out of our margins are fair value adjustments of course because the non-ifrs thing, but it's confusing, and depreciation.
we're trying to get to a cash margin that will allow you to understand the underlying ability of the business to generate cash. this quarter, there was an adjustment for a onetime effective level. i don't know if you're following natural gas prices, but they spike tenfold in december due to some weather in california and they came right back down in january. so, it was just the first time, never seen that before onetime transitory thing.
that was very reflective about, true. gross margin, so we will look at trying to paint a picture for you. the underlying ability of the company to generate cash flow. we think that we will see less.
adjustments through ebitda as we go forward now that we've finished the business transformation or completed our objective there. there has been through that transformation with facility shutdowns and changes in transferring manufacturing lines as g&a reductions, so a fair amount of noise in our financials. but i think we're past that now in q3, you should see the level of those sorts of adjustments coming down.
operator
thank you. at this time, we have reached the end-of-the question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the floor back over to miguel for any closing comments.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
well, first and foremost, let me thank everybody for your interest and time. we're thrilled with where we are. i would say this is absolutely not the finish line. if you take anything away from this call is that our strategic plan is working and we're thrilled with what we did here.
but we're also thrilled with where we're going forward. i appreciate everybody for your interest and look forward to talking to you in the future. all the best. bye.

greetings, and welcome to the aurora cannabis inc. second quarter 2023 results conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. it is now my pleasure to introduce to you ananth krishnan, vice president, corporate development and investor relations.
thank you, ananth. you may begin.
ananth krishnan -- vice president, corporate development and investor relations
thank you, john, and good afternoon, everyone. we appreciate you joining us today. with me are ceo, miguel martin; and cfo, glen ibbott. after the market closed, aurora issued a news release announcing our fiscal 2023 second quarter financial results.
this news release, accompanying financial statements and md&a, are available on our ir website and can also be accessed via sedar and edgar. in addition, you will find the supplemental information deck on our ir website. listeners are reminded that certain matters discussed on today's conference call could constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our future financial or business performance. actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.
the risk factors that may affect actual results are detailed in our annual information form and other periodic filings and registration statements. these documents may similarly be accessed via sedar and edgar. following prepared remarks by miguel and glen, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with our analysts. we ask you to limit yourself to one question and then get back in the queue for follow-up.
with that, i will turn the call over to miguel. miguel, please go ahead. 
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
thank you, ananth. first and foremost, we are very proud to have achieved what we set out to do several quarters ago, namely, reaching our objective of positive adjusted ebitda by the end of the 2022 calendar year. we are confident that we can deliver positive adjusted ebitda on an annualized basis going forward, although there may be some quarter to quarter variability due to the dynamic nature of the cannabis industry, and the seasonality we previously talked about at our bevo business. importantly, as part of our business transformation, we also completed the structural changes we had intended to make as part of our cost rationalization.
these will certainly yield benefits for aurora in both the near and long term. annualized savings now total approximately $340 million since february 2020 and included substantial progress in cutting quarterly sg&a to well below $30 million. our next financial milestone will be achieving positive operating cash flow as part of our plan to build long-term shareholder value. we expect this to be a multi-quarter initiative, and we will update the market on our progress to this new milestone.
looking forward, our enthusiasm for the future is anchored by our no. 1 position in global medical cannabis among canadian lps, and the growth we've been able to sustain despite some quarter to quarter variability. with loyal patients in existing markets and more developing countries poised to open, we think the top line growth trend should continue. as a reminder, medical cannabis is a business we want to invest behind, not only because of its growth characteristics, but because of its defensive nature and volatile times.
it also enjoys enviable adjusted gross margins that consistently exceed 60%, twice that of consumer cannabis. aurora is also ideally positioned because of our robust balance sheet and net cash position, which puts us in select company among our industry peers. this has allowed us to repurchase approximately $302 million in convertible debt in the last 12 months, resulting in about $17 million in cash interest savings on an annual basis. finally, our investments in science, breeding and genetics have resulted in proprietary cultivars and driven meaningful improvements to yields and potency that have benefited all of our product lines.
we also remain committed to furthering medical cannabis clinical research in canada, which should position us for innovation, which will be a key factor to success going forward. so those key strengths as a backdrop, let's take a deeper dive into our global medical cannabis business. as we had expected, international medical revenue rose sequentially compared to q1, which can be attributed to our strength in the australian market, as well as continued success in europe. our european business continues to demonstrate stability and growth on a year-over-year basis.
anchored by the german medical market, we'll remain no. 2 in flower. based on recent comments from the health minister, we expect further clarity around recreational legalization in germany sometime this spring with a potential start to the market there as early as 2025. we continue to believe aurora's position as one of only three companies with a medical domestic production license will give us a significant advantage as the regulatory framework is developed.
we are also bullish on the opportunities that lie ahead in our other key european markets, which include poland, u.k., czech republic and france. while markets such as australia and israel continue to develop, our presence across nearly a dozen countries outside of canada affords us relative installations to individual economic and regulatory climates. turning to the high-margin canadian medical market, most of the sequential growth in revenue was driven by a onetime benefit from q1. however, even after normalizing for this adjustment, we still experienced a 2% growth in revenues.
we are extremely happy with this when coupled with recent cost reductions, which drove meaningful improvements in profitability. over the past several months, aurora patients have been given access to the largest ever selection of products and formats on aurora medical with over 75 skus launched in the medical channel between q1 and q2. these include products from our full portfolio of adult-use cannabis brands such as being quickstrips, greybeard premium flower and new pre-rolls concentrates and minor cannabinoid oils. notably, our canadian medical business benefits from strong patient retention with insured patients comprising about 80% of all medical sales as part of a concentrated market with significant barriers to entry.
our industry-leading market share also remains at about 25%, roughly double that of our closest competitor. to sum up, we remain very optimistic for this segment as we are not only increasing the number of patients in the insured category, but have also experienced year-over-year increases in basket size and participation rates. note that only about 1% of the canadian adult population is involved with medical cannabis. so any sort of movement makes a massive difference with the benefits outsized to a very small subset of companies like aurora that participate in this segment.
switching to canadian adult rec. our q2 revenue show sequential growth of 7%. this increase was achieved despite some temporary industry disruption and a reduced number of shipping days over the holidays. the key driver for us here was strong sales execution, coupled with a strong pipeline of innovative new product offerings.
as you may recall, one of the key reasons for our acquisition of thrive last year was their ability to manage our canadian rec business, and we are thrilled to see our m&a strategy paying off. finally, we plan to drive significant shareholder value over the long run through our controlling interest in bevo, which is one of the largest suppliers of propagated vegetables and ornamental plants in north america. we are currently repurposing the aurora sky facility for orchid and vegetable propagation with minimal capital investment. this will not only increase bevo's production capability and extended shipping range in canada and the u.s., but also enable us to generate predictable incremental revenue and adjusted ebitda.
and with that, now i'd like to turn the call over to glen for our financial review.
glen ibbott -- chief financial officer
thank you, miguel, and good afternoon, everyone. before reviewing our q2 financial performance, let me take a couple of minutes to discuss our balance sheet and cash flow. i'd like to reinforce what i said a number of times before, and that is, we take great pride in having one of the strongest balance sheets among canadian lps and are one of a very few in the net cash position. of course, we're always on the lookout for further opportunities to improve through smart and defensive capital allocation decisions.
as of yesterday, february 8, we have approximately $310 million of cash, including $65 million of restricted cash, and we believe this is sufficient to fund operations into our cash flow positive. we have only cad149 million of principal remaining on our convertible loans due in 2024. during q2, we repurchased $135 million in principal on our convertible notes at a total cost of $128.7 million cash, including accrued interest. the debt we repurchased during calendar 2022 has resulted in cash interest savings that now total approximately $17 million annually.
we also continue to have access to significant capacity under our base shelf prospectus, including approximately $180 million remaining under our atm program. during q2, we issued 39.5 million shares for net proceeds of $68.8 million. the current shelf will expire in april, and we do expect to refile a new shelf and atm program at that time. and we reiterate that the proceeds from share issuance are expected to be used only for strategic purposes.
our operating cash flow in q2 consisted of a net lease of $60.6 million. but that included $15.5 million for a number of onetime payments related to our business transformation, $12.4 million for once a year payments such as insurance and health canada fees and approximately a $12 million investment in working capital. so we are pleased with the positive impact our business transformations having for our future cash flows. with the restructuring of our business now largely executed, we do not expect onetime payments to recur at these levels.
and we do expect that the combination of reduced costs and increased revenue from the same footprint will be significant levers for the company to reach positive operating cash flow. and at the same time, it is worth noting that there may be some quarter to quarter variability in operating cash flow. as we saw in q2, when the company achieved significant increases to sales, the long cash conversion cycle of this industry means that investment in working capital may be required, which may negatively impact operating cash flow for that period. quarterly capital expenditures were approximately $3.5 million, down 36% from the $5.5 million last quarter and more than offset by $14.7 million of cash from the sale of our polaris facility.
looking now to q2 business performance. q2 total net revenue grew 25% to $61.7 million compared to $49.3 million last quarter. we saw strength across all business segments, while also benefiting from a full quarter contribution from bevo. we achieved our goal of positive adjusted ebitda generating $1.4 million.
this was primarily due to growing revenue in our industry-leading canadian and international medical cannabis operations and from reductions in costs across our business, primarily in sg&a. we've now stabilized the company at a much leaner operating structure and see a real opportunity to drive more revenue from these assets in the future. let me now address each of our businesses in a bit more detail. canadian medical revenue was $25.8 million in q2, up 10% from q1.
much of the sequential growth in revenue was driven by a onetime revenue recognition benefit as more shipments than usual or in transit at the end of q1. however, normalizing for this adjustment, canadian medical still delivered a 2% increase. the performance that was important, given that most of our final cost reductions were in this segment during q2 2023. so looking forward to fiscal q3, we expect the canadian medical business to perform similarly to q2, excluding that onetime revenue benefit of $800,000.
international medical revenue was $13.8 million and reflected a 69% increase versus q1. the segment rebounded from q1, as expected, through shipments to export markets such as australia, poland, u.k. and cayman islands and returned to levels more consistent with q4, 2022. we expect our international business to deliver revenues in fiscal q3 that are consistent with that of q2.
taken together, our medical businesses in canada and internationally generated $39.5 million of revenue, up 25% from q1. medical cannabis represented about 64% of our q2 revenue, maybe 7% of gross profit. adjusted gross margin was 61%, down from 67% in the prior quarter. the decrease was primarily driven by higher sales into certain international export markets, which yield a slightly lower adjusted gross margin, but still contribute strong positive gross profit.
consumer cannabis net revenue was $14.6 million, a 7% increase compared to last quarter. the q2 increase was driven by growth in both aurora's premium san rafael brand and by our value brand, daily special, which offers consumers a strong potency, quality and price proposition. looking forward into fiscal q3, we expect the canadian consumer market to continue to be fluid with aurora's top line revenue being flat sequentially. adjusted gross margin before fair value adjustments on consumer cannabis net revenue was 20% in q2 compared to 25% in the prior quarter.
the decrease was primarily driven by the incremental sales of value branded products i just mentioned. going forward, we, of course, remain committed to maximizing profitability through low-cost production and margin-accretive categories, and all supported by our science leadership. our controlling stake in bevo enabled us to recognize $6.6 million in net revenue during q2, up from $3.3 million in q1. this increase is a result of a full quarter of contributions compared to only a partial quarter in q1.
bevo is categorized as plant propagation in our financial disclosures. as a reminder, bevo has the seasonal cadence with two thirds of bevo's annual revenue and ebitda being realized during the period from january to june. on an annualized basis, that was a business that's steady, predictable and supports our ability to generate positive adjusted ebitda. bevo's adjusted gross margin before fair value adjustments was 15% in q2 compared to 16% in q1.
the adjustment primarily related to onetime was an impact on fuel costs, which management expects to be very transitory in nature. due to seasonality, we would expect improved margins in the key spring and summer sales windows. overall, aurora's adjusted gross margin before fair value adjustments was 45% in q2 versus 50% in q1, still among the industry's best. excluding the restructuring and nonrecurring costs of $14 million in q2, sg&a and r&d were well controlled, down 17% sequentially to $26.6 million.
notably, we have made good on our commitment to reducing sg&a to below $30 million as part of our business transformation plan, a rate that we can sustain going forward. so, pulling all of this together, we generated positive adjusted ebitda of $1.4 million compared to a loss of $7.4 million in the previous quarter. and finally, just a reminder that our fiscal year 2023 has only three quarters as we have changed our fiscal year end to march 31, and that's in order to achieve certain internal costs and staffing efficiencies. so thanks for your interest.
i'll now turn the call back to miguel.
miguel martin -- chief executive officer
thanks, glen. at aurora, our purpose is opening the world to cannabis as a global leader in this very exciting industry. in that spirit, let me share some final thoughts. first, we are very pleased to have completed our transformation plan delivering on approximately $340 million in annualized savings since february of 2020.
our entire team's hard work resulted in positive adjusted ebitda while maintaining a strong balance sheet that will allow us to compete at a very high level and take advantage of future global opportunities. second, we've done this without sacrificing growth opportunities in our high-margin domestic and international medical cannabis businesses, which remain one of the best places in the industry to invest. third, we completed our plan during a period of volatility and uncertainty around the canadian rec market. the good news is, it continues to rationalize, which will give us added opportunity for market share improvement.
finally, our future success will be enabled by science through continued plant genetics, improving yields and better crop quality. we believe this will drive high-margin new cultivar licensing opportunities in the future and place aurora at the center of industrywide innovation. looking forward, we continue to focus on profitable growth opportunities across all segments, ongoing discipline in capital deployment and improving operating cash flow. taken together, our ability to make progress in these areas will position our shareholders for significant value creation, especially from these levels.
thank you for your time and interest in aurora. operator, please open the line for questions.
