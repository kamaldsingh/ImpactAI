[operator instructions] the first question is from mike harrison of seaport global securities. please go ahead.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
hi, good morning.
randall s. dearth -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, mike.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
good morning, mike.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
and congratulations to craig on the permanent role of cfo.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
thank you, mike.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
i wanted to ask if you can talk about -- it sounds like you're pretty confident in the direction of things and the trends that you're seeing in north america. i was wondering if you can maybe give a little bit more color on what you're seeing in other regions, maybe in specific areas where you feel like they are making better progress toward normal construction activity or some areas where you have more concern or more uncertainty on the pace of that progress toward normal?
randall s. dearth -- president and chief executive officer
no, it's a good question, mike and just like we see here in north america and we hear about every day on the news, some states are reopening faster than others and are getting back to some type of normalcy. well, the same could be said around certain countries in europe as well as certain countries in the asia-pacific region. some have just been much slower due to restrictions and also due to some hotspots that have resurfaced and getting back to normal activity. so we're going to follow that through the next quarter to see what happens. we do believe that construction activity in those two regions, europe and the apac region, will indeed start coming back in the third quarter. we just don't know the pace by which that's going to happen again due mostly to these restrictions.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
all right and then in terms of the restructuring, you mentioned some additional cost areas that you have learned to operate on a lower cost base. i guess i'm just trying to apply your guidance of 5% impact of covid on the top line, trying to think about how that looks on the bottom line as you may be hang on to some of these additional cost actions that you've delivered and continue to see improvement in the raw material environment.
randall s. dearth -- president and chief executive officer
no, it's another good question, mike. we've obviously gone through an experiment here over the past four months or so on a global basis to see how can we run our company differently given the fact that we have to work differently in this pandemic. and there's a lot of lessons that have come out of that in terms of work at home strategies, how we service our customers differently, how we do virtual go-lives and virtual test trials with our customers. so a lot of those learnings we're going to take going forward as most companies are and we do believe that's going to lead to lower cost of how we run our operations.
we've also learned a lot at our plants in terms of inventory management, again, driven by this crisis in terms of different techniques and different processes that we've built in to be able to better manage our inventory and better manage how we service the customers globally. so a lot of lessons that we've learned and the goal would be going forward that these lessons are going to find their way to the bottom line. anything you want to add craig?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yeah, mike, it's a good question. we've done a lot of just -- our priority is our employee safety of course during this whole process and we're doing a lot of virtual training with our customers. we're doing mix design training with our customers virtually. we're starting to learn that sometimes and our customers' behavior is starting to come around a little bit that that's acceptable. we also implemented a gc plus program of ordering online that randy and the customer service group and the it group implemented about six months ago. we are seeing traction on that now, just orders coming through online versus a sales rep or someone having to take these orders, which obviously is costly when it has to be handed off to eight different people to take orders more back in the 1960s industrial kind of process.
so we're seeing a lot of progress on kind of the new wave of how you do business and we're getting advantage of that in the cost base and we're not going to go back and invest the money back in there now that we see the advantage. so we expect savings to continue in q3 and q4 relative to those and we're having good discussions with the whole team about how we continue that into 2021 even if things come back to normal and covid-19 kind of relaxes a little bit. so that's really quite a bit of money there if we can keep the momentum going. i can't say exactly how much it will be in 2021, but we'll probably have a better idea as we go through q3.
randall s. dearth -- president and chief executive officer
an additional point to make mike that i would like to add, we are in the enviable position that we're going to be looking for new headquarters going forward, as we mentioned, and having this learning of this new environment that we've been working in should play into our decision. so it's definitely -- the world has changed and we need to take that into consideration looking forward.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
all right. and then in terms of, you mentioned some larger projects that looked like they were getting pushed into 2021. are you pretty confident at this point that these are delays and not cancellations, maybe just talk about kind of what you're seeing in terms of the backlog on some of those larger projects?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yeah, so another good question. i mean, i wish i could answer you 100% that they are delays, not cancellations, but for right now, they are delayed. there are certainly some projects that would have got started already in q2, they're not started. there is some probably concern on funding and social distancing. as you know, these big projects when they start them, the timeline is very important to them. so i just think for now as long as the economy stays about where it's at and there is not incremental hotspots that people need to be concerned about, i think they are pushed out, i don't think they are canceled. there is funding for the projects. there is still a lot of money around. that's not the issue.
people just are a little bit more apprehensive to start a project, especially a big one right now with the social distancing, specific hotspots even on the supply chain side. we've actually given our customers a little more confidence in our supply chain. our inventories are slightly higher than we want them to be, but we've actually had some backup inventory just in case one of our plants goes down and i think once other companies start to do this, folks will have more comfort to spend the money on these big projects so they can get full supply chain support from their customers.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
all right. and then last question for me is just maybe on the decision to authorize the $100 million of share repurchase. can you talk about your capital allocation priorities going forward and maybe any guidance on the timing of this repurchase activity? thanks.
randall s. dearth -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, no, mike, we obviously have always had a pretty comprehensive view of capital allocation and returning our monies to shareholders. now with the new board in place and we're excited again to have their input and their guidance and specifically the strategy, operating, and risk committee will be working with management and going through the various options we have, what makes the best sense for the shareholders and is going to create the most value for shareholders. obviously, this was the first decision that was made regarding capital allocation, the $100 million authorization for the buyback, but the overall board once in the strategy and operating committee, once they get up and functioning fully, this will be a discussion point going forward. mike?
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
yeah. i'm all set. thanks very much.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
i'll just add, mike, maybe to one of your other questions. i mean these big projects are in the infrastructure category. they're not in commercial or retail projects that type of thing. so we're more confident they are pushed out than canceled. just the category they are in is more comforting for us.
operator
the next question is from rosemarie morbelli of g.research. please go ahead.
rosemarie morbelli -- g.research -- analyst
thank you. good morning everyone.
randall s. dearth -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, rosemarie.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
good morning, rosemarie.
rosemarie morbelli -- g.research -- analyst
you talked about the board input on your strategy going forward. so between the new board and what you have learned during the covid, well, we are still in it, but during covid, could you touch on what changes you are thinking about for your strategy going forward. is there anything very different from what you were planning in doing ahead of those two events?
randall s. dearth -- president and chief executive officer
what i would say rosemarie, we've been working very closely with the new board. we've had several meetings over the last couple of months and we're still in the phase of sharing our current strategies and getting their input on areas that we could focus on differently and areas that -- ideas that they have that we can investigate. so it's still in that phase of getting to know each other and putting forth the best strategy for gcp going forward. i'm really excited with what i've heard. again mentioning this strategy, operating and risk committee, a lot of experience and a lot of ideas and we're going to continue to work with them closely in the coming months and way to come on that, but we're excited to have this different perspective on how the company could be doing things differently.
rosemarie morbelli -- g.research -- analyst
and in terms of what you learned during covid. so you have learned that you can operate at a lower cost. are there certain amount of discretionary costs, can you quantify how much of those you think you will generate in 2020 and while you may not have a hard number for 2021, how much is coming back with volume?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yes. so rosemarie in q2, maybe this will give you some guidance and i know some others might want it. in q2 of about the $6 million -- i guess about $6 million of operating savings we had, mostly sg&a, it's about a third, a third, a third. it's about third restructuring, about third actual implemented cost savings, and about a third due to kind of lower activity due to covid-19. so our challenge to ourselves is can we keep that third savings due to the covid-19 lower activity. so that's a couple of million dollars a quarter. so we're challenging ourselves to determine how we continue to get our volumes -- our prior year volumes and still still execute on that. so that's about all the guidance i can give right now, but we're still working through that and to determine whether we can keep that through the year or not.
randall s. dearth -- president and chief executive officer
and in terms of restructuring, rosemarie, we're focused on continuing the initiatives that we set forth, supply chain initiatives and obviously, looking at asset management better, but with the input with the new board, we're excited that there'll be some new ideas to come into that. so restructuring is not going to stop. restructuring will continue and that will be an input into our savings going forward.
rosemarie morbelli -- g.research -- analyst
all right. thanks. and i was wondering if you could give us a feel as to how verifi operated during this downturn. i assume that if a cement truck does not go out, then there is no use of verifi, but you are also doing some virtual trials. can you give us a feel for the momentum in that particular area?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yeah, we were actually pleasantly surprised on the revenues with verifi during the quarter, they were up 50% year-over-year in q2. that's mainly due to the fact we had more equipment out there in q2 this year than we did last year because of the installs in the latter half of 2019. the interesting part about that business is that they tend to use the trucks on any job that had verifi. so our trucks go out first with the verifi units on them because they need to keep their operations kind of solidified because that's the new operating model they are on. so we didn't really see a lot of decline of usage of the verifi units during the quarter and certainly not as much as maybe we saw the market.
and in north america, the market was pretty strong and that's where we've got most of our units. so that's why we had the 50% pop in revenue. we have seen slightly slowdown on installs of new customers only because it's difficult for them in social distancing and managing the behavior of their organization at this time during covid-19. they do have to change the behavior of their organization to get the value. so we've seen a little bit of slowdown, but we did see in australia, new zealand and asia some new contracts signed during q2 and even into q3 here. so we're pretty pleased at the progress, but certainly it will be slightly slower on the installs in the second half here, but randy, do you have any other comments.
randall s. dearth -- president and chief executive officer
no, i just wanted to say that as well. i mean it's unfortunate with our customers that we had hoped to have installs, but they are just distracted with the virus and it's difficult to install units when you need their help and you have the social distancing restriction. so that's kind of slowed down to craig's point.
rosemarie morbelli -- g.research -- analyst
sure. that makes sense. i was wondering, lastly, if you could give us the level of importance for your business between residential construction, commercial construction, and infrastructure spending. so we can -- and if you can talk about the trends in each of those categories. what are you seeing?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yes. so north america is where we got the best visibility on the market data, but obviously globally, there is ihs and others that come out with the data. we tend to be, if you want to think about it, about a third, a third, a third. i mean about a third of our revenues tied to infrastructure, a third to commercial, and about a third to residential and people could be surprised on the residential piece, but the north america concrete and cement basically goes into residential also and that's a big part of our business.
we're pretty confident that infrastructure, governments may up the spend on infrastructure going forward just to pump the economy. so we're pretty confident that that's going to happen globally and they're going to -- there might be some delays here just on getting things going, but we think we're good there.
on the residential, the market seems strong. i think you've seen the statistics too both in north america and around the world, china, asia, residential still keeps going strong. so i think we're in good shape there. the commercial could be slightly slower. just you've seen the retail news, there is obviously some reconsideration on office space on what you really need for office space moving forward.
so i would say commercial is probably the place where we might see a little bit more slower uptake, but i think the infrastructure and the residential will offset that and in fact, we get very good margin on the infrastructure. so we'll probably get a margin mix that will offset any decline on the commercial side if there is one moving forward.
rosemarie morbelli -- g.research -- analyst
all right, thank you very much.

randall s. dearth -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, betsy and good morning everyone. so before i begin today's discussion on gcp's second quarter, i do want to update you on gcp's engagement with its new board members that were elected at the may 28th, 2020 annual meeting. management has been working constructively with the board as to help them provide insight on activities to improve our performance and build a greater understanding of our business. we appreciate the engagement as they continue to work actively alongside our business leaders to drive the business forward. the newly formed strategy, operating and risk committee has been advising management on a variety of topics including strategy, operations, go-to-market, product innovation, and operating expenses. progress on all fronts is being made and i look forward to sharing more in the coming quarters.
i would like to take this opportunity to congratulate craig merrill on being appointed our permanent cfo. i've worked with craig closely since i joined gcp and find him to be a valuable partner for me, my executive leadership team, and the board. so again, congratulations craig. turning to the second quarter, please refer to slides 4, 5, and 6 in our presentation. our organization and operations performed well during the second quarter in the face of the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic. we continue to demonstrate our ability to manage cost, deliver on margin expansion, and positive operating cash flow despite the drop in global construction. i want to thank our employees across the globe for their dedication during these ever-changing times due to the coronavirus.
we implemented changes in our operating environment to ensure our employees remain safe and healthy. our multifaceted response to the government imposed and voluntary factory shutdowns resulted in minimal disruptions to our business. i could not be more proud of our employees as they came together to support one another, our customers, and our vendors. it goes without saying that ensuring the health and safety of our employees will always be our number one priority.
as discussed during our first quarter earnings call, we were seeing significantly lower volumes in april and may impeded by lock downs across the globe due to the coronavirus. in june, as the regions began to reopen, revenue started to trend up for the first time since march in many of our markets. our experience is in line with industry trends and our customers continue to depend on us during the quarter to support their needs. july revenues have continued in line with june and our position in our markets is strong.
let's begin by talking about our scc business. scc revenues, which rebounded in june, were about flat with june 2019 after experiencing a 30% decline in the first two months of the quarter. in north america, our largest region, scc had 6% growth in the month of june versus prior year june. several large north american projects started during the quarter, which will continue into 2021. european volumes rebounded in june exceeding june 2019 volumes by 2% as the region reopened after being locked down in april and may. scc in latin america was impacted by a reduction in demand due to lock downs in most of the countries, which continued through to june. in the asia region, china began to recover during the quarter although southeast asia and australia remained in lock down during june. our verifi business continues to grow, although at a slower pace versus pre-covid-19 due to the downturn in the global construction industry.
now turning to sbm, we saw a slowdown in project activity and distributor demand during april, may with volumes down 37% during this two-month period, particularly in markets experiencing construction restrictions or shelter-in-place orders. sales volumes improved in june with north america, which is our largest region, ending the month 1.5% behind june of 2019. we continue to win and progress on large project activity, including airports, bridges, and office building projects and we secured a number of infrastructure projects in north america, which will support us in the second half.
additionally, some projects that began pre-pandemic continued to progress during the second quarter. gcp's products applied in other outdoor applications such as our fire proofing product line experienced less of a negative impact. the positive momentum during the month of june continued through july and we see a stronger third quarter compared with the second quarter while we are mindful of local hotspots that may impact our customers due to the covid-19 virus.
our strategic goal for sbm is for sustainable organic growth, particularly in our north american building envelope and residential product lines and by increasing our presence in under-served segments and market geographies that are profitable and growing in the long-term. our plan also includes expanding our product portfolio awareness to adjacent market segments and accelerating the launch of new and accessory products for the premium and mid-tier segments. this program is starting to gain traction and is evident in our year-over-year june revenues in north america. i'm also pleased to report the launch of two new products for weather barriers and surface coatings that we believe will gain traction in the coming quarters.
there were several other accomplishments from the second quarter that i would like to highlight. gcp's gross margin improved 130 basis points in the second quarter to 39.1%. scc's gross margin improved for the sixth consecutive quarter. this is a result of our continued focus on our manufacturing and freight productivity initiatives that we started in 2019. we also saw the benefit of raw material deflation throughout the quarter.
second quarter selling, general, and administrative cost decreased by approximately 8% mainly due to lower employee and related costs during the quarter as a result of our restructuring programs and lower discretionary spending. cost containment actions, including reduced travel, were put in place during the quarter in response to the crisis. gcp's cash position remains very strong with $318.2 million of cash on the balance sheet at the end of june. net cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended june of 2020 totaled $17.6 million as we continued to execute on our working capital improvement projects.
i'm happy to report that we completed the sale of gcp's cambridge headquarters on july 31st, 2020. planning is under way to locate a fitting location for our headquarters. the $125 million transaction unlocks value for gcp shareholders and is consistent with the company's commitment to invigorating its focus on profitable growth, value creation, and appropriate capital allocation strategies.
in addition, today we announced the approval by gcp's board of directors of the $100 million stock buyback program. with the authorization in place, management will work with the board to determine the best way to execute on this program. i'd now like to turn the call over to craig who will review the company's financial performance in more detail along with segment results and our comments on the third quarter. craig?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
thank you, randy, and good morning everybody. just a reminder, all revenue and associated growth rates in my comments are on a constant currency basis. before we summarize our second quarter, let me first just say that we are very pleased with our results for the quarter and year-to-date considering the challenging operating environment during the second quarter. our teams remain focused on their objectives and continue to provide a high level of service and commitment to our customers albeit more challenging with the current environment.
first, i will focus on the revenues for the quarter. gcp sales of $200 million were 23.7% lower than prior year due to the impact of government imposed restrictions on construction activities and manufacturing as a result of covid-19. impacts due to covid-19 varied by product line and geography during the quarter, but generally remained within the 25% to 35% unfavorable impact expected as we entered the second quarter. although the demand in april and may was down significantly, our june revenues did rebound for gcp overall and specifically in north america as the economy opened up. north america revenues finished 2% up for june versus prior year and we see continued strength in north america in july.
europe, asia, and latin america also finished june much stronger than the first two months of the quarter. however, the rebound was not as generous as it was in north america due to a slower overall return to normal construction activities. u.k. volume has been steadily improving, but at a little slower rate than continental europe. china volumes have come back since the country reopened and the rest of asia including australia continue to improve, but are still impacted by covid-19 government restrictions. latin america volumes steadily improved during the quarter. however, some countries remain under lock down. where lock downs are not present, we are seeing good construction activity and volumes globally.
with respect to price, gcp was close to flat year-over-year at a 0.1% price decline. scc captured price, most notably in latin america, where in-country inflation due to currency devaluations occurred and we increased price appropriately. sbm's north america and asia regions experienced some price pressure, which was expected in the current deflationary period when oil prices are at historical lows. the teams acted quickly though to continue to secure appropriate volumes and margins during the quarter on current and future project bids.
gcp's gross margin increased 130 basis points to 39.1% primarily due to lower raw material, labor and freight costs driven by operational productivity, which were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of reduced operating leverage during the period to lower sales and production volumes. selling, general, and administration costs of $65.7 million improved by $5.7 million or approximately 8% during the quarter benefiting from lower employee and related costs due to restructuring, management of other discretionary costs including advertising and favorable impact of the covid-19 restrictions on travel, entertainment, and other operational activities. some second quarter restructuring activities did move to the second half of the year due to the limited access to offices and travel restrictions, which made it difficult to execute in some countries due to covid-19. we will continue to execute on our restructuring plans and are currently assessing our sg&a position relative to overall sales volumes in the environment. managing these costs is a high priority as we monitor our performance metrics and expected volumes over the next three to six months.
gcp's loss from continuing operations attributed to gcp shareholders was $1.3 million compared to income from continuing operations attributable to gcp shareholders of $3.1 million for second quarter 2019. the change was primarily due to lower gross profit due to lower sales volumes partially offset by reduced restructuring and repositioning costs, lower selling and general administration costs, and slightly lower tax expense. gcp's adjusted ebit margin ended the quarter at 6.8% versus 9.6% in the prior year quarter primarily due to lower gross profit as a result of volume declines partially offset by lower selling, general and administration costs. adjusted ebitda margin was 12.8% for the second quarter or 100 basis points lower than the same period 2019.
looking at the specific performance of our two segments, you can refer to pages 10 and 11. scc sales were down 20.5% to $119.5 million. north america's revenues declined 10.7% in the quarter as construction in most states was deemed essential and our customer network in north america continued to service their customers, although at a slower pace versus prior year during the quarter. however, reorder rates in june were well ahead of prior year. other regional sales declined in other regions 27% to 30% versus prior year during the quarter with the sales declines all mostly attributable to covid-19. impacts in asia, europe and latin america due to covid-19 have been slightly more prolonged and deeper versus north america.
revenue in june versus the same period for 2019 in north america and europe both increased 5.7% and 1.6% respectively compared with june 2019. price gains also occurred in latin america and europe on a nominal basis with slightly offset volume declines during the quarter. scc's gross margin improved by 350 basis points during the second quarter, sixth consecutive quarter of gross margin improvement as randy mentioned. raw material deflation, operation and logistics productivity and favorable regional mix all contributed to margin expansion. scc segment income was $9.9 million with an operating margin of 8.5%, which decreased 90 basis points compared with the prior year quarter primarily due to lower sales volume unfavorably impacted by operating leverage, partially offset by higher gross margin.
sbm sales totaled $80.5 million during the second quarter, a 28% decline versus the second quarter 2019 due to challenging construction markets as a result of covid-19. sales volumes in april and may were below 2019 volumes due to reduced construction and manufacturing. distributors in april and may did not restock at a normal pace due to the uncertainty of the impacts of covid-19 on future product demand. north america volumes did however rebound in june as construction resumed in many north america locations with distributors reordering and larger projects restarting once customer covid-19 safety procedures were instituted, in line with government and state recommendations.
in june, north america sbm sales were down 1.5% versus prior year june. however, positive year-over-year reorder patterns were evident in july. business in france, germany, italy, and the u.k. for sbm also improved during june once overall restrictions were lifted. sbm's gross margin declined 140 basis points to 39.7% compared to the second quarter of 2019 due to the unfavorable impact of lower sales resulting in reduced operating leverage and increased inventory write-off year-over-year, partially offset by raw material deflation and productivity. sbm's segment operating income was $11 million with operating margins at 13.8%, a 610 basis point decline versus prior year. this was due mainly to lower sales volume unfavorably impacting operating leverage and lower gross profit partially offset by the benefits of reduced discretionary costs and employee related costs during the quarter.
now, turning back specifically to gcp. gcp's effective tax rate was 136.4% for the quarter that included the reversal of the first quarter cares act tax benefit resulting from changes in our forecasted income for the year. the company no longer expects to have a net operating loss carryback for 2020, which it did expect in q1 forecast. gcp's net cash provided by operating activities was $17.6 million for the six months ended june 30th, 2020 versus a usage of cash of $13.1 million for the six months ended june 31st [phonetic] 2019. adjusted free cash flow totaled $18 million for the first six months compared with a usage in total of $12.3 million during the same period in 2019. accounts receivable management improved $20.8 million, vendor payables delivered a $4.1 million improvement, and inventories generated a $1.7 million improvement compared to the prior six months. we continue to improve the transparency of our working capital initiatives throughout the regions and within our respective country operations and we are seeing the results of these efforts, which will continue.
please refer to slides 12 and 13 for a discussion on gcps first half performance. gcp's net sales for the first six months totaled $419.4 million, decreasing 14% compared with the prior year mainly due to the second quarter impact of covid-19 on volumes. gross margin for the six months increased 130 basis points to 38.4%. the net loss attributable to gcp shareholders in the first six months totaled $0.2 million compared with net income attributable to shareholders of $24 million for the first half of june 2019. the change resulted mainly from the reduced sales volume to covid-19 in the second quarter partially offset by reduced operating expenses. adjusted ebit was $27.8 million for the first six months or 25.1% unfavorable for the same period in 2019, again mainly due to the impact of covid-19.
turning to our outlook for 2020, although it continues to be difficult to predict the duration and extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business over the next six months and beyond as events unfold, the near-term view is as follows. as discussed, june's positive volume trends have continued into july and we expect the third quarter to be a significant improvement over the second quarter. planned and funded construction projects have resumed or are coming online with construction sites having implemented additional health and safety protocols along with social distancing. these efforts are important for construction to remain active while hotspots may arise. while we expect the demand to improve and slowly return to close to normal levels as the year progresses, some projects have moved into 2021, which may dampen some demand in the latter half of the year and we are monitoring this closely.
as for the third quarter, of which we have the best view, we expect the impact of covid-19 pandemic to reduce overall demand for our products by approximately 5% versus prior year in constant currency. we also expect raw material deflation to provide a modest offset to the forecasted volume declines. however, we will continue to deliver productivity to support our margins. we remain focused on our operating expenses, which we have continued to improve sequentially during the year and in addition to our restructuring programs, which will continue, we have identified additional cost savings opportunities and have learned a lot during the covid-19 period on how to perform at a lower cost base while we service our customers very well.
we are implementing these learnings as we move through the year. we remain on track to the planned capital expenditure reduction of $25 million in 2020 or a reduction of 35% to 45% from our original planned capital spending and we expect our cash position will grow throughout the year based on the working capital programs we have initiated, the reduced capex target versus original plan and of course, the sale of our cambridge site. the share repurchase program announced will be funded with our existing cash balance.
looking beyond the pandemic, we are confident in the long-term fundamentals of gcp and the construction industry. we are confident that our current plans will allow us to navigate the pandemic and we'll be well positioned as the overall construction demand stabilizes somewhat during the second half of the year, while we focus on our overall cost position as a company. i'll turn it now back over to randy. thank you. thanks, craig. just a few closing remarks. let me just say again that we have welcomed our new board members and their enthusiasm and interest in working with the gcp leadership team has been constructive. the working relationships have been very engaging and we look forward to jointly continuing to create value for our gcp shareholders. despite the challenges the covid-19 virus presented in the second quarter, our teams around the globe continued to focus on our customers and we are happy to see june rebound as it did. we will continue this focus going forward and our strong balance sheet, which features significant liquidity and no near-term debt maturities is a competitive differentiator that provides substantial financial flexibility and positions us well to successfully manage through the ongoing economic challenges and uncertainty caused by the covid-19 pandemic. with the sale of the cambridge facility and the stock buyback program, we are committed to maintaining a flexible liquidity base and along with the board, we will continue to evaluate all alternatives for the effective and efficient use of cash. i would like to wrap up my comments by thanking our employees personally and on behalf of my leadership team for all the hard work and efforts they continue to devote to gcp under extremely challenging conditions. i really appreciate that. thank you today for joining our call and we now look forward to taking your questions.

we will now begin the question-and-answer session [operator instructions] and our first question will come from rosemarie morbelli with g.research. please go ahead.
rosemarie morbelli -- g.research -- analyst
well, thank you and good morning, everyone. well, simon, you anticipated my first question, which had to do with what you are seeing in terms of the strategy for the company after one month at the helm, which i understand is very little. can you give us a little more details in terms of customer-centric focus, which i thought that the company was reasonably customer-focused already? but you come from that particular end of the market. so what did you see that is not really up to snap regarding that particular focus?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
well, rosemarie, let me be clear. i'm not suggesting the business is not customer-centric. but i am certainly very keen to draw information from our customers on how we can best drive growth for the company over time, and hence, the initiation of the global customer survey which we began last week.
rosemarie morbelli -- g.research -- analyst
okay. and while i realize it is early, can you touch on what you see in the m&a environment? there has been industry consolidation going on. are you seeing more midsized businesses, for example, willing to sell given the uncertain environment? and if so, what do you see on the multiple side?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'm not really in a position to speak to that yet, rosemarie. i'm 30 days on the job. what i can speak to is the commitment that i have with the board and the agreement with the board to look at our strategy going forward and how best to drive profitable growth. and one of the options we have in front of us would be disciplined m&a.
rosemarie morbelli -- g.research -- analyst
okay. and lastly, if i may, there was quite a substantial reduction of operating expenses, which resulted, obviously, in a higher margin. what is the size of the cost reductions that will be permanent versus what is temporary given the lack of travel and other situations?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'll turn that one over to craig, rosemari
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
hey rosemarie, how are you?
rosemarie morbelli -- g.research -- analyst
all right, thanks.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yes. so we did a little bridge in the slide deck. i think you'll find that we've got about $4 million to $5 million of reduction combined between restructuring and the discretionary in t&e, which is about split 50-50 on the cost restructuring versus the covid-19 impact. and then, of course, it was offset by some investments and some board costs this quarter. moving forward, i think now that we see that the pandemic is going to continue into q4 and q1, we're going to continue probably at that run rate generally. although we are looking at our total fixed cost position -- as you know, the pandemic showing up in q2 has put us in a -- and everybody has been putting in a different position with respect to expectations on volume moving forward. so we're going to look at that very much on the fixed cost piece. so we're going to come back to you at the end of this year or early next year on exactly what that -- what it will look like in 2021 versus the run rate today.
rosemarie morbelli -- g.research -- analyst
thanks. and actually, i do have one more question. given what seems to be the result of the election, if there is a large infrastructure bill, how long before you see the benefit from it?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yes. generally, we're nine months out on those type of things. so if there's a push on the infrastructure and there's a releasement of funds either to the states or just generally on the fed, will be nine months out. so it would be unlikely we'd see a lot of impact in 2021. but we're excited about it. i mean, there's no question if that happens, we're in a much better position over the next two to three years and that would really be helpful for the economy if they did that. we're better to have people working and creating some value for the economy in that kind of injection of cash into the economy. it would certainly help gcp in the long run.
rosemarie morbelli -- g.research -- analyst

our next question will come from mike harrison with seaport global securities. please go ahead.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
hi, good morning.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, mike.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
good morning, mike.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
simon, you are inheriting a company here that has been through multiple rounds of restructuring and kind of focusing more on the cost side. it struck me that you highlighted in your introductory remarks there that you want to stabilize revenues. can you maybe give some early thoughts on what steps are needed to improve top line growth? it does, in particular, seem like there have been some share losses over time within the building materials segment. anything you can comment on right now, simon?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
mike, i don't feel in a position to comment on it yet. i am 30 days on the job. i am spending my time getting to understand the business a lot better. i do expect to have more insight over the coming months and maybe can speak to that on one of the follow-up calls.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
all right. that's fair enough. can we talk a little bit about mix within the building materials segment? it seems like residential markets are stronger than nonresi. how is that impacting your mix and your margin performance? i know you mentioned that building envelope in particular continues to be weak. so maybe touch on that?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
mike, i'll answer that. the ice and water shield product, as you know, that we sell is a high-end product, high demand during this period of time when people are doing their roofs, when they're at home. that's helped us, no question, on the mix. the margins on the residential ice and water shield versus the b are about equal. so we can trade-off those margins and they're about the same. so we did get a benefit on the mix with the ice and water shield being strong. with respect to scc, as you know, we kind of play in all the segments. we play in the infrastructure, the commercial and the residential on the scc. the margins there are about equal. i mean there's not a lot of difference between the margins on that mix. if we get pulled through the residential and the ready-mix versus commercial or infrastructure, it's about equal on that. so i don't see us getting unfavorable or truly beneficial moving forward on the mix on the margins. most of the margin benefit we got on scc was productivity and deflation, and that was the same, honestly, on the sbm side because of the oil prices and we had deflation on sbm. and that will continue over the next couple of quarters, i believe.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
all right. and then maybe the last question for now is on the asia business. you mentioned that there was -- it looks like volume was down 15%. i think for both segments, you mentioned that there was weakness in some of the key markets that you serve. are those countries continuing to be very conservative around, i guess, lockdown activity? or what are your thoughts on the pace of recovery in some of those, i guess, southeast asian markets?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yes, that's a good question. we play in a little bit more of the sophisticated arenas because of our product categories. so we're in australia, we're in singapore. those countries have taken a little more conservative approach with respect to the social distancing, which is probably the right thing to do. and we have been impacted. so singapore was down quite a bit. we haven't lost any share in singapore, but it was down about 50% year-over-year in customer demand. they have come back a little bit in october. our numbers were better in asia in october. so we see it improving, but we're still pretty cautious about it because we think there's going to be intermittent lockdowns in asia. so we'll see how that plays out in q4 and q1.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
all right. thanks very much.

dan rizzo -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, guys, it's dan rizzo for laurence. how are you?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
fine, thank you.
dan rizzo -- jefferies -- analyst
you mentioned with the customer-centric kind of focus going forward. is that going to change the way you develop new products in terms of coming up with ideas, something more of -- it's more of a pull versus a push? i was just wondering if that's the way you look at kind of that going forward?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
i think as we look at our business and we take a look again at our strategy, i think when it comes to r&d and product launches, we want to make sure we get the best return. and so again, i think it's something we can give an update on in future months as, at least, i seek to understand the business a whole lot better and maybe can speak with some authority and some deeper understanding.
dan rizzo -- jefferies -- analyst
the reason i bring it up is because i was just thinking about sustainability and how that's kind of a focus for, i would imagine, a lot of your customers and just everybody within materials and just, i guess, in the world. i was wondering if you're working with customers to establish or increase sustainability, how it works into your process, and if that's part of what you're trying to change as well?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yes, there would be a good example with our cement additives business. obviously, for the cement producers around the world and their significant contribution to co2, that, that is a major concern for those folks. and we are working closely with those customers to try and help develop products that can help them reduce their co2 emissions.

simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, craig. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on gcp's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. i'm very pleased to be speaking with you on my first conference call as gcp's president and chief executive officer. i hope you and your families are safe and well, and i look forward to meeting many of you over the coming months. before we get into the details of our third quarter performance, however, i wanted to provide a brief introduction and to share with you some of my initial thoughts and observations about gcp gathered over my first 30 days on the job. firstly, i am tremendously excited to be part of gcp. it is a great company with a strong tradition for innovation and with product brands that are recognized around the world. i think that my background and experience are a really good fit with the business. i've lived and worked across australia, europe and north america, and i have good local knowledge of many of the markets which gcp serves. over the last 25 years, i have had great building products experience with hanson plc, heidelbergcement and crh plc. on the construction chemical side, i've had the good fortune to work with both axiall and westlake chemical. during those 25 years, i have held a variety of commercial, operational and business leadership roles on both sides of the atlantic. i have had a lot of success developing strong management teams and delivering significant commercial and operational improvements. i'm confident that we can bring those learnings to gcp. also as a former customer of gcp, i am very familiar with its products and reputation for industry-leading performance and technology.
let me just say that everything i have learned over the past month has only strengthened my belief that gcp has tremendous potential. i'm absolutely convinced that gcp has the right and the opportunity to deliver outstanding value to its investors, its customers and its employees. i would also like to mention the resiliency of gcp's employees around the world during the pandemic. our employees have responded to the current environment with dedication and relentless drive to deliver on commitments to our customers. i just want to say my personal thanks to all of our employees worldwide for a job well done. most importantly, however, i wanted to ground you on what you can expect from me and share some of the critical areas on which my team and myself are already focusing. our goals are to stabilize revenues, improve margins and return the company to profitable growth. this will be a heavy lift, but i am committed to delivering profitable growth and our experienced board is committed to delivering profitable growth, and everyone in our team will be committed to driving improved profitable growth. we will initially address four key priorities. firstly, we will revisit our strategy and more clearly articulate where we will focus our efforts and our plans to drive growth. our strategy should also determine how we allocate our capital. we have a very strong balance sheet and we have a lot of flexibility for investments in the business, disciplined m&a and, of course, share buybacks. secondly, i want to bring the voice of the customer front and center. we can be successful only if we deliver outstanding value to our customers in our products, in our technologies and in our service and making sure these align with their needs.
we will do this initially through a global customer survey, and i've also begun to reach out to our key customers personally. thirdly, we will complete a thorough analysis of our cost structure, including our fixed overhead, operating expenses and sg&a. our aim is to significantly improve our speed to react and to invest only where it will drive appropriate returns. finally, we will be relentlessly data driven. i've learned over the course of my career to trust the data. at gcp, we'll be working hard to improve the quality of the information about our business, and make no doubt, acting on what the data teaches us. improving our data capture and internal metrics will give us a deeper understanding of our business over time. as we work toward our goal, you can always rely on transparency. hopefully, you will quickly learn that, with me, what you see is what you get. i'll be transparent about our successes, but just as important, we'll be transparent with you about our challenges and opportunities. i look forward to speaking to you in more detail about our progress in these areas on future calls.
i'd now like to turn the call over to craig, who will review the company's financial performance along with segment results and our comments on the fourth quarter. craig?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
thank you, simon. good morning, everyone. again, just a reminder, all sales and associated growth rates in my comments are on a constant currency basis. before i summarize our third quarter, i want to thank our employees across the globe, who remain focused on their objectives and continue to provide a high level of commitment to our customers. i will first focus on gcp's results and then move into the business segments. gcp's constant currency sales of $250 million were approximately 6% lower than prior year due to reduced construction and manufacturing activity as a result of covid-19. comparing the third quarter constant currency sales, excluding the exited markets, sales declined approximately 5%. these results are in line with our expectations discussed during the second quarter earnings call. construction activity continues to vary around the globe, although demand improved significantly when compared to the second quarter of 2020. with respect to the sales performance in each region versus prior year, north america finished down 2% for the quarter with improved year-over-year performance in our residential and our fireproofing product lines. europe ended the quarter down 10% as the region returned to a more normalized operating environment versus quarter 2, although we did see challenges were remaining in united kingdom, france and germany with respect to overall construction activity, particularly impacted by the pandemic. latin america sales were flat with third quarter 2019. asia sales were down 17% in the third quarter compared with the same quarter in 2019 as restrictions continued in some of gcp's larger revenue countries, including singapore, while construction activity in australia and china was slower-than-anticipated versus expectations at the beginning of the quarter.
price for the quarter was down approximately 0.5 percentage point compared to the third quarter 2019. we started to see price pressure in our sbm segment as rubber and asphalt prices declined with the oil prices, but we did react accordingly in the market. in scc, price was about flat year-over-year, and in latin america, where country inflation due to currency devaluations occur, we increased price accordingly. gcp's gross margin increased about 140 basis points to 40.8%, primarily due to logistics productivity and raw material deflation, partially offset by lower sales volume. selling, general and administration costs were $65.2 million, improved by a total of $1.1 million or about 1.7%. during the quarter, restructuring pension, the management of discretionary costs and lower selling costs due to covid-19 social distancing practices, impacted sg&a favorably by about 400 -- sorry, $4.8 million, which was partially offset by board defense, investment in verifi and other costs of approximately $3.7 million. gcp's income from continuing operations attributable to gcp shareholders totaled $99.5 million compared to income from continuing operations attributable to gcp shareholders of $17 million in the third quarter of 2019. these results include the $110 million gain on sale of gcp's cambridge headquarters, which resulted in an after-tax gain of approximately $82 million. gcp's adjusted ebit margin ended the quarter up at 14.1% versus 13% in the prior year quarter. volume, price and mix together negatively impacted the quarter by about $8 million in margin, but was partially offset by operations, logistics productivity and deflation totaling $4 million for the quarter. adjusted ebitda margin was 18.9%, up 190 basis points versus prior year period.
looking now at the specific performance of our two segments. you can refer to page 12 and 13. scc's constant currency sales were down approximately 7% to approximately $140 million. north america sales declined 5% in the quarter versus prior year, in line with expectations. impacts in asia, europe and latin america due to covid-19 have been more prolonged and slightly deeper versus north america. collectively, sales in these regions were down 10%, lower than the third quarter of 2019, with asia having the highest impact year-over-year primarily due to covid-19 periodic lockdowns, impacting the countries we play in, in singapore, vietnam, malaysia and thailand. scc's gross margin improved by 240 basis points, 39.8% during the third quarter 2020. this is the seventh consecutive quarter of gross margin improvement in the scc business. operations and logistics productivity and favorable mix was partially offset by reduced operating leverage. the scc segment operating income was $18.6 million, with segment operating margin of 13.4%, which increased 40 basis points compared with the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher gross margins and lower sg&a, partially offset by volume decline. now i'll focus on the sbm segment. sbm sales totaled $109.3 million during the third quarter, a 5% decline versus the third quarter 2019. north america sbm sales grew nicely at 1% during the quarter, attributable to growth in residential, on strong roofing material demand and strong fireproofing product demand. building envelope sales declined about 16% globally due to reduced construction activity and a delay of orders for a number of projects in north america. sbm's gross margin increased 10 basis points to 42.3% compared to the third quarter of 2019 due to raw material deflation and logistics productivity, partly offset by price reductions and sales volume leverage reduction. sbm segment operating income was $25.4 million, with operating margins at 23.1%, a 60 basis point improvement versus prior year. the improvement was mainly due to lower operating expenses, deflation on raw materials and productivity. lower sales volume unfavorably impacted operating leverage, which, in turn, partially offset improved margin performance. now let me turn back to gcp overall. gcp's effective tax rate was 23.5% for the quarter versus 24.3% in the prior year quarter.
the tax expense associated with the gain on sale of the cambridge headquarters totaled $27.7 million. gcp's net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $59.3 million for the nine months ended september 30 versus $46.5 million for the nine months ended september 30, 2019. gcp's adjusted free cash flow totaled $52.4 million for the first nine months in 2020 compared to $23.3 million during the same period in 2019. reduced capital expenditure and improved working capital management of $18 million and $15 million respectively contributed to the improvement in adjusted free cash flow. now turning to the fourth quarter outlook. we expect in the fourth quarter volumes to be down approximately 9% for the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2019. this estimate assumes general construction activity globally to be aligned with third quarter run rate activity going into q4, while taking into account fourth quarter seasonality. but we are expecting a slightly lower demand globally in december versus prior year as customers will remain cautious with respect to inventory levels moving into 2021. this estimate would exclude any further deterioration of construction activity due to the pandemic, changes in economic conditions or weather-related impacts due to an early winter in north america or europe. we also expect raw material deflation to provide a modest offset to the forecasted volume declines, but less of a benefit in quarter four versus quarter 3. we will continue to deliver productivity to support our margins, remain focused on our operating expenses. with respect to operating expenses in the fourth quarter, we expect similar performance in the fourth quarter as we had in the third quarter.
we are on track to the planned capital expenditure of $25 million in 2020 or a reduction of 35% to 40% from our original plan. and we expect our cash position to continue to grow in the fourth quarter, driven by our continued focus on working capital and our strong positive operating cash flow focus. looking beyond 2020, we are confident in our ability to perform well within the current impacts of the global pandemic as we continue to manage our costs and expenses relative to quarterly volume expectations moving forward. we are confident in the long-term fundamentals of gcp and the construction industry moving forward.
with that, i will now turn it back over to simon. thank you.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, greg. firstly, my sincere apologies for the technical difficulties we experienced at the start of this call. that was certainly not what i had hoped for on my very first earnings call. now i did just want to take a moment to reiterate the immediate areas of focus for me and the senior management team that i discussed at the beginning of today's call. they are providing clarity on strategy and capital allocation to drive growth, being more customer-centric, all and deep understanding of our cost structure, improving transparency, which will include our updated strategy and detailed financial planning to the investor community in the first half of 2021.
thank you all for joining our call and we look forward to ongoing communications and to taking your questions.

[operator instructions] our first question will come from mike harrison with seaport global securities. please go ahead.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
hi, good morning.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
hi, michael. how are you doing?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
hi, mike.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
doing well, thank you. i wanted to say i appreciate you guys are sharing some of the findings from your customer and employee surveys. i think that kind of self reflection can be difficult, but i think it's also healthy and it seems like an important step in the right direction. in terms of the outlook, can you provide a little bit of color on maybe how we should think about the earnings progression during 2021? you know there are some seasonal factors to keep in mind. i think we can probably assume that the recovery in construction activity is gradual during the course of the year. and then you also referenced some raw material costs that may be come in toward the end of the year, inflationary costs that come in during the end of the year. and then there is also these discretionary costs that you temporarily cut back on during 2020 that maybe start to flow back in during the year. so, maybe just some initial thoughts on how we should think about the cadence of earnings given all those moving pieces in 2021?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yeah, michael, it's craig. i think you've hit a lot of the points. it's not easy to really determine the second half as well as we like. but let me give you a little flavor on the first half. of course, q1 being down a little bit in volume, probably won't have a little -- a lot of pickup in profit in q1, probably be similar to prior year. and then, of course, q2 will be a little better because of the situation last year on the volumes because that was the most dynamic q4 of the pandemic, so that would have a pickup.
and then the second half is a little bit tougher to call. i think you've got inflation coming through, which will work on price. but it's just a question of how much we can pass through and how quickly the inflation comes through, but we do expect that to happen. so, there might be some margin degradation in the second half that we have to work on with price just year-over-year.
and then on cost, we're going to work to try to hold that savings that we've had from from 2020 through 2021, but there are some offsets to that, like the rent in cambridge, obviously, merit and some other inflation. so your overall operating expense generally will probably be about flat full year, year-over-year with all that being said.
does that give you a little bit flavor for the dynamic?
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
yeah, that's helpful and i definitely understand. as i kind of ticked off all those moving pieces, there is a lot to try to take in there. i guess maybe on the specific to the raw material versus pricing situation, can you talk about your ability to pass pricing along the customers in both the scc and sbm segments? and maybe is inflation more of a concern in one segments or the other?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
well, in this construction industry, as you know, you're always about 60 days to 90 days behind on price versus inflation to pass it through. you've got quoted specific projects that are going on, specifically things like fireproofing and some of the big projects. you can't move price through as fast as you like, but that also helps you in some years. so you'll note in some of the notes we outlined in 2020, we got some nice deflation and we didn't have to give back a lot of price. in fact, we held our price. but i think in 2021, we'll have to give back a little price on that deflation on the early first half of the year and then we will push for price in the second half. but when inflation comes in the second half, usually you're a little bit late on it. so you'll get it in 2022. i don't know if that helps on that answer, but that's -- i'll let simon weigh in too because he is from the industry also.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. hi, mike, simon here. i think it's a mixed bag and it's difficult to provide the kind of specificity you would like. we are definitely seeing some price spikes and it seems to also be driven by the weather and the impact on some of the raw material supplies in february. and quite honestly, we are trying to unpick what is some temporary blips on price versus what we can expect for the rest of the year. and so, there is some analysis that kind of goes on on a daily basis for us trying to see where those prices for the raw materials will settle and therefore how it's appropriate for us to respond in the market. so, it's currently a moving target, but something we look at and attempt to manage every day.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
and in terms of the pace of recovery in commercial projects in particular, i think you made a comment that i think it was specific to north america. you were seeing the commercial construction, they were uncomfortable moving forward with projects. is that related to the economic environment? is that related to covid and safety issues? maybe talk a little bit about the commercial -- the pace of commercial activity and what's leading to that discomfort, i guess.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and you know that it's -- we -- the biggest exposure to commercial new construction in any of our geographies would be north america, mike. we are fortunate in some of the disciplines we have in the organization in using various tools to look at our pipeline. so we've got a good view on our pipeline in north america. the part of our business that is being impacted the most is the building envelope business and obviously when we put the water proofing membrane onto the substructure that happens very close to the start of the project.
so some of the very large projects, which could be office buildings, they could be tourist attractions. we have seen a whole series of projects delayed and in some cases canceled in 2020 and we are monitoring that very closely in 2021. what we are attempting to do is switch our focus a little bit onto some of the different types of projects, be that data center, healthcare where we do see growth to offset that. and currently our fireproofing business, which tends to happen about 12 months later after the installation of the water proofing, that business is still looking quite resilient.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yeah, i'd just add on that, we've had some -- we've seen some nice numbers come through on fireproofing. so, on the projects that were already set up to go, they're continuing to finish. so, i don't want to give you a false alarm that there's not nice projects out there that we're continuing to work through. and the fireproofing and the specialty group did very nicely in q4 for instance. and hopefully, these larger projects are just pushed out a little bit on timing. we haven't seen a lot of cancellations yet. that's kind of the situation.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
all right. and then the last question i have is on north america, that was down sequentially from q3 to q4 and on a year-over-year basis seems to have deteriorated a little bit. is that just the spike in covid cases do you think or -- you referred to some share losses, did those share losses intensify in the fourth quarter?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
no, not specifically, michael. you saw that my share loss comments were kind of in the yearly view. generally, we saw in asia a little bit of share loss to the self manufacturing of some additives, a little bit in china. and on the sbm side, it was north america during the year. but specific to q4, if you remember last time we had a call, we said that we were a little apprehensive about the distribution channel taking on much inventory and we expected kind of that to happen. there is no way that we're going to take on a lot of inventory in november and december and have it sit there during the winter, which they might, in some instances, other years. so that's kind of the situation. we didn't hold any promotions. sometimes we do a little promotional activity in q4 where the distributors do want to hold some inventory and shore themselves up, but that didn't happen this year. so, it kind of landed about where we expected. so, that's more distribution channel management effect than anything else in q4.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
all right. and just really quickly to follow-up there, does that suggest that you guys are may be positioned to see a little bit of distributor restocking as we get into maybe late q1 and in early q2?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yes, if we can -- if this winter would move past us and not be disrupting a lot of the u.s. and europe, then yes, we expect to have later in q1 and moving into q2 that to pick up.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
well, we hit 60 in chicago yesterday or close to it, so spring is coming i promise.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
well, congratulations. it will be [indecipherable] probably tomorrow or the next day.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
there you go. all right. thanks very much.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, mike.

our next question will come from laurence alexander with jefferies. please go ahead.
dan rizzo -- jefferies -- analyst
hi guys. it's dan rizzo on for laurence. how is it going today?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
great, dan. very good. thanks.
dan rizzo -- jefferies -- analyst
would you guys benefit directly from a national infrastructure bill if it comes to pass later in the year or is it -- i mean what's your views on that?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
we will benefit directly. it's just a question of timing, dan. generally, it takes a while for those projects to get developed, engineered in progress. so, the roads and that type of thing we benefit less. we have less value of our product on roads and things. if it's a little more infrastructure in bridges, which take a little longer to design and get up to speed, then we would benefit more. but if it's past anything -- past in the second half of this year, the benefit would probably come mostly in 2022, i would think for us.
dan rizzo -- jefferies -- analyst
okay.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
dan, you couldn't see, but we were smiling -- craig and i were smiling at each other. it's a hotly debated topic internally. broadly, we'd say yes, but our expectation is around more 2022.
dan rizzo -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. and then you mentioned focusing on north america. i mean, improving your position -- no, i assume or -- is that -- that's going be organically grown, i would think, or maybe you are looking at m&a? and if that's the case, i mean is there something specific that you're going to do? is it just executing better or i mean -- how are you introducing new products. so, just wondering -- just some color on how you improve your position in this region?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so, i think as i said in my introductory comments, when it comes to scc north america, i think the folks have done a very good job in the last 12 months or so and i see our market position having stabilized for scc in north america. so, it's how we best support them to get back into growth mode. on the building product side, sbm side, it's a mixed bag. so, our fireproofing business, we've done a good job.
on the residential and building envelope business, we have a rather complicated supply chain, which has meant service to our customers over the last few years has not been as good as it should. and consequently, we feel like we've lost some market share in those specific two businesses. so, we have a whole series of projects that we're working on to improve that service, which we think will help. but we think we can also bolster the business by filling some product gaps that we have in both our building envelope and our residential business. now, there is optionality to do that organically or through m&a. and given our cash position, we are definitely going to explore m&a in those categories.
dan rizzo -- jefferies -- analyst
that brings me to one [indecipherable]. you guys have a very solid balance sheet and improving cash position particularly just given the moves you made in the drop in capex. so, i was wondering if m&a is the first use of cash or if returning the cash to shareholders is being considered as well?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we consider all options and it's a good debate and dialog between the senior management team and the board at the best allocation of capital. i think the good news is we are seeing more options to drive efficiency and productivity in the business through some better capital allocation, some capital expenditure projects. we definitely can continue to keep the share buyback as an option. and as i said, we're definitely going to explore m&a too.
dan rizzo -- jefferies -- analyst
and then final question, just given the changing dynamics in the different end markets, particularly in the building side, i was wondering if your focus on residential or increased focus on residential via new products or whatever is something that you're concerning to?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, in terms of our strategy and alignment with the board, we definitely believe a greater exposure to the residential segment to new -- and north america would be a positive for the organization medium term and that's both residential new construction and residential repair and remodel.
dan rizzo -- jefferies -- analyst
got you.

our next question will come from rosemarie morbelli of g. research, llc. please go ahead.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research, llc -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everyone.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
good morning, rosemarie.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
hey, rosemarie.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research, llc -- analyst
just following up on your last comment regarding getting greater exposure on residential repair and for new resi, what is the size of that business currently? and getting a larger exposure, does that mean offering additional product lines which would come via an acquisition or do you have product lines that actually could go into that particular area?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
well, rosemarie, we have, as you know, the premium underlayment in roofing, the ice & water shield brand that we have, the grace or the gcp ice & water shield. that, of course, goes on all the residential and a little bit of commercial but not a lot. and then, of course, about one-third of our our products in the admixture and cement additives goes into residential too in north america. so, we actually have a decent portfolio there that we do get benefit of residential and we expect that to be very strong in 2021, so that's good news.
with respect to additional products, there are some new products on the red side that they're working both on the underlayment, the air barrier, those types of products that we can get benefit from both on the res and the commercial side. they're kind of dual products where the technology is. so, that will help us. but certainly m&a and acquisition opportunities would support our distribution channel and our partners in our portfolio. so, we're also looking at that. so that's a nice opportunity for us whether it's organic or through m&a with respect to our position there.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research, llc -- analyst
so -- thanks, craig. but -- so, my understanding regarding the underlayment is that it is mostly for repair that it does not necessarily goes with new residential because the -- you don't have the entire roofing system and your underlayment is kind of expensive and it is not really needed on a new roof -- i mean on a new construction. am i wrong in that?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
rosemarie, we would describe our product as premium, not expensive.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research, llc -- analyst
sorry about that.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
the best in the industry. no, the majority of our product portfolio when it comes to roofing underlayment does go into the repair and remodel segment. but in some geographies, we do have good exposure to new construction. and i think we are -- we think conceptually about proofing a structure. and so, we think about what other products we should have in our product portfolio and we do have air and vapor barriers, as an example, as an extension of our product line for the roofing underlayment.
so we would like to build out more of a system for the residential markets, both repair and remodel and new construction and then have the opportunity to bundle the product through the distribution channel and provide more value and synergy to them and would love the opportunity to bundle products to the end applicator or contractor as well and get an increased share of wallet that way.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research, llc -- analyst
thank you. that is very helpful. could you talk also about the -- you gave us the dollar amount that -- from the products that you exited. i am assuming they are lower margin product lines. could you talk about the impact on the margin side or on the ebitda whichever one you pick?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yeah, on the exit countries -- you're referring to the exit countries, rosemarie?
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research, llc -- analyst
yes, correct.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yeah, so if you look at the scc margins, they have been generally improving over the last two years, actually over the last eight [phonetic] quarters. and some of the impact of that is the exit country strategy. i won't give you exactly the specific impact on the margin from those exit countries, but the mix has helped us a lot. that probably is pretty well at the end. from here on, we will not be reporting exit country, but certainly there is pick up on that. but it's pretty well at its end, so you won't get further improvement from that. does that answer your question?
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research, llc -- analyst
yes. yes, it does. thank you. could you also give us a little more details behind the loss share? and i do realize that one customer decided to make their own additives, but are they successfully doing it or do you think there is a chance they will come back and are you making progress offsetting that particular loss business?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yeah, so in scc and i think simon made the point that we are starting to see some offset on some of that volume whether that's in asia or in north america, latin america, certainly they're doing a very nice job with pickup in volume there. so we are starting to see offset on that in scc. on sbm, i would say that share -- as you know, we had a tough year in 2019 on sbm and i would say early part of 2020. the teams are really engaged in the last half year of 2020 going into 2021. we've reestablished our kind of commercial savvy, i would call it. and i think that's putting us in a much better position in sbm. there's more diligence around the commercial activity with respect to the distributor promotion activity and clarity and exactly what we're trying to accomplish. so, i think we're over that hump, but i'll let simon weigh in.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i had spent a lot of time over the last few months with the sales teams in north america on both business segments, both sbm and scc. and i'm also reflecting on the 1,600 participants we had in our customer survey and the comments feedback [phonetic]. i would say on the scc side, we have a very strong product portfolio and we have excellent technical support. so, i think that puts us in a very nice competitive situation or ability. where we have work to do is around our service and there's various different aspects for that, which i won't go into detail now, but we are working on improving the service side on scc. and i think that gets us back on the front foot in scc and enables us to grow organically when we fix the service piece and that's number 1 priority for this year for scc in north america.
on the sbm side, again it's -- mixed fireproofing has done very well and been resilient. we feel there is a combination of things that have hurt our position for building envelope and for residential. one is service. and again, absolute number 1 priority for sbm, i think what's fantastic is the loyalty to our brands among our contracted group and i have been very impressed by the quality of our sales groups on the sbm side in north america. they're some other better ones that i've seen in 30 something years. so, that gives me a lot of confidence. we just need to do a better job and support those groups around service and i think we could really strengthen our position and get back into growth if we can have some supplemental products and have a broader stronger product portfolio. so those are real strategic priorities for us for sbm north america.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research, llc -- analyst
thank you, simon. and if i could ask one last question, could you give us an update on verifi?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yes, rosemarie. either simon and i can do that, but -- so during this covid-19 period, it's been a little more difficult to do installations in that type of thing with the trucks and the people and that type of thing. our folks have not been traveling as much just like yourself and other people probably. so, we've not installed as many as we anticipated, for instance, a couple years ago that we would in this year. but we've had good install base. the customers who are using them continue to use it, get value out of it. we did increase our revenues by about 40% in 2020 based on our installed base that we had plus some incremental installs at the current customer base.
so, if customers already have the equipment and they want to add trucks, which i think almost all of them have added trucks in 2020, we've continued to do that and we have signed a few new contracts, but that's a slow process for installs. so we'll continue to install units in 2021 at about the same pace as 2020. so we still see growth in that business, but we'll have to wait for the pandemic to finish to really reassess that to determine whether we want to ramp it up again the way we were or whether we're going to continue to service our current customers and continue to deliver value for them. so, that's where we're at this time.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research, llc -- analyst
okay, thank you.

our next question will come from chris shaw with monness crespi. please go ahead.
chris shaw -- monness crespi hardt -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. how are you doing?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
hi, chris.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
hi, chris. nice to meet you.
chris shaw -- monness crespi hardt -- analyst
just as -- rosemarie just asked, how big is verifi now? its overall sales?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yeah. we've never really disclosed that. that's been something we've been debating internally whether we should be more transparent on that number, but we haven't concluded that at this call. so, chris, i wish i could answer that, but it wasn't something we were going to disclose today. but we may soon because we think that the community outside this room that we're in here should know that and they should understand it, but i'll let simon weigh in also.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think we will hold off on disclosing it on this call and we'll think about how best to represent verifi. but it is a substantial opportunity for us as a significant growth vehicle. the demand is largely untapped globally for the technology. the level of interest and inquiry around the business or around the technology is as busy as ever. and actually when you think about the importance of sustainability, here is a tool we can put in the hands of our customer base that can drive improved sustainability and is measurable and therefore we expect the demand around the technology to continue to grow.
chris shaw -- monness crespi hardt -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then across the -- i guess, the whole company, was sales into the residential construction industry up in the fourth quarter. i guess, i really just want to figure out maybe how weak the demand from commercial construction was in 4q and maybe how is it trending right now kind of?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yeah, so our sales on our residential -- on our sbm residential were down. we didn't do promotions. we did talk to our distributors. they were less apt to take inventory in than they were the prior year. however, we did have decent demand in our admixtures in our cement additive products of which about a third of those go into new residential construction. and that was actually surprisingly strong. and when i say surprisingly, we actually -- we were ahead of our number that we originally expected in north america even though we were down. so, we did capture some of that growth and we expect to continue to do that in 2021.
chris shaw -- monness crespi hardt -- analyst
and as -- just i thought about this, your comments about maybe getting more into residential products or in markets or expanding more there, i always had the impression and i don't really cover anything with so much residential construction exposure, but i always thought that was a much more maybe competitive or volatile market. is that the case in your view or is that something that you think you could expand and they are getting sort of, i don't know, temper somehow [phonetic]?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
no, i mean, i wouldn't consider it volatile, chris, when you look at demand since we came out of the great recession. you've had steady increasing demand for residential new construction. and i think the ideal situation is you've got good exposure to the residential new and you've got good exposure to the residential repair and remodel. and the reason i say that is the repair and remodel tends to be counter cyclical. so that when you see that drop in demand for new construction, you will see a bump in demand on the repair and remodel. though, the pandemic last year completely changed that dynamic interestingly in 2019 where you saw spikes in both residential new and significant spikes in residential repair and remodel across the country.
chris shaw -- monness crespi hardt -- analyst
that's makes sense. and then just looking at this year, simon, what should we as analysts be looking for? what sort of milepost would you encourage us to sort of look at? i would think maybe margins and sort of maybe costs -- some sort of cost things which should be the -- things that we should first focus on that, i guess, the first achievements this year that we could be looking for? is that right? i mean how would you like us to think about sort of how 2021 rolls out?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, look, we are focused on stabilizing revenues. we're focused on improving margins. and i think we've got line of sight to some good projects that we are working on in terms of improving our overall cost structure. of course, it's always about speed of execution and delivery, but that is a primary focus for us. i think the thing that makes it a little murky, quite honestly, is we benefited from raw material price deflation last year and we have some cost inflation currently. so i think that confuses the picture for us and is that combination of ability to move volume, improve pricing and manage our cost down to try and improve those margins. that's our focus. i'm not going to provide any more detail in that at this point.
chris shaw -- monness crespi hardt -- analyst
all right. it's helpful. thanks a lot.

i will now turn the call over to simon.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, betsy. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our earnings call.
let me begin with our announcement last week where we informed our investment community that gcp have identified various material weaknesses within our financial controls during the fourth quarter 2020. craig will talk about the circumstances leading up to the non-material revisions of our prior period financial statements and the plans to remediate our financial control shortly. i want to note that i've been very pleased by the efforts over the last three months by our new team working with our internal auditors and external auditors and we are confident that we have identified the issues and have a clear path to remediate them. we are committed to improving gcp's financial controls, process and procedures. we expect to file our form 10-k within the 15-day extension period. additionally, i'd also like to thank our employees around the world for their resilience during 2020 dealing with the global pandemic. last year and this year, our employees have responded to the covid-19 environment with dedication to deliver on our commitments and results. so, thank you to them.
today, i would like to update you on our progress during the last 90 days around our goals to stabilize revenues, improve margins and return to profitable growth. in november, i discussed our four priorities. first, to revisit our strategy and more clearly articulate where we will focus our efforts and our plans to drive improvements. second, bringing the voice of the customer front and center. third, analysis of our cost structure. and fourth, relying on the data to underpin decision making and accountability.
since that time, we have undertaken various studies and activities that have helped us identify our strategic priorities. we have done extensive work analyzing our historical performance and with the help of third parties, completed an employee survey and the customer survey. we've reviewed our priorities with our board and both the board and the executive leadership team are now aligned on where we need to focus our efforts. these work streams have been informative and have helped us identify the need to refresh and improve our customer engagement. our initial focus will be on north america as it represents half of our revenues. we believe the data and the customer survey strongly indicate opportunities to improve our market position in both sbm and scc.
our goal is to refocus on our customers including improved communication, product availability and simplified business processes. an important finding from our work is that many customers remain loyal because of the performance of our products and the value of our brands. i want to also note that the issues identified did not apply to all parts of our business and in some segments, we have performed well. i've met with many of our sales teams in north america and i have been very pleased with a desire to win.
as we examin the historical data, it is also clear that the decline in profitability over recent years is predominantly driven by our performance in north america. we need to improve our organizational capability and to simplify our structure. over the last three years, our g&a costs have not reduced in line with our revenues. we will address this issue in 2021 and we'll provide more detail on this later in the year.
moving forward, we will focus on having the right people in key roles, building robust business processes and deploying our technology effectively to ensure real-time data and faster communication and decision making. we can also see from the north american data that our profitability is impacted by lost revenue and margin in our sbm business. we believe this is in part due to increased competition and partly due to loss of share. we expect to address margins by reducing our operating costs and we have already identified a series of opportunities to drive margins while remaining price competitive.
for our building envelope and residential businesses, there are clearly some product gaps. we will address these through product development or through acquisitions. our balance sheet and significant cash reserves give us a lot of optionality. i would like to acknowledge that some good work has been completed over the last year in our scc business where our gross margins are improving and our market position has stabilized. i very much appreciate the efforts of our scc team and look forward to giving them a full support to get back to organic growth and share gains.
as i said on our last earnings call, there are significant opportunities to improve our business and financial performance. what gives me confidence is a clear understanding of the issues to be addressed and the knowledge that i've been successful in overcoming these challenges in various situations over the last 30 years. given the continuation of the covid-19 pandemic and our limited ability to travel internationally, my attention will be on the north american region, which, as i've already mentioned, is our largest business geographically.
in summary, we see a clear path to stabilize revenue and to grow the top line both organically and inorganically. initially, we are focused on how to better serve our customers and becoming easier to do business with. this begins with improving our organizational capabilities. to expedite our improvement programs, we are bringing in experienced talent starting with the executive leadership team. i'd also like to discuss our employee survey briefly. our associates identified three key issues issues for us to address. they want a clear and well articulated strategy, faster decision making and for us to provide clear accountability. we are already working on these three items. we look forward to sharing our plans and update you on our progress throughout the rest of the year.
i'd now like to turn the call over to craig. craig?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
thank you, simon, and good morning, everyone.
i will begin my remarks with a discussion of last week's announcement with respect to the material weaknesses and resulting revisions to gcp's prior period financial results as reported. 2020 has been a year of change for gcp, with the new board and new senior leadership team. and as part of these changes, we realigned a number of functions under the purview of the cfo office, which included our new chief accounting officer, james waddell. and during the fourth quarter, the information technology department, the previously named business transformation group and the customer service department temporarily reported to the cfo. with this change, we initiated a review of accounting policies and controls including certain it controls and determined a number of them were ineffective. the team also determined during preparation of the year-end close process that certain accrued expenses in prior periods were inaccurate dating back to 2018. this work led to the final determination of a number of material weaknesses within our controls in connection with certain information technology systems, revenue recognition, general accounting in the close process.
based on the identification of these items, we were required to make revisions to our financial statements impacting prior periods of which the cumulative sum dollar value is immaterial. this incremental effort and time required to ensure the accuracy of our financial statements and proper disclosure of q4 and full year 2020 results, including prior period adjustments, did cause the delay in providing completed audited financial statements.
the financial impact of the provision to net income attributable to gcp shareholders for 2020, quarter three, year-to-date, is $1.7 million favorable and this is included in the gcp 2020 full year preliminary financial statements as reported. the financial impact of the revision to net income for 2019 full year is approximately $200,000 favorable and for 2018 full year is approximately $300,000 unfavorable. the complete impacts of the revisions will be included in the form 10-k once filed. in addition to the changes made in q4 to the gcp leadership team, with the onboarding of james waddell in october named as the new chief accounting officer with over 20 years of experience in internal audit and the naming of our new chief information officer in january with the hire of robyn mccall and the engagement of outside professional support, which is already been retained to develop, review and redesign certain controls, we have a solid plan in place to remediate the identified material weaknesses. our objective is to enhance our internal controls environment overall. as we move forward, the team is committed to improve overall effectiveness of our own controls, our goal is to remediate as soon as possible.
now, turning to the preliminary fourth quarter financial results. as a reminder, all sales and associated growth rates in my comments are on a constant currency basis. i will discuss gcp's results and then move into the business section. gcp's constant sales currency, excluding exit markets of $242.2 million, were approximately 5% lower than prior year due to reduced construction and manufacturing activity as a result of covid-19. these results are higher than our expectations discussed during the third quarter earnings call. construction activity continue to vary around the globe due to recurring outbreaks of covid-19. however, we did see greater consistency of order patterns, particularly outside of north america as customers and markets manage through the pandemic.
with respect to the sales performance in each region versus fourth quarter 2019, north america finished down 10% for the quarter with lower volumes in both scc and sbm. europe sales in the quarter finished up 1%. in europe, we do believe there was some pent-up demand that came through from the lower construction activity in europe in q3 and q2, we do not expect this to continue into the first quarter of 2021 and europe continues to struggle with periodic shutdowns and restrictions due to the pandemic.
latin america sales rebounded up 13% versus the fourth quarter 2019, driven by growth in brazil. asia sales continued to improve sequentially quarter-over-quarter, but were down 7% in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter in 2019 as some countries continued with construction activity restrictions. price for the quarter was up less than 1% compared to the fourth quarter 2019. pricing improved in all regions except asia pacific and most notably in latin america where country inflation due to currency devaluations occurred and gcp increased price accordingly.
gcp's gross margin increased 150 basis points to 39.5%, primarily due to logistics productivity and raw material deflation, partially offset by lower sales volumes. selling and general administration costs of $65.7 million were lower by 1% during the quarter due to lower pension costs and discretionary spending partially offset by growth investments. gcp's loss from continuing operations attributable to gcp shareholders totaled minus $0.8 million compared to income from continuing operations attributable to gcp shareholders of $6.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. the reduction of $7.4 million was due to additional restructuring costs including the cost of exiting certain executives during the fourth quarter.
gcp's adjusted ebit margin, shown on page 7, ended the quarter at 11.2% versus 12.1% in the prior year quarter. lower sales volumes due to the pandemic offset improvements in gross margin. adjusted ebitda margin was 16.1% for the fourth quarter or minus 50 basis points lower versus the same period of 2019. looking at the specific performance of our segments for the fourth quarter on pages 10 and page 11. sccs constant currency sales, excluding market exits, were down approximately 1.6% to $139.9 million. covid-19 continued to negatively impact north america and asia sales declined 5% and 9%, respectively. latin america, principally due to brazil, improved 11% and europe grew in the quarter versus 2019. scc's gross margin improved year-over-year by 180 basis points to 38.9% during the fourth quarter 2020. this is the eighth consecutive quarter of gross margin improvement. operations and logistics productivity and favorable mix was partially offset by reduced operating leverage. scc's segment operating income was $15.1 million with segment operating margin of 10.8%, which increased 10 basis points compared with the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher gross margins.
now turning to the sbm segment for the quarter. sbm sales constant currency totaled $102.3 million during the fourth quarter, a 9.5% decline versus the fourth quarter of 2019. north america sbm sales declined 15% during the quarter attributable to lower building envelope volume and less promotional activity in the residential activity in the residential product line. the building envelope product line saw a number of projects delayed and based on next year's commercial construction market data, it seems right now that this market segment is uncomfortable starting significant large projects at this time. europe was flat with prior year quarter while asia declined 3% year-over-year, but on a sequential basis. asia did grow during the fourth quarter 2020 versus third quarter 2020, which is very promising.
sbm's gross margin increased to 120 basis points to 40.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 due to raw material deflation. sbm's segment operating income was $19.7 million and operating margins were at 19.1%, a 40 basis point decline versus prior period. the decline was due to -- mainly due to lower sales volume due to covid-19 partially offset by higher gross margins.
please turn to page 14 where i will provide a few comments on the preliminary full year 2020. revenue for the year totaled $903.2 million or a 9% decrease versus 2019 on a constant currency basis excluding market exits. sales were down mostly due to the negative impact of covid-19 throughout the year. however, we did lose some share in scc and sbm in asia year-over-year and some share in our sbm business in north america versus 2019. the share loss in asia is due mainly to customers' self manufacturing admixtures or additives in the scc segment and for sbm, poor service including on time and in full service to our customers impacted north america volumes during 2020.
adjusted gross margins ended the year at 39.8% or 180 basis points higher than 2019. productivity, specifically logistics improvements, and raw material deflation was partially offset by lower sales volumes. sales, general and administration costs of $264.5 million for the year were lower by $8.3 million or 3% and this was attributable savings from restructuring programs and lower discretionary spending, partially offset by board costs and growth investments.
gcp's effective tax rate was 27% for the year versus 19% in the prior year. the change was primarily due to state taxes as a result of the gain on sale of the corporate headquarters. the non-recurrence of the 2019 benefit from the 2019 transition tax as well as the 2020 non-deductibility of executive compensation of certain employees. income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders totaled $100.5 million versus $40.8 million for the full year 2019. earnings increased for the year due to the gain on the sale of the corporate headquarters. diluted earnings per share totaled a $1.37 for the year versus $0.56 for 2019. net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during 2020 was approximately $73 million compared to approximately $78 million for 2019. gcp's adjusted free cash flow totaled approximately $76 million for the 12 months 2020 compared to $50 million during the same period 2019, mainly driven by reduced capital spending and improved working capital.
looking forward to 2021. while the distribution of the vaccines represents positive momentum, the coronavirus continues to impact the global construction activity at varying rates. so as in prior discussions, our best views are short term in nature, which will be updated as the year unfolds. based upon today's best information, we anticipate gcp will be down in revenues for the first quarter 2021 year-over-year by approximately 5% in constant currency. this is an improvement to what we saw in q4 2020, which landed q4 2020 year-over-year down 6% on a constant currency basis. we expect the covid-19 dynamics and slightly tougher winter weather in q1 2021 to have some unfavorable impacts versus prior year. we expect raw material inflation to start in the latter half of the year and are preparing price plans to partially offset.
operating expenses for the first quarter of 2021 will be approximately flat with the same period 2020 as the reduction in employee-related costs will be offset by the rent expense of our cambridge campus as a result of the sale. we are extremely focused on our operating expenses as a percent of our revenue and expect improvements in this metric as we move through the year. we will continue to play significant emphasis on cash generation and expect similar positive results on operating cash metrics similar to 2020. capital expenditures for the year year 2021 are planned to be approximately 4% of sales consistent with spending levels in 2020, but much lower than 2018 and 2019. gcp continually reviews its capital expenditures given changes in revenue predictions.
in closing, as we advance the overall performance of the company, we see great opportunities to improve our business and financial performance through revenue growth, cost efficiencies and process improvement. we are confident in our ability to perform well within the current impacts of the global pandemic and are highly focused on profitable growth. our balance sheet is strong and we continue to strengthen it over time, which will broaden our pool of opportunity to create value. we are also confident in the long-term fundamentals and dynamics of the construction markets globally and our ability to capture this opportunity.
with this, i'll turn it back over to simon.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, craig. thank you all for your time today. as the new ceo of gcp, i'm thrilled to be here. i believe there are great opportunities for the company and feel privileged to work alongside our talented employees to drive gcp forward. my goal is to be transparent, objective and to meet and exceed our commitments. we are telling you what we know now. we are striving to do better and as we have more clarity as the pandemic ends, we expect to be able to provide investors with a long-term outlook and vision for the future of gcp. thank you for joining our call and we look forward to taking any questions.

[operator instructions] our first question will come from mike harrison with seaport global securities. please go ahead.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
hi, good morning.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
hi, michael. how are you doing?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
hi, mike.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
doing well, thank you. i wanted to say i appreciate you guys are sharing some of the findings from your customer and employee surveys. i think that kind of self reflection can be difficult, but i think it's also healthy and it seems like an important step in the right direction. in terms of the outlook, can you provide a little bit of color on maybe how we should think about the earnings progression during 2021? you know there are some seasonal factors to keep in mind. i think we can probably assume that the recovery in construction activity is gradual during the course of the year. and then you also referenced some raw material costs that may be come in toward the end of the year, inflationary costs that come in during the end of the year. and then there is also these discretionary costs that you temporarily cut back on during 2020 that maybe start to flow back in during the year. so, maybe just some initial thoughts on how we should think about the cadence of earnings given all those moving pieces in 2021?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yeah, michael, it's craig. i think you've hit a lot of the points. it's not easy to really determine the second half as well as we like. but let me give you a little flavor on the first half. of course, q1 being down a little bit in volume, probably won't have a little -- a lot of pickup in profit in q1, probably be similar to prior year. and then, of course, q2 will be a little better because of the situation last year on the volumes because that was the most dynamic q4 of the pandemic, so that would have a pickup.
and then the second half is a little bit tougher to call. i think you've got inflation coming through, which will work on price. but it's just a question of how much we can pass through and how quickly the inflation comes through, but we do expect that to happen. so, there might be some margin degradation in the second half that we have to work on with price just year-over-year.
and then on cost, we're going to work to try to hold that savings that we've had from from 2020 through 2021, but there are some offsets to that, like the rent in cambridge, obviously, merit and some other inflation. so your overall operating expense generally will probably be about flat full year, year-over-year with all that being said.
does that give you a little bit flavor for the dynamic?
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
yeah, that's helpful and i definitely understand. as i kind of ticked off all those moving pieces, there is a lot to try to take in there. i guess maybe on the specific to the raw material versus pricing situation, can you talk about your ability to pass pricing along the customers in both the scc and sbm segments? and maybe is inflation more of a concern in one segments or the other?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
well, in this construction industry, as you know, you're always about 60 days to 90 days behind on price versus inflation to pass it through. you've got quoted specific projects that are going on, specifically things like fireproofing and some of the big projects. you can't move price through as fast as you like, but that also helps you in some years. so you'll note in some of the notes we outlined in 2020, we got some nice deflation and we didn't have to give back a lot of price. in fact, we held our price. but i think in 2021, we'll have to give back a little price on that deflation on the early first half of the year and then we will push for price in the second half. but when inflation comes in the second half, usually you're a little bit late on it. so you'll get it in 2022. i don't know if that helps on that answer, but that's -- i'll let simon weigh in too because he is from the industry also.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. hi, mike, simon here. i think it's a mixed bag and it's difficult to provide the kind of specificity you would like. we are definitely seeing some price spikes and it seems to also be driven by the weather and the impact on some of the raw material supplies in february. and quite honestly, we are trying to unpick what is some temporary blips on price versus what we can expect for the rest of the year. and so, there is some analysis that kind of goes on on a daily basis for us trying to see where those prices for the raw materials will settle and therefore how it's appropriate for us to respond in the market. so, it's currently a moving target, but something we look at and attempt to manage every day.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
and in terms of the pace of recovery in commercial projects in particular, i think you made a comment that i think it was specific to north america. you were seeing the commercial construction, they were uncomfortable moving forward with projects. is that related to the economic environment? is that related to covid and safety issues? maybe talk a little bit about the commercial -- the pace of commercial activity and what's leading to that discomfort, i guess.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and you know that it's -- we -- the biggest exposure to commercial new construction in any of our geographies would be north america, mike. we are fortunate in some of the disciplines we have in the organization in using various tools to look at our pipeline. so we've got a good view on our pipeline in north america. the part of our business that is being impacted the most is the building envelope business and obviously when we put the water proofing membrane onto the substructure that happens very close to the start of the project.
so some of the very large projects, which could be office buildings, they could be tourist attractions. we have seen a whole series of projects delayed and in some cases canceled in 2020 and we are monitoring that very closely in 2021. what we are attempting to do is switch our focus a little bit onto some of the different types of projects, be that data center, healthcare where we do see growth to offset that. and currently our fireproofing business, which tends to happen about 12 months later after the installation of the water proofing, that business is still looking quite resilient.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yeah, i'd just add on that, we've had some -- we've seen some nice numbers come through on fireproofing. so, on the projects that were already set up to go, they're continuing to finish. so, i don't want to give you a false alarm that there's not nice projects out there that we're continuing to work through. and the fireproofing and the specialty group did very nicely in q4 for instance. and hopefully, these larger projects are just pushed out a little bit on timing. we haven't seen a lot of cancellations yet. that's kind of the situation.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
all right. and then the last question i have is on north america, that was down sequentially from q3 to q4 and on a year-over-year basis seems to have deteriorated a little bit. is that just the spike in covid cases do you think or -- you referred to some share losses, did those share losses intensify in the fourth quarter?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
no, not specifically, michael. you saw that my share loss comments were kind of in the yearly view. generally, we saw in asia a little bit of share loss to the self manufacturing of some additives, a little bit in china. and on the sbm side, it was north america during the year. but specific to q4, if you remember last time we had a call, we said that we were a little apprehensive about the distribution channel taking on much inventory and we expected kind of that to happen. there is no way that we're going to take on a lot of inventory in november and december and have it sit there during the winter, which they might, in some instances, other years. so that's kind of the situation. we didn't hold any promotions. sometimes we do a little promotional activity in q4 where the distributors do want to hold some inventory and shore themselves up, but that didn't happen this year. so, it kind of landed about where we expected. so, that's more distribution channel management effect than anything else in q4.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
all right. and just really quickly to follow-up there, does that suggest that you guys are may be positioned to see a little bit of distributor restocking as we get into maybe late q1 and in early q2?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yes, if we can -- if this winter would move past us and not be disrupting a lot of the u.s. and europe, then yes, we expect to have later in q1 and moving into q2 that to pick up.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
well, we hit 60 in chicago yesterday or close to it, so spring is coming i promise.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
well, congratulations. it will be [indecipherable] probably tomorrow or the next day.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
there you go. all right. thanks very much.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, mike.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer

our next question will come from laurence alexander with jefferies. please go ahead.
dan rizzo -- jefferies -- analyst
hi guys. it's dan rizzo on for laurence. how is it going today?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
great, dan. very good. thanks.
dan rizzo -- jefferies -- analyst
would you guys benefit directly from a national infrastructure bill if it comes to pass later in the year or is it -- i mean what's your views on that?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
we will benefit directly. it's just a question of timing, dan. generally, it takes a while for those projects to get developed, engineered in progress. so, the roads and that type of thing we benefit less. we have less value of our product on roads and things. if it's a little more infrastructure in bridges, which take a little longer to design and get up to speed, then we would benefit more. but if it's past anything -- past in the second half of this year, the benefit would probably come mostly in 2022, i would think for us.
dan rizzo -- jefferies -- analyst
okay.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
dan, you couldn't see, but we were smiling -- craig and i were smiling at each other. it's a hotly debated topic internally. broadly, we'd say yes, but our expectation is around more 2022.
dan rizzo -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. and then you mentioned focusing on north america. i mean, improving your position -- no, i assume or -- is that -- that's going be organically grown, i would think, or maybe you are looking at m&a? and if that's the case, i mean is there something specific that you're going to do? is it just executing better or i mean -- how are you introducing new products. so, just wondering -- just some color on how you improve your position in this region?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so, i think as i said in my introductory comments, when it comes to scc north america, i think the folks have done a very good job in the last 12 months or so and i see our market position having stabilized for scc in north america. so, it's how we best support them to get back into growth mode. on the building product side, sbm side, it's a mixed bag. so, our fireproofing business, we've done a good job.
on the residential and building envelope business, we have a rather complicated supply chain, which has meant service to our customers over the last few years has not been as good as it should. and consequently, we feel like we've lost some market share in those specific two businesses. so, we have a whole series of projects that we're working on to improve that service, which we think will help. but we think we can also bolster the business by filling some product gaps that we have in both our building envelope and our residential business. now, there is optionality to do that organically or through m&a. and given our cash position, we are definitely going to explore m&a in those categories.
dan rizzo -- jefferies -- analyst
that brings me to one [indecipherable]. you guys have a very solid balance sheet and improving cash position particularly just given the moves you made in the drop in capex. so, i was wondering if m&a is the first use of cash or if returning the cash to shareholders is being considered as well?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we consider all options and it's a good debate and dialog between the senior management team and the board at the best allocation of capital. i think the good news is we are seeing more options to drive efficiency and productivity in the business through some better capital allocation, some capital expenditure projects. we definitely can continue to keep the share buyback as an option. and as i said, we're definitely going to explore m&a too.
dan rizzo -- jefferies -- analyst
and then final question, just given the changing dynamics in the different end markets, particularly in the building side, i was wondering if your focus on residential or increased focus on residential via new products or whatever is something that you're concerning to?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, in terms of our strategy and alignment with the board, we definitely believe a greater exposure to the residential segment to new -- and north america would be a positive for the organization medium term and that's both residential new construction and residential repair and remodel.
dan rizzo -- jefferies -- analyst
got you.

our next question will come from rosemarie morbelli of g. research, llc. please go ahead.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research, llc -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everyone.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
good morning, rosemarie.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
hey, rosemarie.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research, llc -- analyst
just following up on your last comment regarding getting greater exposure on residential repair and for new resi, what is the size of that business currently? and getting a larger exposure, does that mean offering additional product lines which would come via an acquisition or do you have product lines that actually could go into that particular area?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
well, rosemarie, we have, as you know, the premium underlayment in roofing, the ice & water shield brand that we have, the grace or the gcp ice & water shield. that, of course, goes on all the residential and a little bit of commercial but not a lot. and then, of course, about one-third of our our products in the admixture and cement additives goes into residential too in north america. so, we actually have a decent portfolio there that we do get benefit of residential and we expect that to be very strong in 2021, so that's good news.
with respect to additional products, there are some new products on the red side that they're working both on the underlayment, the air barrier, those types of products that we can get benefit from both on the res and the commercial side. they're kind of dual products where the technology is. so, that will help us. but certainly m&a and acquisition opportunities would support our distribution channel and our partners in our portfolio. so, we're also looking at that. so that's a nice opportunity for us whether it's organic or through m&a with respect to our position there.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research, llc -- analyst
so -- thanks, craig. but -- so, my understanding regarding the underlayment is that it is mostly for repair that it does not necessarily goes with new residential because the -- you don't have the entire roofing system and your underlayment is kind of expensive and it is not really needed on a new roof -- i mean on a new construction. am i wrong in that?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
rosemarie, we would describe our product as premium, not expensive.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research, llc -- analyst
sorry about that.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
the best in the industry. no, the majority of our product portfolio when it comes to roofing underlayment does go into the repair and remodel segment. but in some geographies, we do have good exposure to new construction. and i think we are -- we think conceptually about proofing a structure. and so, we think about what other products we should have in our product portfolio and we do have air and vapor barriers, as an example, as an extension of our product line for the roofing underlayment.
so we would like to build out more of a system for the residential markets, both repair and remodel and new construction and then have the opportunity to bundle the product through the distribution channel and provide more value and synergy to them and would love the opportunity to bundle products to the end applicator or contractor as well and get an increased share of wallet that way.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research, llc -- analyst
thank you. that is very helpful. could you talk also about the -- you gave us the dollar amount that -- from the products that you exited. i am assuming they are lower margin product lines. could you talk about the impact on the margin side or on the ebitda whichever one you pick?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yeah, on the exit countries -- you're referring to the exit countries, rosemarie?
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research, llc -- analyst
yes, correct.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yeah, so if you look at the scc margins, they have been generally improving over the last two years, actually over the last eight [phonetic] quarters. and some of the impact of that is the exit country strategy. i won't give you exactly the specific impact on the margin from those exit countries, but the mix has helped us a lot. that probably is pretty well at the end. from here on, we will not be reporting exit country, but certainly there is pick up on that. but it's pretty well at its end, so you won't get further improvement from that. does that answer your question?
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research, llc -- analyst
yes. yes, it does. thank you. could you also give us a little more details behind the loss share? and i do realize that one customer decided to make their own additives, but are they successfully doing it or do you think there is a chance they will come back and are you making progress offsetting that particular loss business?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yeah, so in scc and i think simon made the point that we are starting to see some offset on some of that volume whether that's in asia or in north america, latin america, certainly they're doing a very nice job with pickup in volume there. so we are starting to see offset on that in scc. on sbm, i would say that share -- as you know, we had a tough year in 2019 on sbm and i would say early part of 2020. the teams are really engaged in the last half year of 2020 going into 2021. we've reestablished our kind of commercial savvy, i would call it. and i think that's putting us in a much better position in sbm. there's more diligence around the commercial activity with respect to the distributor promotion activity and clarity and exactly what we're trying to accomplish. so, i think we're over that hump, but i'll let simon weigh in.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i had spent a lot of time over the last few months with the sales teams in north america on both business segments, both sbm and scc. and i'm also reflecting on the 1,600 participants we had in our customer survey and the comments feedback [phonetic]. i would say on the scc side, we have a very strong product portfolio and we have excellent technical support. so, i think that puts us in a very nice competitive situation or ability. where we have work to do is around our service and there's various different aspects for that, which i won't go into detail now, but we are working on improving the service side on scc. and i think that gets us back on the front foot in scc and enables us to grow organically when we fix the service piece and that's number 1 priority for this year for scc in north america.
on the sbm side, again it's -- mixed fireproofing has done very well and been resilient. we feel there is a combination of things that have hurt our position for building envelope and for residential. one is service. and again, absolute number 1 priority for sbm, i think what's fantastic is the loyalty to our brands among our contracted group and i have been very impressed by the quality of our sales groups on the sbm side in north america. they're some other better ones that i've seen in 30 something years. so, that gives me a lot of confidence. we just need to do a better job and support those groups around service and i think we could really strengthen our position and get back into growth if we can have some supplemental products and have a broader stronger product portfolio. so those are real strategic priorities for us for sbm north america.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research, llc -- analyst
thank you, simon. and if i could ask one last question, could you give us an update on verifi?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yes, rosemarie. either simon and i can do that, but -- so during this covid-19 period, it's been a little more difficult to do installations in that type of thing with the trucks and the people and that type of thing. our folks have not been traveling as much just like yourself and other people probably. so, we've not installed as many as we anticipated, for instance, a couple years ago that we would in this year. but we've had good install base. the customers who are using them continue to use it, get value out of it. we did increase our revenues by about 40% in 2020 based on our installed base that we had plus some incremental installs at the current customer base.
so, if customers already have the equipment and they want to add trucks, which i think almost all of them have added trucks in 2020, we've continued to do that and we have signed a few new contracts, but that's a slow process for installs. so we'll continue to install units in 2021 at about the same pace as 2020. so we still see growth in that business, but we'll have to wait for the pandemic to finish to really reassess that to determine whether we want to ramp it up again the way we were or whether we're going to continue to service our current customers and continue to deliver value for them. so, that's where we're at this time.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research, llc -- analyst
okay, thank you.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer

our next question will come from chris shaw with monness crespi. please go ahead.
chris shaw -- monness crespi hardt -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. how are you doing?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
hi, chris.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
hi, chris. nice to meet you.
chris shaw -- monness crespi hardt -- analyst
just as -- rosemarie just asked, how big is verifi now? its overall sales?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yeah. we've never really disclosed that. that's been something we've been debating internally whether we should be more transparent on that number, but we haven't concluded that at this call. so, chris, i wish i could answer that, but it wasn't something we were going to disclose today. but we may soon because we think that the community outside this room that we're in here should know that and they should understand it, but i'll let simon weigh in also.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think we will hold off on disclosing it on this call and we'll think about how best to represent verifi. but it is a substantial opportunity for us as a significant growth vehicle. the demand is largely untapped globally for the technology. the level of interest and inquiry around the business or around the technology is as busy as ever. and actually when you think about the importance of sustainability, here is a tool we can put in the hands of our customer base that can drive improved sustainability and is measurable and therefore we expect the demand around the technology to continue to grow.
chris shaw -- monness crespi hardt -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then across the -- i guess, the whole company, was sales into the residential construction industry up in the fourth quarter. i guess, i really just want to figure out maybe how weak the demand from commercial construction was in 4q and maybe how is it trending right now kind of?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yeah, so our sales on our residential -- on our sbm residential were down. we didn't do promotions. we did talk to our distributors. they were less apt to take inventory in than they were the prior year. however, we did have decent demand in our admixtures in our cement additive products of which about a third of those go into new residential construction. and that was actually surprisingly strong. and when i say surprisingly, we actually -- we were ahead of our number that we originally expected in north america even though we were down. so, we did capture some of that growth and we expect to continue to do that in 2021.
chris shaw -- monness crespi hardt -- analyst
and as -- just i thought about this, your comments about maybe getting more into residential products or in markets or expanding more there, i always had the impression and i don't really cover anything with so much residential construction exposure, but i always thought that was a much more maybe competitive or volatile market. is that the case in your view or is that something that you think you could expand and they are getting sort of, i don't know, temper somehow [phonetic]?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
no, i mean, i wouldn't consider it volatile, chris, when you look at demand since we came out of the great recession. you've had steady increasing demand for residential new construction. and i think the ideal situation is you've got good exposure to the residential new and you've got good exposure to the residential repair and remodel. and the reason i say that is the repair and remodel tends to be counter cyclical. so that when you see that drop in demand for new construction, you will see a bump in demand on the repair and remodel. though, the pandemic last year completely changed that dynamic interestingly in 2019 where you saw spikes in both residential new and significant spikes in residential repair and remodel across the country.
chris shaw -- monness crespi hardt -- analyst
that's makes sense. and then just looking at this year, simon, what should we as analysts be looking for? what sort of milepost would you encourage us to sort of look at? i would think maybe margins and sort of maybe costs -- some sort of cost things which should be the -- things that we should first focus on that, i guess, the first achievements this year that we could be looking for? is that right? i mean how would you like us to think about sort of how 2021 rolls out?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, look, we are focused on stabilizing revenues. we're focused on improving margins. and i think we've got line of sight to some good projects that we are working on in terms of improving our overall cost structure. of course, it's always about speed of execution and delivery, but that is a primary focus for us. i think the thing that makes it a little murky, quite honestly, is we benefited from raw material price deflation last year and we have some cost inflation currently. so i think that confuses the picture for us and is that combination of ability to move volume, improve pricing and manage our cost down to try and improve those margins. that's our focus. i'm not going to provide any more detail in that at this point.
chris shaw -- monness crespi hardt -- analyst
all right. it's helpful. thanks a lot.

simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, betsy. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our earnings call.
let me begin with our announcement last week where we informed our investment community that gcp have identified various material weaknesses within our financial controls during the fourth quarter 2020. craig will talk about the circumstances leading up to the non-material revisions of our prior period financial statements and the plans to remediate our financial control shortly. i want to note that i've been very pleased by the efforts over the last three months by our new team working with our internal auditors and external auditors and we are confident that we have identified the issues and have a clear path to remediate them. we are committed to improving gcp's financial controls, process and procedures. we expect to file our form 10-k within the 15-day extension period. additionally, i'd also like to thank our employees around the world for their resilience during 2020 dealing with the global pandemic. last year and this year, our employees have responded to the covid-19 environment with dedication to deliver on our commitments and results. so, thank you to them.
today, i would like to update you on our progress during the last 90 days around our goals to stabilize revenues, improve margins and return to profitable growth. in november, i discussed our four priorities. first, to revisit our strategy and more clearly articulate where we will focus our efforts and our plans to drive improvements. second, bringing the voice of the customer front and center. third, analysis of our cost structure. and fourth, relying on the data to underpin decision making and accountability.
since that time, we have undertaken various studies and activities that have helped us identify our strategic priorities. we have done extensive work analyzing our historical performance and with the help of third parties, completed an employee survey and the customer survey. we've reviewed our priorities with our board and both the board and the executive leadership team are now aligned on where we need to focus our efforts. these work streams have been informative and have helped us identify the need to refresh and improve our customer engagement. our initial focus will be on north america as it represents half of our revenues. we believe the data and the customer survey strongly indicate opportunities to improve our market position in both sbm and scc.
our goal is to refocus on our customers including improved communication, product availability and simplified business processes. an important finding from our work is that many customers remain loyal because of the performance of our products and the value of our brands. i want to also note that the issues identified did not apply to all parts of our business and in some segments, we have performed well. i've met with many of our sales teams in north america and i have been very pleased with a desire to win.
as we examin the historical data, it is also clear that the decline in profitability over recent years is predominantly driven by our performance in north america. we need to improve our organizational capability and to simplify our structure. over the last three years, our g&a costs have not reduced in line with our revenues. we will address this issue in 2021 and we'll provide more detail on this later in the year.
moving forward, we will focus on having the right people in key roles, building robust business processes and deploying our technology effectively to ensure real-time data and faster communication and decision making. we can also see from the north american data that our profitability is impacted by lost revenue and margin in our sbm business. we believe this is in part due to increased competition and partly due to loss of share. we expect to address margins by reducing our operating costs and we have already identified a series of opportunities to drive margins while remaining price competitive.
for our building envelope and residential businesses, there are clearly some product gaps. we will address these through product development or through acquisitions. our balance sheet and significant cash reserves give us a lot of optionality. i would like to acknowledge that some good work has been completed over the last year in our scc business where our gross margins are improving and our market position has stabilized. i very much appreciate the efforts of our scc team and look forward to giving them a full support to get back to organic growth and share gains.
as i said on our last earnings call, there are significant opportunities to improve our business and financial performance. what gives me confidence is a clear understanding of the issues to be addressed and the knowledge that i've been successful in overcoming these challenges in various situations over the last 30 years. given the continuation of the covid-19 pandemic and our limited ability to travel internationally, my attention will be on the north american region, which, as i've already mentioned, is our largest business geographically.
in summary, we see a clear path to stabilize revenue and to grow the top line both organically and inorganically. initially, we are focused on how to better serve our customers and becoming easier to do business with. this begins with improving our organizational capabilities. to expedite our improvement programs, we are bringing in experienced talent starting with the executive leadership team. i'd also like to discuss our employee survey briefly. our associates identified three key issues issues for us to address. they want a clear and well articulated strategy, faster decision making and for us to provide clear accountability. we are already working on these three items. we look forward to sharing our plans and update you on our progress throughout the rest of the year.
i'd now like to turn the call over to craig. craig?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
thank you, simon, and good morning, everyone.
i will begin my remarks with a discussion of last week's announcement with respect to the material weaknesses and resulting revisions to gcp's prior period financial results as reported. 2020 has been a year of change for gcp, with the new board and new senior leadership team. and as part of these changes, we realigned a number of functions under the purview of the cfo office, which included our new chief accounting officer, james waddell. and during the fourth quarter, the information technology department, the previously named business transformation group and the customer service department temporarily reported to the cfo. with this change, we initiated a review of accounting policies and controls including certain it controls and determined a number of them were ineffective. the team also determined during preparation of the year-end close process that certain accrued expenses in prior periods were inaccurate dating back to 2018. this work led to the final determination of a number of material weaknesses within our controls in connection with certain information technology systems, revenue recognition, general accounting in the close process.
based on the identification of these items, we were required to make revisions to our financial statements impacting prior periods of which the cumulative sum dollar value is immaterial. this incremental effort and time required to ensure the accuracy of our financial statements and proper disclosure of q4 and full year 2020 results, including prior period adjustments, did cause the delay in providing completed audited financial statements.
the financial impact of the provision to net income attributable to gcp shareholders for 2020, quarter three, year-to-date, is $1.7 million favorable and this is included in the gcp 2020 full year preliminary financial statements as reported. the financial impact of the revision to net income for 2019 full year is approximately $200,000 favorable and for 2018 full year is approximately $300,000 unfavorable. the complete impacts of the revisions will be included in the form 10-k once filed. in addition to the changes made in q4 to the gcp leadership team, with the onboarding of james waddell in october named as the new chief accounting officer with over 20 years of experience in internal audit and the naming of our new chief information officer in january with the hire of robyn mccall and the engagement of outside professional support, which is already been retained to develop, review and redesign certain controls, we have a solid plan in place to remediate the identified material weaknesses. our objective is to enhance our internal controls environment overall. as we move forward, the team is committed to improve overall effectiveness of our own controls, our goal is to remediate as soon as possible.
now, turning to the preliminary fourth quarter financial results. as a reminder, all sales and associated growth rates in my comments are on a constant currency basis. i will discuss gcp's results and then move into the business section. gcp's constant sales currency, excluding exit markets of $242.2 million, were approximately 5% lower than prior year due to reduced construction and manufacturing activity as a result of covid-19. these results are higher than our expectations discussed during the third quarter earnings call. construction activity continue to vary around the globe due to recurring outbreaks of covid-19. however, we did see greater consistency of order patterns, particularly outside of north america as customers and markets manage through the pandemic.
with respect to the sales performance in each region versus fourth quarter 2019, north america finished down 10% for the quarter with lower volumes in both scc and sbm. europe sales in the quarter finished up 1%. in europe, we do believe there was some pent-up demand that came through from the lower construction activity in europe in q3 and q2, we do not expect this to continue into the first quarter of 2021 and europe continues to struggle with periodic shutdowns and restrictions due to the pandemic.
latin america sales rebounded up 13% versus the fourth quarter 2019, driven by growth in brazil. asia sales continued to improve sequentially quarter-over-quarter, but were down 7% in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter in 2019 as some countries continued with construction activity restrictions. price for the quarter was up less than 1% compared to the fourth quarter 2019. pricing improved in all regions except asia pacific and most notably in latin america where country inflation due to currency devaluations occurred and gcp increased price accordingly.
gcp's gross margin increased 150 basis points to 39.5%, primarily due to logistics productivity and raw material deflation, partially offset by lower sales volumes. selling and general administration costs of $65.7 million were lower by 1% during the quarter due to lower pension costs and discretionary spending partially offset by growth investments. gcp's loss from continuing operations attributable to gcp shareholders totaled minus $0.8 million compared to income from continuing operations attributable to gcp shareholders of $6.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. the reduction of $7.4 million was due to additional restructuring costs including the cost of exiting certain executives during the fourth quarter.
gcp's adjusted ebit margin, shown on page 7, ended the quarter at 11.2% versus 12.1% in the prior year quarter. lower sales volumes due to the pandemic offset improvements in gross margin. adjusted ebitda margin was 16.1% for the fourth quarter or minus 50 basis points lower versus the same period of 2019. looking at the specific performance of our segments for the fourth quarter on pages 10 and page 11. sccs constant currency sales, excluding market exits, were down approximately 1.6% to $139.9 million. covid-19 continued to negatively impact north america and asia sales declined 5% and 9%, respectively. latin america, principally due to brazil, improved 11% and europe grew in the quarter versus 2019. scc's gross margin improved year-over-year by 180 basis points to 38.9% during the fourth quarter 2020. this is the eighth consecutive quarter of gross margin improvement. operations and logistics productivity and favorable mix was partially offset by reduced operating leverage. scc's segment operating income was $15.1 million with segment operating margin of 10.8%, which increased 10 basis points compared with the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher gross margins.
now turning to the sbm segment for the quarter. sbm sales constant currency totaled $102.3 million during the fourth quarter, a 9.5% decline versus the fourth quarter of 2019. north america sbm sales declined 15% during the quarter attributable to lower building envelope volume and less promotional activity in the residential activity in the residential product line. the building envelope product line saw a number of projects delayed and based on next year's commercial construction market data, it seems right now that this market segment is uncomfortable starting significant large projects at this time. europe was flat with prior year quarter while asia declined 3% year-over-year, but on a sequential basis. asia did grow during the fourth quarter 2020 versus third quarter 2020, which is very promising.
sbm's gross margin increased to 120 basis points to 40.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 due to raw material deflation. sbm's segment operating income was $19.7 million and operating margins were at 19.1%, a 40 basis point decline versus prior period. the decline was due to -- mainly due to lower sales volume due to covid-19 partially offset by higher gross margins.
please turn to page 14 where i will provide a few comments on the preliminary full year 2020. revenue for the year totaled $903.2 million or a 9% decrease versus 2019 on a constant currency basis excluding market exits. sales were down mostly due to the negative impact of covid-19 throughout the year. however, we did lose some share in scc and sbm in asia year-over-year and some share in our sbm business in north america versus 2019. the share loss in asia is due mainly to customers' self manufacturing admixtures or additives in the scc segment and for sbm, poor service including on time and in full service to our customers impacted north america volumes during 2020.
adjusted gross margins ended the year at 39.8% or 180 basis points higher than 2019. productivity, specifically logistics improvements, and raw material deflation was partially offset by lower sales volumes. sales, general and administration costs of $264.5 million for the year were lower by $8.3 million or 3% and this was attributable savings from restructuring programs and lower discretionary spending, partially offset by board costs and growth investments.
gcp's effective tax rate was 27% for the year versus 19% in the prior year. the change was primarily due to state taxes as a result of the gain on sale of the corporate headquarters. the non-recurrence of the 2019 benefit from the 2019 transition tax as well as the 2020 non-deductibility of executive compensation of certain employees. income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders totaled $100.5 million versus $40.8 million for the full year 2019. earnings increased for the year due to the gain on the sale of the corporate headquarters. diluted earnings per share totaled a $1.37 for the year versus $0.56 for 2019. net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during 2020 was approximately $73 million compared to approximately $78 million for 2019. gcp's adjusted free cash flow totaled approximately $76 million for the 12 months 2020 compared to $50 million during the same period 2019, mainly driven by reduced capital spending and improved working capital.
looking forward to 2021. while the distribution of the vaccines represents positive momentum, the coronavirus continues to impact the global construction activity at varying rates. so as in prior discussions, our best views are short term in nature, which will be updated as the year unfolds. based upon today's best information, we anticipate gcp will be down in revenues for the first quarter 2021 year-over-year by approximately 5% in constant currency. this is an improvement to what we saw in q4 2020, which landed q4 2020 year-over-year down 6% on a constant currency basis. we expect the covid-19 dynamics and slightly tougher winter weather in q1 2021 to have some unfavorable impacts versus prior year. we expect raw material inflation to start in the latter half of the year and are preparing price plans to partially offset.
operating expenses for the first quarter of 2021 will be approximately flat with the same period 2020 as the reduction in employee-related costs will be offset by the rent expense of our cambridge campus as a result of the sale. we are extremely focused on our operating expenses as a percent of our revenue and expect improvements in this metric as we move through the year. we will continue to play significant emphasis on cash generation and expect similar positive results on operating cash metrics similar to 2020. capital expenditures for the year year 2021 are planned to be approximately 4% of sales consistent with spending levels in 2020, but much lower than 2018 and 2019. gcp continually reviews its capital expenditures given changes in revenue predictions.
in closing, as we advance the overall performance of the company, we see great opportunities to improve our business and financial performance through revenue growth, cost efficiencies and process improvement. we are confident in our ability to perform well within the current impacts of the global pandemic and are highly focused on profitable growth. our balance sheet is strong and we continue to strengthen it over time, which will broaden our pool of opportunity to create value. we are also confident in the long-term fundamentals and dynamics of the construction markets globally and our ability to capture this opportunity.
with this, i'll turn it back over to simon.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, craig. thank you all for your time today. as the new ceo of gcp, i'm thrilled to be here. i believe there are great opportunities for the company and feel privileged to work alongside our talented employees to drive gcp forward. my goal is to be transparent, objective and to meet and exceed our commitments. we are telling you what we know now. we are striving to do better and as we have more clarity as the pandemic ends, we expect to be able to provide investors with a long-term outlook and vision for the future of gcp. thank you for joining our call and we look forward to taking any questions.

[operator instructions] today's first question comes from mike harrison with seaport global securities.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
hi good morning. simon, maybe we can start on the restructuring. gcp has been through multiple programs since becoming a public company. i'm sure you're aware of that. can you walk us through your approach to this restructuring? it seems like you're making a number of pretty major changes all at once. obviously, one of those being the relocation of the headquarters to the atlanta area. and maybe just talk about whether you -- your plan at this point is for this to be the last restructuring program that will be needed at gcp for a long time.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
mike, for future reference, all difficult questions to be directed at craig, please. no, i'm happy to answer that, mike. look, i think the data speaks for itself. and when we look at prior restructurings the company has done, they have not impacted the bottom line in the way we would want. so the restructuring is really built around our reorganization to the three principal geographies we operate in. and the idea really is to de-complicate the organization and push decision-making and accountability into the regions. that provides us with the opportunity to really de-complicate or un-complicate our corporate structure, which as -- from a g&a basis, has been a significant burden on the organization. and so we're trying to do two things. push decision-making or speed of decision-making and accountability locally, and we are trying to simplify our corporate structure. and moving to atlanta enables us to do that probably quicker and also enables us to refresh and build some more organizational capability. as to -- is it the last restructuring? i can't say that at this point, but i would suspect it's more of an iterative process and a gradual process from here on in as opposed to major restructuring programs. does that answer your question mike?
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
yes, that's very helpful. thank you. maybe just in terms of asia, i think you referenced that, that came in better than you anticipated. i know that as we look at last year, the pace of recovery in some of the countries where you operate has been slowed by covid and by restrictions on access, but it seems like that activity is picking up. what are you seeing there?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
i think there's a couple of things. as you may know, china is our most significant market in the apac region. secondly, one of our major production facilities is close to wuhan. and so, it would have been the part of our business that was most quickly impacted last year from the covid pandemic. and so i think what we are seeing is a faster post covid recovery in apac, particularly with strong revenues and -- coming from china and other countries in that region.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
and then the residential business, the 60 -- i believe you said 62% improvement in north america. can you walk through some of the product lines that drove that improvement? and i believe you mentioned some promotion timing, just maybe how should we think about the sustainability of that residential strength as we go into q2 and the rest of the year?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so the majority of our sbm business is in north america. and as you're aware, mike, we have three product lines: waterproofing, fireproofing and our roofing underlayment business. we saw a slowdown in commercial new construction in q1. and in terms of the project life cycle, our building envelope or waterproofing business is most quickly impacted. and so we did see a reduction in revenues for our building envelope business. our fireproofing business remained resilient that tends to be on -- operated different -- slightly different geographies, some differences in the type of projects. but actually, the fireproofing goes on much later in the project cycle. so those revenues remain robust.
and where we really saw the improvement was in our roofing underlayment business, which mike, as you're aware, is residential new construction and residential repair and remodel primarily. so strong residential market. yes, the timing of the winter buy, we moved for some of our customers out of q4 last year into q1 this year, which is more comfortable for the customers. and there was more time and attention spent on the sbm business from a production standpoint in q1, which partly accounts for the improvement in margin. so we would expect some continued challenges in sbm, north america this year for our building envelope business, but we have a strong project pipeline, and we just need to work that pipeline well. we would expect the residential business for the roofing underlayment to remain strong. and at the moment, the pipeline for fireproofing is also robust.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
and michael, maybe i'll just add that the bookings, our bookings for residential and -- are strong in april also. so april is strong and our bookings going into may are strong. so we do expect the residential or the underlayments to continue with good strength, and we see that. we're quite happy with that because that's an area where we struggled. as far as the product lines, most of it is the underlayments, the roofing underlayments and flashing, by core, some of the window flashing that we sell and those type of products that are kind of residential refit, redo those kind of products there. so they're really strong.
mike harrison -- seaport global securities -- analyst
alright. and then in the scc business, you mentioned that mix was a negative there. can you maybe give a little more color on what was going on with mix? and if that was a one-off or something that's going to be lasting longer into the year?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
so it was a little bit of a one-off as the asia market picked up. matter of fact, we had our strongest volumes in asia and latin america from a growth perspective year-over-year. they tend to have slightly lower gross margin than the north american european business. there's less operating cost under it, but they do have slightly lower gross margin. so that's where the mix came in. and we were pleasantly surprised in asia on how singapore, hong kong, china all came back, as simon mentioned. and so that kind of just offset us a little bit from our forecast and versus prior year.
operator
our next question today comes from rosemarie morbelli with g. research llc.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research llc -- analyst
thank you! good morning everyone.you mentioned that you were doing -- or you are seeing better trends on the commercial side. is this because of large projects picking up again? i mean, restarting, let me use the proper term, restarting? or is it that you are actually seeing new construction on the commercial side, which is kind of surprising, considering that there is a glut of office buildings and so on. so if you see a pick up, can you talk about the areas where you are actually seeing it?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yes. so yes, do you want to go, simon?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
sure, sure. for us, rosemarie last year for the sbm business in north america. we were most impacted in the northeast and the west coast. and that was a combination of some cancellations of projects and some postponements of projects. some areas of the country remain pretty robust in terms of their demand. we still saw a strong growth in the southeast and in texas, for example. in terms of our pipeline, we are seeing a number of projects restarting. and the northeast seems to be picking back up faster than the west coast. and we are seeing a combination in new york, for example, of projects restarting and new projects starting, which provides us with some optimism. and it remains to be seen. it's something that we manage very carefully and very closely, and we review monthly with our teams.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research llc -- analyst
could you talk about the percentage increase you are seeing on the raw material side and whether it is mostly a shortfall from raw material? or is it more of delivery issues on the transportation side? and then what type of price increases are you anticipating?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
so generally, we're looking at around 6% to 10% increases in raw materials, depending on the product line. i would say, sbm is more in the 4% to 7% on raw materials. scc tends to be up around the 10%, unfortunately. so we are going to have some margin compression on the scc side as we go through q2 and 3, and we're hoping to get that back on price in q4 and into q1 of next year. sbm has less inflation, although we have gone out for price for both globally, almost every product line. and generally, the prices have been anywhere from 3% on the low end, right up to 10% or 15% products like fibers on the polypropylene end. they got hit by oil, increased price and some supply chain issues. so some of those are 10% or 15% price or raw material increases. i would say we have a lot of different raw materials and a lot of unique products.
but in a general sense, i would say about half of it right now seems to be supply chain related, whether that's shortage because of covid-19 last year or that type of thing. and then the other half, i would say, is more of the dynamic of the industry with the oil prices up and just the streams coming in at a higher price to make the raw materials. so -- but i'm not an expert on that, but i would say probably for us, it's probably half and half. i would have expected about a 5% inflation. we forecasted 3% to give you an idea. so i would expect it maybe 5% at the top end. and unfortunately, it's somewhere between 6% and 10%. so our prices are in line with what the raw material increases are. i will say everybody has gone up for price increase. i think you've probably found it in your home life. i mean, prices are all going up everywhere, and everybody seems to be accepting that to some extent, the prices are going up. so that is a good sign that we think we will get the price. it's just a question of time.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research llc -- analyst
i was wondering also, if it is too early to -- for you to start looking at m&a. i mean, you ended the quarter with a positive net cash position, but you are also in the middle of doing a lot of things. so is -- when do you have time to look at m&a? or is it something that we would see more in -- toward the end of 2022 when the dust settles on all of your projects?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
so when we met with the board in january, and we highlighted some of the opportunities for the business, rosemarie. one of the opportunities is really to strengthen our product portfolio in north america. and really, we're prioritizing the sbm business because of the outlook for residential construction and also because of the significant margins that we earn in that business. so actually, we have been very active looking at the landscape, and we have two active targets we're considering, and i think it would be a great achievement for the business if we could close on one of those in 2021.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research llc -- analyst
and can you touch on the potential size of these opportunities? are we talking -- i mean, really substantial type of acquisitions or more of a bolt on?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
we're looking -- we've looked at a range, rosemarie, and that's about as far as i'm prepared to go in this conversation.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research llc -- analyst
can you talk about the range?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
i'd rather not.
rosemarie morbelli -- g. research llc -- analyst
and if you could give us an update, lastly on verifi, have you seen some pick up as the economies are reopening in north america, particularly the u.s.?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and the outlook for verifi from a revenue standpoint is very strong. that's partially because of the delay in fulfilling contracts that we signed in 2019, which are now being fulfilled as the various parts of the world come out of the pandemic. and partly because the significant interest in the product. and so, we would expect to see some very healthy growth in the revenues for verifi this year. and i think where it plays extremely well is both in driving productivity for the end user, but also driving sustainability and a demonstrable improvement in things like fuel, timing and co2 footprint. so we would expect the demand for verifi to remain robust.

and our next question today comes from laurence alexander with jefferies.
dan rizzo -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning. this is dan rizzo on for lawrence. how are you? you mentioned hiring in atlanta because it has a robust pipeline. i was just wondering just overall, given what we're seeing and hearing from others in terms of labor availability and labor costs. if you could provide color of just making things more difficult and what you expect going forward?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think, particularly in our manufacturing operations and particularly in north america, we've seen some significant challenges in recruitments for hourly folks and also for salaried folks within the operation. as regards more senior management, i think the war on talent is high. and therefore, we probably takes us a little bit longer than we want, but i would tell you, we have been very pleased with the quality of candidates that we've been able to hire over the last few months.
dan rizzo -- jefferies -- analyst
and then you mentioned a little bit about sustainability. i was wondering just in terms of the push for energy efficiency in buildings, what could that -- what that can mean to you guys in the coming years, particularly for, i guess, for your sbm business with, i guess, the wind business? or waterproofing just everything really?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yes. when i think about the image and the positioning of gcp, i think there's a much, much stronger story for us to tell around sustainability. and that goes for our scc business, where we just talked about verifi. but also, for example, our cement additives, have proven improvements to drive a reduction in co2, i think we could do a better job of highlighting and selling that. and as we think about our sbm business, i have in my mind, we would be proofing structures and proofing against the elements, but also driving energy efficiency through the system and the products that we sell. so i think we can do a better job of promoting it, but i think we also have to do some infill in terms of our sbm product range to be able to push that better.
operator
our next question today comes from chris shaw with monness, crespi.
chris shaw -- monness, crespi. -- analyst
hi good morning everyone, how are you doing? i wanted to follow-up, i guess, on the answer you had given to one of rosemarie's questions about some of the pockets of strength in commercial construction. i think you specifically talked about the northeast, but they were seeing some new projects. i mean, i guess, in general, i'm trying to figure out where -- looking forward, where there might eventually be some pick up in commercial construction and just having a hard time figuring out what area that might be. and you were saying there were some new projects that were actually getting -- coming on board, i think, in the northeast. and what's your sense at what areas are those coming from? because i can't -- unless there's going to be a large, obviously, government infrastructure spill or spending outside of that. obviously, rosemarie mentioned office should be pretty weak. i would think a lot of the other institutions like universities, hospitals would be undergoing some large projects right now. i mean with the projects that you're seeing that are new? were they pre-funded i mean i just -- i'm trying to sense what might be coming back first in commercial construction, looking forward, i don't know, 12, 18 months in north america, specifically, i guess.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yes. look, i think there's a combination. and i think everybody would have some skepticism about office space in the near future. but we are seeing projects that were postponed, be -- coming back online. but we are also seeing that the healthcare sector, the federal sector. and for example, some elements of infrastructure such as data centers, that there is a robust pipeline of new work coming through. and we've had to shift our focus as an organization into moving away from maybe what may be our more traditional targets and segments to those segments that are growing.
chris shaw -- monness, crespi. -- analyst
and then just looking at the scc business, it's hard to tell, and you guys told a little bit of the story, but just looking at the numbers from this quarter, it's hard to tell what the progress that is being made there. obviously, margins came down, some of that was mix, some of that sounds like volume deleveraging. sales were strong in asia and latin america, but some of the -- it sounded asia, you had an easy comp versus maybe covid last year. i mean, what should we be -- it's just not coming through the numbers. what should -- what do you want to tell there that's really happening that we should be excited about going forward with that business?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
well, i'll answer that, chris. we did have a little weaker january, february in north america than what we wanted. so hence, the reason why the mix, not just the latin america and asia coming up, but we had less demand in february because of texas. and i think we mentioned that on the call actually the last call for the q4 call. and then we got a little bit of volume back in march. so that's why the mix was a little bit different than we expected, but that doesn't answer your question. long-term question is, we've done quite a bit of work actually on the pipeline and working with our sales management team globally, to work on getting some of our share back or at least starting to gain share.
as you know, we were soft in that area for -- with scc. we did a lot of work around exiting countries and then getting the margin up over the past couple of years, which we've done by a couple of hundred basis points. and now, we have to work on getting share. so we have had some small wins recently on that. we had one in canada. we had one recently in asia in april against some of our competitors. so i think we'd like to get a little more stabilization of the revenue going forward. so we can have a little more consistency in that business moving forward on the volumes.
and then there is quite a bit of productivity in that area on freight, freight lanes, formulation relative to the inflation that's coming through. and so i think we've made some changes there. we've got salesforce in as a pipeline management tool, and we've got some -- a little bit change. simon's changed some of the structure on the sales side. and i think the regional structure is going to help too in the stabilization of those revenues.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yes. look, i think each geography has different elements and different challenges, be it from a competitive sets or kind of its product portfolio. i would say, broadly, where historically, the organization has done well is in the cement additives that we have a highly competitive offering from a product standpoint and from a technical knowledge standpoint. and i am pleased at the progress that we are making there, globally. and i see us growing share this year. when it comes to the concrete additives, it's quite different by geography. latin america, i've been super impressed by the team in latin america, both stabilizing share. and i think we'll see growth of share in latin america this year. i think in north america, on the concrete additives, the team has done well over the last year or two in stabilizing share.
i think what's crucial in north america as we build out our product portfolio, and we get back on the front foot and get more competitive and enable share take. i think the -- historically, where we've been most challenged on the concrete additive side is in europe and bringing a new team on board in europe in terms of gary dee joining. we'd like to see that we get back on the front foot, in particular, on the concrete additives side and get more competitive. we have very good products broadly. we have fantastic technical support and technical knowledge. and i think it's down to us to be more competitive in front of the customer and go get some of that share back.
chris shaw -- monness, crespi. -- analyst
and then just a quick one. both segments had a slight decline in pricing. i know you're going after pricing. is it just -- does it just take too long? i mean, i thought we'd be a little bit in the first quarter. is it just too slow in the way the business works to have seen that, any sort of price increases in the first quarter?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yes. most of our price went out to take effect in april. so we didn't expect to see much price in q1, honestly. so it's just a timing. and then we're wanting to see it in q2. we'll see the most price in q3 and 4. that's just more of a timing and when we went out. we did go out early on cement. but sometimes, that takes a little while, it probably takes thirty or sixty days to take in effect. so we haven't seen a lot of that in q1 either.

good day, and welcome to the gcp applied technologies first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to betsy cowell. please go ahead.
betsy cowell -- investor relations
thank you, operator. hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. with us on the call are simon bates, president and chief executive officer; and craig merrill, chief financial officer. our earnings release and corresponding presentation slides for this quarter's results are available on our website. to download copies of the presentation, please go to gcpat.com and click on the investor tab. some of our comments today will include forward-looking statements under u.s. federal securities laws. actual results may differ materially from those projected or implied due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the impacts of covid-19.
please see a full description of information used in forward-looking statements in our earnings release. we will discuss certain non-gaap financial measures, which are described in more detail in our earnings release and on our website. our comments on forward-looking statements and non-gaap financial measures apply both to the prepared remarks and to the q&a. references to ebitda refer to adjusted ebitda, references to ebit refer to adjusted ebit, and references to margin refer to adjusted gross margin, adjusted ebitda margin or adjusted ebit margin as defined in our press release. all revenues and associated growth rates in this discussion are stated on a comparable constant currency basis, which adjusts for the impact of foreign currency.
i will now turn the call over to simon.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, betsy. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. as i've said in our previous discussions, we continue to work on our key objectives for gcp. first is improving our customer focus and delivering high-quality products and great service. this is essential to stabilizing market share and revenues. second, we have to build our organizational capability to help reduce complexity and improve our cost position. third, we have to drive accountability for improving performance across the organization. and fourth, we have to improve our return on the cash we invest in the business. greg and i would like to discuss some changes and some progress that we have made in delivering on these objectives over the last few months.
as we announced in march, we have reorganized our business around three geographies: the americas, europe, including the middle east and asia pacific. we believe this creates more focus and accountability and allows us to simplify our corporate structure. as part of this change, i would like to welcome [indecipherable] gary dee, who started as our leader for europe and the middle east. gary has a great track record of improving performance and growing revenues. we also announced the relocation of our corporate headquarters to the metro atlanta area following the sale of the cambridge facility last year. we believe that metro atlanta will provide us with access to a diverse talent pool to enable us to build our new team and improve performance.
we are busy recruiting in atlanta and have already filled a number of key roles. therefore, i'd also like to welcome sherry monange who will start next week as our new chief of human resources. she will be instrumental in helping us build our organizational capability and improve our processes for performance and talent management. our u.s.-based research and development group will remain in the greater boston area so that we can retain key talent and drive continuity. however, we would like to see a greater return on our significant investment in r&d globally. and therefore, i am also very pleased to announce that dr. amy randall will join us next week as our new global head of r&d and product development.
in conjunction with relocating our headquarters, we announced the restructuring program aimed at reducing our general and administrative costs, but we still have further work to do to eliminate complexity and duplication. as mentioned, the regional structure is designed to push accountability and decision-making to our local leaders who are closest to the markets and the customers they serve. we have also hired chris scocos as head of operations for north america. he has responsibility for customer service, manufacturing and supply chain. through these changes, we expect to better service our customers, improve productivity, enhance our innovation platform and improve profitability and cash flow.
although we have more to do, we are beginning to see changes within our organization, and it has translated into some positive momentum. we would like to thank betsy cowell for supporting gcp in the investor relations role over the last year. i would also like to welcome will kent as our new vice president of investor relations, who is with us today. in summary, we continue to move forward with our plans to repair and rebuild gcp, providing a clear path to stabilize revenue, growing both the top line and the bottom line organically and inorganically.
i'd now like to turn the call over to greg. greg?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
thank you, simon. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. as a reminder, all sales and associated growth rates in my comments are on a constant currency basis. i will discuss gcp's preliminary first quarter results, including comments on each of our business segments. lastly, i will provide commentary on second quarter and a general outlook for the year. starting with the preliminary first quarter financial results. gcp's constant currency sales of $219.6 million were 1.3% higher than prior year. while volumes were soft at the beginning of the quarter, demand did pick up in march. quarterly revenue growth was driven by strong residential sales due to demand for our roofing products and timing of promotional activity. sales volumes improved in both asia and latin america as construction activity improved versus the negative impacts of the pandemic in the first quarter of 2020.
commercial construction activity in north america and europe continued to be constrained, which we expected, where we saw a decline in revenues in our product lines versus first quarter 2020. price for the quarter was essentially flat compared to first quarter 2020 coming off a deflationary 2020. however, gcp's gross margin increased 60 basis points to 38.8%, primarily due to operational productivity, partially offset by product and geographic mix. selling, general and administrative costs of $66.6 million decreased 2% during the quarter due to a favorable net effect of the shareholder activism expenses in 2020, q1 and lower employee-related costs resulting from restructuring programs. gcp's income from continuing operations attributable to gcp shareholders totaled $1.5 million compared with $2 million for the first quarter 2020.
the reduction of $0.5 million was due to additional restructuring costs and tax expense, partially offset by higher gross margin and lower general and administrative costs. gcp's adjusted ebit, shown on page seven of the earnings presentation, totaled $16.9 million compared to $15.4 million in prior year quarter, up approximately 10%. adjusted ebit margin improved 50 basis points to 7.6% attributable to higher sbm operating income, partially offset by lower scc operating income. adjusted ebitda margin was 12.7% for the first quarter or 50 basis points higher versus the same period in 2020. net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during the first quarter 2021 was approximately $700,000 compared to $14.3 million for 2020.
the timing of sales with a strong march adversely affected accounts receivable performance versus prior year, and inventory increased during the quarter to support march and q2 sales volumes. prebuys were also instituted on raw material inventories once we expected higher prices in q2 and q3 on raw materials. first quarter is generally our weakest cash generation quarter, and we do not expect this to impact our cash performance for the full year. looking at the specific performance of our two segments for the first quarter on pages eight and nine. scc's constant currency sales were down approximately 2.1% to $122.8 million, attributable to lower sales volumes in north america and europe, partially offset by stronger sales volumes in latin america and asia pacific. asia pacific demand for our products exceeded our expectations as the market had a strong quarter as chinese new year and other holidays were shortened due to the covid-19 restrictions.
we expect north america demand to progressively improve as the market opens up in the second half of 2021, and our year-over-year north america comparisons will improve for scc as we move through the year. commercial construction activity continues to be spotty across europe. however, we are pleased with march's activity and performance. scc's gross margin declined year-over-year by 140 basis points to 36.6% during the first quarter 2021 due to the unfavorable impacts of product mix, partially offset by lower costs resulting in improved productivity. scc gross margins will be unfavorably impacted throughout the year in comparison to 2020 due to the inflation headwinds in raw material prices globally. scc segment operating income was $6.1 million, with segment operating margin of 4.9%, a decrease of 190 basis points compared with the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower gross margins on volume leverage.
turning now to the sbm segment for the quarter. sbm sales, constant currency totaled $96.8 million during the first quarter, a 6% improvement versus the first quarter of 2020. north america residential sales increased 62% due to strong roofing demands and the timing of promotion activities. building envelope and specialty construction products volumes declined due to lower commercial construction activity. we do expect improvements in these product lines as we move through the year while at a modest pace. sbm's gross margin increased 290 basis points to 41.9% compared to the first quarter of 2020 due to improved raw material utilization, operations efficiencies and higher sales volumes favorably impacting fixed cost absorption. sbm segment operating income totaled $19.4 million with operating margins at 19.6%, a 420 basis point improvement versus prior year.
the improvement was due mainly to higher gross margins. now looking forward to the second quarter. we remain positive on our product offerings to the residential end markets, and we see signs of commercial activity improvement as financing remains favorable. construction activity resumes on these larger projects and social distancing requirements are relaxed as vaccinations ramp up. in addition, revenue comparisons between the second quarter of 2021 and the second quarter of 2020, favor 2021 due to the onset of the pandemic across the globe in 2020. as in prior discussions, our best views are short-term in nature, and we are pleased with the demand for our products in april and our bookings, which have been solid throughout the first part of the second quarter. based upon today's best information, we estimate gcp will be up in revenues for the second quarter 2021 year-over-year by approximately 25% in constant currency and adjusted ebit is expected to approximately double in the second quarter 2021 versus second quarter 2020.
as mentioned during the march earnings call, we expect inflation to impact the second quarter and the second half of 2021. in response, we have announced price increases in all of our product lines and have shifted prioritization to materials and logistics productivity. price will start to come through in q2, but to a lesser degree than q3 and q4 as contracts and project committed pricing rolls over as we move through the year. gross margins will compress in the latter half of quarter two and in quarter three versus prior year and then stabilize in quarter four as price absorption catches up with the inflation impact. the impacts on gross margins will have a slightly more unfavorable impact on the scc segment versus the sbm segment. we expect to overcome current inflation trends with price by the end of the first half of 2022.
adjusted ebit and ebitda margins, even with the compressed gross margins should end the year approximately equal to prior year, with the support of price and volume leverage overcoming the inflation impacts on margin by the fourth quarter. operating expenses for the second quarter of 2021 will be slightly higher versus prior year due to the timing of incentive compensation costs and the rent for the cambridge facility. full year 2021 operating expenses are expected to be approximately flat with the same period 2020 as the announced restructuring program in march mostly impacts 2022 with a $10 million to $12 million reduction in operating expenses expected in 2022. we will continue to place significant emphasis on cash generation and expect results on operating cash metrics similar to 2020. capital expenditures for the year 2021 are on track to be approximately 4% of sales, consistent with spending levels in 2020 and much lower than 2018 and 2019.
in closing, we remain on track to our original 2021 planned financial performance objectives and have implemented a number of management actions to overcome the newly forecast impacts of higher global inflation on raw materials and logistics. over the past six months, we have identified significant opportunities within the core business to drive efficiencies related to an overall improvement in business process, freight optimization, sales pipeline management and manufacturing productivity. our strong balance sheet will continue to strengthen throughout the year and is providing significant flexibility and opportunity to deliver on our short- and long-term objectives, focused on growth and value, both organically and inorganically to create shareholder value.
with that, i now will turn it back over to simon.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, greg, and thank you all for the time today. although we see some significant cost inflation for the rest of the year, we are pleased with the progress we have made on our objectives and our plans for 2021. implementing positive change will continue to be our primary focus, and we intend to be transparent on our progress with you, our employees, investor community and our shareholders. our goal is to make gcp a stronger and more competitive company.
thank you for joining our call, and we look forward to taking any questions.

[operator instructions] the first question comes from steven martin from monness crespi. please go ahead steven.
chris shaw -- monness crespi -- analyst
can you hear me? it's chris shaw. i don't know where steven martin came from.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yes, sorry, we just -- i don't know if we couldn't hear you so.
chris shaw -- monness crespi -- analyst
again, this is chris shaw from monness, crespi. i'm not sure where the name steve martin came from.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
we had a strange musical, but we're back.
chris shaw -- monness crespi -- analyst
i guess just -- i kind of wanted to just get a better idea of the state of the industry in terms of maybe demand, volumes. i mean, if you look back, your sales are still below, say 2019 levels for the same period. and i assume there's been some pricing inflation in there over time. so volume is probably down since then. and just where are we on the trajectory of the recovery and sort of commercial restruction? and where do you see it coming from there? and just get back to 2019 levels by next year? or is the industry depressed for some other reason that i'm not seeing right now?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yes. chris, it's craig. and simon probably will want to weigh in. but just on compared for the gcp comparables, the 2019 would have had some of the exit country revenue in it. so it's tough to compare our 2019 to 2021 specifically because we were still running through some exit country in 2019. but on the general industry, i think if you look at the data, which we stay pretty close to, you are seeing -- 2019 was the most, the highest construction spend. that was the peak of the construction spend historically. and we're a little shy, i think, globally on that, on the trajectory going through to the end of the year, global construction spend. and then there was the expectation that in 2022, you would match the 2019. i think construction spend this year is estimated to be at 5% globally. that includes china, 5.1% i think, was the last look. but with that bump versus prior year and plus 2022, where commercial and infrastructure is expected to come back, not only for the u.s. infrastructure bill, but around the world as projects start to get back on track from the covid-19 and some spending that you would get back to 2019 levels. i hope that helps.
chris shaw -- monness crespi -- analyst
it does also -- do you know -- globally, i know obviously u.s., but are there sort of recovery project or recovery incentives in other economies where it's like another infrastructure program basically around in other countries? is that the kind of thing that people are doing to recover out of covid, just like the u.s.? or is it sort of u.s.-centric in terms of that's a big government spending coming out of covid?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
no. i think some of the other countries may be behind on the organization of that, but they are discussing it. i know europe is having discussions, and i heard mexico is having discussions. unfortunately, at this time, it's tough to implement because of the situation in the covid-19. u.s. is probably the first out of the box other than china is continuing to try to manage that as they always do. so we foresee in the future that europe and some of the latin america countries will start to use their funds as they need to, to invest in infrastructure in the economies. because they've lost kind of a -- if you think about it, they've almost lost 1.5 years of investment there, and that's not really appropriate.
chris shaw -- monness crespi -- analyst
and then can you just remind me the sort of philosophy around potential buybacks and such? i know you obviously have a good balance sheet, you create cash flow. you haven't bought any shares back in a while. so i can't remember what you normally said.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yeah, we approved $100 million buyback up to $100 million. we never specifically said when we were going to do it, of course, we're still monitoring that. of course, we're balancing our balance sheet with m&a opportunities and other opportunities. so we're working through that. so that's still on the table. we just got to work through it on the balance of what other opportunities in m&a there are there versus sending back to shareholders.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yes, chris, it's an ongoing dialogue and something we discuss with the board on a quarterly basis. i would go back to your question around -- you're looking for transparency on the global markets and the relative movements of construction. and it's very hard for us to give you that transparency because each of the geographies is moving at different rates. and quite honestly, it's been a little bit stop-start and what's seen, in particular, in asia pacific, where as we come out of the pandemic, we've then gone back in some of our key markets into a much more controlled environment and a slowdown in construction activity. so it is a mixed bag. i can tell you broadly, when we look at north america, we continue to see strong residential new construction. commercial new construction is slightly down year-over-year, but we've seen some positive signs of recovery in the northeast and on the west coast. and there's also some share gains that we've achieved during the year. so it's hard for us to really give you that transparency. it is a mixed bag by geography and by segment.
chris shaw -- monness crespi -- analyst
got it, thanks a lot.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
thanks chris.

the next question comes from jeff bronchick from cove street capital. please go ahead jeff.
jeff bronchick -- cove street capital -- analyst
good morning everybody. just a quick question. it was mentioned in the prepared remarks, and there was a reference to achieving long-term goals and shareholder value and all that good stuff through organic and inorganic needs. is the word in organic a, is that a stock investor relations? or is that a new inclusion? and are you guys actively looking at things outside of internal improvement?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yes. jeff, it's simon. yes, we absolutely are, we have that excellent situation on our balance sheet. and we do believe there are some opportunities to strategically grow and supplement our competitive position through the right m&a.
jeff bronchick -- cove street capital -- analyst
now simon, it's not fair to bust your chops because you're relatively new, but maybe this is a total and board inclusion. but do you think the company has demonstrated the operational confidence to actually engage in m&a vis-a-vis, and i get it, it's a consolidating industries that building materials, etc. why do you think that you're capable of doing and have earned the right from the shareholder base, which has not been terribly happy with how many x years to do that vis-a-vis quite the opposite? there's plenty of people out there running around who we're paying outlandish multiples for businesses like yours. maybe discuss that as a concept?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
i'd say you're preaching to the converted and often the phrase i use is internally is earning the right to grow, that we have to demonstrate, we have the capability and from a management standpoint, that if we were to consider and do some deals, we've got to be absolutely sure we have the internal capabilities to properly integrate those businesses. i do believe we are building out that capability. i would say based on scale, we have more capability around that in north america currently, and we're building out that capability in our other geographies. but point taken, and it's very clear and any m&a we would do, we would be very disciplined about the right m&a and the right multiples.

thanks, will. good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. we continue to make substantial progress during the quarter on our strategic priorities of building out our organizational capability and making the right investments to improve our overall competitiveness so that we can grow our revenues and profit margins. i'd also like to note that i have received several questions from our customers' investments on our commitment to the environment. gcp has a very powerful sustainability story. our construction chemicals and verifi business reduced the co2 footprint for our customers every day. our building products form an envelope against fire, moisture, vapor and air, making them more energy-efficient and extending the lives of the buildings constructed. you'll hear more about our exciting sustainability story going forward.
i do consider this year to be one of the tougher working environments that i have experienced. why do i say that? well, we have multiple daily interruptions in our supply chain for raw materials, packaging and transportation, and we have an incredibly tight labor market impacting all our regions. this is exacerbated by significant input cost inflation and the continued challenges from the covid-19 pandemic. therefore, i really want to acknowledge and thank the gcp team on delivering very solid results for the second quarter. these results were achieved through the hard work of all of our employees who have kept their focus on meeting customers' needs despite their daily challenges. given this backdrop and the strategic changes that we, as a management team are making to the business, our folks should be very proud that we delivered the strongest first half performance since 2018.
moving on to our strategic objectives. as in past calls, we believe it is important to discuss some progress that we continue to make. building organizational capability is imperative to our success, and i wanted to highlight that we hired david campos this past week to run our scc business for north and south america. david is originally from colombia and has a management degree from mit and a long track record of success in the roles and industries he has operated in. we welcome david and know that he will bring a fresh perspective to our business, and will focus on improving the level of service to our customers, enhancing our product portfolio and growing the revenue and profitability of our scc business in the americas. as part of our focus on investing to win, we continue to progress with the relocation of our headquarters to the metro atlanta area, which we announced in march.
we will be partially operational at our new headquarters in q3 this year and fully staffed in q1 next year. this move will improve our competitiveness and reduce our g&a costs. we expect to end all of our business activities at our current cambridge location in september and to complete the move of our r&d and technical support groups to our new metro boston location by the end of this year. our new r&d space will be a significant improvement in design and space allocation and will foster collaboration and most importantly, innovation. before turning the call over to craig, i'd like to spend some additional time on what we see in our global markets. while our second quarter results were quite good, we and our competitors and most other industries are facing a barrage of ongoing business disruptions, whether it be labor or raw material shortages, price increases or logistical challenges.
of most concern is our ability to mitigate the cost inflation we forecast for the second half of this year. we have announced multiple price increases in all regions to offset these impacts and have an extensive global program to drive productivity improvements that we review weekly. however, inflation is currently moving ahead of our mitigating actions, and we expect margin compression in q3 and q4 as our actions have not yet caught up to the costs. despite the near-term challenges, we believe the strategic actions we are taking are reflected in the improvement in the first half results for revenue and profit. i'd now like to turn the call over to craig.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
thank you, simon. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. as a reminder, all sales and associated growth rates in my comments are on a constant currency basis. i will discuss gcp's second quarter results, including comments on each of our business segments. and lastly, i will provide commentary with a general outlook for the second half of 2021. before i get started, i want to give you a brief update on our progress with respect to the remediation of the year-end material weaknesses identified in our 2020 10-k. the summary progress to-date is outlined in our 2021 10-q quarter two report. in addition to engaging an outside financial and compliance consulting firm to support the development and redesign of a number of our financial controls, we have hired a new north american controller and a new sox financial leader based in atlanta during quarter two.
both have significant experience in their respective roles and experience with public company accounting and compliance requirements. we continue to resource the remediation efforts with the highest priority, and we will update you on progress as we move through the year. now moving to the second quarter financial results. gcp's constant currency sales of $244.8 million were 25.3% higher than prior year, generally in line with our expectations as we saw higher volumes from increased construction activity globally. this activity drove revenue growth in all regions. price for the quarter improved 1.2% compared with second quarter 2020 as price started to come through from our actions. gcp's gross margin decreased 290 basis points to 36.7% as higher raw material and logistic costs started to ramp-up at a higher rate than our q2 forecast.
selling and general administration costs of $64.2 million decreased approximately 3% during the quarter and were in line with our expectations due to a favorable net effect of the shareholder activism expenses in q2 2020 and lower employee-related costs resulting from restructuring. these impacts were partially offset by higher employee incentive compensation costs, in line with higher revenue and profit in the first and second quarter of 2021 and higher facility costs related to the cambridge corporate headquarters. gcp's income from continuing operations attributable to gcp shareholders totaled $10.4 million compared with a negative $700,000 loss for second quarter 2020. the increase was primarily attributable to higher gross profit due to volumes. gcp's adjusted ebit totaled $26.9 million compared with $14 million in prior year quarter, up approximately 92%.
adjusted ebit margin improved 340 basis points to 10.6% due to higher scc and higher sbm operating income. adjusted ebitda margin was 15% for the second quarter were 180 basis points higher versus the same period in 2020 and our best second quarter margin performance since 2017. net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during the second quarter 2021 was $20.3 million compared with $5.6 million for 2020. we had strong collections in the quarter sequentially and versus prior year, which helped offset higher inventories as we work through the significant supply chain disruptions globally. and we have decided to carry increased inventory levels to better service our customers during this time. our capital spending for the quarter was within forecast range at $6.8 million and down approximately 30% versus prior year of $9.6 million.
year-to-date, we are at $21 million of net cash provided by operating activities versus $20 million year-to-date prior year. now looking at the specific performance of our two segments for the second quarter. scc's constant currency sales were up approximately 20.5% to $139.7 million due to higher sales volumes. all regions grew with strong revenues year-over-year, specifically around global cement products, ductilcrete and our latin america and european businesses with share gains in certain categories and countries. however, scc's gross margin declined year-over-year by 330 basis points to 36.1% in the second quarter due to higher raw material costs, partially offset by improved operational productivity and price. scc gross margins will be unfavorably impacted throughout the remainder of the year in comparison to 2020 due to the inflation headwinds in raw material prices globally as our price increases will take time to overcome the impacts throughout the remainder of the year.
scc segment operating income was $15.3 million, with segment operating margin of 10.6%, an increase of 200 basis points compared with the prior year quarter due to higher sales volumes, positively impacting operating leverage, partially offset by lower gross margin. turning to the sbm segment for the quarter. sbm sales, constant currency, totaled $105.1 million during the second quarter, a 32.2% improvement versus the second quarter 2020. north america residential roofing demand strength continued, supporting our residential product group with revenues up 41% year-over-year. global commercial and infrastructure projects ramped up and our building envelope product group revenues were up 29%, including stirling lloyd products, up 82%. our specialty construction products group revenues were up 34%, including our injections products, up 61% and our fireproofing product revenues up 31%, all versus prior year quarter two.
we have made good progress in improving our overall customer service, specifically in north america, specialty building materials segment, focused on customer service with an improvement in on-time and in full shipments to our customers. sbm's gross margin decreased 240 basis points to 38.1% compared with the second quarter of 2020 due to higher raw material costs. sbm's segment operating income totaled $19.9 million, with operating margins at 18.3%, a 370 basis point improvement versus prior period year. the improvement was due to higher sales volume, resulting in improved operating leverage. now looking forward to the third quarter and beyond. due to the current supply chain disruptions globally, impacting the construction market, particularly the commercial and infrastructure markets, we now believe our third quarter volumes will be approximately flat to prior year.
although the demand is strong, we do believe in the short term, construction projects will be impacted by the supply disruptions as the projects will struggle to ramp at the same speed they did in q2. as an example, the gcp supply chain has been impacted by 28 force majeure declarations by our vendors globally year-to-date and 14 force majeures continue to be in place as of the end of q2. we are holding increased inventories to support our customers' demand. however, we continue to expect a volatile supply dynamic within the global construction supply chain over the next two quarters. by the end of the year, we expect the supply chain disruptions to ease, and we see solid opportunities in both the commercial and infrastructure markets globally in 2022, including favorable impacts from a u.s. infrastructure bill, which will positively impact certain specialty building material product lines and our specialty construction chemicals segment.
until then, we expect our gross margins in the second half to compress as raw material and freight inflation continued to impact financial performance in the short term. price increases have been implemented. however, it will take a couple of quarters for price to overcome inflation. due to the significant inflation, adjusted ebit is expected to be approximately 30% lower in quarter three versus prior year, all due to lower gross margins based on our current inflation forecast, partially offset by price. the impacts on gross margins are expected to be more unfavorable on the scc segment versus the sbm segment as approximately 2/3 of our inflation is impacting our scc segment. sg&a expenses for both the third quarter of 2021 and the full year will be approximately flat to prior year.
our announced restructuring program in march will mostly impact 2022 with a $10 million to $12 million reduction in operating expenses expected in 2022. our expense management and restructuring programs remain on track. cash management is a priority, and we are on track to our forecast. our capital expenditures will continue to be lower versus historical trends. and although inventories are higher due to the inflation impacts on raw materials, we are seeing the benefits of our investments in technology, which are supporting accounts payable and accounts receivable working capital performance, which is helping to deliver on our working capital targets. in closing, we are very pleased with our progress on revenues as we expect to end the year up 6% to 8% higher in revenues versus prior year, with a more focused approach on our customer requirements.
we expect our ebit and ebitda to be up versus prior year full year, driven by higher volumes, leverage and lower costs, excluding incentives. however, the benefits of the organization's strategic initiatives over the past year are expected to be partially offset versus our original year forecast due to the increased material and freight inflation. in closing, our strong balance sheet will continue to strengthen throughout the year and is providing flexibility and opportunity to deliver shareholder value, whether it be m&a or capital return to shareholders were a combination as we focus on growth and value, both organically and inorganically. thank you. and now i'll turn it back to simon.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, greg, and thank you all for your time today. we are very pleased with the progress that the business has made in the first half of the year. and once again, my thanks to our employees who focus on the customer every day despite the unusual challenges that 2021 has brought. although we forecast margin compression for the rest of the year, we estimate that without the significant impact of cost inflation that our trajectory was to grow profitability by approximately 15% year-over-year, a testament to all of our hard work. our primary focus remains on implementing positive change, and we intend to maintain our transparent dialogue with all of our stakeholders. our goal is to make gcp a stronger and more competitive company. and clearly, our cash position gives us tremendous optionality, as greg mentioned, both organically and through acquisitions.
thank you all for joining our call, and we look forward to taking any questions.

[operator instructions] today's first question comes from mike harrison with seaport research partners. please proceed.
mike harrison -- seaport research partners -- analyst
hi, good morning.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
good morning.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, mike.
mike harrison -- seaport research partners -- analyst
i was wondering if you could talk first about the volume impact that you saw related to supply chain disruption, raw material availability and maybe even labor shortages or labor availability and maybe kind of parse that out between the scc segment and sbm. i guess the question is, how much higher could volumes have been, if not for these disruption impacts?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
mike, i think it's a good question. it's not something we formally capture or calculate. but i can tell you, be it from a production standpoint with the inability to get raw materials or having to switch to alternate raw materials, with the challenges of getting labor in some of our facilities, the inability at times to source materials in a timely manner that is coming across an ocean. we've also seen, as we've tried to ship product, a lack of trucks that are available. and so i would tell you, mike, those supply chain disruptions have impacted our volumes in every geography that we operate. these aren't limited or different, honestly, by geography and has equally impacted both the sbm and the scc segment.
mike harrison -- seaport research partners -- analyst
all right. and then on the price versus cost front, maybe just talk about how you see that trending over the next few quarters. any thoughts on do we expect to see peak margin headwinds and when we might expect to see some margin recovery?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yes. michael, it's craig. i'm going to give you a little bit more detail here just on the numbers. so we generally had about $25 million worth of freight raw material inflation in the quarter. we mitigated about half of that through price productivity and our sg-and-a efforts. and you'll see that in the margin basically. if you just use those numbers, that's the margin drop. unfortunately, we expect that to continue into q4. so really sequentially, i think the margins are going to be about the same. the inflation is going to be about the same. we are going to get a little bit more price. so we're working to do a little more favorable into q4. honestly, most of it is around scc. that's where we've got the challenges.
on scc, normally, in history, we've been able to formulate around and use different materials. one material goes up, another one is neutralized. we change it out, and we formulate. unfortunately, with the tsunami of price increases and supply chain disruptions, you can't get the product that you want to switch into properly or the freight has gone up or the cost has gone up. so that's where we've been challenged on scc. that's a temporary issue. our business model is really strong in formulation. and where we've been hampered there, that's why the scc margins have come down more than we would like them to, obviously, and more than historical even when we've had inflation like this. so we're working through that. and once the supply chain disruptions ease a little bit and stabilize over the next -- probably by the end of the year, we're hoping into next year, we'll start to grab back those margins in scc.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
and just talk a little bit about our sbm segment. clearly, for our waterproofing, building envelope business and our fireproof business, these are job-driven contract-driven. and consequently, your pricing is specific to a job. and generally, and our peers would be in the same situation, you're looking at a three- to four-month drag on the ability to move price specific to the next job. having said all of that, we did announce global price increases at the beginning of october for our sbm business, and we will be doing the same again in january.
mike harrison -- seaport research partners -- analyst
all right. and then as it relates to the sg-and-a line, those costs appear to be down quite a bit sequentially. you mentioned the restructuring actions that you've taken, but i think also you mentioned in the press release some changes in incentive accrual. so i wanted to get a sense of how much of that sg-and-a reduction is sustainable? and what portion of it might be related to some true-up of accruals?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yes. some is definitely a true-up of some incentive accruals. listen, it's sustainable. we accelerated some of our moves on our operating expense reduction. so it is sustainable. i think you won't get any further lift, i think, in q4, honestly, because we are starting to -- we've got the atlanta office that we're now in, that's what we're speaking from right now, honestly. so i think we're probably flat in q4 with any -- with no further uplift. but we will roll over. we haven't even got fully, michael, the benefit of all of the cambridge rent. for next year, we'll get that benefit because that's certainly more expensive than the atlanta rent, including the r-and-d facility in wilmington. we'll get the benefit of a number of actions we've taken in the second half here with reduction in headcount. during the year, by the time we end up at the end of the year, we'll be down in g-and-a 100 headcounts approximately, which will roll over and help us next year, even if we have to put back some incentive next year as we roll through the year. so we'll be net positive, and we're looking good on those programs.
mike harrison -- seaport research partners -- analyst
all right. and then my last question for now has to do with a comment that you made about reducing sales into china to limit your credit risk. can you give us a little bit more detail on, i guess, how you're viewing risk within that environment given some of the issues that have been in the headlines recently?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yes. so payment terms in china for -- most of those on the phone probably know it. it's almost between half a year to a year, depending on what customer you're working with. we're just kind of in the middle of that. so i won't get into the details. so we're kind of split right down the middle of that terms. so we thought it more prudent with all the issues going on. we have some developers we sell to. there's one that's fairly into the situation that you read about. and so we've restricted any more volumes to that developer until we get some payment. and so we lost about $3 million to $3.5 million worth of revenue, and we'll probably lose a little bit more in q4. it could be $5 million in q4 on a year-over-year rep, but we think that's the prudent thing to do. we're not nervous we're not going to get paid. we've got some other customers that are paying us very well, and we're selling to them. and in fact, stirling lloyd product has been being sold there, and we've really increased those sales in china. but that particular developer, we're just holding back and giving up some volume until we get payment. so we can give you a further update on the next call once we work through it. does that answer your question, michael?
mike harrison -- seaport research partners -- analyst
yes, it does. go ahead.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
maybe i give a bit more color from my perspective, mike. there's three revenue streams in china, stirling lloyd business, our fireproofing business and our waterproofing business. we're seeing year-over-year growth in our fireproofing and our stirling lloyd business. this particular issue impacts our building envelope, our waterproofing business. and i think we've taken a strong stance in terms of protecting our credit risk, and there is a short-term impact to our revenues, but i emphasize the short term.
mike harrison -- seaport research partners -- analyst
just one more layer of the challenges you have to deal with. thanks very much. i'll turn it back for now.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, mike.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer

our next question comes from rosemarie morbelli with gabelli and company. please proceed.
rosemarie morbelli -- gabelli and company -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everyone.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
good morning, rosemarie.
rosemarie morbelli -- gabelli and company -- analyst
simon and craig, i was wondering if you could talk about the specific end markets, the trends you are seeing and which ones are being affected by -- well, obviously, all of them are being affected by the shortages, being affected by the logistics and so on. but in terms of demand for the industry overall, have you seen a slowdown? do you have pent-up demand? can you give us a feel for what is going on out there in the marketplace?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
in a succinct manner, rosemarie, it's probably going to be a challenge when we speak about the segment and geography. but i would say, broadly, we sell into infrastructure, and we sell into commercial new construction, and we sell into residential, repair and remodel. i would say we are positively -- have been positively surprised by the commercial new construction market this year, in particular in north america, and that's resulted in some good results for our waterproofing and fireproofing businesses.
on the residential repair and remodel, we've seen nice growth year-over-year. i think as we've pointed out before, our exposure, particularly in north america, to residential new construction is quite limited. and that would have been the strongest segment in north america this year. and then that's really talking specifically about our sbm business for our scc business. because our customers are essentially cement producers and ready-mix concrete producers, we get full exposure across all the different segments in terms of residential, commercial and infrastructure. i think where we've seen nice growth this year, and it's been global growth, that could have been better had we had access to more raw materials has been our infrastructure business. and that's a segment that we enjoy and like and is likely to be more robust over the next three years than residential or commercial.
rosemarie morbelli -- gabelli and company -- analyst
so looking at the infrastructure, how much do you think you have lost -- revenues delayed because of the shortage?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
well, rosemarie, let me -- i use math a little bit more than probably i should. but we said at the beginning -- if you remember at the beginning of q3, we said we thought we'd be up about 6% to 8%, right, in revenue for the full year. i think now we're looking at around 5% approximately -- between 4% and 5% as reported, right? i'm going to say as reported. so if you think about that, you could argue that i would think the global construction market has probably lost a point or two for the full year versus what expected they expected to. so, quite a bit, but we are seeing -- what happens with rosemarie in any specialty infrastructure projects, in any one of those projects, if they're missing one product or they're missing one item to finish the sequence of the job, they cannot continue the job, and they're having a problem switching out to other items, alternative items because they can't get it either. so that's slowing down the bigger jobs. one of the reasons why, and we're not in new construction residential, unfortunately, the folks who are in new construction residential or light commercial, they can switch out and they can move to another job and come back to a certain job. they have much more flexibility.
on the high-end commercial and the infrastructure and where we play, the jobs just can't switch out products. so that's delayed it. now the good news about that, we'll get that in 2022 because the jobs -- what we're seeing in our pipeline is the jobs are not going away. money is cheap. people are still continuing to invest and still completing those jobs. it's just they'll move into 2022. and this is when we talk about supply chain disruption. it's not on the -- just on the inbound. it's also on the outbound on the demand and people delaying some need for our products because their projects are delayed. so hopefully, that's helpful.
rosemarie morbelli -- gabelli and company -- analyst
yes. that is very helpful. thank you. and so this actually brings up my next question, which is regarding m-and-a. is it safe to assume that it is going to open the residential construction market to you in a much larger fashion? and is that -- do you have something that could eventually close by year-end?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
the -- we are very -- we have put a lot of time and effort, rosemarie, into m-and-a. and we're very thoughtful and specific about where we would invest our shareholders' funds. and we are clear on the geographies where we want to play, and we are clear on the segments where we think an investment is prudent. and we've talked about infrastructure as an example. i think the global construction trends or information, for example, from ihs would suggest that global construction should grow at about 2% to 3% the next three years. but the infrastructure spend is likely to grow at more 6%. and so we think infrastructure would be a prudent investment. and we also, of course, when we think about north america, residential new construction, given the pent-up demand that is a decade in the making, we think, although growth may be limited, that will remain a strong and robust segment over the next two or three years. and we think that would be a prudent investment, too.
rosemarie morbelli -- gabelli and company -- analyst
thank you. and one last question, if i may. so you are lagging price increases. i understand that there is -- it is difficult to raise price in some particular areas. are you considering surcharges in order to offset at least the higher cost of logistics?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
it's a daily conversation, rosemarie, honestly. and every option is on the table, and every option has been discussed and is part of our execution plan.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yes. and maybe, rosemarie, i'll weigh in on that. the -- we expect more price in q4. we actually have committed price from customers that we haven't received price in their current jobs or projects because we don't have the ability to get it on those projects, but they've committed to give it to us on the next projects, which are now being shipped in q4, and that will roll through q4 and q1. and in sbm, honestly, we're doing well between price and productivity, and this will be our low margin mark for sbm. and it'll pick up through a little bit of q4, and then it'll come more normalized into next year. sccs where we're focused, to your point. we have inbound freight and outbound freight on scc, and it is challenging. and we're attempting to do surcharge and then working with our vendors on some of the extra freight costs overseas and inbound overseas because it's a global supply chain for scc versus sbm, which is a little more local, and it's easier to handle.
rosemarie morbelli -- gabelli and company -- analyst
alright. thank you very much.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
the next question comes from laurence alexander with jefferies. please proceed.
dan rizzo -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, guys. it's dan rizzo on for laurence. just one quick question, is there a way to shorten or change your supply chain? i mean, obviously, not right now because you're just dealing with issues, but just to kind of change things so this doesn't happen again. i mean, i guess, it's closing the horse out, but i was wondering if you're looking at that.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
dan, i truly believe every company that is impacted by the supply chain challenges is asking the very same question. and again, it's a daily conversation. and decisions that you would like to make, as craig said, in terms of switching to an alternate material, it's just not feasible right now. but i think it does beg the question, how do you more fundamentally secure yourself against the prospect of this happening? and it is a current and continuous conversation and will be part of our strategic planning going forward. but to your point, dan, the horse has already bolted. and it's now thinking about what we can do over the next 12, 24 months rather than what we can do right now, unfortunately.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yes. and dan, i'll just -- sorry, dan. i'll just reemphasize that, that's predominantly a challenge on the scc part. and we've actually got the benefit from that global supply chain for years. and unfortunately, with the increasing freight, the blackouts in china now on production on areas and even across asia, that's challenging getting product, let alone the cost increase is going up. so to your -- your point is very valid, and we need to have some sort of balance in that.
dan rizzo -- jefferies -- analyst
it sounds like that a lot of the issues or at least the volume issues in scc, because of the shortages, are just pent-up demand. so i just make sure i'm thinking about this right. that would suggest that once this is over, be it three months, six months, nine months from now, you should see a pretty large restock cycle as people basically catch up, particularly given the infrastructure demand that are growing worldwide.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yes. on sbm, certainly, because we have stirling lloyd -- we actually have back orders on stirling lloyd right now right through the quarter on some of the bae. scc tends to restock fairly quickly, but i think our customers are not moving the product out to those projects. so you are right. i think it's -- it will extend the cycle, i think. i don't know if there'll be a big bang in q1 or two, but it will extend the cycle on the replenishment of inventory.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
and dan, to your question -- it's simon. i'll give a little bit more color. specific actions that we had taken that actually were going to drive some very nice productivity improvements for us year-over-year have been negated by the inability to get the product that we planned to replace the raw or the cost of that raw has increased so much that it negates the productivity improvement. the second thing because -- what you asked, what can you do? clearly, we have taken the decision to increase our physical inventory and quite substantially. and i think surprisingly, that meant for some customers in some segments, we've actually been able to drive an improvement in our on-time and in full on certain projects for certain customers. and i think that's a testament to our supply chain group that we've been able to do that in these challenging times.
dan rizzo -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you very much.

our next question comes from chris shaw with monness, crespi. please proceed.
chris shaw -- monness, crespi -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone. how are you doing?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
hi, chris.
chris shaw -- monness, crespi -- analyst
if i could follow up on rosemarie's question about m-and-a. you've lined up the strategy and the target sort of areas and geographies. and i think you've seems like you've had that sort of set for a while now, i guess. what's just sort of the -- what's the sticking point right now? is it just -- are there no targets? are they not selling? or is the multiples too high? have you lost that on some targets? or are you guys -- is it covid or are you guys been distracted with the supply chain issues? i mean what's really sort of the sticking point in getting this done?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
no. we've actually dedicated a lot of time and effort to m-and-a. in some cases, we have lost out. in some cases, we've decided the price is too high. in some cases, we've decided there isn't enough good fit and synergies. and so we want to be thoughtful. we want to be discerning. we actually have a very good pipeline and feel good about some of the targets that we are pursuing.
chris shaw -- monness, crespi -- analyst
okay. so it's a lot of reasons, i guess.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
chris shaw -- monness, crespi -- analyst
and then if i could ask, historically -- i can't remember. in both your businesses, when you've had to raise prices a decent amount, is there any impact to demand? or is there some sort of elasticity? or is there any switching out to more commodity-like product or anything like that? i forget the sort of historical when that has happened in the past.
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yes. generally, i mean, we're managing the balance between price and volume. and generally, there's not switching out as long as we are sensible, we communicate effectively and we're clear to the customer on exactly where they're getting the price. and the challenge is the timing. i mean, certainly, if we're going to jam the customer and put him in a very difficult position with his pricing to his customer or his -- their project or her project. that's an issue. so hence, the reason why the delay a little bit on our part because we don't want to lose volume. we haven't lost volume that we know of as we're tracking where we had, i think, about two or three years ago, we did move price and we lost volume. and you can see in 2019, it came back to haunt us on the sbm side. so we're very thoughtful on this price approach. of course, we've got the wind in our back with the inflation. so we're going to get the price. we are driving productivity to offset it, too. and i think at the end of this, we'll be more competitive, and we'll be able to grow the business on the backs of that versus just working on price and margin, honestly.

[operator instructions] our next question is a follow-up from mike harrison with seaport research partners. please proceed.
mike harrison -- seaport research partners -- analyst
hi. yes. just one last one for you around free cash flow. looking even at the adjusted number, you're quite a bit behind where you were last year. i know you mentioned the higher inventory levels. but maybe just as we're starting to think about free cash flow for next year, maybe walk us through some of the puts and takes there. presumably, working capital becomes less of a headwind. expect to see some earnings growth in there. but also how do we think about the cash for restructuring and repositioning into next year as well as capex next year versus this year?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
i mean i'll give you a general comment, mike, and then craig will probably follow up with more specific data. but very deliberate decision on craig and my part early this year as we saw challenges on raw material pricing and the indications of shortages that we bought early. and we bought a lot. we're very deliberate. so i'd say the majority of the change in the free cash flow comes from increasing physical inventory. what i am pleased to say is that throughout the course of this year, we've made some changes within our supply chain group, and i think we have a very talented group. and i think that's part of the reason why we've been able to improve service levels to some customers even in these challenging times. but we will definitely be targeting that group with a reduction in physical inventory once the supply chain disruptions have abated and driving that improvement in free cash flow next year. craig?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
yes. so michael, i'll play in on chris' question a little bit on this, too. so we decided to carry this extra inventory. one of the reasons was to support number. i'm from the -- i have a commercial background to support the commercial teams on pricing. the last thing you want to do with customers is give them a price increase and then tell them you can't service them with the product. so we're supporting our commercial teams and our customers on that. we have about 15% to 20% more cost in our inventory this year than we did last year. about half of that is inflation, and the other half is the decision simon and i made to carry extra volume to make sure we can service the customers. so we'll reap the benefit of that next year, not at the end of this year because the supply chain disruptions are keeping on. but next year, we'll reap the benefit of that because we expect to bring that down slightly next year.
but just to give you some numbers, we do expect to spend probably about $5 million to $8 million more capex next year than this year. that would be on the projects. we've identified some nice productivity projects in mostly north america on the sbm side. so that's where the number will be at. we'll be at $45 million, give or take, on capex. interest expense will stay the same next year right at this moment, unless we do m-and-a and when we can get a target closed, which would change it. restructuring. we're trying to accelerate the restructuring not just for the savings, but we want to get over it so we can operate the business effectively just from an operating point of view. so you're going to see less cost on dollars and restructuring next year. so that's probably going to give us a bump of $10 million or $15 million. so you're going to see probably our anticipation, our best cash conversion year will be 2022 once we get past this current restructuring.

i'll now turn the call over to simon.
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, will. good morning and thank you for joining today's call. our financial performance in the third quarter was within the expectations, which we laid out in early august. what is notable is that we delivered these results despite cost inflation being significantly higher than we had forecast in the quarter both for raw materials and transportation. notably, sg-and-a was down by more than 8.5% year-over-year in the quarter, a direct result of our efforts to rightsize the business. i am confident we are building a leaner and more agile business and setting gcp up for future success. this will become more evident once macro conditions have normalized. now i'd like to give a little bit more insight about our segment results. given the market dynamics, i am very pleased with the performance of the sbm business.
for 2021, we forecast both revenue and operating income growth year-over-year. our employees have done an outstanding job in improving service and driving better results in this segment. for the scc business, the supply chain disruptions and year-over-year cost inflation started earlier and have been more severe when compared to the sbm segment. unfortunately, the cost inflation impact in the scc segment has accelerated, and price recovery is lagging. we are clear on the actions we need to take to improve profitability in the scc business.
the addition of david campos as our new president of the scc americas business is already bringing tangible change. we are working closely with david on developing a revenue and profit improvement plan for this business, and i look forward to sharing more on this in future calls. since i joined gcp a little over 13 months ago, we have focused on improving the competitiveness of the business so that we can drive revenue and margin improvement. when we last spoke in august, i shared that this was one of the tougher working environments that i have experienced. this remains a very dynamic and challenging period. our revenue and margins have been negatively impacted by raw material shortages, cost inflation, transportation bottlenecks and tight labor markets. the gcp team is working diligently to address the challenges. we evaluate every opportunity to streamline production processes, find substitute raw materials where possible, and we continue to prioritize the customer. i want to make sure we recognize our employees for their continued focus on meeting our customers' needs despite the unprecedented challenges. they have done and continue to do a truly remarkable job.
looking into 2022, we will continue to focus on the things that we can control and on repositioning the business for growth. we will accomplish this through the combination of building out our organizational capability and improve focus on the customer. given our strong balance sheet, we can accelerate our strategic plan through the right m-and-a.
i'd now like to turn the call over to craig. craig?
craig merrill -- chief financial officer
thank you, simon. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. as a reminder, all sales and associated growth rates in my comments are on a constant currency basis. i will discuss gcp's third quarter results, including comments on each of our business segments. lastly, i will provide commentary on the remainder of 2021. gcp's constant currency sales of $246.1 million were 0.9% lower than prior year but generally in line with our expectations. we had forecasted stable demand year-over-year with respect to revenues but with a slight impact from material and logistic constraints globally, which we started to see in the late quarter two. price for the quarter improved 1.3% compared with third quarter 2020 as price continued to come through from pricing actions implemented earlier in the year. gcp's gross margin decreased 710 basis points to 33.9% as higher raw material and logistic costs impacted margins at a higher rate versus our q3 forecast, with a significant impact on the scc segment.
selling, general and administrative costs of $59.2 million decreased 8.5% during the quarter, partially offsetting the gross margin compression and stronger than our forecast due to lower employee costs. gcp's income from continuing operations attributable to gcp shareholders totaled $7.8 million compared with $100 million for the third quarter 2020. of course, the prior year period included $82.5 million in gains from the sale of the cambridge corporate office. gcp's adjusted ebit totaled $24.5 million compared with $36 million in prior year quarter, down approximately 32%. adjusted ebit margin decreased 470 basis points to 9.8% due to higher raw material and logistics costs. adjusted ebitda margin was 14.3% for the current quarter or 500 basis points lower versus the same period in 2020. our capital spending year-to-date is $23.9 million versus $28 million prior year-to-date, reflecting improved discipline of capital deployment.
to better service our customers, we continue to hold higher inventories as we work through significant supply chain disruptions. therefore, for the first nine months of 2021, net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations equals $25.8 million versus $59.3 million compared to prior year. now looking at the specific performance of our two segments for the third quarter. scc's constant currency sales were up 1.3% to $140.1 million due to favorable impact of price increases. we saw year-over-year growth specifically around global cement additives and geographically in both in latin america and europe. the scc volume offset was generally in asia where we saw intermittent government restrictions due to covid-19, impacting demand.
gross margins in the scc segment declined year-over-year by 900 basis points to 31% in the third quarter due to high raw material costs and logistics costs, which accelerated in the quarter. scc gross margins will be unfavorably impacted for the remainder of the year in comparison to 2020, mainly due to the inflation headwinds, including shipping and freight costs. scc segment operating income was $7.7 million, with segment operating margin of 5.4%, a decrease of 820 basis points compared with the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher raw material costs.historically, third quarter has been our strongest margin quarter for scc. and unfortunately, the severity of the inflation will have a significant impact on our scc full year results in 2021.
turning to the sbm segment for the quarter. sbm sales constant currency totaled $106 million during the third quarter, a 3.7% decrease versus the third quarter 2020 due to lower sales volumes. the volumes were slightly lower than we expected as we reduced shipments to certain property developers in china to reduce credit risk. we did see solid volume growth in certain product lines such as our stirling lloyd business and our specialty construction products group, which includes the fireproofing, injections and flooring products. although sbm's gross margin decreased 460 basis points to 37.9% compared with the third quarter of 2020 due to higher raw material costs, it was in line with our expectations. sbm segment operating income totaled $20.9 million, with operating margins at 19.4%, a 390 basis point decrease versus prior year. however, year-to-date, sbm's operating margins continue to outpace 2020 margins due to volume growth, productivity, good mix and cost leverage to date.
now looking to quarter four. it is clear that inflation and logistics cost increases will continue to impact our financial results on a year-to-year comparable basis, particularly in the scc segment. we continue to take actions we believe are needed to offset these costs. however, we do not believe the actions will be sufficient to substantially lift margins sequentially moving into the fourth quarter for scc. we are using our balance sheet in order to better service our customers and when we continue to do so in order to ensure we have product to supply into 2022 without disruption. as a result, we expect to have on hand more physical inventory volume versus our historical trend at year-end.
certainly, the second half of 2021 has been an extremely challenging time to operate with material shortages, global supply chain disruptions and the changing labor dynamics. the global teams have done a great job working together to manage through the day-to-day disruptions to meet order commitments and keep construction projects on track. we do expect our gross margins to remain compressed for the short term. price increases continue to be implemented. however, we believe it will take a couple more quarters for price to overcome inflation and stabilize margins. the impacts on gross margin are expected to be more unfavorable on the scc segment versus the sbm segment as approximately 2/3 of our inflation is impacting our scc segment.
we forecast sg-and-a expenses for the full year to be down approximately $8 million year-over-year, and we expect a further favorable impact in 2022. and this will continue to partially offset the temporary margin compression. our expense management and restructuring programs are ahead of schedule. we currently have approximately $482 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of the third quarter, slightly lower than forecast as we are holding higher inventory.
in closing, we are pleased with our progress. and although the environment is challenging on both the supply side and logistics, we expect quarter four revenues to be in line with our regular seasonality following our quarter three results with higher price capture in q4 versus q3. our strong balance sheet continues to provide significant flexibility and opportunity to deliver shareholder value, whether it be return of capital to shareholders, m-and-a or a combination. during the year, we have accelerated our efforts to identify and broaden the scope of potential m-and-a opportunities, which will provide increased capability, scale and leverage for our organization.
i will now turn it back over to simon. simon?
simon bates -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, craig. 2021 has been a truly dynamic year. our operating plan assumes both cost inflation and productivity improvements. i am very pleased to say that between productivity and sg-and-a reductions, we will realize more than $20 million of improvement in our operating expense and efficiency by the end of the year. consequently, had cost inflation been in line with our budget or historical norms, our results would have been well in excess of our operating plan. unfortunately, in the short term, these unprecedented increases in costs have negatively impacted our consolidated results.
although we feel very good about the progress we are seeing in the underlying business, we have naturally switched our focus to address margin through price and to drive further productivity improvements. i also want to note that we are ahead of schedule on the exit from our cambridge facility, and we have stood up our new head office in alpharetta, georgia. our new state-of-the-art r-and-d facility in wilmington, mass is under construction and will be ready for occupancy in q1 2022. the execution of our strategic priorities to date has improved the business. and coupled with the use of our strong balance sheet, we are committed to deliver shareholder value.
thank you for joining our call, and we look forward to taking any questions.
