operator
good morning, and welcome to the q4 2020 conocophillips earnings conference call. my name is zenarah, and i'll be the operator for today's call. [operator instructions] please note, this conference is being recorded. i will now turn the call over to ms.
ellen desanctis. ellen, you may begin.
ellen desanctis -- senior vice president, corporate relations
thank you, zenarah. hello, and welcome to our listeners today. first, i'll introduce the members of the conocophillips executive team who are on today's call. we have ryan lance, our chairman and ceo; bill bullock, our executive vice president and chief financial officer; matt fox, our executive vice president and chief operating officer; tim leach, our executive vice president of lower 48; dominic macklon, our senior vice president of strategy and technology; and nick olds, our senior vice president of global operations.
ryan will open this call with some prepared remarks, and then the team will be available for your questions. before i turn the call over to ryan, a few reminders. the results we released this morning reflect 2020 results for conocophillips only. we will not be discussing any concho-specific results today, but beginning in the first quarter of 2021, results will reflect the combined conocophillips-concho company.
we will make some forward-looking statements this morning based on current expectations. actual results could differ due to the factors described in today's press release and in our periodic sec filings. we'll also refer to some non-gaap financial measures today. reconciliations to the nearest corresponding gaap measure can be found in this morning's press release and on our website.
thanks. and now i'll turn the call over to ryan. 
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, ellen, and thanks to all our listeners for joining today's call. lately, i've been reflecting on this time a year ago. we had just rolled out a groundbreaking multi-year plan for the company. the plan was anchored to a comprehensive philosophy and approach we had been espousing since 2016 that was aimed at reversing the failings of the e&p sector to create a sustained value for shareholders through cycles.
what was that business model? was reinvest about 70% of our cash flows into the lowest cost of supply resource to grow financial returns and free cash flow, return at least 30% of the cash flow to our owners, maintain a very strong balance sheet and lead in esg stewardship. our multi-year plan gave the market a credible example of how this business model would work. well almost as soon as the ink had dried on our multiyear plan along came 2020. and for the entire year, nothing went as expected for any of us.
but here's the thing, despite the most challenging year in the history of our sector, our business model worked. the value proposition prevailed. we exercised available flexibility without forfeiting productive capacity. we high-graded our portfolio.
we executed our programs and returned over 50% of our cash to our owners. our balance sheet stayed strong and we continued to up our game on esg. in other words, our value proposition passed the test of 2020. and this strengthened our conviction that we have the right model for this volatile sector.
this conviction is what led us to acquire concho in a transaction that will enhance our ability to deliver our proven value proposition. so we've turned the difficult experience of 2020 into an opportunity to emerge as an even stronger, more investable company for our sector. earlier today, we announced fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 results for conocophillips. because the concho transaction closed after year end, the results we reported today represent stand-alone conocophillips performance for 2020.
however, beginning january 1st, our 2021 results will reflect the combined company performance. now i don't plan to review the results we announced this morning. i just described some of the important highlights from last year. but this morning's results should give you all confidence that the underlying stand-alone conocophillips business is running very well, thanks to the many efforts of our workforce.
and i can assure you the concho permian business is running well too. and again, thanks to our workforce in midland. our mindset as we start 2021 is all about doing the work and delivering the results that make us the best e&p company in the business. and to align all of us here are our key focus areas for '21.
our top priority is to create the strongest competitor in the business from the combination of conocophillips and concho. the closing of the concho transaction cleared the way for us to begin comprehensive integration and optimization efforts across every part of our business. we're just getting started post-closing, but we're already taking actions that will drive greater efficiency and capture best practices to ensure we perform at the highest level organizationally, technically, operationally, financially, and culturally. we have already identified the sources of capital and cost reductions to meet the $500 million target we set when the deal was announced.
and i can report that we will significantly outperform those initial expectations as we review our processes, share best practices and organize for the new realities of the business. but let me put our revised saving expectations into perspective for you. compared to pro forma 2019 adjusted operating cost of approximately $7 billion, we anticipate being at an annual run rate of approximately $6 billion in 2022, assuming a similar production level of roughly 1.5 billion -- million barrels a day equivalent. now this $1 billion reduction, about $400 million of that was driven by actions taken by both companies prior to the deal announcement, with the remaining savings to be realized through cost reductions implemented in conjunction with the transaction.
it represents a major value upgrade for the company because it greatly enhances the competitiveness of our free cash flow-generating capability which is how we'll win. we'll be implementing our cost reduction actions throughout 2021, and we'll provide updates on our progress along the way. the next priority is to execute the announced operating capital plan of $5.5 billion. this budget is comprised of sustaining capital of about $5.1 billion and about $400 million that would be directed toward major capital projects, primarily in alaska and ongoing appraisal activity.
now for this level of capital, we expect to produce about 1.5 million barrels of oil per day equivalent, which is roughly flat to 2020 pro forma production adjusted for curtailments and asset sale. in this morning's supplemental material, we provided operating capital plan by segment. we expect to spend about 55% of our capital in the lower 48, with the remainder allocated across our diverse global programs. we've set the capital budget at about $5.5 billion for two principal reasons: first, while the macro environment has firmed up recently, we are cautious about the trajectory and the timing of a recovery.
demand recovery is taking longer, spare supply remains and inventories remain elevated. it makes no sense to grow into this market environment, so we're choosing to stay at a sustaining level for the year. second, we're committed to growing free cash flow, and we are setting up the company to be a significant free cash flow generator. that means maintaining capital discipline but also driving program improvements that enhance uplift efficiency.
in other words, we're driving for free cash flow growth, not production growth. at $5.5 billion of capital in 2021, and if current prices hold, we expect to generate significant additional free cash flow. in that situation, our dividend alone will not be sufficient to meet our target of returning greater than 30% of our cfo to our shareholders. you should not be surprised to see us reactivate buybacks as a channel, and we always like the idea of improving net debt.
a third key 2021 priority is engagement with our various stakeholders. this includes investors, regulators, government officials, partners, communities, and our workforce. we're undergoing a significant level of change, both on the inside as we integrate our companies, but also in the external environment. while we consider engagement part of ordinary business, there's no question this priority has taken on a new level of importance in today's environment, especially given the recent industry-related announcements coming from the new biden administration.
now let me take a moment to address our thoughts about the administration's recent pronouncements of a temporary moratorium on leasing and permitting on federal lands. i have to say we were not entirely surprised by the announcement. in fact, president biden said during the campaign that he would issue a temporary moratorium on new leasing. as for the permitting moratorium, the administration has publicly indicated this as a temporary pause and that they will continue to issue permits.
obviously, we hope these temporary actions are resolved in a timely fashion, and we are certainly watching the situation closely. now from our perspective, some of the recent executive actions targeting u.s. oil and gas production will have negative economic and environmental consequences to the american people. if the moratoriums become permanent, they will eliminate well-paying jobs, mainly in rural america, slower economic recovery, negatively impact energy and national security, and increase our reliance on higher ghg foreign barrels.
we certainly want to avoid these outcomes. so we stand ready to work with the biden team as we did successfully with the obama-biden administration to find balanced solutions to address the issues. as for the questions of what a permitting moratorium could mean for conocophillips specifically, let me take that head on. while we certainly are going to engage to protect our interest, conocophillips has the flexibility, the diversity, and the depth of low cost of supply and low ghg resource to manage through this issue without materially impacting our plans.
and a final 2021 priority will be continuing to up our game on another issue that is very important to our stakeholders, namely esg. this is an area where we have a long-term demonstrated track record of commitment and performance. but clearly, there is heightened interest across all of the industry on this topic. we continue to accept our responsibility for continuing esg improvement.
and, in fact, embrace the opportunity to be an industry leader. last year, we became the first u.s.-based upstream company to adopt a paris-aligned climate risk strategy. we set internal emission reduction targets that are consistent with the goals of that agreement and are taking significant measures to monitor and reduce methane emissions across our operations. in addition, we're actively advocating for a well-designed price on carbon in the u.s.
because we believe that's the most economically efficient and effective step that can be taken by the u.s. to set the world on a sustainable path to long-term ghg emission reductions. while we work diligently to reduce emissions on a parallel path, we have established a low-carbon team within the company. that team is conducting in-depth studies of energy transition alternatives, monitoring trends, and evaluating the economics and the viability of these alternatives for conocophillips over time.
our board is engaged with the team and its work, and we're committed to continuing our analysis on this important topic. but at least for now, we believe the highest value we can create for all our stakeholders is by being the best e&p company in the business. the world needs clean, low-cost barrels that are safely delivered by disciplined, free cash flow and returns-focused companies like conocophillips. 2020 was indeed a challenging year, but the lessons and accomplishments we took from it put us in great stead not only for 2021 but as a $75 billion enterprise value industry leader.
we're in a unique position to help transform the perception and the performance of our sector with a clear vision of what we need to do, deliver value from the concho transaction, execute our 2021 operating plan, engage with our stakeholders and keep pressing on esg leadership. we look forward to keeping you informed of that progress as we go throughout the year. now let me turn that back over to the operator, and we'll take your questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from doug terreson from evercore. please go ahead. your line is open.
doug terreson -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi, everybody.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, doug.
doug terreson -- evercore isi -- analyst
ryan, conocophillips has emphasized cost-effective energy supply, esg leadership, which you just referred to, and competitive returns to shareholders, which has really been a refreshing approach, and one that most of your peers have ended up emulating over the past couple of years. and while having a good head start is usually a good thing, a paradigm shift seems to be under way in energy with investor expectations for management teams changing too. so my question is, what are some of the things that the management team is going to need to do to sustain its leadership position in this new environment to continue to be the best e&p company with these new realities, i think, is the way you phrased it a few minutes ago? so that's my question.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
all right. thanks, doug. and first, a big call out and congratulations on your retirement. we know we're going to probably see your name around.
you've been an incredible partner and thought leader in the industry and have gotten it right more times than you've gotten it wrong, so kudos to you as well. so thank you. yes. doug, it's really good.
a lot of external pressures right now, certainly on the industry and on what's happening with the new administration. i guess i go back to kind of our three areas that we think are really critical for success of an e&p company. and i think it starts with returns on and returns of capital. you've got to generate a competitive return for our shareholders in this business.
you got to do that sustainably and through the cycles. and we think that's critically important, and we're well bought into that, as you know, for a number of years. and to do that, we've got to also deliver this low greenhouse gas affordable energy all around the world, and that's going to be a part as we go through this transition that's really important. i think it's maybe lost in some of the rhetoric today, just how important oil and gas is to this transition that we're going to be going through over the next number of years and decades.
and then finally, you have to do that sustainably. we have to do that with the environment in mind. we can't put the planet through a great experiment. we've been an advocate of this and been a supporter for a long period of time.
and as i described in my opening remarks, it's about taking care of our scope one and scope two emissions, and we're on a pathway to reduce that intensity by 2030 that puts us on a pathway to 2050 and the goal that's consistent with the paris agreement. so we think everybody needs to be focused on your scope one and scope two emissions. and then for scope three, we advocate for a price on carbon. we think that's the best way, that's the most economical way.
it's the best way that the market can deal with this issue and drive consumer behavior that takes -- that puts us on the pathway that's consistent with the paris agreement as well. so that's how we've come up with our climate strategy, and that's how we're dealing with this kind of contra around how do you get energy and make it affordable? how do you make it sustainable? and how do you make it resilient and something that shareholders can invest in?
doug terreson -- evercore isi -- analyst
and also, to be fair, it's been really easy to have conocophillips as my top idea in e&p since you guys or since you became the ceo in 2012, and that you guys originated the model for success in this sector. it's obviously worked and you stuck to it. so kudos to you and the team. thank you for your leadership in the space, and the pleasure has been all mine.
thanks again.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, doug. we'll miss you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from neil mehta from goldman sachs. please go ahead. your line is open.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning, team, and thanks for taking -- good morning, ryan. so i guess the kickoff question is about capital returns. and ryan, you alluded to this, but as you look at 2021, at the $5.5 billion capital budget, where do you see the breakeven to cover your dividend? and i'm guessing the number is a lot lower than where the spot is right now, which is close to $58 brent. and so how do you think about using a share buyback to take advantage of that excess cash flow, but also the dislocation you've historically talked about the correlation between your stock and the price of oil, and that correlation has recently broken down.
so how do you think about leveraging excess cash flow via buybacks to take advantage of dislocation to the extent you see one?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so maybe i can take the latter part of yours, neil, maybe matt can chime in on breakevens and the first part of your question. but yes, you're right. certainly, i know you guys can do the math and are doing the math pretty quickly these days.
and certainly, at current prices, if they hang, we're going to be -- you shouldn't be surprised at all for us to be back in the market and buying our shares back at kind of the level we were at pre-transaction. so we recognize that our commitment is to deliver 30% back to the shareholder, and we're committed to doing that. we recognize that the ordinary dividend today and the kind of market we're experiencing today, and if you look at the forward curves, that would be insufficient, so we recognize we'd have to take some of that free cash flow and return that to the shareholder. and that's certainly our commitment.
and as i said in my opening remarks, with what we experienced in 2020, having a really, really strong balance sheet is really important. so reducing our net debt is something of interest to this as well. so let me -- maybe matt can chime in a little bit on the breakeven numbers.
matt fox -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yes, neil. 2021 is going to be a little bit noisy in establishing that because of some of the one-off costs. but when we get to 2022 in the steady-state mode to breakeven to cover the capital and for sustaining capital, the dividend is going to be somewhere around $40 a barrel, consistent with what we showed at the time that we announced the transaction. and of course, certainly, that's before we've considered some additional cost savings that might come from capital reductions and margin improvements from commercial and supply chain and so on.
so we're feeling very comfortable that we'll be consistent with that, roughly $40 or a bit less once we're into 2022.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
and i'd add, neil -- sorry. neil, i would just add that we're taking the time to drive the efficiencies and the free cash flow generating power through the transaction with concho. and we're just getting started with that. we've been two weeks now since we got it closed.
and i think we've got about a month of prices above $50 wti as well. but we're just getting started, and our focus is on trying to drive that as low as we possibly can. and the teams are up for it.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
well, that's the follow-up for you, ryan. it's been a couple of weeks since you've gotten your hands on the concho steering wheel. just thoughts on what you're seeing so far. what is surprising to the upside? anything surprising to the downside? and any quantification around the value creation that you've seen so far with the concho asset?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
no. thanks. i think i'd say we haven't seen a downside yet. we're just happy to have tim and will and jack on the team and helping us get jump-started in terms of what we're doing in the permian basin and building on the best practices, as matt talked about.
so we're quite excited about the upside and the opportunity and just continuing to drive that efficiencies, free cash flow generation, get our assets on the concho learning curve, and continue to drive the value. and that's what this year of kind of sustaining level of capital, we're coming into the same level that we came in out of 2020, and that gives us the chance to get the team really focused on driving those efficiencies and getting more out for every precious capital dollar that we're spending.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jeanine wai from barclays. please go ahead. your line is open.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone. thanks for taking my call.
ellen desanctis -- senior vice president, corporate relations
good morning, jean.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
good morning. so i guess my question is maybe on the medium, longer term. you'll be holding production flat this year, pro forma to 2020. and over the medium term, has your view on the mid-cycle price of $50 real ti, does that change relative to underpin the 10-year plan? and i know you indicated that kind of go past the value proposition test of 2020.
so is the plan to make your way back to that more than 3% production cagr and the substantial through the cycle share buybacks? or has the macro and the concho acquisition kind of made you think a little bit differently?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, maybe i'll start and then let matt chime in a little bit as well. i think long term, jeanine, our view of the mid-cycle if you think about it that way over a long period of time, hasn't really changed. we see some potential for demand destruction coming out of this post covid, that could be up to a couple of million barrels a day. we also see some supply destruction as well.
so on balance, we'd have a long-term view that the mid-cycle price hasn't really changed. i can maybe turn to matt. he can maybe address kind of that medium-term question that you asked, which i guess is kind of direct to maybe over the next two, three, four years.
matt fox -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yes, jeanine. the signs say -- i mean, in the short term, we're expecting perhaps quite a volatile year this year if we work off inventories and we're getting here a better demand and supply. but our view is that in the medium term, it's quite possible that we'll spend some time above mid-cycle prices and because a little bit due to some demand reduction. we know there's been significant supply reduction, particularly in the u.s.
if we give some numbers to that, i mean, u.s. tight oil production was 8.2 million barrels a day in december of 2019. and last year, it was 7 million barrels a day. so that's a significant drop.
and our view is that at $50 a barrel or thereabouts, the current strip prices below 50s, so assuming there's a six-day moratorium on permits isn't extended for a long period. when u.s. tight oil will probably average around 7 million barrels a day for 2021, at least that's our sense of it. and if you take that and look at 2022, that's at least 2 million or 3 million barrels a day below the pre-covid trend.
so assuming the demand comes back in 2022 and assuming u.s. produces a disciplined bulk, i think it's reasonable to expect a few years above mid-cycle. but on balance, our underlying view of the mid-cycle for the longer-term hasn't adjusted yet.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
and then into the latter part of your question, jeanine, we're pretty committed to the 30% return of our cash back to the shareholder that where we believe that's the right model for this industry and we're committed to doing that.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
ok. and then my follow-up is just maybe digging in a little on neil's question. and i apologize for pushing you on this a little bit, but i think that conoco's cash return model is extremely differentiated. not a lot of companies on our list at all are able to return capital the way you can.
but when you mentioned in terms of potential expectations for the buyback to resume, you said it could be maybe around the level at pre-contract transaction levels. so i know that you had announced a $1 billion buyback in 4q '20 alone, which got canceled. so are we supposed to be anchoring around that? or is it more kind of the 2019 expectations?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i think you can do the math at these kinds of prices and calculate sort of the cfo that we generate and our commitments to return 30%. so it's more similar to like what we were doing before the transaction.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
ok. great. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from phil gresh from j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
your line is open.
philip gresh -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the question. so first one here, i guess, would just be on the outer year look at capital spending, and i know you're going to give us an update here in march and you just closed the transaction. but i guess this is more directional in nature.
if you have any color about how you think about the moving pieces looking out? and i noticed that you do have some spending here in 2021 allocated for willow as well. so should we be anticipating that that will be ramping up in 2022 and beyond at this point?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i can maybe give a -- yes, we have an expectation to come back and talk about -- update you throughout the course of the year. and we kind of said we'd come back in march and certainly expect toward the latter part of the year, we need to come back to the market and describe our longer-term plans. we have thoughts and ideas around optimized plateau levels of spend for the assets.
we do that at the company level and certainly do that at the asset level as well in the lower 48 and across our portfolio, including the willow asset, and i can have nick describe a little bit about what we're doing today on the willow asset. but we'll give that update to you, phil, longer term, but expect that there will be some ramp-up to an optimized kind of levels, both at the company level and the asset level. and a lot of that is dictated by the recovery in this market. we got to see just what happens and how quickly supply and demand get rebalanced in the global markets.
so we're watching that really closely, but understand that there's going to be a ramp-up to some optimized level. and that's where we're busy trying to assess right now and understand after the concho acquisition. maybe i can have nick add a few comments on the willow piece specifically.
nick olds -- senior vice president, global operations
yes, phil. this is nick. just to take you back a little bit to q4 2020. as you've seen, we crossed through two major milestones around permitting for willow.
we had the record of decision by the blm in october and then the army corps of engineers 404 permit allows us to put gravel for roads and pads. for this year, part of that capital will be advancing engineering through our feed, so we took feed end of december. that's a major decision gate within the company. so advancing the front-end engineering and design.
and then we plan to move to detailed engineering sometime this year. and then part of the scope for 2021 is also some small civil construction to put gravel and start the road system for willow. and then we're targeting fid, final investment decision, later this year. so we'll advance the detailed engineering, which will impact that overall decision.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
so we're watching it closely, phil. and if things move to the right because of this current administration or somehow we get curveballs thrown at us, we have not taken fid yet. we've got a lot of flexibility around how fast we actually ramp-up at willow and what our options are around that.
philip gresh -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. ok. a follow-up question to neil's question on the breakeven. understood on the 2022 kind of still normalizing at a $40 to $41 ti, which i presume includes the incremental synergies that you've discussed today.
but with respect to the transient factors for 2021. i was hoping just a little bit more color there. is that just the severance that you're referring to as the one-offs? or were there other things? because i think there were some things like lng distributions on a lag effect and other things. so anything else you could share would be helpful.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i can have dominic. he's leading up the integration efforts around the two companies and describe some of those transaction costs in relation to the synergies.
dominic macklon -- senior vice president, strategy and technology
yes, phil. obviously -- there's obviously severance costs here in terms of where we have duplicate labor and other savings. there are obviously fees associated with that. but once we get through this year and get through those costs, i think we're focused really on what our cost structure will look like.
so maybe just to give a bit of an update on that. i want to be clear about that. the integration is going well. that's on the system side, the organization side.
and we do have line of sight to exceed our targeted $500 million cost and capital savings we announced at the time of the transaction. so if you remember, that $500 million was made up of $350 million of operating cost savings and $150 million of capital reductions. and those really came across three areas: the direct savings from the transaction, restructuring our corporate staff groups to better align with our new portfolio on the conocophillips side and then stopping our new ventures exploration program. that reduced our targeted exploration spend from $300 million to $150 million a year.
and in fact, our 2021 capital program of $5.5 billion reflects a reduced exploration capital spend along those lines. now our expected operating cost savings have now increased from $350 million to $600 million. so our teams have really done an excellent job turning over every stone, both in relation to the transaction and restructuring our center. so in total, the operating cost and capital reductions will now amount to $750 million.
so we're up from $500 million to $750 million, and we're still counting. i think as matt mentioned, we still have the opportunity for cost and capital efficiencies across our d&c spend. supply chain economies of scale and also improved price realizations on the commercial and marketing side. so we do expect that $750 million to increase through the year.
and we'll be providing another update on that in march. now finally, just to tie back to ryan's prepared remarks, with the operating cost savings having increased to $600 million, together with the $400 million of sustainable cost reductions, each company made -- both companies made together, in 2020, we anticipate our 2022 operating costs to be around $6 billion, and that's $1 billion less than our pro forma costs in 2019. now that was really the last normal year pre-pandemic. so it represents the best baseline.
and that's all assuming production flat at about 1.5 million barrels a day. so at the end of the day, as we think about, we get through these transition costs this year. we then get into a run rate of about $6 billion. it's those bottom-line costs that matter at the end of the day, and that's what we're very focused on, to make really the company the strongest competitor in the business from two already very strong companies.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from alastair syme from citi. please go ahead. your line is open.
alastair syme -- citi -- analyst
thank you, and hello, everybody. look, earlier today, one of your u.s. peers slashed their permian growth forecast by almost 40%. and i thought what was intriguing about that is on their conference call.
there was not a single question asking about that revision. so it's almost like the market has swung at a pendulum and now doesn't think the permian works. so i wonder if you can really reflect from the trends you are seeing at efficiency, cost of supply. and i think, ultimately, the question that the market doesn't seem to believe about whether this business could be turned into one that generates free cash flow.
thank you.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i'll start, alastair, and maybe let tim chime in. he's our resident permian expert that we're enjoying having on the team. but i think as we look at it and what drove our decision around the transaction early on is looking for the lowest cost of supply resources we could find in the world today and the companies that owned it and that's what drew us to concho and the transaction that we announced back at the end of last year.
so when we look at it and we look at the performance inside our own company, and now that we've gotten a look under the hood deeper on the concho side, we're pretty pleased with what we're seeing and continue to see efficiencies in free cash flow growth above and beyond that. and maybe ask tim, he can supply a little bit of color to that as well.
tim leach -- executive vice president, lower 48
yes. i'll just follow-on by saying how pleased i am to be here and how well i think that concho fits within this portfolio. but specifically to the permian basin, we were operating a really efficient program coming into this deal. conoco was also operating very efficiently.
and as i was reminded recently, the program we're executing right now is generating the best economics that we had seen during most of my career. so it's pretty exciting to have the inventory that we have. and have the opportunity then to go in and make that better and making it better, makes it more capital efficient, which will greatly expand the free cash flow and drive down the cost of an already low cost of supply area. so we really see opportunity to really enhance the economics of what we're doing together.
so that's the exciting part of going forward.
alastair syme -- citi -- analyst
can i ask if you think the industry in 2020 has managed to bring the cost of supply down further in the permian? or is it difficult to tell?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'm not sure we caught that, alastair. say it again.
alastair syme -- citi -- analyst
the question is whether you think efficiency gains in 2020 have brought the cost of supply down in the permian at all?
tim leach -- executive vice president, lower 48
oh, yes. certainly. i think we saw declining capital costs, but then also enhanced efficiencies from better-designed wells, better-designed spacing across the board. so, yes, i do think the cost of supply came down dramatically in 2020.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from roger read from wells fargo. please go ahead. your line is open.
roger read -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yeah. good morning.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
hello, roger.
roger read -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
i just wanted to jump in. i know a question was asked a little bit earlier, just got your hands on the wheel with concho. but maybe as a step back and looking at the overall company, thinking of your cost to supply portfolio review, the step away from the exploration as part of the savings from the transaction. are you thinking of an overall portfolio kind of shakeup in coming years? or is everything that's in there, it really does make sense? and then as an addendum to that, just how you're thinking about some of the international lng opportunities at this point?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, roger. we've made a lot of portfolio changes since we spun the company in 2012. and i think now, as we look across the entire portfolio, we're pretty pleased with the resource base that we have, the cost of supply of all the major assets that we have in the portfolio. with that said, if they don't compete for capital, we've demonstrated our ability to move them out of the portfolio, and we'll do that if their cost of supply gets higher, and they don't compete for capital, but that's how we're really focused and feel like the portfolio today is in a really good shape.
what we're investing in is a less than $40 cost of supply and it averages below $30, so we feel very comfortable we can deliver the returns of capital, returns on capital, even through the cycles in this business with the portfolio that we have. and part of that includes those lng projects that you described. now we did divest at one at the end of last year in australia, and we did that because we were concerned about the cost of supply and the ghg footprint among a few other things. but we do like the lng projects.
we think we like the market in asia. we like the growing need for gas around the whole world. we are interested in competing in qatar for another train. we think that should be coming soon.
it's been certainly delayed with covid like everything else. but if it fits our investment profiles and our investment thoughts around cost of supply, we'd like to participate in that because it ultimately lowers capital intensity and really helps, we think, the overall portfolio. so we're still quite interested in that particular project. and then, obviously, we still have one of the trains in qatar, we have our aplng project that's performing very well right now on top of it as well.
roger read -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from scott hanold from rbc capital markets. please go ahead. your line is open.
scott hanold -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks, and good morning, guys. ryan, appreciate the color that you provided on what you view in terms of the changes in administration and regulations there. but do you all anticipate that you're going to have some visibility to make your longer-term directions at some point? so when do you expect to have a firm direction by the administration? or is there a risk that there isn't anything that's as clear as you need?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, scott, i mean, we're watching the next 60 days really closely. and we've got to get back to permitting rights, ways, and easements across public lands. and if that gets hung up or takes a lot of time, we'll have to -- that's what we're watching very closely. we're already starting to see, frankly, a bit of loosening up of that, some permits getting approved that they said even during this moratorium wouldn't get approved.
so that's what we're following pretty closely. and certainly, we'll adjust our plans if it turns out to be something other than temporary, which is what we're hearing from the biden administration is that it is to get their feet on the ground, understand the lay of the land, understand what was transferred to him from the prior administration and understand how they're going to deal with those issues going forward. but we expect them to come back. we worked very successfully with the obama-biden administration on all these issues and would expect to do it and take them at their word that this is temporary, and that we'll get back to business as usual or at least something close to it after these 60 days.
scott hanold -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
i appreciate that color. and as my follow-up, when you look out at the synergies that you're looking to capture, can you discuss how much of that is included with what your commercial teams can do with the concho assets? and remind me if that's included in that. and if you could give a sense of like what should we expect from that? because i know, certainly, obviously, concho was a two-stream reporter. you guys are three-stream.
but what's going to be that transition period? and is there some synergy upside in addition to what you've already spoken to?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so, scott, i think, as dominic described, the $750 million of synergy that we are talking about today does not include any commercial uplift or realized price benefits or supply chain enhancements or best practices that drive more capital efficiency. those are yet to come, and we fully expect we're going to get significant uplift from those particular items as well. it's going to take us probably the better part of this year commercially to understand all the different contracts.
you brought up two-stream and three-stream reporting. ultimately, we'll go to a three-stream reporting for the combined assets, but it's going to take us some time to understand the restrictions and how quickly we can get there for the concho assets. in fact, i think tim was trying to get there as a company anyway. so they plowed a lot of ground in that regard.
so it will just be a matter of getting to understand those contracts. but importantly, that's why it's helpful to take a sustaining approach and just a stable approach to our execution this year. gives us the opportunity to really focus the teams on trying to drive those efficiencies and trying to drive those additional cost reductions, finding those opportunities on the supply chain and the commercial side of the business that are not included in the current estimate that we've provided to you. but we'll fully update you again in march and provide you another look at where we stand and provide additional details as we go through the course of the year.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from bob brackett from bernstein research. please go ahead. your line is open.
bob brackett -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
thank you. my interest was piqued by your mention of the studies of energy transition alternatives. and my thought would be that there's a financial lens in thinking about that, does this compete for capital against other options in the portfolio? and i guess there's a strategic lens, which is, is this in our core capabilities? is this something we could do better than most or better than the rest? without giving away how far along you are, how do you frame those in terms of financial and strategic objectives?
dominic macklon -- senior vice president, strategy and technology
yes, bob. it's dominic here. if i can just talk a little about our carbon team that ryan mentioned. that sits in our technology organization.
and their work is really in support of our paris-aligned climate risk strategy as well as monitoring opportunities more generally with the energy transition for the company. but you mentioned the competencies, and that's something we have to stay very focused on as to the contribution that conocophillips can make overall to the energy transition. and so their primary focus, that low carbon team we have now is focusing on those opportunities most relevant to our core business and to our core competencies. so those are things like carbon capture, use and storage, carbon offsets, alternative power sources to further reduce the emissions intensity of our operations.
and so now they're also working with the bus, our business units very closely to implement the lowest-cost opportunities we have to reduce operational emissions more broadly. so that is where our primary focus is. we are looking more broadly as well in monitoring. but as you say, at the end of the day, we've got to achieve the three things that ryan laid out.
we have to provide affordable energy to the world. we have to generate returns on and of capital for shareholders, so we have to be very -- continue to be very disciplined and thoughtful about our capital allocation. but we have to do these all sustainably through esg excellence. and i think the key thing here is that we are very committed to our paris-aligned climate risk strategy and the work they're doing is in support of that over the longer term.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from doug leggate from bank of america. please go ahead. your line is open.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everyone. happy new year, everybody. two quick ones.
ryan, my first one is, i don't know to the extent you can answer this, but i'm just wondering if the consolidation opportunity, in your mind, is over. obviously, there was a bit more going on in the s-4, so i think it's the first time there's really a chance to talk about it, the elusive company a that was mentioned. i'm just wondering, where do you stand now in terms of -- are you still looking for additional opportunities as we move through, let's say, the recovery phase?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, thanks, doug. i think our focus is just integrating these two great companies, and that's really the whole focus of the company right now. so i'd say we're not trying to be distracted on anything else other than driving the efficiencies, the cost reductions, the free cash flow growth, and then applying all these best practices and learnings that we have across two great companies to the current company that we have. with that said, no, i don't think m&a is done in this business.
i think you got to continue to drive down cost of supply, you want the best resource in the business, and you got to be the most sustainable company from an esg perspective. and i think continuing to drive out costs in the business is going to be a good thing. so, no. i don't think m&a is over.
and i think we've laid out our framework for how we think about that, but that's not on the radar screen right now relative to our company. we're focused on just driving the best results we can out of the transaction that we did with concho.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. my follow-up, i'm afraid there's another capital allocation question. and it's great to see tim in the room. so i don't know which one of you guys wants to answer this.
but obviously, the federal land exposure of the combined portfolio might change, let's say, where you decide to allocate capital. so as you think about the go-forward portfolio, how do you think about prioritizing capital allocation? and maybe just to a part b to that, what is the right longer-term growth for the combined portfolio? maybe that's a market question.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i mean, what's the right -- i'll take your last one first and maybe let tim talk a little bit about the federal land exposure that you talked about. what's the right level for the company? i think that's something that we work on every day trying to understand. we know there's a ramp-up to an optimized plateau for the whole company and for each one of the individual assets, and that's informed by the market environment that we find ourselves in, the long-term mid-cycle price.
and in what production comes out of that's an output. we're not trying to drive a certain amount of growth, i think, to an earlier question that we had. we're trying to grow free cash flow. we're trying to make sure that we get as efficient as we can, drive as much free cash flow growth as we can.
and we'll take what the macro gives us and that will set a capital allocation, and then we'll make sure that we're developing the lowest cost of supply resources for that capital, and doing that across our global portfolio. i think we've demonstrated that capability and have been really committed to it since we started down the journey as a big e&p company. so maybe let me have tim talk a little bit about your first part, doug, on the federal land exposure.
tim leach -- executive vice president, lower 48
yes. thanks, doug. to reinforce something that ryan said, it's really great to have such strong assets in the lower 48 with eagle ford and bakken and permian and even the montney in canada. so we've got some of the best assets, unconventional assets, in the business, and they're all in different places on this optimized plateau model.
and from very early time to ones that are more fully mature. so as we go through time, that's part of the evaluation is allocating more capital to bring those assets up the plateau model. and that's really what we're working on now on the -- just as a reminder to something you already know, on the federal lease side. we said, short term, what's going on with the federal leases really doesn't affect greatly any of our plans in the short term, we can still deliver on everything that we said we're going to do.
and as a reminder, we've got several decades of non-federal, high-quality drilling locations throughout the portfolio. so it's really a great opportunity to be disciplined capital allocators.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from paul cheng from scotiabank. please go ahead. your line is open.
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
thank you. ryan, just curious that, i mean, we understand that it's probably too early to jump to any conclusion about what biden administration may or may not do. but i think it's sort of highly -- the sort of operating risk of having a concentrated portfolio just in the u.s. so from that standpoint, does it shape your view in terms of the investment that you're going to make over the next five years in u.s.
and in overseas to try and to get some domestication? or you don't think that it really changed your view on that? and that if you do need to, within your portfolio, is that going to make any changes, for example, you previously said argentina will be on the selling for that will be a candidate to be divested. and so does that make those decisions being somewhat different?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, paul. i'd say there's a bit of recency effect with the biden administration coming into the path and putting all these executive orders. so i would caution everybody not to swing the pendulum too far one side to the other. we know we've got a large position in north america when you consider the lower 48, canada, and alaska, we recognize that.
but uncertainty around administrations in fiscal terms and permitting and all that, that really exists all around the whole world. we're kind of going through a little bit of that during the recency of this new administration. so i wouldn't get hung up. and it really -- we take it into consideration, but we're focused on just making sure we got the lowest supply resources.
we're developing those. we do value diversification, as you've described, but we want to make sure it's diverse across our cost of supply mantra. so we're all about diversification, but it's got to be low-cost supply. so we think about that globally.
we think about it when it comes time to allocate capital. and certainly, the company does have a -- we've got a large north american footprint, but we like it, and we've worked with prior administrations to get all our work done, and we've permitted the activity and we do it responsibly and sustainably. so we think we've got a good track record as a company. so i think that's where our focus and attention is at.
now on some of the exploration stuff, as dominic said, we've reduced our allocation to kind of those new venture exploration opportunities from $300 million to $150 million. and that's where places that south america and other places around the world may not compete in the portfolio. so we'll be looking at trying to monetize those and potentially get out of 'em.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from ryan todd from simmons energy. please go ahead. your line is open.
ryan todd -- simmons energy -- analyst
good. thanks. maybe a couple of quick questions on capital allocation. first off, i guess, can you give us any color on relative capital allocation within the $3.1 billion that you plan for the lower 48 in terms of permian versus eagle ford versus bakken or other? and then maybe as a follow-up, you had some pretty material explorations to fix in norway during 2020.
how does that resource compete for capital in your portfolio? how might it be developed? and how do you think about further exploration potential there in the region?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. let me take you first one. no, we haven't split anything out, ryan, in the lower 48. so the $3.1 billion is being allocated to the whole lower 48.
there'll be -- we'll provide more updates down the road as we go through the course of the year. maybe ask dominic to -- he's in charge of exploration, talk a little bit about what's exciting about norway. so yes, we did have some two pretty interesting and exciting discoveries there over the course of the last few months.
dominic macklon -- senior vice president, strategy and technology
yes, ryan. we actually had four successful exploration wells in norway there over the last year and a half. but most notably, the recent two significant discoveries, warka and slagugle, and i'm sure you know slagugle is a norwegian word for a type of owl. but anyway, the warka discovery, both of these are near heidrun.
and so we're really pleased and excited about these. i think both of us -- well, the warka is a gas condensate discovery and northwest of heidrun. our prelim estimates are 50 million to 190 million barrels equivalent. we're the operator there and then the slagugle discovery is even nearer heidrun.
it's oil, and it's between 75 million and 200 million barrels. so we're really excited about that as well, and where they operated there. so we would expect those being in the vicinity of existing infrastructure. we would expect those to be very low-cost supply.
subsea tiebacks is probably what we have in mind. but we have more appraisal work to do. this is a study here. now i might add as well, we have just picked up a couple of new prospects just near warka and slagugle in that area.
so we're really pleased with our norwegian exploration team. but at the end of the day, they'll have to compete in our portfolio. but we expect those will be quite competitive.
ryan todd -- simmons energy -- analyst
great. thanks for your help there.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from dan boyd from mizuho. please go ahead. your line is open.
dan boyd -- mizuho securities -- analyst
hi. thanks for squeezing me in. ryan, if i look back to your last analyst day, and you talked about growth in the -- so i think you're exceeding 3%. i know you've had a lot of questions on the call today about growth.
you don't want to necessarily put a target out there. but if you look at where commodity prices are today, you look at your cash flow generation profile, you would have the ability to grow, i would say, mid to high single digits as we get out 2022, 2023. i don't think the market is actually looking for that type of growth really from any oil and gas company. so can we think about, while you have returning at least 30% cash flow as one number, is there an upper end to growth that we should think about as well?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i don't think -- as you said, the macro is growing, at best, 1%. so i don't think you'd see our company trying to target a growth rate that's high single digit, as you talked about. again, that's going to be an output from our plans, and it only occurs as we deliver at least 30% of our cash back to the shareholder. i'll remind people that we've well exceeded that over the last number of years, and we want to make sure we've got a stronger balance sheet as we can have as well.
so i don't put really growth numbers on it. it's an output to our plans, and that's a function of the macro environment we find ourselves in and how much cash flow we think we're going to have and making sure that we're getting an appropriate amount of return to the shareholder and that the balance sheet stands in a strong position. so it's triangulating around all those issues. and so i think it's foolhardy to put out growth kind of estimates because i don't think they stand the test of time, nor a volatile market environment that we find ourselves in.
dan boyd -- mizuho securities -- analyst
so in other words, if we are above your mid-cycle price, we would expect you to return more cash to shareholders. so if you were -- and as you said, you have returned more than 30%, so we wouldn't be surprised if that number was in the 45% or even 50% range? is that fair if prices were above that at all?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think you just, yes, look at our history, and we value strengthening the balance sheet in the process as well. so i think about those two things.
ellen desanctis -- senior vice president, corporate relations

operator
absolutely. thank you. our last question comes from john freeman from raymond james. please go ahead.
your line is open.
john freeman -- raymond james -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for sneaking me in. just one question for me. when i think about the synergies and cost savings you have already provided that's now at about $750 million.
and you all mentioned how it doesn't include anything yet for the upside on savings from the marketing and leveraging kind of conscious expertise as well as the supply chain benefit. so i guess when we think about the additional details on kind of capital allocation, etc., going forward, that we could get in march. is the thought that by, at that point, you all would be able to sort of quantify the benefits of all that? or is it going to be a little bit too early for that?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
no. i think we'll have more information in march when we provide some more guidance items to the market. we know you need them. we know you need them to calibrate your models.
so you should expect us to be updating the synergies. but those synergies are going to persist throughout the course of the year as we go into 2022. so we're going to be constantly kind of driving them in capturing as much of that as we possibly can. and we'll continue to update the market in march in our quarterly calls and then certainly have a more thorough market update probably toward the end of the year.
operator
thank you. and we have no further questions at this time. i would like to turn the call back over to ellen.
ellen desanctis -- senior vice president, corporate relations

operator
welcome to the first-quarter 2021 conocophillips earnings conference call. my name is hilda, and i will be your operator for today. [operator instructions] please note that this conference is being recorded. i will now turn the call over to ellen desanctis.
ellen, you may begin.
ellen desanctis -- senior vice president, corporate relations
thank you, hilda. hello, and welcome this morning to our listeners. i'll first introduce the members of our conocophillips executive team who are on today's call. we have ryan lance, our chairman and ceo; bill bullock, our executive vice president and chief financial officer; tim leach, our executive vice president of the lower 48; dominic macklon, our svp of strategy and technology; and nick olds, our svp of global operations.
today, several of our executives will make prepared remarks, and then the team will take your questions. before i turn the call over to ryan, a few quick reminders. in conjunction with this morning's press release, we posted a short deck of supplemental material that includes first-quarter highlights, earnings and cash flow summaries, operational highlights, and updated sensitivities. we also announced this morning that conocophillips will host a virtual market update on june 30th.
so save that date, we will be providing details on that meeting shortly. in today's call, we will make some forward-looking statements based on current expectations. actual results could differ due to the factors described in today's press release and in our periodic sec filings. and finally, we'll also refer to some non-gaap financial measures today.
reconciliations to the nearest corresponding gaap measure can be found in this morning's press release and on our website. and with that, i'll turn the call over to ryan. 
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, ellen, and welcome to all our call participants. it's a very busy but exciting time at conocophillips. with the concho transaction now closed, our entire workforce is on a mission to emerge from last year's extreme sector volatility and the transaction integration activities as the strongest competitor in our business. we're viewing 2021 as a catalyst moment like we did in 2016 to improve every aspect of our business and again, step out from the pack by taking our disciplined, shareholder-friendly value proposition to the next level.
we're taking actions across every aspect of the company to improve our underlying drivers, and our first-quarter results represent an early indication of our progress. some of the actions we're taking are transformational, such as capturing synergies, others are chipping away at core drivers to improve efficiency and returns, such as the debt reduction plans we announced this morning. here's what everyone in our organization is focused on. first, we believe a safe company is a successful one.
with the concho transaction, we've combined two industry-recognized safety leaders, which has aided our overall integration. and again, i want to recognize our workforce for their exceptional handling of the many challenges presented by the winter storm uri last quarter. we're continually -- continuously driving to lower the cost of supply of our diverse resource base. we have a deep inventory of the very best rocks, which is a clear source of sustained competitive advantage, and we're always working to further high-grade the portfolio through asset sales but our low-cost inventory loan isn't enough.
we're focused on applying our rigorous capital allocation process to optimize investments based on the metrics investors demand, free cash flow, and returns. we're driving improvements in free cash flow and returns by driving down our sustaining capital through well cost and supply chain efficiencies as well as margin improvement, driving down our cost structure through synergies and balance sheet improvements, driving down our sustaining price through the combination of lower sustaining capital and lower cost structure. and finally, we don't cap the benefit from higher prices, which means upside in free cash flow above our sustaining price. we're only a short time into the concho integration but we're already seeing the previously announced synergies materialize, and we expect to yield additional benefits as our integration progresses.
we remain committed to returning a significant portion of capital to our shareholders with a five-year track record of exceeding our target of greater than 30% of cfo. in fact, our return to shareholders since implementing our returns-focused strategy in 2016 has been 43% of cumulative cfo. so our capital return approach represents a floor on the level of capital returns, not a ceiling. we don't tie our returns to free cash flow like others are doing.
so in other words, investors directly benefit from cfo expansion, including from higher prices when they occur. and as you saw in today's release, we're taking actions to further increase our returns of capital in 2021. in addition to our ordinary dividend and our previously announced $1.5 billion of buybacks, we intend to begin reducing our cenovus ownership stake using proceeds to purchase incremental conocophillips stock. we're taking action to further strengthen our balance sheet.
this morning, we also announced that we're planning to reduce gross debt by $5 billion over the next five years. this will reduce our annual interest expense cost and help lower our sustaining price. and finally, we're focused on leading in esg, especially in emissions reductions. all of this is underpinned by our talented, motivated workforce.
they are the driving force in our progress. you can tell from my comments that we're encouraged by the improvements we're seeing across the company. that's why we announced in today's press release our intention to accelerate our 2021 market update from november to a virtual event on june 30th. now here's what you can expect at that update.
we'll reiterate our disciplined philosophy for the business and how we expect to enhance our through-cycle performance for a volatile price world but also for a more stable price world should that transpire. we'll reaffirm the allocation priorities that have been foundational to our company for years. compared to our plan two years ago, we believe every part of the business has improved. and our goal is to put conocophillips in an even better position to deliver multiple years of free cash flow and returns to shareholders post-concho.
we'll provide an update on our outlook for 2021 and beyond, including our synergy capture progress and our business driver improvements. we'll also provide updates on our asset base and our esg efforts and plans. as i said earlier, it's a busy time for the company, and we're going to take advantage of our momentum to reengage the market sooner rather than later on our compelling future. now let me turn the call over to bill, who will address high-level quarterly results as well as our announced debt reduction and cenovus-cop share plans.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, ryan. well, we're certainly off to a good start in 2021. in today's posted materials, there's a summary of highlights from the first quarter, and i'll cover just a few of those items. as we foreshadowed on our march 31st market update, the financial results reflected some onetime contra-related items.
adjusted for these known items, underlying financial performance was very strong. adjusted earnings were $0.69 per share versus $0.45 per share in the first quarter last year. production came in at the high end of the range, and all producing segments generated positive earnings in the quarter. as shown in the cash waterfall in the supplemental materials posted on our website, first-quarter cash from operations was $2.1 billion and free cash flow was $0.9 billion.
these figures include the cash flow impacts related to previously announced contra-related items, which reduced both cfo and free cash flow by about $1 billion. but even with the roughly $1 billion in onetime transaction-related impacts, our cfo of $2.1 billion very nearly covered capital, dividends, and buybacks. we returned 46% of cfo to shareholders in the quarter in the form of our ordinary dividend and share repurchases and we ended the quarter with $7.3 billion of cash and short-term investments. as a reminder, we issued updated first quarter and full-year 2021 guidance for key business drivers on march 31st.
and today, we provided updated cash and earnings sensitivities. i call your attention to these because our cash flow toward to the upside has improved significantly as a result of the concho transaction. and in a more constructive price world, we're going to differentially capture the benefit of higher prices since we're unhedged, we're liquids-weighted, and we have exposure to diverse markets globally. turning to today's announcements, we view our balance sheet as a strategic asset, just like we do our portfolio of low cost to supply resource.
and our balance sheet is very strong with top-tier leverage due to our low net debt. now of course, our cash balances are a component of our net debt. and given that our borrowing costs exceed the returns on our cash, we plan to put some of that incremental cash to work along with future free cash flow to reduce gross debt by $5 billion over the next five years. this will reduce our ongoing interest expense, lower our ongoing free cash flow breakeven price, improve returns, and create greater flexibility on our overall debt structure, all while maintaining our strong leverage position.
as part of our program, we may refinance some of our high coupon debt to take advantage of historically low interest rates and facilitate the total quantum of our debt reduction over time. next, i'll address the cenovus share monetization plan we announced. as a reminder, we own approximately 10% of cenovus, which is valued at about $1.6 billion today. the shares we received as part of the consideration for our sale of canadian assets to cenovus in 2017, and we've always stated that we did not intend to be a long-term strategic owner of cenovus shares.
over the years, we've looked at several strategies reducing our position, and we believe the market has responded to the positive steps cenovus has taken, including its recent commitments to balance sheet strength and operational efficiencies. we intend to begin selling our cenovus shares in the open market in the second quarter while simultaneously tendering the proceeds in the conocophillips shares. we will be thoughtful and measured with our sales program, as you would expect, with an intention to fully dispose of our cenovus position by the end of 2022. we believe this plan to swap cenovus shares for conocophillips shares aligns well with both our commitment to returning capital to shareholders and to monetize our cenovus position.
taken together, our planned debt reduction and our planned swap of cenovus shares for conocophillips shares further strengthen both our balance sheet and our ongoing ability to consistently deliver differential returns of capital to our shareholders, all while lowering our sustaining price. now i'll turn the call over to tim for an update on the lower 48 business.
tim leach -- executive vice president, lower 48
thanks, bill. we're just a few months into the conocophillips-concho integration process. and like ryan and our other leaders, i'm more excited now than ever to tell you about our vision for the company and the great progress we've already made. i'll do a quick recap of the lower 48 from the first quarter, which was nothing short of historic, not only because of a fast-paced integration activity but because of winterstorm uri.
overall, the storm impacted lower 48 production by about 50,000 barrels a day for the quarter. however, facility damage from the storm was negligible, and we quickly resumed production in march. it was a heck of a test for our expanded lower 48 region. they passed with flying colors.
total lower 48 production for the quarter was 715,000 boes per day, which includes 405,000 in the permian, 187,000 in the eagle ford and 86,000 in the bakken. we exited the first quarter with 15 drilling rigs, 11 in the permian and four in the eagle ford. and we had seven frac spreads, five in the permian and two in the eagle ford. it doesn't get a lot of attention but i also wanted to mention that during the quarter, we executed several innovative pilots across the lower 48, including more than 40 twin frac wells.
electrification of our frac spreads and additional v5 completions. the point is while we're executing the base business, we're also combining the experience of both companies by conducting numerous tests that should yield future efficiency gains. my entire lower 48 organization is excited about the role we can play in making conocophillips, a company that can supply the cheapest, cleanest barrels to the market, successfully navigate the price cycles, achieve the highest level of execution efficiency, and continue to lead the industry on the innovation front. from a size and scale perspective, our lower 48 is clearly differentiated in the industry.
with the acquisition of concho, the lower 48 grew to be about half of conocophillips' production and among the largest domestic producers. we have a high-quality set of assets and a low cost of supply resource base made up of core positions in the three premier tight oil basins in the world. our lower 48 team is focused on capturing the strategic advantages of both concho and conocophillips to make our operations more efficient and drive down sustaining capital with the primary goal of maximizing our cash-generating capacity. we're creating a massive free cash flow machine from our combined business that will contribute toward the company's ability to deliver on its priorities through those cycles.
all of us recognize that the largest opportunity for value creation is going to come from bringing the best out of both companies and elevating the combined conocophillips to a level unachievable by either company on their own. i'm happy to say that the new organization has embraced this challenge and we're seeing even more opportunity than we had initially expected. i couldn't be more pleased with the quality of people we have working on this, starting with the lower 48 leadership team, which consists of both heritage conocophillips and concho leaders. we made it a priority to work closely together and leverage the knowledge base of both very experienced operations.
in fact, we continue to see substantial improvements in our well cost. we have our eyes on additional ways to get more for less. beyond working together to generate the best plan of development and drive efficiencies in our operations, our team is working hard to identify commercial opportunities to improve margins as well as supply chain opportunities to leverage our global scale and drive down cost. i want to leave you with a strong sense of optimism about what the lower 48 can deliver.
we are fully dedicated to extracting the full value of this deal, and i'm looking forward to providing more detail at our midyear market update. and now i'll turn the call over to nick to provide the status of our operations in the rest of the world.
nick olds -- senior vice president, strategy and technology
thanks, tim. while there's clearly a lot going on in our lower 48 business, we believe conocophillips has a significant advantage over our independent peers because we also have diverse global businesses that generate significant free cash flow. today, our alaska and international businesses comprise about 50% of our company's operated 1.5 million barrels per day production. i'll take this opportunity to recap some of the achievements from the first quarter and bring you up to speed on activities we have under way around the globe.
so starting in alaska, i'm pleased to report that greater mooses tooth 2 project has made significant progress over the past several months and facility and construction costs are about 10% below budget as we finish our third and final construction season. the project is expected to be online by the end of this year at approximately 10,000 barrels a day with peak production of 35,000 barrels a day that will leverage our existing alpine infrastructure. we're also back to development drilling on the slope. after suspending virtually all activity in 2020, we are restarting four rigs across our operated assets in alaska.
in the western north slope, we restarted drilling at cd5 and commissioning activities on the new extended reach drilling rig. the erd rig will play a significant role in augmenting alaska's base business, allowing us to drill wells in excess of 35,000 feet, accessing low-cost supply resources while minimizing surface disturbance. so our base alaska business is performing very well, and we've built a strong momentum coming out of 2020. and of course, it's been an eventful quarter for willow.
let me give you a quick update on where that project stands. we continue to progress the front-end engineering and design work while at the same time, taking actions to address the legal challenges that have been recently raised. the 600 million-barrel oil discovery remains very competitive in our portfolio but we won't take final investment decision or make significant long lead investments until the litigation risks have been resolved. now moving to canada.
at montney, we continue to optimize our development plans to incorporate the liquids-rich acreage we acquired from kelt, mid last year. we're leveraging our lower 48 unconventional resource expertise and our reduced drilling costs by 25% over the first four pads. this part of our business doesn't get a lot of external attention yet, but it's worth noting that's currently produced an approximately 30,000 barrels a day, of which 50% is liquids. we continue to be excited about our future in this premier 300,000-acre unconventional position.
at surmont, we continue to take actions to reduce costs, improve netbacks, and reduce emissions, and we're seeing encouraging improvements on all three of these fronts. so in summary, canada remains an important part of our business with quite a lot of upside and learning curve opportunities. now moving to our europe, middle east, and north africa segment. in norway, we've made good progress on several projects, which benefit from the fiscal incentives implemented by the norwegian government last year.
we're nearing completion of tor ii and are on track to make final investment decisions on both tommeliten alpha and kobra east gekko later this year, and work continues to assess our recent discoveries at warka and slagugle. in qatar, our qg3 asset continues to deliver very strong performance and generate free cash flow, and we continue to advance our evaluation of the north field expansion opportunity. we're still very interested in participating in this project if it fits our financial framework. so we'll keep you posted as this plays out.
moving on into our asia pacific region. aplng is running extremely well. production continues to be strong, which when combined with ongoing focus on reducing capital, operating, and financing costs has brought the cash breakeven down to $25 per barrel brent. aplng distributed almost $100 million to the company in the first quarter of 2021 and is expected to contribute about $200 million in the second quarter.
finally, in malaysia, we have several low cost of supply, high-margin bolt-on projects at various stages of development. the malikai phase 2 project achieved first oil in this year and snp phase 2, and gumusut phase 3 are on track for first oil in late 2021 and '22, respectively. so that's a brief update of our global operations. in summary, we have a lot of exciting work under way that will continue to enhance free cash flow generation.
now i'll turn it back to ryan for some short closing comments.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
all right. thanks, team. to wrap up, let me go back to how i started today's call. we're viewing 2021 as a catalyst moment, an opportunity to further own every part of the business and continue leading this sector [audio gap] the aspect of the company to improve [audio gap].
we're looking forward to sharing more on that and what that means for our shareholders when we get together with you again on june 30th. so now with that, let's open it up to q&a.

[operator instructions] we have a question from neil mehta from goldman sachs.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning, team. and i think matt's last day, if i'm not mistaken, was may 1. so if he's listening from the mountain somewhere, i wish him well in his retirement and congratulations to everyone on their promotions.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, neil. rest assured, he's probably listening and greeting us.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
well, good. well, the first question is around cenovus. so you could have approached this, ryan, in a couple of different ways, certainly a block sale, and you elected to do this through the end of 2022. so talk about why you thought this was the optimal way to release the shares into the market? and just a housekeeping question here.
so you got this annualized billion and a half dollar buyback program. but as you're selling cenovus shares, this will be incremental to the baseline billion and a half dollars, right? so this is -- this would be a supplemental to the billion and a half that you've already announced. so two questions there.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, neil. yes, let me handle the last one first, maybe turn it over to bill for a little bit of color on why, but you're exactly correct. so we have the dividend that we're paying.
we announced earlier that we were buying billion and a half of our shares back. and this cenovus swap for conocophillips shares is incremental or on top of the billion and a half dollar that we're currently doing in terms of buying our shares back in. we've looked at this lots of different ways over the course of the last number of years as we've been an owner of cenovus shares, and let me ask bill to kind of give you a little bit of color on why now and why under this sort of plan.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. good morning, neil. so as i mentioned, we've always said that we didn't intend to be a long-term holder of the cenovus shares. and as ryan mentioned, we've looked at several methods.
we did look at block sales, and we considered them. we think the exchange of cenovus shares for cop shares over time in the open market makes the most sense to us. the voice of discounts associated with open -- with block-type transactions, and we think that the market has responded positively due to recent cenovus announcement, so that the exchange ratio for cenovus and cop has really come back to a more historic level. so we see this as an opportunity to, one, trade into the cop shares, which we like the upside on; two, monetize an asset on the balance sheet, which we don't think is a lot of value; and three, give that value back to shareholders.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. that's very clear and thanks for the color, bill. the second is, if you guys can provide some big-picture thoughts on the macro recovery. it certainly seems like the supply side is responding well and prices are firmer but demand is still uncertain.
so, ryan, how are you thinking about the brent price outlook from here and the sustainability of the recovery? any thoughts on the natural gas side -- global natural gas side as well as that's firmed up nicely as well?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, neil. no, we continue to kind of execute the plan that we laid out at the beginning of the year, and it's largely due to our view of the macro, as you kind of described, demand still is off to pre-pandemic levels at, pick a number, 96 million, 97 million barrels a day of demand. spare capacity still exists on the supply side, largely with the opec group, or opec plus.
so we still view kind of 5 million, 6 million barrels a day of spare supply out in the world. so we still have a balancing that we need to do before we kind of see where the price falls out at that point in time and what the call is on, say, u.s. tight oil going forward. so we think it's prudent to kind of stay the course right now and not change.
we also don't want to whipsaw our programs. so we want to be stably executing our programs and driving the efficiencies that tim and nick talked about across the global portfolio with a lot of emphasis on what we're doing here in the u.s., in the lower 48. so until the market gets rebalanced, we're doing all that, watching it before we make any differences as well. so we're positioning conocophillips for any kind of market that we think enters the fray.
so if it is going to be volatile or if it's going to be sort of a sustained more stable kind of price, we're positioned to react to either one of those kinds of markets. it's a bit uncertain with the pandemic and the demand, how quickly that's going to recover. now if you ask us, we believe it's going to recover. we think we probably hit 1 million or so barrels a day of demand later this year.
and on an annual average, we expect 2022 to be at that kind of a demand level. so at that point in time, we would hope the market is balanced on a supply and demand perspective, but it's going to take really the remainder of this year to see that. but our value proposition is pretty firm and also delivering money back to the shareholder like we described. and hopefully, you see from today's announcements that we're enhancing that.
and again, the 30% is our floor. and you look over the last five years, and we've delivered about 43% of our cash back to our shareholders. so discipline matters and returns matter, and so that's what we're all about.

the next question comes from jeanine wai from barclays.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
hey. good morning, good afternoon, everyone. thanks for taking our questions.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, jeanine.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
good morning. thanks. the first question is really on capex. and q1 capex was $1.2 billion versus the full year guide of about $5.5 billion.
so that implies a little over $1.4 billion a quarter on average for the rest of the year. and so we know that it's hard to do ratable capex outside of excel and we can appreciate that, plus there's noise in the q1 number based on concho and weather and a bunch of other stuff. but how do you see activity progressing or ramping throughout the rest of the year, if at all? and we understand that production is an outcome for conoco, but we're just trying to get a better sense of the new steady state now that concho is in the mix.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, yes, jeanine, yes, the first quarter was a little bit artificially low, given exactly what you described as the weather impacts in the lower 48 kind of shut things down for a period of time. and then so the people forget too that we had kind of a -- we had to react to a winter drilling season in alaska that reduced the cap a little bit. so it's not a ratable, you can't just take the first quarter times four but we are driving the teams to greater efficiency and trying to get as much done with the precious capital dollar that we can. we'll provide more of an update in the june update that we've talked about, and then we would say thirdly is we designed this to run stable.
we designed our programs at the beginning of the year and asked our teams to go execute that scope and really not interested in also trying to drive that on a quarterly basis and whipsaw the teams around doing those programs. we just want them to really be efficient and effectively execute the programs that we set out at the beginning of the year, but we'll provide more of an update as we see the year progressing in june.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
ok. great. thank you. we'll wait for that update.
and our second question is just on the debt reduction target. we've got balance sheet enhancement, dividend, buyback, capex, all moving pieces on capital allocation. so maybe can you talk a little bit more about how you picked the $5 billion target over five years? and i noticed that exceeds the amount that's coming to in that time. so maybe something on cadence as well? and i guess, we're just really trying to back into how much cash return is available now that we have a defined gross debt target out there that we need to allocate?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thanks. i can let bill talk specifically about the debt. i would just say, back to my opening remarks a bit, jeanine, is that we're looking at every piece of the business.
we're looking at the portfolio, we're looking at the balance sheet, we're looking at the cash sitting on the balance sheet, and all those pieces of it. and we haven't forgotten about the shareholder. if you saw that today with our announcement on the trade with the cenovus shares and the conocophillips. and again, that's incremental to the billion and a half that we're doing already.
let me ask bill. he can give you a little bit more color on why $5 billion, why five years.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, sure. thanks, ryan. jeanine, so first, i just would start with both heritage conoco and heritage concho had really strong balance sheet, so does this combined company. and in fact, as we look at this, our net debt to cfo consensus is under one time, materially less than our peer group.
but with the contract transaction, gross debt's increased from $15 billion to $20 billion. and we have some legacy high coupon debt that's out there on our balance sheet. so we think this is a unique opportunity to reduce our ongoing interest and lower our ongoing free cash flow breakeven. we think this improves returns.
i think it creates greater flexibility in our debt structure and all this supports our ability to maintain greater than 30% of returns to our shareholders. when you think about why $5 billion? well, that's certainly over what's our natural maturities of our bond ladders would be right now. we've got about $3 billion of bonds retiring over the next five years. so some of that will be early retirements.
and you can see us do that with public tenders, open market repurchases or perhaps a combination with refinancing. all that's going to be taking approach that favors flexibility and optionality. and so in the case of our $5 billion over five years, that is our base case. we think that gives us the ability to moderate the reduction and take advantage of supportive marketing conditions, but you may see this accelerate a bit if efficiencies in the market allow us to do that earlier.
so that's a bit of a context on why we're looking at reducing our debt structure, and how we got to $5 billion and a bit on the pacing.
operator
our next question comes from phil gresh from j.p. morgan.
phil gresh -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yes. hi. good afternoon. i suppose it's a bit of a follow-up to jeanine's question.
there's a lot of excess cash that would be available if you're paying down the $5 billion of gross debt between free cash flow and the cash and the balance sheet and cenovus shares. perhaps some of this, you want to save for the analyst day, but any additional high-level commentary you could share around capital allocation?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, yes, we'll see what the market gives us, phil, over time. i would say, too, that we described to you back in november 2019, how we think about the cash on the balance sheet. there's the operating cash, there's some reserve cash to deal with, the volatility of the market, and then we like to hold some strategic cash as well, and at least we still think the market is going to be quite volatile. so we'll see what the market gives us, but we want to be prepared for any kind of market that we find ourselves in.
and then, thirdly, you should think about some of this cash will make sure this shareholder is fully satisfied based on our past experience and what we've done as a company. and then, thirdly, i would say it's -- we are thinking about some of the future calls, whether that's the -- if we're successful, the north field expansion, what we might do at willow, and we had some exploration discoveries in norway. we hope to be successful in malaysia. so some of that cash, that you might see on the balance sheet will go to some of those projects as well, such that we can be -- we continue to reap all the benefits from the annual free cash flow that we're getting and distribute that back out to the company and to our shareholders.
phil gresh -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. ok. my follow-up would just be, ryan, you made a comment about certain minimum cash levels. how do you think about what that should be today? and then if i could glue in one question around alaska.
do you still target trying to sell down alaska as -- a portion of alaska, as you discussed at the 2019 analyst day? would that be another source of potential cash still?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i think more broadly, the direct answer to your question, phil, is yes, we're still looking at potentially marketing some of the alaska position. but more broadly, i think, with the concho acquisition, we're combing through the portfolio to make sure that we're continually high-grading and take the opportunity of the kind of commodity price environment we find ourselves in, so we'll have more to say on that in june as well. from the various gas positions, i think it kind of came in the first, we think about $1 billion of operating cash and a couple of billion dollars of the -- $2 billion to $3 billion of reserve cash, which is our -- what happens in the market, we can respond. and we can keep our programs running consistently and not with sar programs, so we want to have the cash there to do that.
and then we have strategic cash on top of that, which are for our other uses that i described in your first question.
operator
our next question comes from roger read from wells fargo.
roger read -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hello. good morning.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, roger.
roger read -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
i guess, it's getting beaten pretty hard here, but i'm going to try one other thing on the debt structure here. i mean looking back to where you were in '16, the changes you made pre the concho acquisition, it would appear you're aiming for a lower level of debt. you mentioned lowering breakeven as a component of that. it would seem you could get there by refinancing the debt and bringing the overall interest expense down.
so i was just curious, as you think about it as a part of your capital allocation, right, return to shareholders. granted reducing debt can be seen that way, but i was just curious how it all kind of fit together as the goal of reducing by $5 billion.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, roger. this is bill. i'll take that. yes, certainly.
so as part of our $5 billion debt reduction over five years, i mentioned we've got about $3 billion that's just naturally maturing towers. we are absolutely looking at refinancing a portion of our debt, our purchasing debt in. we like our path to $5 billion but with a high coupon out there, it's possible to refinance. and i think that will just depend on a couple of factors including the cost of debt retired and reissued and how we decided to approach our debt reduction targets.
but certainly, refinancing is a component of the overall debt restructuring and portfolio and it works in combination with considering public tenders or open market repurchases. but you're absolutely right, we could make some really steady progress on that also just by refinancing some of our high coupon debt.
operator
our next question comes from ryan todd from simmons energy.
ryan todd -- simmons energy -- analyst
great. thanks. maybe at a higher level, i mean what are you seeing on capital efficiency and onshore portfolio as we kind of emerge from the pandemic a little bit? and with the addition of concho to the portfolio, do you have an estimate for what you think the maintenance capex is and the right way to think about long-term capital spend? you used to talk about kind of $6 billion to $7 billion a year as a rough range, is that -- has there been any adjustment to kind of what you see as kind of a normalized level of your longer-term capital spend?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. we'll be talking about that, ryan, in june and kind of provide an update relative to what you saw back in 2019. it'd be premature for me to talk about that. i would just tell you, we're constantly trying to drive down our sustaining capital and lower the breakevens in the company.
and i think tim and what we're doing in the lower 48, nick's doing around the rest of the globe, we're seeing a lot of progress, and that goes with the synergy capture that we can talk about, if you like. but all those things are manifesting themselves in lower capex, lower sustaining and lower breakeven.
operator
our next question comes from josh silverstein from wolfe research.
josh silverstein -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks, guys. just on alaska. i know last year was a covid-shortened drilling program. can you talk about all the exploration activity that's taking place this year? and then just again with the timing around willow with the litigation and what needs to happen there to progress that forward.
nick olds -- senior vice president, strategy and technology
yes, josh, this is nick. i want to start with willow -- yes, i apologize, josh. let me start with willow. first, the big focus this year is really to the front-end and engineering design, as i mentioned, as well as detailed engineering.
that's all in related to reducing -- understanding our capital, the schedule and ultimate development considerations that's prior to taking fid later this year. that's the target. as a reminder for the group, they've got two lawsuits that are currently in federal court filed by two environmental groups, challenging the blm and the army core record of decision for the willow project. as you recall as well, we also had all the permits for the 2021 willow construction received in early january.
however, due to the granting of the injunction by the ninth circuit court of appeals, that 2021 activity, which was a very small and modest scope of gravel work has been deferred into 2022. and as all projects, we have scheduled float or the scheduled contingency, josh. so that won't impact the overall time line. in addition to the fee that i just mentioned, the primary focus now relates to the merits of those active lawsuits, and we anticipate a decision by the district court in the third quarter.
i also want to just mention we have significant stakeholder support. as an example, we got state of alaska and the north slope borough have this intervened in the court case supporting the blm record decision. we also have several north slope village councils and tribal organizations who have sent strong letters of support to congress and the secretary of interior. and the last thing i'll just reiterate as part of my opening remarks, we will not take fid or make any significant long lead investments such time as key litigation risks have been addressed.
and finally, willow is just a great investment opportunity, and we have the flexibility to adjust the pace of the project if needed.
operator
our next question comes from stephen richardson from evercore isi.
stephen richardson -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you. ryan, i was wondering if you could expand a little bit on this idea of 2021 as a catalyst moment as you contemplate june 30th in that update. i'm not asking you to kind of preview it, but i think the -- it would seem to us that one of the big differences today at conocophillips relative to the last time you did one of these updates was just the predictability of your portfolio is probably better than it's ever been. so i was wondering if maybe you could reflect a little bit on that predictability.
acknowledging oil price is still the big externality, but the predictability of the business you see internally and how that's informing kind of your longer-term targeting and kind of willingness to think out more than a couple of quarters or even a couple of years?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, stephen, you're right. as we said in the opening remarks, the lower 48 is half the company in terms of production today and the shorter cycle nature of that business is a lot -- is pretty predictable. but i wouldn't -- i'd say we've gotten to a place where we understand in running the base business across the whole world is good, too. and so we understand the portfolio really well, obviously, and know what the prospects look like over the long haul.
you talked about this catalyst moment, it's really focused in what we wanted to convey today. it's every aspect of the business. so we talked about the balance sheet, we talked about returns back to the shareholder, and we talked about the efficiencies that we're gaining in the system, post the concho acquisition. so we're working really on every part, trying to lower the breakeven of the company and still be the best company in this business that can operate in a very volatile environment, and you can still then count on these returns back to the shareholder, and you can count on us hyper-focused and disciplined on returns, not only on capital, but of capital, both.
so i think that's what you'll hear in june. a lot more on that, work on our portfolio, work on what we're doing across the whole company on every lever. we know what investors want. and it's free cash flow and returns, and that's what we're hyper focused on.

our next question comes from doug leggate from bank of america merrill lynch.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
hello, doug?
ellen desanctis -- senior vice president, corporate relations
doug, are you there?
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
can you hear me now, ryan?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. yes. now we've got you, doug. thanks.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes. so it seems i've got a dodgy headset. i apologize for that. so ryan, i'd like to -- i'm afraid, going to be up a little bit on the free cash story here, but also i'd like to kind of frame it a little bit because matt's not here to defend himself.
but if you think about value as essentially your unlevered free cash flow, you -- the decision is ultimately between the balance sheet and equity, the transfer of value between those two. then a buyback implicitly has some view on the value of your company. so i'm kind of curious how low you'd be prepared to take the debt before you step up the buybacks again because clearly, you could do a lot more if you wanted to, of $1.5 billion and where the variable dividend potential sits into that story?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. if i -- sorry, you were breaking up there a little bit, doug, if i understand your question right, how do we make all those balances? i think we're walking and chewing gum at the same time here a little bit. so we're working on all aspects of the portfolio. i think our focus is on trying to just lower the breakeven and lower the sustaining capital to work on the operating side of the business, lower the breakeven, which is reducing our interest expense by taking some of this high coupon debt and bringing it forward, giving us options to take that callable and reduce that in addition to what's coming out over time.
so i think we're trying to do all things. and i think the basic commitment that we've made to the shareholders is we're going to return 30% of our cash or the greater back to you then over time. so we will do that. now the vehicle, and i think part of your question was what's the right vehicle to do that in.
that's, i guess, in the eye of the beholder a little bit. there's not maybe around what the right way to do that is we like the shares given the reduction that it makes in the absolute dividend, the per share metrics that it creates and the -- and our balance is the accepted way that its done. but with that said, we've studied variable dividends and cbds or whatever you want to call them going forward. we spend a lot of time thinking about it.
mathematically, it really doesn't matter. so at the end of the day, the commitment is to return more than 30%. if there's a hybrid in our future, they could be. we'll -- we keep looking at it, and we're not committed to one path to deliver these returns back to our shareholders.
but today, we think our shares are a great value, so -- and we think this conversion from cve to conocophillips shares is an elegant solution to get more back to the shareholder. so we're pretty committed to that.

our next question comes from bob brackett from bernstein research.
bob brackett -- bernstein research -- analyst
thanks for that. most of my intelligent questions have been asked, but i'd like to at least chime in and congratulate matt as well on his retirement. and maybe ask a question around the june 30th virtual meeting. should we expect something like the 2019 meeting, 100-plus slides, a 10-year plan or should we expect more of a modest update?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
modest update, bob.
bob brackett -- bernstein research -- analyst
it felt there was a lot of questions and putting a bit of burden on you all, but glad for that clarification.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. appreciate the question, bob, and we got the clarity out there.
operator
the next question comes from paul cheng from scotiabank.
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
ryan or team, just curious about when do you think that you will, at a stage you believe you will fully integrate the concho asset and that ready to take on this -- other m&a opportunity arise that you would be in a position to say, ""ok, the organization is capable and ready to take on new assets."" and also that -- on that basis that when you're talking to your peers with the commodity prices much stronger and the share performance much better today comparing to a year ago, how is that conversation on the consolidation trend that in the industry has changed? do you think that the consolidation trends are essentially over by now or that still has opportunity? the second question is that when i looked at the full year production guidance of 1.5 million barrels per day, your first half is roughly 1.5 million based on the midpoint of the second quarter. but when we think that second quarter probably has some maintenance downtime, perhaps that a little bit higher than the second half. so is there any reason why the full year or that the second half production will not be higher than the 1.5 million barrel per day implied estimate that you gave? thank you.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, paul. i think if i understand your question, first one was around consolidation and m&a. i think you referred to the integration activities going on with concho, and we're really hyper-focused on that right now and trying to deliver all those efficiencies and the synergy.
and the story is pretty good there. we updated the synergies to 750 million kind of earlier this year, and we still see more opportunity. and most of that is focused in the best practices and capital avoidance in our commercial and in the supply chain. so we're really focused on that, and we'll give an update in june.
so we are really focused on making sure we get the concho assets integrated in. tim is doing a great job with his team in the lower 48 and on the efficiency side. and i think it manifests itself in the performance of the company in the first quarter and in the production performance despite having the impacts from winter storm uri. so maybe this -- i'll have -- nick can also comment a little bit.
we do -- for the rest of the year in profile, we do have some turnarounds coming. so i can let nick refer to that, i think, which is really the second part of your question around what does that profile look like in the last half, for just the last three quarters of the year?
nick olds -- senior vice president, strategy and technology
ok. yes. thanks, ryan. paul, yes, just quickly, the turnaround impacts are very consistent with the prior years.
our heavy turnaround season is in 2q but even more so in 3q. so if you look at 2q, you've got about 15,000 barrels a day in 2q. that's mainly norway maintenance work. and now if you look at 3q, it's about 25,000 barrels a day, so we see higher downtime.
and that's mainly in our western north slope alpine assets as well as greater crude oil bay. again, this maintenance cross. so 15,000 and 25,000 2q, 3q, respectively. and that has been included in our guidance.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
and i probably didn't fully answer your question, paul, sorry, but i don't think m&a is done in our business. i still think there is consolidation that will occur and needs to occur. there's too many players and it's more difficult at these kinds of prices, clearly, but i won't be surprised if you see more of it in our industry because i think it still needs to take place.
operator
our next question comes from john freeman from raymond james.
john freeman -- raymond james -- analyst
good afternoon. just a follow-up on stephen's question earlier, where following the concho merger, lower 48 makes up half the company's production and again, realizing that your primary focus is just on low-cost supply. but just sort of how you think of kind of the long-term balance you're kind of striving for with the short cycle versus long cycle production? obviously, you're benefiting tremendously with the uptick in the short-cycle production, just as the oil price has had a big move. just maybe longer term, how you think about the balance? and does it -- does the answer change at all based on the commodity environment?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, not really. i think we're hyper-focused on cost of supply. we're pretty agnostic to gas, oil, short, long, which is why we're interested in the north field's expansion in qatar and continue to have interest in that and continuing to add to and then improve our lower 48 operations. so i'd say we are really -- we don't really have an ideal blended mind that we're trying to drive to over time.
we're pretty agnostic and just focused on the best rocks because they deliver the best returns. that's the competitive advantage in this business.
operator
our next question comes from leo mariani from keybanc.
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
just a couple of quick questions here for you. certainly, i just noticed that your first quarter of '21, permian production was very strong. if i did the math right, looks like it was up about 317,000 barrels a day versus the fourth quarter of '20, which looked to be well in excess of the contribution from the concho, which i think closed kind of mid-january here. just trying to get a sense of what kind of drove that very strong performance? was there maybe like a larger group of wells that maybe came on in such fashion that you saw this bunch of upside in the production? is it stronger well performance, kind of what drove that here in the first quarter?
tim leach -- executive vice president, lower 48
yes, leo. this is tim. we were projecting entering the first quarter at a pretty hot rate coming out of last year. and then with this storm that slowed the capital down, but didn't really slow too much of production that was coming in from of our carry on activity.
and so i think as ryan said, you'll see kind of a more steady approach throughout the rest of the year. but yes, it was an excellent quarter. everybody is just -- and all the regions are hitting on all cylinders, so i'm really pleased with the performance.
operator
our next question comes from raphael dubois from societe generale.
raphael dubois -- societe generale -- analyst
the first one is on the north field expansion. with so many players earmarked with the rest, can you tell us a bit more about how you can get involved in this project? it cannot just be about the price tag you're willing to accept, i guess. so what are you going to bring to qatar that will make them accept to work with you? that would be my first question, please.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, raphael, i think it goes back to our long-standing commitment to qatar, and we're in train 6 qatargas 3 project, been there for a long time, and i think we've demonstrated the value. we have a water center in qatar. so we've had strong relationships with the qataris. and to your point, it's not only about sort of the bid level, it's about the long-term relationship and this past relationship, the historic relationship that you've had.
so they've been a great partner, a great owner to deal with. so i also think just like anybody and our competitors, we rely on the history that we've got in the country and the opportunity that sits there, then we'll have to be competitive in our bid, and -- but this has to work for us. so it has to be competitive in our financial framework. so it cuts both ways.
raphael dubois -- societe generale -- analyst
great. and i have to ask you an esg question. i understand you have this net zero emission target by 2050. you gave an intermediate target for 2030.
can you -- without pre-empting too much with what you will tell us in june, how to bridge the gap between 2030 and 2050? do you really have an idea of what then will be another layer for absolute reductions? and what will be the offset -- the use of offsets that you will be contemplating?
dominic macklon -- senior vice president of strategy and technology
yes, raphael. it's dominic here. so i mean, i think the -- there's really two main thrusts there. the first is that we have a tremendous amount of work going on around the business units around reducing emissions.
this year, we have about 50 projects, reducing our scope 1 and 2 emissions by $80 million. some great examples across lower 48 and around the world. but in addition to that and just sort of incremental gains each year, we have launched our low-carbon technologies team, and that's very much in support of our paris-aligned climate risk strategy. their primary focus is to those opportunities most relevant to our core business to support this and also to our core competencies.
so areas of focus include renewable power sources to further reduce the emissions intensity of our operations, that's our scope 1 and 2; carbon capture use and storage, and also carbon offsets -- areas of initial focus. so i think that these are the areas that we're looking at right now, and we expect to develop those very much through the coming years.
ellen desanctis -- senior vice president, corporate relations
hilda, this is ellen. we'll take one final question, if you don't mind.
operator
the question comes from neal dingmann from truist securities.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks for squeezing me in. maybe a question for you or tim, just given you've talked about all the debt repayment you're doing, and i was looking, obviously, you've still got a massive lower 48 portfolio, my question is -- and thirdly, to add even to that, we've seen some very outstanding sales most recent with the smaller bakken one, just in the last day or so. my thought is pertaining to your bakken, i noticed tim mentioned i don't think any rigs running in that area. would you think about bringing forward either value from that or any other assets forward, given the large size of your entire international portfolio?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i mean, we're looking over everything, neal. so that globally and here in the u.s., i think post the transaction with concho, we want to make sure that every asset is competitive in the portfolio and we're not lost on the fact that it's a reasonable market right now for sales. so you'll hear more about that in june.
ellen desanctis -- senior vice president, corporate relations
hilda, i think we'll go ahead and wrap up, if you don't mind. give our listeners any closing instructions. i appreciate everybody's time and attention. we'll see you in june.

2021-Q2,COP,2021-08-03 12:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good morning, and welcome to the quarter-two 2021 conocophillips earnings conference call. my name is sanera, and i'll be the operator for today's call. [operator instructions] i will now turn the call over to ms. ellen desanctis.
ellen, you may begin.
ellen desanctis -- senior vice presiden, investor relations
thanks, sanera. good morning, and welcome to our listeners. we have the following executives on today's call: ryan lance, our chairman and ceo; bill bullock, our executive vice president and chief financial officer; tim leach, executive vice president of the lower 48; and dominic macklon, our senior vice president of strategy and technology; and nick olds, our senior vice president of global operations. given our recent june 30 market update, we plan to keep our prepared remarks very short this morning and then, as sanera mentioned, we'll begin our q&a session.
two correlated logistics. some of today's speakers are participating virtually. we've done our best to ensure everything runs smoothly on the technology front. also because we want to give as many people as possible a chance to ask questions during today's call, please don't get offended if you get cut off.
you can jump back into the queue where you can reach out to investor relations any time after the call. finally, a few reminders. in conjunction with this morning's press release, we posted a short deck of supplemental material that includes second-quarter earnings and cash flow summaries, some guidance items and our cash flow sensitivities. and then finally, in today's call, we'll make some forward-looking statements based on current expectations.
actual results could differ due to the factors described in today's press release and in our periodic sec filings. i'll also refer to some non-gaap financial measures today. and as usual, reconciliations to the nearest corresponding gaap measure can be found again in this morning's press release and on our website. thanks, and now i'll turn the call over to ryan. 
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, ellen. today's quarterly results come right on the heels of our june 30 market update, during which we again laid out a compelling multiyear outlook for the company. the update was widely followed and we received some pretty positive feedback. as you'd expect, given the recency of our update, there isn't much incremental news to share at this time, except to say we remain convinced it was timely and relevant, given the ongoing volatility we're seeing in the sector.
and today, we're pleased to follow it up with the very strong quarterly results we announced this morning. as you'll recall, we kicked off our update by declaring that we believe we're at a defining moment for the e&p sector and that persists today. oil equities have been especially volatile recently, in part due to uncertainties in the macro and because we know investors need to see evidence that sector discipline will hold and returns on and of capital will follow. it's clear to us that long-term sector sponsorship requires leadership on the part of companies, as well as conviction on the part of investors.
of course, for investors, the case for these equities requires a reasonably constructive macro view. the case for equities also requires conviction around a micro view. in other words, who is best positioned for the cyclical business realities and who has a track record of execution and performance and who can truly lead in esg. most companies are espousing the virtues of discipline, and everyone now looks better coming out of the 2020 downturn.
the questions investors need to consider is, who can deliver consistent returns-focused performance through thick and thin? that's where leadership matters. in june, we met this defining moment with a credible and highly investable plan that generates massive free cash flow and returns of capital with financial returns that are competitive with the s&p. the leadership requires more than setting expectations and plans. it also requires successfully executing them.
execution is where the rubber meets the road. conocophillips offers a unique combination of a credible and compelling investment plan with a commitment to strong ongoing execution. you saw that -- you saw the plan in june, and today, you see the execution. in other words, you're seeing the june plan at work.
this morning's release and supplementary information provided details on this quarter's performance so i won't restate them. but here are a few key takeaways and themes that i want to underscore. during the second quarter, the business ran extremely well. our planned turnaround activity went smoothly, as did our ongoing core programs across the company.
these include activities in the north american channel plays, as well as in the multiple programs in our alaska and international regions. while we're talking about execution, i'll also mention that we continue to make good progress on more than 50 emission reduction projects that we have underway this year. every part of our business has a role in delivering our results, and i'm proud of our team for their accomplishments during a very busy year. overall, this quarter's financial results were really quite straightforward.
the noise of 2020's market upheavals and most of the concho transaction adjustments are behind us. and the known deal integration synergies and streamlining impacts we discussed in june are showing up in our performance. we're on track to meet the updated 2021 guidance we issued a month ago, but we're not done, not done with our efforts to continue driving the operational and underlying efficiencies the team has described in our june material. we can't ignore that higher benchmark prices were a factor in this quarter's sector performance broadly and certainly, conocophillips specifically.
however, what is somewhat unique to conocophillips is that our results demonstrate the capacity of our company to capture the benefit of higher prices when they do occur. that's because we're unhedged, we're diversified and we're almost entirely intact in royalty regimes. now a year ago, we demonstrated just how resilient we are to low prices. 12 months later and post-concho transaction, this quarter gives you a sense for the upside toward we can realize when prices exceed the reference prices we showed you just one month ago.
the clear bottom line, conocophillips works differentially through the cycles. cash from operations of $4 billion more than covered our capital expenditures of $1.3 billion and distributions of $1.2 billion in the quarter. and importantly, we continue to meet and exceed our target of returning greater than 30% of our cfo to our shareholders. we announced another increase to our 2021 distributions in june, bringing our total planned returns of capital to about $6 billion for the year, representing almost 8% of our market cap today, while other companies are only announcing or just reactivating such programs.
and of course, as bill described in our market update, if prices continue at current levels, we would expect to have additional cash that could go toward greater distributions. and for reference, we estimate full-year 2021 cfo at $50 per barrel wti would be about $11 billion after adjusting for the one-time concho transaction-related impacts. and you can do the math on our sensitivities at roughly $300 million per $1 per barrel change in prices. at this time, we still believe our distribution allocation of nearly 3% yielding ordinary dividend and share repurchases is a very sound mix, but we continue to evaluate the issue and we want to engage with the market on alternative allocations.
we know there isn't a perfect answer but we know what matters, and that's a credible commitment to return capital and a solid track record of reliable performance, which we've certainly delivered now for multiple years. so to summarize, we have a great shareholder-friendly business model and plan. we're hitting our stride after a busy time and putting the execution runs on the board. we're maintaining our discipline.
the company is running extremely well, and we're not done with our work to improve underlying financial returns on capital employed. that's the goal. that's how we enlist long-term market sponsorship and that's what conocophillips is all about. we're pleased to be where we're at here at midyear but we recognize the year is still young.
looking forward to the second half of 2021, our priorities are squarely focused on executing our remaining plans and programs for this year. meanwhile, we're closely watching how the macro evolves and beginning our internal process of setting our 2022 budget and capital plan. we'll stay actively engaged with the market and look forward to ongoing discussions about how our plans are progressing. so let me turn the call over to the operator and we'll begin the q&a portion of the call.
",":
operator
absolutely. thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from neil mehta from goldman sachs. please go ahead.
your line is open.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning, team. two quick questions for me. first one for you, ryan, just your perspective on m&a in this current market. you did a terrific transaction last year.
but how do you think about the opportunity set that's out there for either buying and selling? and the other one, this might be for bill, it's just related to the quarter itself. was it a relatively clean quarter? can we just simply say $4 billion of cash flow minus capex and then annualize that free cash flow implies about a mid-teens type of free cash flow yield? but want to make sure that we weren't missing any pieces here to the positive or negative, that would be more one-time in nature.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, thanks, neil. i'll start on the m&a side, i'll let bill chime in on your second question. when we think about the market, our approach is to constantly know what assets that we like, and we constantly are reviewing the portfolio to look at the pieces inside the portfolio that are uncompetitive. so we're constantly screening opportunities to both buy and sell assets and we're constantly trying to high-grade the portfolio.
i think the environment that we see today, certainly, it feels like more assets tend to come to the market. but i don't think that makes it necessarily a buyer's or a seller's market today. i think what matters to us is just to keep at the rigor and the discipline that we've described back in 2019. we continue through today and continue through the concho transaction that we did earlier back in january.
and that's just the rigor of our disciplined framework around cost of supply and value and simply being patient, neil. i think the market may require that even now more than ever. so i think that's a bit about how we think about the inorganic side of the business. now maybe turn it over to bill and he can comment on the cash flow.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. good morning, neil. this is bill. it was a very clean quarter on a cash basis.
it was clean for both cash and it was clean for both earnings. as you're looking at your run rate, i'd point you to just two items to consider though. the first one, and we mentioned this in the press release is that we did make a $200 million discretionary pension plan contribution in the second quarter. that reduced our second-quarter cfo, and the contribution increased the pension plan's funding status above 90% and that eliminated the need to pay the pbgc premium payments.
it also leads to reduced financial statement volatility for the pension and reduces some of our go-forward funding requirements. so that really did make good sense for use of cash to us in the quarter. and so i draw that to your attention as a reduction in run rate. and the other one that i point out as you're thinking about run rates would be our aplng distributions.
we received distributions of $250 million from aplng in the second quarter. that brings year to date about $350 million. and we anticipate about $100 million in the third quarter and $700 million for the year. so just as a reminder, we typically receive lower distributions in the first and third quarters and higher distribution in the second and fourth quarters as you're thinking about the run rates on that.
and that -- those aplng distributions are pretty locked in for the year because of long-term lng sales, lng are price lagged and so there's very little sensitivity to that for the remainder of the year. and so as you're thinking about how to look at run rates for the rest of the year, i direct you to our sensitivities that we provide, those still hold. and a good rule of thumb is about $300 million annualized cash flow for every $1 million change in wti. and with those, you ought to be pretty bang on with cfo sensitivities.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
all right. makes it easy. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question is from roger read from wells fargo. please go ahead. your line is open.
roger read -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yeah. thank you. good morning, and congratulations on the quarter. it's interesting, ryan, you kind of mentioned looking across at the industry overall, an easier quarter for companies to do well.
so let's maybe ask the question, what are some of the things that may become headwinds as we think about some of the inflationary issues that may be creeping up out there? what you would do to offset that and what you think maybe will allow you to continue to separate from some of those companies we look over the next several quarters?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, roger. i can provide some comments. maybe dominic can add a little bit of color to that as well.
i think if you're a pure-play one-basin kind of operator, you're probably going to experience certain categories of spend that are inflating. i think the advantage that conocophillips has right now is we're still capturing a lot of the best practices and the synergies from the concho transaction plus the fact that we're a global diversified company. so other areas around the world are not inflating maybe like some of the economies that are leading the recovery from the covid pandemic. so i think we're able to differentiate ourselves in that regard pretty clearly.
we think it's imminently manageable this year and as we go into next year. and i would add one other thing that seems to be missing a little bit from the conversation, and i mentioned it in my opening remarks, and that's the unhedged nature of our portfolio. i'm just surprised to hear the analysts aren't asking the question to the e&ps that are hedged, what happened. you could -- there could even be more cash flow if you hadn't hedged your position.
you shouldn't expect that from conocophillips. we'll get the torque from the upside on the prices as we described in my opening comments. but dominic, i don't know if you have any more you can add to the inflation part of roger's question.
dominic macklon -- senior vice president of strategy and technology
thanks, ryan. yeah, roger, i think ryan's covered it very well. i mean, i think the important point is that we still have wind in our sails from the transaction. i mean, we did give our last synergy update on at -- the market update of over $1 billion, and we said, well, that would be the last time we will give that scorecard.
but that does not mean we are done with sourcing supply chain efficiencies and operational efficiencies. so we really still have wind in our sails on that. i mean, we -- of course, we are seeing some inflation in tubulars, cement in the lower 48, some pressure on frac crews. but like ryan said, being a global company really helps because we're still seeing deflation in certain categories internationally.
so i think that's an interesting question. and i think it really is because we still have the momentum coming out of the transaction. we do think we're well placed to manage inflationary effects. so --
roger read -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
i appreciate that, and i imagine the hedging and the unhedging comes back to the balance sheet strength that you've been able to maintain. so congratulations on that. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from ryan todd from piper sandler. please go ahead. next question.
ryan todd -- piper sander -- analyst
ok. thanks. good morning, everybody. maybe a couple ones here.
i know that we've discussed this frequently in past quarters and on the recent analyst day. but obviously, you continue to generate far more free cash than you're targeting to return to shareholders via dividends and buyback. should the environment remain supportive, can you talk a little bit about the potential impact to pace of debt reduction versus share buybacks as you look forward? would you pay down debt just far more quickly than the five-year original target that you had given or ramp up the buyback more aggressively? any thoughts there? and then maybe a second follow-up. this is the first quarter that we saw the combined performance of the legacy conoco portfolio and the acquired concho assets without some of the one-off noise that we saw during the first quarter.
and the outcome was outstanding, and i think your lower 48 business certainly exceeded our estimates quite materially. i know maybe hard at this point, but can you talk through some of the things that may be exceeding expectations, either in terms of cost, well performance, capital efficiencies or marketing efforts?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. thanks, ryan. i'll -- maybe some comments. i can let bill, and tim obviously can chime in on the lower 48 a little bit.
i'd say at a high level, the debt reduction plan that we announced in our june market update, trying to take the gross debt off over the next five years. that still remains our target and our goal. shouldn't -- we're not right at this point, trying to increase that or necessarily accelerate that. we're going to have some natural maturities that will retire and then we'll do some optimization of the debt.
bill can provide a few more details about that. but i think as we think through the commodity tailwinds that are in there right now, beyond the plans that we talked about to the balance sheet, we feel pretty comfortable that those are in place, so any incremental ought to be returns of capital back to the shareholder. maybe bill, if you want to add anything to that and then i can let tim chime in about the performance in the lower 48.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. sure, ryan. so we do have about $1 billion in debt maturities that will be coming due before the end of 2022. you should expect us to retire that debt as it comes due.
and as we've previously said, any potential debt refinancing and reduction will depend on multiple factors, including cost to retire debt, cost to issue debt and how we decide to approach that broader debt reduction target. but we're in a really strong position with the balance sheet right now. and so i think you should expect us to be patient in evaluating market conditions as we continue to consider transactions to reduce our debt portfolio.
tim leach -- executive vice president, lower 48
yeah. i think the only thing i'd have to add to that is as we've communicated in the market update, my excitement about the performance of the lower 48 couldn't be higher. when you take the different levels of technology that we're applying to a broader set of really, really good assets, my expectation is that the efficiencies we're getting out of our business, the performance of our business would just continue. so it's a real driver of cash flow and value creation.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from doug leggate from bank of america. please go ahead. your line is open.
kalei akamine -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. this is kalei on for doug. a couple of questions for me, maybe first off on m&a. evident by the concho acquisition, obviously, conoco has an affection for permian assets at the right price, in the right locations, etc.
so there are no holes in conoco's permian position today. so there's no need to fill. but the question is whether you would consider a large bolt-on acquisition at the right price. and if you would, what would that bring to the table for conocophillips?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, thanks. so i think as we, i think, i answered earlier, we have a pretty rigorous discipline kind of framework for how we think about acquisitions. we know the assets in the areas that we really like. and you shouldn't be surprised if we're looking at opportunities that are consistent with that framework and contiguous to where we operate, but they have to compete within our cost of supply framework and the discipline that we've brought to that and the patience that we've done, both on the buying and the selling side.
so i would look at our history, our performance, what we've done not just in the permian but alaska, canada and elsewhere around the portfolio. so we're pretty -- we think about it pretty consistently, and that's how we look at those kinds of inorganic opportunities.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from phil gresh from j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
your line is open.
phil gresh -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yes. hi. good afternoon. two questions for me.
one, i guess, a bit of a follow-up just on uses of cash. you have nearly $9 billion of cash and short-term equivalents on the balance sheet right now. as you said to ryan's answer, you aren't really looking to reduce debt at this point in time. so how do you think about this optionality? is there a trigger you're looking for to return even more cash back to shareholders? or would you rather be linear and just have the optionality of the cash on the balance sheet? and then the second question, just on big 3, could you give us your latest update of where you stand with rig counts and frac crews by basin and how you're thinking about activity levels for the second half of the year? thanks.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
all right. thanks, phil. i'll let tim kind of chime in on the big 3. yeah, as far as uses of cash, we've communicated before and broadly, we like to carry some of the cash on the balance sheet for strategic and reserve and operating purposes, and we've described that in quite a lot of detail in the past.
i think with the commodity price environment that we're seeing today, the balance sheet's in great shape, as bill described earlier on the last question. so i think as we get incremental free cash flow above and beyond our means, we're not necessarily looking to continue to build a lot of cash on the balance sheet. shareholders should expect that they start getting incremental returns, if the -- if our view of the commodity prices continues to hold. we've seen how volatile that can be and the fact that the market is still pretty imbalanced.
demand is yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels, and you got arguably 5 million or more barrels a day of spare supply sitting in the market. so we still expect quite a lot of volatility, which is why we like the strength of the balance sheet that we have today and holding some cash on that balance sheet. and we'll continue to watch that macro market, which will inform our distribution strategy going forward. maybe, tim, you could comment on the details around the lower 48 rigs and frac spreads.
tim leach -- executive vice president, lower 48
sure. just as a reminder, in the lower 48, we invested about $1.5 billion so far in the first half of the year. we expect that investment rate to stay steady throughout the remainder of the year. we're currently running 15 rigs in the lower 48, 11 in the permian, four in the eagle ford.
and we're running seven frac spreads, four in the permian and three in the eagle ford. and we expect those levels of activity to remain pretty constant throughout the rest of the year, one of the big benefits of the size and scope that we have. we also have various rigs running with our other operating partners in the big 3, and we're keeping a close eye on that to see and try to model what that activity is doing.
ellen desanctis -- senior vice presiden, investor relations
sanera, we'll take the next question.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from paul cheng from scotiabank. please go ahead. your line is open.
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning or good afternoon. two questions. first, deferred tax, can you discuss about how that as a potential source of fund in your cash flow statement over the next several years? how is that progression is going to look like, given the current commodity price environment? the second question is why i don't know if you can give us some -- maybe share some market insight that what you see from the private producer, the operator there.
i think the publicly traded company, the capital discipline are pretty good, but we are concerned about the activity level in the private side. what are you seeing there?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. let me -- you broke up there a little bit, paul. i think your first question was around debt and the last question around private operators. i think --
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
the first question is relate to the deferred tax and how that, as a source of cash, source of cash flow for you guys over the next several years, given the current commodity prices.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, ok. thank you. sorry. thanks for the clarification, paul.
i can let bill talk about the way we view deferred taxes over the course of the plan that you're referring to. and i guess in general, to your second one, on the private side, they are representing about 45-or-so percent of the rigs that are running in the tight oil plays in the lower 48 today. but they only account for about 22% of the current production of about roughly 7 million barrels a day, probably increases the bid because they are pretty active, to your point. i think generally, as we think about it going forward, they run out of some of their best acreage over the next couple of years.
so we don't see them having an outsized impact on the growth coming from the tight oil and being a dominant driver to u.s. production growth. that's really going to depend on the strong public companies like conocophillips that have the best rocks and the higher-quality rock versus the private companies. so i think that's really the area to continue to focus on.
although we see, as well as you do, in the short term, some of the incremental production that's coming out of the private operators. we're certainly taking advantage of the commodity price environment that don't have maybe the investor pressure on discipline and returns of capital back to their shareholders while they're trying to increase the value of their properties as they go forward. so while a short-term thing, we don't think it will be a long-term driver to what the u.s. tight oil play looks like.
so let me ask bill to chime in on the deferred tax question.
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
yeah. before that, one, can i just ask that there's some industry consultants forecasting the private operator, they may be able to grow production by 0.5 million barrels per day next year or the next year -- the next couple of years. do you believe that?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
that would probably be way at the upper end of our estimate, paul. i don't think we would view that much. we would probably be half or so of that kind of an estimate at their current kind of rig load.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from neal dingmann from truist. please go ahead. your line is open.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
we probably have one follow-up with paul that bill can ask -- maybe if i could just actuate and bill can address paul's other question.
ellen desanctis -- senior vice presiden, investor relations
yeah, sanera, hang on a second. we're going to break in with the answer to paul's second question. sorry, neal, we'll get right back to you.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, paul, it's bill. on deferred taxes, if you look at -- for this quarter, we had about $360 million of deferred taxes as a source of cash this quarter. that's primarily due to utilizing our u.s. tax loss carryforwards this quarter.
but if you look back to what we showed at the market update in june, the deferred taxes really are not a material component of that $70 billion worth of free cash flow we showed at reference prices at $50 wti. and we would expect that all of our significant businesses would be in a tax-paying position at that reference price by about 2024. now should the current prices continue, we'd expect to move into a tax-paying position a bit earlier, maybe late 2022 or 2023 at current prices compared to 2024. but under normalized $50 barrel prices, deferred taxes really aren't a source of tailwinds for us.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, sanera. now we go to neal. sorry, neal. thank you.
operator
thank you. my apologies. neal, please go ahead. your line is open.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
sure. thank you. the two i had was just first on in the marketing, you guys have done a great job continuing the marketing. just wondering the opportunities you see there either to export oil or other market opportunities you would see to potentially see higher differentials.
and then just as a second, a lot's been talked about, obviously, your great debt repayment. i'm sorry, your debt -- i would say, your share repurchase. is that the primary sort of free cash flow now item over debt repayment or they sort of coexist? those are the two i have. thank you.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, neal. i think, yeah, on your first one, we've got export capacity for some of our oil coming out of the u.s. lower 48.
and in fact, we're doing some direct marketing with our commercial organization that has been an uplift to our margins and netback prices. so we continue to see that as an opportunity and have a longer-term goal to continue to grow that capacity and to be able to access some of those unique opportunities in the export market. and in fact, not even going to traders, they pick it up at the short line but going direct customer to customer, given some of our relations primarily in asia and in southern south america as well. so that's an opportunity for us as well.
on your second question, we announced our gross debt reduction plan, and that's consistent and equally important to the share repurchases that we're doing today. once we obviously get through that debt optimization plan that we're doing, then returns of capital back to the shareholder would dominate. but right now, it's -- we are in a dual track of looking at, as bill described, retiring some of our near-term debt maturities and then doing some optimization of our debt in the balance sheet as market conditions continue to provide the right opportunity to do that.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks. great way to look at it.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jeoffrey lambujon from tudor, pickering, holt. please go ahead. your line is open.
jeoffrey lambujon -- tudor, pickering, holt & co. -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question. just one for me on return of capital, which you've been very clear about in terms of plans and very consistent about in terms of exceeding those plans. as we think about the multiyear outlook and the target that you put out for aggregate cash returns, can you just remind us what some of the guideposts are as you think internally about nailing down forms for that capital return in a given year? whether that's an optimal level for the dividend that you and the board consider or if it's free cash flow metrics above a certain threshold that keep buybacks even further front and center over any consideration of a variable? just trying to look for any parameters that can help us understand the thought process and how discussions have been with shareholders.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, jeff. i think i go back to our original sideboards of the fairway that we've described to the -- to our shareholders to our owners is that you should expect greater than 30% of our cash returning back to our shareholders. that's on a quarterly and an annual basis.
and if you look back at our history in the last five years, that's averaged over 40%. so i think -- and that's really the differentiation between our model for return of capital back to shareholders and maybe some of the others that we've been reading about and that we've been hearing about because it's not free cash flow-based. it is cfo-based. so as cfo grows because commodity prices are up, the shareholders should expect to get more distribution.
now we've chosen the -- in our ordinary dividend, we've said we want to be competitive. we want to grow that competitively with the s&p. that's how we're measuring ourselves. that's how we're measuring our performance of return on capital, and that's how we're measuring our performance of return of capital with respect to the ordinary dividend.
and then -- but we want that ordinary dividend to be resilient through the cycles. so we don't want to -- we want to be able to afford it at the low end of the cycle, which we demonstrated last year through the pandemic. and then we recognize, as we get additional torque that we described with higher prices, because our cash flow is going to grow and our returns to our shareholders should grow as well. you should expect that to come.
and at a minimum, it's going to be 30%. so it's not a free cash flow-based model. we think about it as a cfo-based model. and as i said in my opening remarks, we continue to watch what the best distribution channel, maybe it's a combination, maybe it's a hybrid down the road.
we'll continue to watch that. but today, we feel like our shares are a great buy in the market. so the channel that we've chosen right now at this 10 seconds is to the strong ordinary dividend. it's yielding what it is today, combined with returning -- meeting our threshold of greater than 30% through the share buyback channel.
jeoffrey lambujon -- tudor, pickering, holt & co. -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
thank you. we have another question from doug leggate. please go ahead. your line is open.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you. i apologize, folks, if i --
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
the real doug.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
there's a number of calls going on, ryan.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i understand, doug.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i hate -- we need to get you guys to coordinate a little better. i'm kidding. their fault, not yours. so joking aside, ryan, forgive me, i'm going to hit on the dividend question again.
i want to preface couple of examples. so bp announced the dividend increase. their shares are up 6%. shell announced the dividend increase.
their shares on the day were up fairly significantly. i guess my point is that it seems, to us at least, that market recognition of value tends to be through the dividend channel more than the buyback channel. you guys have done a phenomenal job of resetting your portfolio. you were spending $15 billion prior to the dividend cut.
and today, you've got better free cash flow power on a third of the spending. why not go back to a bigger dividend that the market will pay you for?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, doug, i think we've learned through the past history and you referenced the reductions that we made coming out of the downturn in 2014 and 2015, that experience is there. and we got to make sure the ordinary dividend is reliable, it's consistent, it's predictable, it's transparent, it's global over time and it works through the cycles. and through the cycles is an important distinction here. so a lot of the people that you've talked about raising the dividend have come out of the period where they cut it pretty dramatically and maybe growing it back to a place that works through the cycles.
we feel like we've done that heavy lifting over the course of the last four to five years. and we're in a place now where we're comfortable with the ordinary dividend. and like i said, we want to be competitive with the s&p 500 as we go forward. but i pivot back to what's important is the shareholders are going to get 30% of our cash flow or more on an ongoing basis.
so you will get it. and maybe today, cash return is, to your point, a little bit more in favor than buybacks. i could point to a couple of years ago where that wasn't the case. i don't know what that case will be six or 12 months from now, but we're open to it.
we're looking at it, we're evaluating it. and you'll hear more from us about that particular piece of it as well. but today, i think our shares are a pretty good buy.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
well, forgive me if i keep pounding on this issue, but i think your portfolio capital efficiency can support it, in our view, and i don't think you're getting rewarded for it. so i'll keep pounding on that, ryan, if that's ok. thanks so much for taking my question.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, i hear you, doug. thank you.
operator

2021-Q3,COP,2021-11-02 12:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good morning, and welcome to the q3 2021 conocophillips earnings conference call. my name is sanara, and i'll be the operator for today's call. [operator instructions] i will now turn the call over to ms. ellen desanctis.
ellen, you may begin.
ellen desanctis -- senior vice president, corporate relations and investor relations
thank you, sanara, and welcome, everyone, to the third quarter earnings call. in the room with me today are ryan lance, our chairman and ceo; bill bullock, our executive vice president and chief financial officer; tim leach, our executive vice president of the lower 48; dominic macklon, our executive vice president of strategy, sustainability and technology; nick olds, our executive vice president of global operations. mark keener, our vice president of investor relations, is also in the room today. the format of our call will consist of some very brief prepared remarks, and then, as sanara mentioned, we'll go to q&a.
a few reminders. in conjunction with today's earnings release, we posted a deck of supplemental material addressing third quarter earnings and cash flow results, as well as some fourth quarter full year 2021 guidance updates. today, we will make some forward-looking statements based on current expectations. actual results could differ due to the factors described in today's press release and in our periodic filings.
and we'll mention some non-gaap financial measures this morning. you can find reconciliations to the nearest corresponding gaap measure in this morning's press release and on our website. with that, i will now turn the call over to ryan. 
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, ellen. as ellen mentioned, i'll make a few opening comments, and then bill will address a few details about this quarter's results. and then we'll begin the q&a session. in this morning's release, i referred to the quarter's results as notable.
obviously, financial and operating results were outstanding, but the context for describing them as notable meant something different. for the past year, we've been integrating concho, improving underlying metrics across the business and creating the most competitive e&p for the energy transition. the significance of this quarter's performance is that it represents the post concho go-forward baseline for the company. on a run rate basis, the integration is essentially complete.
we've captured the announced $1 billion of synergies and savings from actions the company took in connection with the transaction, all ahead of schedule. we're unhedged, but even more importantly, our torque to upside is helped by having high conversion of revenue to income and cash flow. the core executables of our global operating plan are delivering as expected. we'll close out 2021 as a stronger company compared to any time in the past decade.
every aspect of our triple mandate is moving in the right direction. our underlying portfolio cost to supply is improving. our overall ghg intensity is lower. our emissions intensity reduction targets are more stringent.
underlying margins are expanding, and our trailing 12-month return on capital employed is headed toward an estimated 14% by year-end, reflecting the benefit of more than just stronger commodity prices. between now and year-end, our top priority is closing the shell transaction, which we expect to occur in the fourth quarter. once we close, we will be working diligently to integrate these properties and capture efficiencies in a similar fashion to what we've achieved through the concho integration. in addition to layering in these properties on top of our existing high-performing platform, we're continuing to high-grade our portfolio and optimize the business drivers everywhere.
the setup for next year is, well, notable. we're now in the process of setting our 2022 capital plans, which we expect to announce in early december. directionally, we don't anticipate a significant departure on capex from what we included in our june update excluding shell. in june, we provided an outlook based on a roughly $50 per barrel price that included a modest ramp in the lower 48 to reactivate our optimized plateau plans, some incremental base alaska investment and some longer-cycle low cost of supply investments in canada, the montney and in norway.
since june, we see some inflation pressures, especially in the lower 48. however, at this point, we'd expect to adjust scope modestly in order -- in response to maintain our base capital at a level that is roughly consistent with our june update. and then, of course, we'll add capex for the shell properties once we've brought them into the portfolio. as we finalize our 2022 plans, we're watching the macro closely, keeping an eye on inflation and potential obo pressures and undertaking our typical capital high-grading processes.
it goes without saying the market certainly appears to be more constructive, but we must always remember that this is an incredibly volatile business. but there's more to come on that in december. it's certainly been a busy year for the company but an incredibly successful one so far, and that's thanks to our dedicated and talented conocophillips workforce. we believe we're entering a very constructive time for the sector, but even so, we know that there will be relative winners.
the relative winners will be companies with the lowest cost of supply investment options, peer-leading delivery of returns on and of capital and visible progress on lowering emissions intensity. that's what we offer. our third quarter represents a glimpse and a strong jumping-off point to what you can expect from conocophillips going forward. so now let me turn it over to bill, who will cover some of the key items from this quarter.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, ryan. to begin, adjusted earnings were $1.77 per share for the quarter. relative to consensus, this performance reflects production volumes that were slightly above the midpoint of guidance, better-than-expected price realizations and lower-than-expected dd&a. as for the better realizations, we captured a higher percentage of brent pricing in our overall realized prices.
we've provided supplementary information in this morning's material to address the realizations variance. and as ryan mentioned, we're unhedged so we're getting full exposure to the current higher prices. as for dd&a, we're trending lower compared to the previous guidance as a result of positive reserve revisions due to higher prices. you saw in today's release that we lowered full year 2021 dd&a guidance from $7.4 billion to $7.1 billion.
excluding libya, production for the quarter was 1,507,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which represents about 2% underlying growth. lower 48 production averaged 790,000 barrels a day, including about 445,000 from the permian, 217,000 from the eagle ford, and 95,000 from the bakken. at the end of the quarter, we had 15 operated drilling rigs and seven frac crews working in the lower 48. across the rest of our operations, the business ran extremely well.
in particular, our planned seasonal turnaround activity across several regions went safely and smoothly. you will have noticed that we provided production guidance for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2021 in this morning's release. this reflects the impact of a decision we're making to convert concho two stream contracted volumes to a three-stream reporting basis as part of our ongoing efforts to create marketing optionality across the lower 48. we expect to convert the majority of our contracts in the fourth quarter.
reported production is expected to increase by approximately 40,000 barrels a day, and both revenue and operating costs will increase by roughly $70 million. in other words, this conversion is earnings neutral. besides dd&a and production, there were no other changes to 2021 guidance items. now, once we've closed the shell acquisition and can see where the ongoing us tax legislation conversation lands, we'll provide an updated earnings and cash flow sensitivities that consider such factors as projected 2022 price ranges and how those ranges might impact our cash taxpaying position in various jurisdictions around the globe.
coming back to third quarter results. cash from operations was $4.1 billion, which was reduced by about $200 million for nonrecurring items, so a bit higher than the average of external estimates on an underlying basis. free cash flow was almost $3 billion this quarter, and on a year-to-date basis, this is about $6.5 billion. through the first nine months of the year, we've returned $4 billion to shareholders, and we're on track to meet our target of returning nearly $6 billion by the end of 2021.
this is through a combination of our ordinary dividend and buybacks. so to summarize, as ryan said, it was a notable quarter. the company is running exceptionally well, and we've achieved a significant reset of the base business post concho. that creates a powerful platform for entering next year.
we're focused on closing the shell permian acquisition so that we can begin the work of getting those properties fully integrated into the business, setting our capital plans for 2022, maintaining a leading position of returns on and of capital and lowering our emissions intensity. that's the triple mandate. that's what conocophillips is all about. and we look forward to providing additional information in december.
i'll now turn the call over to the operator to begin the q&a portion of today's call.

operator
[operator instructions] and our first question comes from roger read from wells fargo. please go ahead. your line is open.
roger read -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yes. thank you. good morning. hopefully you can hear me.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, no, we can.
roger read -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
sorry. just it was like really quiet there. anyway, i just want to come back to the inflation question. i know you'll talk more about capex in december, but maybe an idea of what you have seen to date and where you think the bigger inflation headwinds may arise.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. sure, roger. as we're kind of in the middle of -- like i said in our opening comments, in the middle of putting all our plans together. right now, the supply chain organization tells me that globally, we're thinking about mid-single digit kind of inflation rates as we go into 2022.
but it's bifurcated into two pieces, the us being, depending where you're at geographically in the us, anywhere from kind of the low double digits to the higher single digits, the permian being the area probably that's most influenced or most experiencing inflation right now and as we go into 2022; and then the rest of the world though still at about 2% to 3% inflation rates kind of globally. so the categories that you can imagine are inflating right now certainly are those that are in need here in the us as we start to recover out of the low point, things like otcg, labor, sand, pressure pumping, and the likes. i think as we think about it going forward, it's an opportunity for us to try to offset as much of that through some modest scope reduction and efficiencies, which i think is where tim is focused in the lower 48. i can ask -- tim, if you want to add anything to that relative to the lower 48, in the permian.
tim leach -- executive vice president, lower 48
no, i think that covered most of it. but i would say that where we are seeing inflation on those items, we have size and scale advantages of our combined organizations. and the operations continue to improve in the lower 48, so i think there's many ways that we can mitigate those inflation factors.
roger read -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. great. and then just since it's been in the news quite a bit, what's been going on in alaska, i was just curious. while it can't go forward, what do we think about in terms of other opportunities in alaska? and have you noticed any meaningful changes since hilcorp became the other partner in prudhoe bay?
nick olds -- executive vice president, global operations
yeah. roger, this is nick. just maybe a quick update on willow. as you've probably seen in the press, both the department of justice and ourselves decided not to appeal the alaska district court decision.
we feel the best and most efficient approach there is to really work through the 3 substantive issues that were identified in the district court ruling. we'll do that through additional nepa analysis. we're currently engaged with the blm and the cooperating agencies up there, just working through those three particular issues. as you look forward, as we've mentioned, we continue to work through our detailed engineering in service of continued refinement of our cost and schedule and any development modifications, all in service of doing an fid.
if you look at 2022, our capital program, that will reflect the continued engineering work. and then from a shareholder standpoint, we still see significant support from the alaska delegation, the state of alaska, as well as the north slope borough. so we remain committed on this front. as far as other projects, we spoke about in the june 30 market update, in part, as an example, we've got nuna, we've got coyote.
these will leverage existing infrastructure, so existing pads, facilities and pipelines, very low cost of supply opportunities that we're progressing. and then on the prudhoe front, we're seeing great efficiency improvements and safety performance. they continue to reduce costs across the board. so our teams are heavily engaged.
so all three legacy assets are performing well.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jeanine wai from barclays.  please go ahead. your line is open.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone. thanks for taking our questions.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, good morning, jeanine.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
good morning. our first question is on scope 3. in conjunction with the shell permian acquisition, you announced an improvement in your scope 1 and 2 emission intensity targets, which is great. at this year's meeting, i believe shareholders voted in favor of the company setting scope 3 reduction targets as well.
so could you maybe update us on the company's strategy for addressing that vote? and perhaps any color on feedback that you've received from your shareholders regarding scope 3 reduction targets for conoco.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. sure, jeanine. let me make a few comments, and i'll turn it over to dominic, who's been involved at all our shareholder engagement activity. that's a normal part of our process this time of year.
but yeah, you saw consistent -- or coincident with the shell acquisition announcement that we increased our targets related to scope 1 and scope 2. and maybe hopefully not missed in that, we went from a gross operated to a net equity, which we think the industry needs to move to as well. so it's not only what you operate, it's what you are involved in from a net equity perspective. so yeah, pretty focused on our commitment to reduce our scope 1 and scope 2.
and then as you state, we did get a resolution. it got 50-some-percent of the vote, not binding but one that we have to engage with our shareholders on. so we've been doing that on the scope 3 side specifically. and i can get dominic maybe to comment on what that looks like and what we've heard so far from shareholders.
dominic macklon -- executive vice president, strategy
well, thanks, jeanine, for the question. we are continuing in dialogue with shareholders. this is an ongoing process on this very important matter. i think to share some key elements of that dialogue, as an e&p company, we continue to believe our paris-aligned climate risk framework that we launched about a year ago is both credible and ambitious and addresses the realities of our triple mandate that you often hear us talking about.
so that's responsibly meet transition pathway demand, deliver competitive returns and achieve net zero emissions on the emissions we control, and that's scope 1 and scope 2. and we have established just earlier this year a dedicated low-carbon technology group, and they are supporting our business units in their ongoing progress to achieve our scope 1 and 2 targets and our net zero ambition. but we are not ignoring scope 3 end-use emissions. so our new low-carbon group are also working to develop new opportunities in low-carbon businesses with a focus on carbon capture and storage and hydrogen, both of which have a strong adjacency to our core business and our competencies.
but those opportunities must, of course, deliver competitive returns for shareholders. and on the policy side, we continue to advocate for a well-designed economywide price on carbon, and we see that as the most viable solution for addressing demand and actually reducing scope 3 end-use emissions. but we don't believe a scope 3 target for a paris-aligned e&p company like conocophillips makes sense as it wouldn't address consumer demand and it would shift supply away from top-tier esg producers to less accountable producers and jurisdictions. and we believe, in fact, that a paris-aligned e&p company with a focus on low ghg intensity and low cost of supply of production has a valuable and crucial role actually to play in the energy transition.
so now, of course, we take our stakeholder -- our shareholders' views very seriously and we're continuing our engagement to understand their perspectives. it's an ongoing process. we'll continue that through the next couple of months here. but that perhaps gives you a flavor of the nature of the dialogue.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
ok. great. that's really helpful. we look forward to the carbon capture and hydrogen development.
so, i guess, our second question, maybe a little housekeeping item here, is on the affiliate distributions. so the distributions, they were slightly below what we think was implied by prior commentary on the 2q call, and it was a little bit below our forecast. so we're just wondering if there was anything unexpected related to the timing of distributions, we understand there's seasonality for the quarter, or if there's any change in the full year outlook of $700 million in aplng distributions for this year?
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, jeanine. we received distributions of $85 million from aplng in the third quarter, and that brings our total year to date to $430 million for the year. and we now expect full year distributions of around $750 million from aplng this year. as you noted and as a reminder, we typically receive lower distributions in the first and third quarters and higher distributions in the second and fourth quarters.
and as you think about aplng, due to the pricing lag with aplng's long-term lng sales, there's really little sensitivity to price for the remainder of 2021 distributions as lng pricing is essentially set. so we feel very good about $750 million for the full year.

thank you. our next question is from neil mehta from goldman sachs. please go ahead. your line is open.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning, team. and let me start by thanking ellen for her service to the industry and to the investment community. congratulations on your retirement, ellen. you are going to be sorely missed.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, neil. yeah. i appreciate the call out, neil. we're going to miss her as well.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah. ellen, you can't escape us. so you know where to reach us. so...
ellen desanctis -- senior vice president, corporate relations and investor relations
i'm not going to try.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
she's not going to escape us completely either, neil.
ellen desanctis -- senior vice president, corporate relations and investor relations
you're in great hands. it's been an honor everybody, truly an honor. and conocophillips won't miss a beat.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's great. well, you've left it in great shape. well, ryan, i want to kick off on a big-picture question for you, and then tim, i had a follow-up for you on the permian. but the big picture question is, ryan, do you think we're in the beginning of a structural up cycle here, which is we've been through seven years of a very dark period of oversupply in the industry? underinvestment might be kicking in here.
do you see multiple years ahead of a potential recovery? and to the extent we actually are at the beginning of a structural up cycle, the last time we had one, the industry destroyed a lot of value over the long term by not seizing the opportunity appropriately. and so, as a leader of the e&p industry, what is the message you're telling your folks about how you do it differently this time to create structural value to the extent you have a period of excess cash flow?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. no. thanks, neil. certainly, pretty constructive for a number of reasons.
we're seeing the demand recovery post pandemic. and for all the reasons you stated, this becomes a -- turns into a supply problem. and i think that's going to be some pretty constructive tailwinds for the industry. so yeah, you asked a bit of a provocative question there.
so what would i say? maybe a few things. for my peers, i would say we've got to restore sector sponsorship. and that's only going to happen through consistent returns on capital employed, and they have to be competitive with the market. i think that's the opposite of what we saw in this boom/bust industry.
so i think investors need to have us on a short lease and -- short leash, and i think that would be good for this sector. so that's kind of what i would tell my peers. what would i tell investors? it is different right now because i think shale industry is being run as a free cash flow business. and so, now we have short-cycle inventory that can be managed for returns of and returns on capital.
but i think you have to remember one thing in that shale business, that inventory quality really does matter. because the ones with the best inventory like conocophillips, we're going to be able to make market-competitive returns, and we can do that without having -- blowing through the roof on growth. so with modest growth, you can deliver those kinds of market-competitive returns for people that have the top-quality shale inventory. and i think that's a pretty big paradigm shift.
so that discipline on growth and returns on and of capital really, really matters. lastly, and this would be for investors and my peers, for everyone really, is the energy transition is happening. we are going through a transition today, but i think that's a new lens that we have to look at this business through, and it requires a bit of new thinking. and i think dominic just referred to that in the last question that jeanine had, which is our triple mandate.
we must do those three things simultaneously, and we've got to do them really, really well. so we have to meet the transition demand. whatever slope that demand going on, we've got to be there to supply it with low cost of supplies barrels because we've got to deliver on our returns. and we've got to meet our net zero ambition ultimately by 2050 in this business.
so i guess that would be the few things that i would offer, neil. and really, shame on us if this industry can't do it, and i can guarantee you conocophillips will.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah, you guys absolutely have delivered the playbook. and that's a good dovetail into you, tim. and just your perspective on the permian position at this point, and specifically talk about where we are in terms of integration of the concho assets. and you've probably gotten more time to take a look under the hood of the shell assets.
how do you feel about what you've acquired?
tim leach -- executive vice president, lower 48
yeah. it's pretty exciting that -- first of all, i'm really proud of our team of being able to integrate this concho acquisition and deliver on all the production and cash flow and get the wells drilled and not miss a beat on execution and so -- and deliver all the synergies that we've talked about. that's an important concept as well. so things -- the blocking and tackling of our business is going really well in the permian.
but in addition to that, conocophillips has four really great shale basins in the us and watching how information is being transferred, how much teamwork is going on between those groups, they're continuing to make everything better. the wells are getting better. we're delivering more efficiency all the time. so that's exciting for the future.
and then when you look at the opportunity with the shell acquisition, what we can do with those assets and how we can create value with them -- and that's kind of what our teams live and die for, is the opportunity to go get something like that and make it better. so i'm pretty excited, and i'm proud of the work that's being done right now.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from stephen richardson from evercore. please go ahead. your line is open.
stephen richardson -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you. i was wondering if i could follow up on that last question with tim. tim, i appreciate that you haven't closed the shell transaction yet and haven't got your hands on the assets, but it seems to us one of the big areas of upside could come from equalizing working interest and some swaps and trades and blocking up your total position, including shell. could you just talk a little bit about that opportunity as you see it? and have you had incomings from industry knowing that you will be the holder of those assets in short order?
tim leach -- executive vice president, lower 48
yeah. managing assets like that is kind of what i think we do best. and there are so many different ways that we can create value, from the way the wells are drilled, the way the wells are completed, the marketing arrangements. and it also gives us the opportunity with those additional assets coming in.
we have way more flexibility on what we can dispose of and how we can high-grade our portfolio. so it gives us the opportunity to do what i think we're really good at from an operation standpoint but also from property management. and the swaps and trades, we have a dedicated group around that, and they can create a lot of value in the basin. all the operators are trying to get out of each other's way and not have so much outside operated and create longer lateral drilling opportunities, all kind of things like that.
stephen richardson -- evercore isi -- analyst
if i could just follow up with bill on cenovus specifically. it looks -- from what we can glean from the public filings, it looks like that sell-down is happening kind of in a pretty orderly way in terms of pace. but i was wondering if you could talk about experience so far executing on that. and also, noted a nice uptick in the contingent payment associated with that western canadian sale a number of years back at these oil prices.
and maybe you could remind us all of the quantum of that and where that will stand and the duration of that as well, please.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, sure. happy to. so first, starting with the cve monetization program. we've sold about 67 million shares year to date.
that's about 30% of our original balance. and so, we reduced our equity stake in cenovus from about 10% to about 7%. and those proceeds have been used to buy back about $600 million of conoco bulk shares through the third quarter. and you'll note on our slides for cash that that was about $400 million for the third quarter.
we have accelerated our sales. we expect to exit our position sometime early part of next year, and we're executing those sales in a thoughtful and measured way. we continue to monitor market conditions as we move forward. assuming that they remain supportive, we'll be out early part of next year.
you also asked about the contingent payments from cenovus. during the quarter, we recognized about $100 million in pre-tax earnings, bringing our year-to-date total to about $200 million so far in cenovus contingent payments. and at current pricing, we'd expect to recognize another $100 million in the fourth quarter. now, the contingent term expires at the end of the second quarter 2022.
but at current strip prices, we'd expect to continue to accrue contingent payments in the first and second quarter of next year. it's probably also worth mentioning that we are still continuing to receive contingent payments also from our san juan sale. just would throw that in there a bit. we've accumulated so far $30 million in pre-tax this year with $21 million in the third quarter and expect to accrue another $21 million on that in the fourth quarter.
and at current prices, that should continue through calendar year next year.
operator
thank you. our next question is from doug leggate from bank of america. please go ahead. your line is open.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you. let me add my congratulations to ellen. i'm pretty sure i'm not going to be on the call list, ellen, but good luck and thanks for all your help over the years. really, we're going to miss you.
a couple of things, if i may. ryan, i know we get to the cash return question a lot when i come to question you on this. but i just wonder if i could pick your brain on whether your thinking is evolving. and what i'm looking at is you're pretty much bigger than bp at this point.
you're knocking on the door of both total and shell in terms of scale. and on average, your yield is about -- running about 60% of those peers. you could easily step that dividend up and get greater recognition for the value proposition, in my opinion. why not?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i think i tried to be pretty clear, doug. i appreciate the question and the push. i think what i tried to be pretty clear about is our 30% of cfo is going back to the shareholders.
so that's a commitment you can take to the bank as an investor in conocophillips. and with this run-up in the prices that we've seen here lately, you should expect to get 30% of our cash coming from our operations as a result. you asked, ""what about the channel?"" i'd say maybe before the channel conversation, too, the shell acquisition will probably look to try to put some more money onto the balance sheet as we go through the course of this. but more directly to your question about the channel, i've been comfortable, based on our outlook and our view of the macro, where things are going right now, to split the distribution between the ordinary dividend and share repurchase.
so how do i think about the ordinary dividend? for me, it needs to be something that's incredibly reliable. it's transparent. it's global. it's reliable.
you can count on it. you can take it to the bank. and it works at the downside of this sector in the -- whenever we go through those downturns. that's how i think about the dividend.
and i think you can get your fork when these times are pretty good, but i think you got to think about the dividend being commitment, reliable, always there and it's growable. and so, that's how i think about the dividend. but more importantly, you should expect to get 30% of our cash coming back from our operations. that's our commitment.
that's what we've done for a number of years, and that's what we're going to continue to go do. so as that cfo goes up, you're going to get those dollars. and we've been pretty open to the channel. we've had this conversation with the market and with our investors.
and as we see circumstances changing, we're not locked into a specific channel to go do that. so i take your point, doug. i think -- i probably think about the ordinary dividend just a little bit differently.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i appreciate the answer. i guess it's more about trying to figure out what the market is best prepared to recognize, is kind of what's behind my question. but i appreciate the answer.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. and that, recognition, doug, needs to be over the long term, not just over a month or a quarter. but well, what builds value? what's the right model over the long haul in a very volatile business?
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
sure. very different capital structure today for you guys than a few years ago. my follow-up is very quickly -- you touched on high-grading the portfolio. i don't think we've heard you say that in a little while, and obviously, you've now got a very large slug of production coming in.
i just wonder if i could push you a little bit to touch on some of the things you were thinking there to flesh that out. and i'll leave it there.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. no, thanks, doug. i think we've sold through this quarter a couple of hundred million dollars worth of assets. those are largely in the lower 48.
we've got another couple of large packages in the lower 48 on the market today that are significantly larger than what we've talked about closing today and a couple of other things. but we're pretty committed. we announced at the -- after the shell transaction that we would sell $4 billion to $5 billion. we had $2 billion to $3 billion out in the market from the june market update.
we're well on the road to delivering that $2 billion to $3 billion. we upped that to $4 billion to $5 billion as a result of the shell transaction just because, when we get the first look at the portfolio, primarily in the permian, we think there's going to be some cleanup that we can do with tim's team and the trading and the swapping that he described earlier and some outright sales. so feel pretty comfortable with that $4 billion to $5 billion target. obviously, takes us into 2023, but making probably a lot of progress through the first half of next year in delivering those targets.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from phil gresh from j.p. morgan.  please go ahead. your line is open.
phil gresh -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. hi, good afternoon. my first question is just on the prior guidance around the ending 4q cash balances post the shell acquisition of about $4 billion in cash. any updated thoughts there now that we've gone through 3q? and any other moving pieces that you talked about on the call here today?
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. sure, phil. we still feel very good about that $4 billion of ending cash. the shell transaction headline price is $9.5 billion, but the effective date is july 1 of this year.
and so, as we go through the year, we would expect to end up with a little over $4 billion of cash by the end of this year.
phil gresh -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. and then second question, bill, for you would be -- you gave a little teaser in your prepared remarks around cash taxes. do you have any updated thoughts around when you would become a cash taxpayer, kind of factoring in the impacts of the shell acquisition, the higher oil prices, etc.?
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. sure, phil. so at current pricing, if current pricing continues into 2022, we would expect to move into a significant taxpaying position in the us by early to mid-2022.
phil gresh -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
and how about just for the overall company?
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, so the overall company would be similar. so if you look across our international assets, many of them are already in a cash taxpaying position, so the main change is in the us
phil gresh -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. got it. ok. thank you.
operator
thank you. our question comes from paul cheng from scotiabank. please go ahead. your line is open.
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
hi. thank you. let me add first my congratulations to ellen and wish you a wonderful and healthy retirement. so thank you for your help.
ellen desanctis -- senior vice president, corporate relations and investor relations
thank you.
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
two questions. maybe this is for tim. maybe we read too much. in the third quarter, eagle ford production actually is sequentially down.
i think in your previous 10-year strategic long term, the target is eagle ford may be reaching, say, close to about 300 in the longer term and stay there for a long period of time. so wondering, with the asset -- permian asset, is that still the game plan and what we've seen in the third quarter is just the timing of the well coming onstream or we should read more on that? so that's the first question. and maybe i will ask the second question maybe later.
tim leach -- executive vice president, lower 48
good. thank you. yes. the way we think about managing the eagle ford and the bakken and the permian is one asset that we can allocate capital around.
but we've said on this call before that the eagle ford and the bakken are much closer to being at their optimal plateau than the permian is. the permian doesn't get there for a long time. but we are increasing activity in the eagle ford. it will be at that optimal plateau rate that you referenced.
and the sequential quarter over quarter is more about timing and things like that of wells coming online. but i'm very pleased with the performance of that asset. and there have been things like refracs and other things that we've talked about that have continued to improve the performance of the eagle ford.
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
tim, when do you think eagle ford will reach that plateau kind of production rate, in 2024, 2025 or maybe sooner? so in other words, how aggressive are you going to ramp that up?
tim leach -- executive vice president, lower 48
yeah. well, we haven't given guidance on things like that. but generally, it reaches its plateau much sooner.
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
ok. and the second question maybe is for bill or for ryan. i think when you set up the $6 billion on the cash return, that's based on the $60 wti for this year. obviously, the price is much stronger.
so should we assume that you're going to return more than that or because of the shell transaction, you're going to stick to that and just have the additional cash to strengthen the balance sheet?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. no, at this point, we're -- our guidance is the $6 billion of return this year. and stay tuned for what that looks like for next year. but yeah, we're sticking to the plans we have in place for 2021 that gets us pretty close to $6 billion total return.
that's through the ordinary dividend and through our -- the shares that we're buying and the shares that we're swapping with cve or cenovus.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from neal dingmann from truist securities. please go ahead. your line is open.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
ryan, just a quick follow-up on what you just said. i just want to make sure i was clear on the shareholder return, on the $6 billion. it looked like the bulk -- a good size of that, i think one third of it is coming this quarter. is that just the result of how it played out from the cash flow -- the stated cash flow payout?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i think you probably saw some ramp-up in the swap with the cenovus shares. the dividend is obviously ratable across the four quarters other than the raise that we announced here recently. and we had -- we restarted our share buybacks outside of the cenovus swap after the first quarter.
so yes, they're not quite ratable. and you saw the ramp-up there in the third quarter if you look at our results, and you should assume that that continues into the fourth quarter.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. ok. great clarification. and my second, probably for tim.
tim, you just mentioned earlier on the activity. my question is more on permian activity that you were talking about. i know one of your peers suggested kind of a notable increase in permian activity for remainder of this year and into '22. and i'm just wondering, post the shell deal, would we continue to see a ramp in that? i just want to see if that's what you were indicating on the last -- given you mentioned the plateau on the other two plays.
could we see some ramp there? or is it still in the works to hold things steady? obviously, knowing you don't have '22, '23 guidance out yet.
tim leach -- executive vice president, lower 48
yes. we haven't completed all our planning for next year. that's what ryan referred to that we're still going through. but i would tell you that as we're planning for shell, until we get our hands on the steering wheel, that's kind of just continuing the level of activity that they currently have going on there.
i would tell you that we really believe strongly in the steady as she goes. and as we add activity, it will be ratable and kind of a -- i wouldn't call it a ramp. i would call it slow steady growth because i think that will build the most efficiency in our operations.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from john freeman from raymond james. please go ahead. your line is open.
john freeman -- raymond james -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks. i just wanted to revisit the 10-year plan, which obviously got enhanced after the shell transaction. and just when i'm thinking about the different sort of, i guess we'll call them, toggles that you have, obviously, given the unhedged nature of the portfolio, you've talked about if you do have a $10 higher oil price, then your oil assumption there, it's an incremental $35 billion.
and i'm just trying to make sure that i'm on the same page with how you all are thinking about that. the last time that the free cash flow got enhanced from a shell transaction with the incremental, let's call it, $10 billion over that 10-year plan, that full $10 billion basically went to the incremental shareholder distributions. so i'm just trying to -- i guess, ryan, just how do you think about what it would theoretically take for you ought to look at something other than that kind of 3% kind of production cagr? is it just it doesn't really matter what the oil price is, the incremental goes to the shareholder distribution? or just how you think about it, ryan, would be helpful.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. no, thanks, john. i think -- yes, i think you should think about it on top -- again, the market update plan was at a $50 a barrel price deck. so our commitment to our investors is that 30% of the cash will go back to the shareholders.
as prices increase and our cash flows increase, you should expect the distribution to the shareholders to increase. we're still going to maintain a very strong balance sheet, and having some cash on the balance sheet is important to the company. and then we'll deliver modest growth. that's always been kind of an output out of our plans.
we want to make sure that we have a good idea of where the macro is going to go for the next year. we're going to set our capital budget plans to deliver the strongest returns on that capital that we can manage. we don't want to blow into the face of really high super inflation. we've seen what that's done before to return, so we'll be very conscious of that as we go into what we think is a pretty constructive view of the macro going for the next two to three years.
so you ought to expect us to act like we've done in the past. we'll be really judicious how we spend our capital, make sure we're getting the most out of every capital dollar we can. shareholders are going to get 30% of their cash back. they'll get that through the dividend and through some share buyback, maybe another channel.
we'll see if that's the right thing to do for the company with where we're at, and we're going to maintain a very strong balance sheet as we go through this process. but adding the shell just made the company better, made it more resilient and made more cash flow and more -- so that means there'll be more returns of capital back to the shareholder. and then remember we're running the shell assets just like we're running our own lower 40 asset -- or lower 48 assets at about a 50% to 60% reinvestment rate. we're -- again, that's what i tried to say at the beginning.
we're executing the shell differently than what this industry did a number of years ago.
ellen desanctis -- senior vice president, corporate relations and investor relations
sanara, this is ellen. we'll take john's second question and then wrap it up.
john freeman -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. thanks. and then just my follow-up question. ryan, you talked about the inflationary pressure you're seeing in the lower 48 with that kind of high single-digit to low double-digit inflation versus the international part of your portfolio, which is still rather modest at kind of 2% to 3% inflation.
obviously, tim and his team have done a great job on the efficiency gain side on the lower 48. but it doesn't sound like, at least for the 2022 plan, that we should anticipate any material shift in sort of that, i guess, international versus lower 48 sort of mix. but just, i realize this is oversimplifying it. but like how wide would that spread have to be from a service concentration perspective, lower 48 versus international, where we might see you lean a little bit more on the international portfolio?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i don't think we'll probably allocate capital based on how we see those different inflation rates going. so i think we just want to be clear about how we kind of see it developing in the significant categories of spend that we have in the company and try to give you an idea of what we're seeing today. we'll continue to watch it.
i think it probably more goes to our lower 48 business. if we see hyperinflation and start seeing it running away from us, we might adjust our scope modestly. so we're not going to try to go into that. so again, it's with, really, focus on making sure the returns are adequate for the capital that we're investing.
and i think tim said in one of his responses we're a large company. we've got a very sophisticated supply chain organization, very sophisticated commercial organization, and the efficiencies that we're bringing out of the business are still there. so we think we have a way to mitigate quite a lot of it, and we'll just adjust our plans if it gets out of control as an example. so that's where we stand out as an e&p company.
we're global. we're big. and that's a huge advantage to us when we think about the impacts of these kinds of things on our business.
operator
thank you. we have no further questions at this time. i'd like to turn the call back over to you, ellen. thank you.

actual results could differ due to the factors described in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the sec. and finally, we'll also make reference to some non-gaap financial measures today. reconciliations to the nearest corresponding gaap measure can be found in this morning's release and on our website. with that, i'll turn the call over to ryan. 
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, mark. so, 2021 was a truly remarkable year for conocophillips. our operating performance around the globe was outstanding, we generated strong returns on and of capital for our shareholders and closed on two significant, highly accretive acquisitions in the heart of the permian basin. our exceptional results last year are directly attributable to the talent and dedication of our global workforce.
we produced 1.6 million barrels per day and brought first production online at gmt2 in alaska, the third montney well pad, and the malikai phase 2 and s&p phase 2 projects in malaysia. we also completed the tor ii project in norway and achieved all of this with excellent cost, schedule, safety, and environmental performance. financially, we achieved a 14% full-year return on capital employed or 16% on a cash-adjusted basis and generated $15.7 billion in cfo, with over $10 billion in free cash flow. and we returned $6 billion to our shareholders, representing 38% of our cash from operations.
we also continued our rigorous portfolio optimization work, completing the truly transformative concho and shell permian acquisitions and further high-grading our asset base around the world. in the asia pacific region, we exercised our pre-emption right to acquire an additional 10% in aplng and announced the sale of assets in indonesia for $1.4 billion. in the lower 48, we generated $0.3 billion in proceeds from the sale of noncore assets last year, and last week, we signed an agreement to sell an additional property set, outside of our core areas for an additional $440 million. collectively, these transactions reduced both the average cost of supply and the ghg intensity of our more than 20-billion-barrel resource base and we're well down the road toward achieving our $4 billion to $5 billion in dispositions by 2023.
in early december, consistent with our 10-year plan and capital allocation priorities, we announced a returns-driven capital budget for 2022 that's expected to deliver modest growth this year. we also introduced a new variable return of cash, or vroc, tiered to our distribution framework and provided a full-year target of $7 billion in total returns of capital to our shareholders. based on current prices on the forward curve, we've increased the target to $8 billion, with the incremental $1 billion coming in the form of increased share repurchases and a higher variable return of cash. the $0.30 per share vroc announced for the second quarter represents a 50% increase over our inaugural variable return to shareholders that we paid this quarter.
now, to put the $8 billion in perspective, it equates to an increase of more than 30% from the $6 billion returned last year and a greater than 50% increase in projected cash return to shareholders. our three-tier distribution framework provides a flexible and durable means to meet our returns commitment through the price cycle and truly is differential to others in this sector as our returns commitment is based on a percentage of cfo and not free cash flow. and as you know, we are guided in everything we do by our triple mandate. we must reliably and responsibly deliver oil and gas production to meet energy transition pathway demand.
we need to generate competitive returns on and of capital for our shareholders and achieve our paris-aligned net-zero ambition by 2050. just as i'm very proud of the excellent operational and returns-focused performance we delivered in 2021, i'm equally pleased about the progress we have made in support of the third pillar of our mandate. we increased our medium-term emissions intensity reduction target to 40% to 50% by 2030 and expanded it to include both gross operated and net equity production. as a reminder, we're also committed to further reducing our methane emissions and achieving our zero routine flaring ambition by 2025.
and as highlighted in our december release, we've allocated $0.2 billion of this year's capital program for projects to reduce the company's scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity and investments in several early stage, low-carbon opportunities that address end-use emissions. we strongly believe that this level of focus on and performance toward is fully realizing our triple mandate as conocophillips is very well positioned to not just survive through the energy transition, but to thrive regardless of the pathways it takes. while we're on the topic of energy transition, i'd like to touch on the macroenvironment. commodity prices today reflect global energy demand returning to pre-pandemic levels, along with supply being impacted by decreased investment in oil and gas over the past couple of years, concerns about inventory levels, and the amount of available spare production capacity in the system.
all these factors demonstrate the ongoing importance of our sector to the global economy today and for the foreseeable future. it's becoming increasingly clear that the energy transition isn't going to happen with the flip of a switch. what people and businesses around the globe need is a managed and orderly transition, but that's not what the world is seeing to this point. supply and demand balances are fragile at the moment, likely driving continued volatility and the current commodity price situation in europe may be providing a cautionary signal.
the simple reality is that most alternative energy sources still have a long way to go toward becoming as scalable, reliable, affordable, and accessible as the world needs them to be, which brings me back to our triple mandate and the importance of performing well across all three of the pillars, for our shareholders and for the people in the world who need and use our products. now, with that, let me turn the call over to bill, and he will cover the fourth quarter and our 2022 outlook.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, ryan. looking at fourth-quarter earnings, we generated $2.27 per share in adjusted earnings. this performance reflects production above the midpoint of guidance and strong price realizations, as well as some commercial and inventory timing benefits, partially offset by slightly higher costs in dd&a. lower 48 production averaged 818,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter, including 483,000 from the permian, 213,000 from the eagle ford and 100,000 from the bakken.
as previously communicated, our permian and overall lower 48 production were both increased roughly 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter due to the conversion from two- to three-stream accounting for the acquired concho assets. at the end of the year, we had 20 operated drilling rigs and nine frac crews working in the lower 48, including those developing the acreage we recently acquired from shell. as ryan touched on earlier, operations across the rest of the portfolio also ran extremely well last year with our gmt2 project in alaska producing first oil in the fourth quarter as planned. turning to cash from operations, we generated $5.5 billion in cfo, excluding working capital, resulting in free cash flow of $3.9 billion in the quarter.
for the full year 2021, we generated $15.7 billion in cfo, $10.4 billion of free cash flow, and returned $6 billion to shareholders. in addition to the asset dispositions ryan covered, we also sold 117 million shares we held in synovis in the year, generating $1.1 billion in proceeds that we used to fund repurchases of our own shares. this left us with a little over 90 million synovis shares at the end of the year, which we intend to fully monetize by the end of this quarter. we ended the year with over $5 billion in cash, maintaining our differential balance sheet strength, even after completing the all-cash acquisition of shell's delaware basin assets.
so, to recap, it was not only a strong quarter but one that also bodes very well for 2022 and future years. we continue to optimize the portfolio. our businesses are running very well around the globe, and we have had an overall reserve replacement ratio of nearly 380%, establishing an incredibly powerful platform for the company as we head into this year and beyond. our cash flow performance and leverage to prices have substantially improved over the past couple of years as demonstrated by our fourth-quarter results and expect it will continue to improve as we begin including the newly acquired delaware assets in our consolidated results this quarter.
now, demonstrating this point and appreciating that it's helpful for the market to have an accurate sense of our stronger cfo generating capacity, at a wti price of $75 a barrel with a $3 differential to brent and a henry hub price of $3.75, we estimate our 2022 full-year cash from operations would be approximately $21 billion, which reflects us reentering a tax-paying position in the u.s. this year at those price levels. and our free cash flow for the year would be roughly $14 billion. and of course, we continue to be unhedged across our global diverse production base, so we expect to fully capture the upside of the current price environment.
we provided updated sensitivities in today's supplemental materials to help estimate how much earnings and cfo are projected to change this year with market price movements. so, to sum it up, all that we've shared with you today underscores our readiness to reliably generate very competitive returns for our shareholders as we thoughtfully move forward as a responsible, valuable e&p player in the energy transition. that is our triple mandate. it's what we have conocophillips built for and are ready to deliver.
now, with that, let's go to the operator to start the q&a.
",":
operator
thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from jeanine wai from barclays. please go ahead.
your line is open.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
hi. good morning, good afternoon, everyone. thanks for taking our questions. 
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
you bet. good morning to you.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
good morning. our first question, maybe for you, ryan. it's still pretty early in the year, but you have the confidence to increase the expected cash return by $1 billion to the $8 billion. you provided an update on your macro view earlier in the call.
and is this really the primary driver for increasing the cash return level? and can you provide an update on how inflation is trending for conoco, given continued strong oil prices, as well as we heard some of the general recent industry commentary from service companies?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, jeanine. it is the primary reason we're increasing our returns of capital to our shareholders from the $7 billion that we announced here just a few weeks ago to $8 billion now. so, again, it represents a pretty significant increase year on year, but it's a reflection of kind of our view.
and as we step back and take a look, like we will each quarter, thinking about where the forward curve is at, where the market's at, where our capital is at, where the balance sheet is at. so, it's a recognition of a strengthening commodity price market. and that's a reflection of that strengthening since the december time frame when we announced our capital budget for the year. and we're seeing a bit more inflation as a result of the strengthening commodity price that we see.
and i'd say it's primarily in the permian basin as well but be kind of spreading a bit to the lower 48. prior, we were probably in the mid-single-digit kind of inflation across the whole company. i would say now we're in the mid-level single-digit kind of inflation rates. so, we're seeing the impact of that.
it's uncertain commodities of spend like tubulars, trucking, labor, chemicals, otcg, those kinds of things and primarily in the more active parts of the lower 48 like the permian today. around the whole world, though, we see much lower inflation, and that's the benefit of a global diversified portfolio. but we are seeing a little bit higher pressure at these higher commodity prices than maybe what we would have said even a month and a half or two months ago.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
ok. great. thank you for all that detail. our second question is on the shell acquisition.
we know it hasn't really been very long since it closed, but can you provide any color on opportunities related to the integration or any efficiency gains? and i guess we're thinking, for example, just using concho as a playbook, you were very successful at capturing lower-hanging cost savings related to the supply chain related to marketing optimizations and that added up to a big structural number. but for the shell deal, you have a higher percentage of nonoperator interest, and that could dampen the impact of similar optimization. so, are there other unique opportunities with the shell assets? thank you.
tim leach -- executive vice president of lower 48
jeanine, this is tim. yeah, let me address those questions. as a reminder, we closed the shell acquisition on december 1, just 70 days after we made the announcement of the transaction. we've had a smooth and safe transition of operatorship and personnel over the time.
so, that's been a huge success. we plan to continue running four rigs on that property, the same activity rate that shell was running through the remainder of this year, but we've moved our personnel, our rigs on. and since we've taken up operatorship, we've quickly transitioned to our style of well drilling design, casing design, which has generated lower cost. we've also switched to our fracking design, which provides better economics using our style of proppant, fluid specs, and cluster spacing.
so, all those are kind of the blocking and tackling of us putting our style of operations on those properties. but i would tell you that the biggest opportunity in the near term is transitioning from one-mile wells to two-mile wells. and that's with our partners out there in the field. all those companies that we're partnered with, we have done deals with in the past, to core up and drill longer laterals.
so, i think that's the low-hanging fruit. we are in conversations with all of them. we've made transactions on some of those properties already. and just for a frame of reference, the difference between drilling a two-mile lateral on those properties and a one-mile lateral, everything else being held the same, is a 50-basis-point improvement on rate of return on well economics, which generates about a 30% improvement in cost of supply.
the other thing that we're working on that i'm pretty excited about, the shell deal in and of itself has allowed us more freedom for overall property management. you may have read in the last couple of weeks that we sold some noncore assets on the new mexico shelf and on the central basin platform. the kind of efficiency we get from those kind of property managements, for example, that one transaction allowed us to sell 25% of our operated wellbores, and it only affected 2% of our production in the permian. so, that kind of efficiency will flow through the entire organization and it's just one example of how i think we're making things better.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from neil mehta from goldman sachs. please go ahead. your line is open.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning, team. thank you. ryan, you were quoted recently talking about the u.s. production profile, i think your point was entry to exit this year, you thought we might grow 800,000 barrels a day, i guess that's accrued.
i'd love your perspective on how you're seeing the u.s. production profile as you think about yourself and peers. and it's tough for us to get the same store same-store sales growth rate for conoco in the permian because, of course, you've done some acquisitions here. but just as you think about the growth rate in '22 versus '21 for your own asset base, how are you thinking about that in the permian?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i can let tim talk about specifically the lower 48 and the asset. but i'd say the macro, yes, i was quoted in a recent discussion with several of my peers that we put the entry to exit at about 800,000 barrels a day this year. and i think -- and in light of the last couple of announcements that i've heard, neil, i would actually be moving that number up now because i think we were even a bit surprised by the strength of some of the numbers that we were hearing.
but i think importantly, we would place -- and that is a crude and condensate number. it doesn't include ngls. so, i'd say we're 800,000 to 900,000 probably barrels a day growth this year from the u.s. and probably a similar kind of number coming out next year.
this year dominated by the privates, with some influence by the publics. but clearly, next year, probably having that swap a bit and the publics' kind of regenerating and coming out of a maintenance capital mode in 2021 and reenergizing, just like we are. we plan to add some activity in both -- in all three of the big three: the bakken, the eagle ford, and the permian as well. so, i can let tim maybe talk a bit about how he sees that, how that manifests in our portfolio on a normalized basis.
tim leach -- executive vice president of lower 48
yeah. i don't really have a whole lot to add other than to just remind you that underlying decline rate on the permian is pretty substantial. and so, the increase in activity that we've seen from the privates and such will generate more production, and you've seen that show up in the numbers. but i think companies like ours and other large companies kind of think more of a sustainable growth rate because that's really where you get your efficiency is a disciplined kind of growth that allows you to move down the learning curve and lower your cost of supply.
we talked in our 10-year plan of a growth rate for our permian in the high single digits, and that as a result of that disciplined growth. so, i do think there'll be more consolidation. so, for a company like us, you've seen our operated production grow more than 35% in the permian since we did the shell deal and other things. so, i think there'll be some production moving around based on the consolidation.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks, tim and ryan. and actually, that was my follow-up here, which is you've developed a core competence here, seeing either the market around m&a between the foster creek transaction and then, of course, concho and the shell assets. how do you think of conocophillips in terms of further consolidation and the role it can play, particularly in the lower 48?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i've said before, neil, that i think further consolidation makes sense. i think you have to get more assets in responsible hands like conocophillips. we spent a lot of time talking about our triple mandate and the value proposition that we have and how we just think about the business. and i think getting more assets like that into responsible hands is going to make sense.
now, clearly, with the addition of concho and shell, we got a lot on our plate, and the bar is quite high inside the company. so, we're not immune to what's going on. we watch the market. we're on top of everything that's going on.
it takes a lot to make us better as a company, and we've got to see that in any assets that we look at, make us a better company, make our 10-year plan a better plan. and if we apply what we think is a better way of drilling and completing these wells can we add value to the assets that we might be looking at. so, yes, we're always looking and we're -- we've been ruthless, high-graders of the portfolio. so, as you mentioned, even dating back to the foster creek christina lake transaction that we did that really just started us down this path.
and the $4 billion to $5 billion that we've committed to sell and high grade by the end of 2023 as well. and we're well on the pathway to do that. so, we're always trying to lower the cost of supply in the portfolio, lower the ghg intensity. and we can do that through organic investments, and we can do that potentially through inorganic if they compete.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from roger read from wells fargo. please go ahead. your line is open.
roger read -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yeah. thanks. good morning. 
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, roger.
roger read -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
i guess maybe come back to the commentary about switching from the one-mile to the two-mile laterals, where you even heard talk of an increasing percentage of three-mile laterals. and i was just wondering as you think about that aspect of it, whether or not you've tried that yet, whether or not it made sense on your acreage in any sort of idea what that might do in terms of a further impact on decreasing your cost of supply?
tim leach -- executive vice president of lower 48
yeah, roger, we just -- in the southern midland basin, just completed a drilling project that included several three-mile and one three-and-a-half-mile lateral that we drilled in record time and have been very pleased with the results and the production from that. so, i think that's a big opportunity for the future. you know, it's another challenge for your lease configuration, that's why it's good to have big blocky acreage blocks.
roger read -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
no doubt. and that leads into my next question, which as jeanine said earlier, very early in your shell permian acquisition. but i was curious anything you've seen on the true swap side? you mentioned the one thing in new mexico, but i mean, like a real improvement in terms of acreage alignment where you can become more active.
tim leach -- executive vice president of lower 48
yeah. you know, we have one big partner and several other pretty sizable partners that we've done business with for a long time on swapping and trading. the good news is that this is a win-win for both parties. everybody wants to be able to drill longer laterals where they have bigger interest in their own operations.
so, we've already accomplished some of this. i can't tell you if i think it's going to be a lot of small blocking and tackling or a few big trades, but things are moving pretty rapidly in a good direction.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from doug leggate from bank of america. please go ahead. your line is open.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you. good morning. happy new year, everybody. ryan, i want to come back to your comments about the permian.
and i just want to ask you philosophically, are you concerned about the u.s. going back to that level of growth, given the recent history of growth for growth's sake? and we all know how saudi responded to that in that global market, which despite the post-covid recovery, still has a relatively pedestrian long-term growth outlook. and how does that play into your strategy?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. doug, thanks. no, i am. i think that sits very -- not so much at the back of our mind, but right at the front of our mind, i am absolutely concerned about.
i think the one change maybe relative to late 2014 and '15, the last time we were kind of at these levels is just what is the spare capacity sitting in the opec+ group. it was quite a different number back at that point in time, and you can -- we can all debate what that number is. and the fact that the inventories are down quite a bit globally and certainly here in the u.s. so, i think there's a little bit of time that we have associated with that.
but certainly, if we're getting back to the level of growth in the u.s. that if you're not worried about it, you should be and be thinking about.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes. well, i hope your peers are listening. my follow-up is, i don't know if you're able to give this yet, maybe a question for bill. but with all the portfolio changes going on, one of our favorite kind of output is the breakeven analysis you guys do, the sustaining capital that goes along with that.
are you able to give us an update on a post-tax basis, given that you're now back to paying full cash taxes?
dominic macklon -- executive vice president of strategy, sustainability, and technology
yes, doug. it's dominic here. i can help with that a little bit. i mean, i'll just take you back to the numbers we showed in our 10-year plan.
that all included tax modeling of course of the prices that we had there. so, that we were -- that mid-cycle price, we were about $30 wti breakeven. so, the higher prices, obviously, we'd have a little bit higher taxes. but i think that demonstrates the competitiveness of the portfolio.
so, bill, i don't know if you've got anything to add to that?
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no. that's well said, dominic.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from scott hanold from rbc capital markets. please go ahead. your line is open.
scott hanold -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks. you know, with proxy season coming up, could you guys talk a little bit about the shareholder proposition on your scope 3 emissions? and where you all stand on that right now?
dominic macklon -- executive vice president of strategy, sustainability, and technology
yeah. thanks, scott. it's dominic again. so, we have engaged very extensively with our shareholders on the resolution, as you would expect.
so, we've met with around half of our stockholder base, and that represents about 80% actually of our institutional investor base. so, we'll have a lot more detail coming in our proxy statement. but at a summary level, i would say we heard a lot of support for being the first u.s.-based oil and gas company to set a paris-aligned net-zero ambition on our scope 1 and 2 emissions and for the progress that we're making toward that. and that includes the $200 million capital allocation we announced for this year, which will go to our scope 1 and 2 emission reduction effort, as well as some low carbon business opportunities.
our stockholders, with very few exceptions, did not express an expectation for conocophillips as an e&p upstream-only company to set the scope 3 target. and that's because there was really a general recognition that this would amount to really a prescribed shift of responsible paris-aligned production to other less accountable sources. and also, the end-use emissions will only be addressed effectively, if all the many consumers across the value chain, industrial consumers, commercial consumers, retail consumers, that they also address the scope 1 and 2 emissions. but we also -- we're able to emphasize that we are not ignoring scope 3.
we are continuing to actively advocate for an economywide price in carbon. of course, that's so important to address both the supply side, but so important, the demand side. we're also engaging with our supply chain on their emissions and their reduction plans, and we're making some early stage investments in low carbon business opportunities that address end-use emissions. and of course, we've talked a lot about that, and we're pursuing those.
that's carbon capture storage and hydrogen. so, we believe a paris-aligned e&p company, with a focus on reliable, low ghg intensity and the low cost of supply production has a valuable and really, a crucial role to play in the energy transition. so, of course, we are continuing in dialogue with our shareholders, but that's really an update as to how that dialogue has progressed.
scott hanold -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
i appreciate that. that was very, very thorough. as a follow-up, can i ask on norway? obviously, you've got the tor project online, and it seemed like gas volumes are very robust this quarter. is that just it ramping up to full capacity? or are you guys pulling some other dials, given the strength in prices for gas over there?
nick olds -- executive vice president of global operations
yes, scott. this is nick. yes, on tor ii, we did bring all the wells online in may of last year. that asset is producing as expected.
and then we did a lot of work with our nonoperated folks and just trying to make sure we maximize gas production through the end of 2021, and that's what you're seeing come through the bottom line. so, yes, assets are performing well, tor ii as expected, and some additional gas flowing through 2021.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from phil gresh from j.p. morgan. please go ahead, your line is open.
phil gresh -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yes, hi. thank you for taking my question. my first question, just a bit of a follow-up on the activity levels planned for 2022. i hope you could elaborate a little bit more on the cadence and some of the moving pieces, particularly in the big 3.
in the press release, you gave some information on rig count and frac crews, but any additional color by basin and how you see things playing out as the year progresses?
tim leach -- executive vice president of lower 48
phil, this is tim again. the cadence of activity as we talked about before is kind of back-end weighted in the year. and it's cadence that we think will give us efficiency gains. but right now, we're at 20 drilling rigs and nine frac spreads, and we would add approximately four more drilling rigs in the lower 48 throughout the balance of the year.
one of those standing up in the bakken and i think the rest are in the eagle ford and the permian. so, it's kind of a measured pace and we are being very disciplined and as we said in the last quarter, it's a constrained pace in the permian. and we have lots of flexibility and capacity. but we think this is -- will give us the greatest efficiency.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
and i would add, phil, you know, what we talk a lot about is setting our scope early in the year with our teams and not wanting to whipsaw that scope. so, just wanting to go execute it as efficiently as they possibly can. so, on our operated scope, we want that to be -- we want them to know right at the beginning of the year what we expect them to go do and hope to execute that, as tim said, have flexibility.
phil gresh -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
that makes sense. thank you. one just quick follow-up for bill. very much appreciate the cash flow color for 2022.
i did have one follow-up question there. do you have anything pending in the first quarter for libya for income tax and royalty payments? one of your peers that operates there mentioned something on their call. and i presume your guidance would be kind of ex any working capital, of course, but just any clarification there. thank you.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. sure, phil. so, on libya, we're now current with our income tax payments in libya and current through the month of january. i would expect that to continue through the year.
phil gresh -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
was there a particular payment in january?
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
there was. so, we became current for the year on january. it's about $900 million was paid in january that was catching up on taxes from last year. that was shown in working capital as you look at our financials for the year.
so, not a surprise on that.
phil gresh -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. and the guidance of $21 billion would be excluding that, right?
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
correct, based on cfo. yeah.
phil gresh -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from ryan todd from piper sandler. please go ahead. your line is open.
ryan todd -- piper sandler -- analyst
yeah. thanks. maybe if i could just -- a couple of detailed follow-ups. regarding the operating expense guidance of $7.3 billion for 2022, you mentioned a number of factors pushing that higher year on year.
maybe any rough breakdowns on roughly how much of that is coming from portfolio change versus two, three industries -- three streams switch versus how much is driven by inflation?
dominic macklon -- executive vice president of strategy, sustainability, and technology
ryan, it's dominic again here. thanks for the question. yes. so, you know, just to sort of provide a little bit of context here, i think, remember that last -- q3 last year, we achieved a $6 billion run rate target we set when we announced our acquisition of concho, and now that was a $1 billion improvement to our cost structure versus the 2019 pro forma adjusted op costs of $7 billion.
so, we're continuing to benefit from that. that's been a major advantage from the transaction and through the work we've done over the last couple of years. as we look this year, so obviously, we've increased, we've said $7.3 billion and that's really -- that's from incorporating our shell permian assets, obviously. we've got costs that come with those properties, converting historical concho production for two- to three-stream.
we've got some impact of that, and we do have some anticipated inflation. i would say in terms of general breakdown, i would say about half of the increase is from the shell permian and the other -- the concho production two- to three-stream accounting and the anticipated inflation would represent the rest, about equally split, something like that. but we're very pleased with the progress we've made on our costs.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
and i would put that a little bit in context, ryan, too, we were -- just a reminder that kind of pro forma concho, we were at about the $7-ish billion level, and we had 1.5 million barrels a day of production. so, we're at that kind of level now at 1.8 million barrels a day of production for 2022. so, i just want to put some context around sort of where we've come and where we're at.
ryan todd -- piper sandler -- analyst
that's very helpful. thanks. maybe one follow-up on realizations. i mean, realizations continue to trend toward relative highs across much of your mix, and we appreciate the slide that you've included in the deck.
any thoughts on what you may be doing as an organization that's helping to drive that? and looking forward, is that something that we should expect to continue? or should we expect those to widen back out at some point going forward?
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. sure, ryan, this is bill. looking at our realizations in the supplementary data, total realizations as a percentage of brent, you'll notice that they increased to 82% versus in fourth quarter versus 77% in the third quarter. and that's really driven by a 45% increase in henry hub and about 120% increase to our gas prices in europe versus just a 9% increase in brent.
so, it's that relative outperformance by those that are driving that percent of overall realizations. i'd say on our crude realizations, those continue to remain strong. they're all within historical ranges. as you go through there, i would expect those to continue as we go through the year, particularly as we continue to optimize our deliveries there.
and then gas realizations is really the one that you saw the big change on. this shouldn't be a surprise to folks. the change here on lower 48 really was, as our gas realizations move back to kind of the 90% level versus 115%, that's primarily driven by conversion of the concho volumes from two to three-stream that we signaled on the third-quarter call. it's in line with what we were expecting.
so, i would expect that what you're seeing as realizations here for fourth quarter are pretty good indication of where we expect to be.

thank you. our next question comes from josh silverstein from wolfe research. please go ahead. your line is open.
josh silverstein -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks, guys. just had a question on the asset divestitures, the $4 billion to $5 billion there. as they start coming in, are the proceeds going right to debt reduction? or could this potentially accelerate the return of capital profile, whether it be via the buyback or dividend? i asked because that -- you have about $1.2 billion of short-term debt, but i don't think there's a lot of big maturities over the next few years.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, it's pretty ratable maturities. over the next few years, i can have -- bill can give you the specifics on that. but no, i think cash is cash, josh, we look at the cash flow that's coming in and we looked at the proceeds that we're getting in as well. and i think if you look at our past history, we've been sharing pretty significant percentage of both our cash and our proceeds back with our shareholder on an annual basis.
so, it's all fungible cash. and we watch the balance sheet as well. we have a $5 billion gross debt reduction target, and we're on track, and bill can maybe provide a little bit of color on that with respect to the balance sheet.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, ryan. yeah, we're right on track to achieving our $15 billion gross debt target by 2026. and as you noted, we do have some debt maturing this year, about $800 million of debt. we're expecting to repay that when it matures.
and then as we've said previously, we're looking at potential debt refinancing, and that would depend on multiple factors, including cost to retire and cost to issue new debt, and how we decide to manage that overall portfolio. we're looking at those factors and you could expect to see us act sometime relatively soon to take advantage of that supportive market if all things stay where they've been at. and as ryan pointed out, we don't mind putting cash on the balance sheet.
josh silverstein -- wolfe research -- analyst
gotcha. thanks for that. just a question on the asset base and the portfolio mix. you're increasing your position in aplng.
it's an asset that you already have a stake in. but how do you think about cop's position within the global gas market? and is this an area of the portfolio where you may want to get bigger, given what's happening with europe and asia prices?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i mean, we're pretty longer term, we're bullish on lng prices, both in europe and asia, given the trend the energy transition and what the planet is going to be going through and the role that gas is going to play on that. so, yes, that informs some of our decision to pre-empt on the sale of some of the aplng assets. it's why we're interested in the north field expansion in qatar. it's lng that services both europe and asia and then looking at what role we play in terms of that here in the u.s.
as well. that's the beauty of our cost of supply model. it's kind of indifferent to gas and oil. and if we see a structural advantage to gas developing over the next few years, it will show up in our cost of supply model and will attract additional investment.
but that's the basis -- again, the basis and the foundation for how we allocate capital, whether it's geographically or by product type or by geology.
operator
thank you. our next question is from paul cheng from scotiabank. please go ahead. your line is open.
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
all right. thank you. good morning, guys. 
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, paul. 
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
ryan, that maybe there is a little bit detail, but in -- from the fourth to the first quarter, it seems that you're going to add shell, which the production, say, call it 175 to 200. alaska production is also going to be higher. so, seems like, without other offset, the first-quarter production should be higher than your guidance. i noted that, i mean, we assume that the permian legacy production will also be somewhat higher.
so, i mean, with the offset that in order for the first quarter production guidance to come down to the 1.75 to 1.79? the second question is just -- i mean, it's not such a big deal, but i think you and total is going to take over the shell interest in midyear. you already have the ownership there. but given the really high tax regime over there and also that the political volatility, just want to understand the rationale behind why that kind of m&a will be interesting to you?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. let me go production first, and i can have dominic add a little bit of color to it as well. i think what -- paul, at a high level, i'm not worried about production at all. we're going to be just fine.
as tim described earlier, it's a bit of a back-end ramp in our lower 48, that's always going to be lumpy on a quarter-by-quarter basis depending on when you get the frac spreads out to complete the wells and when they come online. what's probably missing from people, there's a planned turnaround in qatar in the first quarter that wasn't in the fourth quarter. so, there's a few ins and outs with respect to that. so, i think that's maybe around the edges why if you're looking at just sequential production from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, you might see a little bit of differences.
on your -- to the libya question, paul, we were approached. it's not like hess wanted out of libya and its partnership after total bought marathon's interest. it remained total, conocophillips, and hess as the 2p parties in the venture in libya. we were approached and said, would we want to participate with total to take -- pick up the hess interest in there, and it's a pretty good deal.
take all your points. it's relatively low margin. it's a contract that is just the gross margin contract. we recognize that, but the deal was quite attractive on a cost of supply basis for us.
and frankly, we'd like to control who the partnership is, not necessarily interested in an outside partner coming in to take some of that. and then clearly, with total and conocophillips in libya, there may be some opportunity to have some different kinds of conversations with the libyans going forward.
operator
thank you. our next question is from bob brackett from bernstein research. please go ahead. your line is open.
bob brackett -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
good morning. if i think about that u.s. growth rate of 0.8 million to 0.9 million barrels a day and the lion's share of that being in the permian, you can start to see the day where permian gas takeaway gets exhausted. how do you guys think about your gas takeaway to meet your growth targets? and how do you see the whole basin shaking out?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i can start and anybody else can chime in, bill. with our commercial team is we're all over this, bob. and yes, we see the potential for some of that, i guess, i think we're in really good shape based on the position that we have and the infrastructure we have.
we can evacuate gas south. we can go west. and we can come into the katy hub and into the gulf coast as well. but we're watching it pretty closely because we got to make sure industrywide, we don't go back to flaring as an industry and all those kinds of things.
so, we've got to build the gas infrastructure and offtake capacity has to be there to support these macro offtakes in the oil side coming out of the broader permian basin. and maybe i can have bill add a little bit of color from our commercial team.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, sure, ryan. you're exactly right, bob, that watching the takeaway capacity out of the permian basin is something that's important to do, particularly as more production is coming on and particularly as associated gas starts ramping up, we're probably a couple of years away before you start hitting that capacity, but it's important to keep an eye on. i think as we look at a couple of things to note. first, we are currently moving several multiples of what our current production is across the permian basin.
we've got a very skilled commercial organization in terms of how we move that volume, so we have flow assurance for conocophillips production. and then you've seen in the market, there's been a couple of recent proposed pipelines coming out that would put additional takeaway capacity both down to kind of the corpus christi area and the houston area. i think those are going to be important to keep an eye on as we look at where the market goes. but flow assurance is something we definitely keep an eye on for our physical production.
bob brackett -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
great. thanks for that. a quick follow-up. what's your appetite or philosophy around revisiting the capital program in sort of midyear results?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, we watch it every month, every day, bob. and so, we're looking at the inflationary pressures that might be in the system. we're looking at what our partners are balloting us for what the operated by other activity level. and certainly, they see these kinds of prices and that pressure on the obo spend is there.
so, we look at that every year. obviously, we can impact that through our operating scope, should we choose to go do that. but again, we like the steady program nature on our operated scope. so, i guess the message as we watch it, absolutely, and we've got lots of levers in the toolbox to manage to an outcome, should we choose to go do that.
but that will be conversations and things that will come on the next couple of quarterly calls as we kind of watch the macro, watch the activity level, watch the inflationary forces that might be out there, and what sort of offsets that we're seeing on the efficiency side because as we integrate the shell assets into the portfolio that tim talked about, we still have those opportunities as well. so, there's a lot -- there's a number of moving parts, but absolutely, we'll be all over it and update the market as necessary through the remaining quarters.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from john freeman from raymond james. please go ahead. your line is open.
john freeman -- raymond james -- analyst
good afternoon. the first question i had was just a follow-up on the inflation topic, just to make sure i understand what's kind of built in on the guidance. so, the couple of hundred million dollars that you've got in the budget for inflation, is -- can you give us some idea like pretty much almost all of what you would have from a service cost inflation standpoint, is that locked in? or are there certain items that as you go through the year, you're still exposed to, i guess, ""the spot market for certain items""?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, we're not fully locked in on that side in the service side. so, we are exposed like most everybody is to what you describe as spot condition or what's happening in the service side of the industry. and again, it's predominantly in four or five categories of spend. those are the ones that we watch pretty closely.
interestingly, otcg started at $1,000 a ton, went to $2,000, has now come back down to $1,300, so for rolled steel. and we get updates frequently from our supply chain organization, chemicals because they -- a lot of them originate out of europe are up right now with the supply chain constraints that are in that. and then local kind of impacts with trucking and labor, sand and some of those things, we watch them pretty closely. but they're probably inflating a bit more, as i said earlier, than what we would have thought just eight weeks ago, when we put out our capital guidance for the year.
we've included some inflation, to your point, and we're watching that because we're also generating efficiencies as a company, and we'll update that as the year progresses.
john freeman -- raymond james -- analyst
and so, ryan, is there -- i know at least, you know, there's a few of your peers that will put out slides that say, well, x percent of our service items are sort of locked in for a given year. i mean, is there any ballpark kind of round number you could use in terms of what's locked in versus what's still exposed?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, i don't. we'd have to get back with you on that, john. you cut out on the first part of your question, sorry, but you could have a follow-up.
john freeman -- raymond james -- analyst
yeah, sure. and then just the last question for me, just thinking about maybe a longer-term perspective. when we look at the three tiers where you all have been sort of returning returns to shareholders, if you kind of exclude the synovis share sales and you just sort of look at kind of your base cash flow, you've kind of had that ordinary dividend and the buybacks have sort of been relatively kind of equal and then anything you get incremental has gone to the vroc. do you think of like tier 1 and tier 2 is that's kind of the framework that you like when you sort of think about, i don't know, your 10-year plan or something, where those are relatively kind of equal? or do you see those kind of shifting over time?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, we don't necessarily think of it as equal look at that. we actually think about what's an affordable ordinary dividend through the bottom end of the cycle. we want to make sure that we can -- it's affordable, it's reliable, it's transparent, it's growable and it's competitive with the s&p 500. so, we look at the ordinary dividend and we think about it at the bottom end of the cycle.
but we also have our view of the mid-cycle price and some combination of dividend and repurchasing our shares at what we believe is a mid-cycle price is what we'd like to be able to do for our shareholders and more importantly, make sure that it represents at least 30% of our cash going back to the shareholder. and in our mid-cycle price, the combination of those two things does that in the kind of proportions that you described. and then on top of that, we recognize the torque that we have to the upside with these higher commodity prices, and we're doing this -- we're swapping into the synovis shares. and the strength of the synovis share price has allowed us to swap into more conocophillips shares, which will be complete in the first quarter of this year.
so, all that kind of weighs in. and what's left to hit our 30% target and above is coming through that third tier that we introduced last year called the vroc, which is a cash variable return back to the shareholders. so, that's how we're using it. we think the three-tiered system is durable, it's reliable and it recognizes the reality of the volatility that we're seeing in this business.
and so, that's why we put a three-tiered system together. we like ratably buying our shares through the cycles, and we think they're still a good deal. and we like an ordinary dividend that's predictable and reliable. and we like -- we want to recognize that we've got a lot of torque to the upside and shareholders deserve a significant amount of that cash over 30% at least or more in these upcycles like we're experiencing today. 
mark keener -- vice president, investor relations
we probably have time for just one more.
operator
absolutely. thank you. our last question comes from neal dingmann from truist securities. please go ahead.
your line is open.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you all. just one last -- i guess two quick ones if i could. just, again, it's notable the amount of cash you all are kicking off, obviously. and my question is given the returns and the cash you're kicking off, why not -- and i know you guys have been opposed to this, but why not maybe lock in some of this with at least collars or something along that nature?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, we're unhedged, neal. we think shareholders buy our shares because of the upside that it represents in the commodity price and the torque that we have to the upside in the way we set up the company. so, no, we prefer to remain unhedged, and frankly, hedging would do little help. so, we have a very strong balance sheet, which helps us on the downside, and shareholders ought to expect full exposure to the upside that we're experiencing to date.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
no, great point. ok. and then just lastly on divestitures. tim mentioned -- i know you've done a couple of small ones.
my sort of two questions around that. is there anything sort of -- that you'd sort of considered noncore that might be in that sort of near-term divestiture category? and then secondly, why even do -- and given how strong your balance sheet is now, is there -- does it -- the requirement to put it in the non sort of core, does that make it more difficult and less likely to sell, given how strong the balance sheet is? thank you.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, not really. we just want to take advantage of the strong markets we're seeing today, and we recognize that we've made two pretty transformational transactions over the course of the last year, and it's raised the bar in our whole company on cost of supply. so, there's things that we're probably not going to invest in that we recognize others will invest in. so, that's been part of our mantra and our drumbeat for the last 10 years in this company.
so, we're constantly trying to high-grade the portfolio. and we see -- again, we see some more opportunities to do that across the lower 48, primarily the permian as we think about what's going to be competitive in the current portfolio.
operator

[audio gap] during the call, we'll make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. of course, actual results may differ due to the factors described in today's release and our periodic sec filings. and finally, we'll also make reference to some non-gaap financial measures today. reconciliations to the nearest corresponding gaap measure can be found in this morning's release and on our website.
and with that, let me turn the call over to ryan.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, mark. before we get into the results for the quarter, i'd like to touch on a couple of other items that are top of mind for us. the first is the war in ukraine. in a world already ravaged by the pandemic, this unprovoked invasion is having tragic consequences as we all see in heartbreaking detail in the news every day.
the bravery of the ukrainian people is inspiring, and we pray for a peaceful resolution at the earliest possible moment. this deeply troubling war is also disrupting supply chains at a time of recovering global economic growth and energy demand. it is affecting every aspect of the global economy and impacting the energy security of our allies in europe, and it's driving significant volatility in commodity prices. we are fortunate that the united states has abundant resources to ensure our own energy security.
these resources also provide vital geopolitical benefits. secure u.s. energy exports serve as a market stabilizing factor, enabling our allies to better withstand energy blackmail by hostile and unreliable resources. like the rest of industry, we've quickly restored activity levels from the lows driven by the pandemic-related energy price collapse despite lingering service and supply chain shortages, infrastructure permitting delays and lag time required for workforce and equipment redeployment.
as a result, total u.s. oil and gas production is growing meaningfully despite these headwinds. and conocophillips will continue to do our part as we fulfill our triple mandate of reliably and responsibly meeting energy transition demand, delivering competitive returns on and of capital and achieving our net zero ambition. now the other topic i'd like to touch on are the leadership changes we announced a couple of days ago.
i suspect you all saw the release on monday, but for those who might have missed it, tim will be transitioning from leading our lower 48 business, which he's done incredibly well since we combined companies a little over a year ago, to serving in an advisory role to myself and the entire leadership team. tim has truly been an industry visionary founding concho almost 20 years ago, and growing it into one of the permian's largest and best run companies before joining conocophillips. he's also been instrumental in driving value realization as we've integrated the assets into the company. i'm appreciative that we'll continue to benefit from tim's significant experience and strategic relationships in his new capacity and of course, as a member of our board.
i'm also very pleased to welcome jack harper, who most of you know, to our leadership team as executive vice president of our lower 48 business. jack is an experienced proven leader who will help ensure that our lower 48 business fulfills its key role in delivering on our triple mandate. reflecting now in the quarter. once again, we've made significant progress working on all levers across the company.
we efficiently and safely delivered our capital scope globally and successfully integrated the shell permian assets. we also took important steps to further strengthen our balance sheet and continue to upgrade our portfolio, with the sale of our mature indonesian business and the acquisition of an additional 10% stake in our long-life, high-quality aplng business. we're running well and with very strong financial performance. now building on two very successful permian transactions, we have truly transformed conocophillips.
we're a premier e&p company with a large low cost of supply, low-aged ghd intensity resource base, returns-focused strategy and the balance sheet strength to thrive through the price cycles of the evolving energy transition. and underscoring this last point, we also recently published our plan for our net zero energy transition, which is available on our website. i'm going to let bill cover the first quarter results. but before turning the call over to him, on the topic of returns, i want to highlight the fact that for the second consecutive quarter, we've again increased our targeted 2022 shareholder distributions, this time with an incremental $2 billion or a 25% increase to be distributed through the blend of share repurchases and additional variable cash return.
we continue to make significant strides in all elements of our triple mandate. and as you know, we have now a five-plus year track record of returning well over 30% of our cfo to our shareholders. the increased $10 billion target for 2022 further demonstrates our commitment to return significant value to investors through the price cycles. so now let me turn the call over to bill, and he'll cover the results for the quarter, starting with our returns on capital.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
picking up where ryan left off, we generated a return on capital employed of 19% on a trailing 12-month basis. that's 21% on a cash adjusted basis. we understand and appreciate that returns on and of capital matter to our investors, and we are fully focused on delivering to our shareholders. in the first quarter of 2022, we generated $3.27 per share in adjusted earnings.
that's driven by strong realized prices and production of 1,747,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a record level of production since we became an independent e&p 10 years ago and is bolstered by our two highly accretive permian acquisitions over the past 18 months. lower 48 production averaged 967,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter, including 640,000 from the permian, 208,000 from eagle ford and 97,000 from the bakken. operations across the rest of our global portfolio also ran well, allowing us to generate $7 billion in cash from operations, excluding working capital in the quarter. we also continue to enhance our low cost of supply, low greenhouse gas intensity portfolio, closing on both the sale of our indonesian assets and the acquisition of an additional 10% of aplng, taking ownership there to 47.5%.
both of these transactions enhance our overall margins going forward. illustrating this point, we realized roughly $500 million in cash distributions from aplng in the first quarter, and we've already received $400 million so far in the second quarter. while the full-year distributions will continue to depend on prices going forward, if you assume brent averages $100 per barrel for the year, we would expect roughly $2.3 billion of total distributions from aplng in 2022. turning back to focus on the first quarter.
in addition to the $7 billion in cfo, we generated $1.4 billion in cash to the sale of our remaining 93 million shares of synovis. and this $1.4 billion fully refunded the share repurchased here of our $2.3 billion total returns to shareholders in the quarter. we also made significant strides toward our $5 billion debt reduction target, executing a successful refinancing through which we reduced our total debt by $1.2 billion. we decreased our annual interest expense by about $100 million and extended our overall debt maturity by three years.
also in april, we called our $1.3 billion note, which was due in 2026. so we'll have achieved approximately half of our $5 billion debt reduction target by the end of may. and with the progress we've made in the first two quarters of this year and our remaining natural maturities, we'll reduce our debt by $3.3 billion this year. we are now positioned to meet our overall $5 billion reduction target in 2025.
that's one year earlier than our prior projections. as you will have noted, we also invested roughly $1.8 billion back into the business in the first quarter of the year. while this is ratable with the $7.2 billion full year capital estimate we provided last december, we're increasing our guidance to $7.8 billion. about half of the increase is due to additional low cost of supply drilling and completion activity in some of our partner-operated areas in the lower 48.
and the rest is modestly higher inflation, as we believe such supply chain constraints will be prolonged as a result of the ongoing conflict in the ukraine. from a reduction standpoint, we've adjusted our full year target from an approximate 1.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day to roughly 1.76 million per day. that's reflecting the net impact of closed a&d activity through this point in the year as well as some expected impacts from weather and well timing. so we've had a strong quarter to open the year.
we've returned $2.3 billion to our shareholders and ended the quarter with $7.5 billion of cash and short-term investments. we further enhanced our low-cost supply portfolio, and we strengthened our balance sheet. and of course, our operations around the globe are well positioned to deliver on our commitments through the rest of this year and through the energy transition that's ahead of us. with that, let's go to q&a.

[operator instructions] we have a question from jeanine wai from barclays.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
our first question, maybe to you is, we know you're committed to returning at least 30% of cash flow every year, year in, year out. can you talk about how you decided on the new $10 billion level for the total return this year? i guess just assuming strip prices that equals to 35% of at least our forecasted cash flow and that's below the 2021 level of 38% and it's below the 5-year average prior to that. we know cash balances look very, very strong, and they're growing throughout the year. and that will probably be supplemented by some divestiture proceeds as well.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, jeanine. no. we look at this quarterly review with the board quarterly.
we take an informed view of what we think the macro and the outlook for commodity prices is going to be for the rest of the year. i'd say we're -- we moved to $10 billion because we certainly felt like commodity price outlook is going to be probably above $90 a barrel and depending on where things end for the year and that supported going from $8 billion to $10 billion. and again, that's anchored in our commitment to return at least 30% of our cash flow back to our shareholders. and as you noted correctly, over the last four to five years, we've delivered even more of that and prepared to do that, should the market support that as we go forward.
the other i can say is you can see that cash is rebuilding on the balance sheet a little bit as a result of the check we wrote at the end of the year. we have a desire, we want to put some more cash on the balance sheet to do that. so at the same time, we want to keep funding our stable capital program. so as we looked at it, we certainly thought we could afford moving to $10 billion.
and that's supported by even if prices were to fall below $90 for whatever reason or if they continue to stay strong, investors should expect, calculate our cash flow, and you should expect to get a minimum of 30% of that back as we go through the year. that's been our commitment for many, many years now, and we're just living up to that commitment via these strong prices we see in the market.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
ok. great. our follow-up question is maybe moving to natural gas. so conoco, you're in a unique position among your e&p peers in that you've got a lot of scale and also the location of your resource base, especially what you have in the permian with your really strong marketing and takeaway position there.
so maybe can you discuss how your view of conoco's role in both the u.s. natural gas market and on the global scale? how that's really changed over the past six months or so? and perhaps any color you might have on your opportunity set as it relates to that would be really interesting.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, jeanine. i guess, long term, today, we're about 30% of our portfolio is natural gas. if you look at our global position, a lot of that here domestically in the u.s.
and then globally with our lng exposure. we're pretty big fans of lng. we think the asian market and the european market, obviously, as a result of this invasion of ukraine, has bolstered sort of the international gas side of it, which is why you see us doing things like competing for another train in qatar and why we pre-empted on our aplng interest in australia. so we understand lng and we'd like to get into that full value chain of that lng.
here domestically in the u.s., we have a large gas position as well. and the beauty of our cost of supply model is it's a bit indifferent to gas and oil, but we are asking ourselves, has there been a disconnect on the gas side and what do we -- what should we be interested in. and certainly, lng from the u.s. to europe or other places is something of interest as long as we can be in that full value chain.
we're not necessarily interested in just being in the liquefaction tolling business, that if we get exposed to that full value chain, that's something that we would be interested in looking at, given the nature of the gas business that's out there today.

our next question comes from neil mehta from goldman sachs.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
the first question is around the capital guidance moving from $7.2 billion to $7.7 billion. i think this was well telegraphed and certainly, we're in an inflationary environment. but would love your perspective on the components of some of those moving pieces. and as we get an early thought into 2023 and normalized spending levels, how much of this does carry forward?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, neil. i think what bill tried to describe in the call transcript a little bit was we've upped our capital from $7.2 billion to $7.8 billion. and roughly half of that is extra activity that's ongoing across our lower 48 by other operators. and these are good opportunities that are low-cost supply, very competitive in the portfolio, and we certainly don't want to be drilled out of any opportunities.
so we are funding those kinds of opportunities as we go along. the other half is inflationary driven. and i would take you back to -- we set our budget at the end of last year in december. we talked about it in our fourth quarter call, where our view of the world at the time was coming out of the pandemic, we thought we were seeing some elevated inflation rates, primarily in the permian.
but the rest of the portfolio, we didn't see as much impact. so we were thinking in the order of mid-single digit kind of inflation rates across the whole global portfolio. and currently, since the ukrainian -- and we also thought at the time that, that would abate itself in the last half of the year, as supply chains got renormalized coming out of the covid pandemic. and certainly, after the ukrainian invasion, we're seeing now inflationary forces across the entire global portfolio, with certain hotspots clearly still in the permian and on certain categories of spend like labor and rigs, steel, pipes, chemicals, and some of the key categories of spend that our industry relies upon.
so -- and i guess whether it mitigates as we go into 2023, is really a question of when does this -- all this turmoil that's going on around the world start to renormalize and get back a little bit. and at this 10 seconds, it's hard to say that that's going to renormalize anytime soon. so i think it's here with us for a while. i don't think it's transitory, and we're going to have to deal with it.
the last thing i would say is we could have chose to cut scope. we could have cut our operated scope in order to try to manage to a number. and given the current macroenvironment, that didn't make sense to us. so that's why we have raised our capital guidance for the year to $7.8 billion.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
makes a lot of sense, ryan. and that's the follow-up, it's on russia and the ukraine war. how does this structurally change the way that you think about the company and the oil and gas industry? and there are a couple of components to that question. does it make it more likely that the market is going to be more accepting of sanctioning of long lead time projects, whether in alaska or elsewhere? does this change -- does it change where you ultimately want to invest? and then can you talk real time about what you're seeing in terms of russia volumes as you guys explore -- follow the oil macro really closely? and how you see that playing out in the back half of the year, recognizing you don't have frontline operations, but you follow the situation very closely?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i think we all are, neil, trying to figure it all out. i think we've seen sort of an immediate 1 million barrels a day of russian crude off the market. our expectation at this juncture is we're expecting probably 2 million to 3 million barrels a day of russian crude with all the conversations going on in europe right now to stop both products and oil imports into europe.
we're expecting that 2 million to 3 million barrels a day being taken off the market. and that's going to be tough for the supply to ratchet up. so we think about that, that's happening on the supply side. while on the demand side, there's a little bit of uncertainty with what's going on in china and another covid.
our view of the demand side is we'll probably average close to 100 million barrels a day this year, which is kind of that pre-pandemic demand level, but we see growth in demand coming. now that could be -- that could get slowed if another wave of covid impacts the whole world. we don't see that as part of our base case. so we see demand continuing to grow over the next couple of years.
and it will be tough if we take 2 million to 3 million barrels a day of additional russian supply off the market, it will be tough for supply to keep up in the short and medium term. so it does have an impact as we think about the need for medium- and longer-cycle projects, the need for a call on more u.s. growth, which i think is coming this year. we think probably 1 million barrels a day and something similar next year.
and i think it does kind of change the view angle on medium- and longer-cycle projects long term because of the underinvestment in the industry, with the demand growth continuing and supply being challenged to keep up with that. and then what that means back for the company is we're spending a lot of time rethinking a longer term or medium and longer-term macro, what the energy transition has in store and how quickly that might start to abate demand. and i think the immediate manifestation is what is your view of mid-cycle pricing over the short, medium and longer term right now. and while i don't think that impacts our capital allocation scheme and our cost of supply methodology and how we think about allocating capital, it does maybe at the broader level when you think about how much you have available for distributions and then what channels should you be distributing that capital to.
and we have a three-tiered system, as you're aware of, our ordinary -- we'd like to ratably buy shares through the cycles. and then we introduced our third tier, the cash return vroc to supplement that in these times when prices are well in excess of what we think a mid-cycle might be.
operator
our next question comes from phil gresh from j.p. morgan.
phil gresh -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
my first question is just on the permian. in the first quarter, the quarter-over-quarter increase in production looked to have been below the amount of the acquired volumes from shell. and i recognize there's quarter-to-quarter variability, but i was just wondering if you could talk about some of those moving pieces, but also more importantly, just how you're thinking about that cadence of activity for the rest of the year, given what you're talking about around obo activity and other factors?
tim leach -- executive vice president, lower 48
yes, phil. this is tim. i'll take that one. we've been really pleased -- let me first say, i'm really pleased with the way the team has integrated the shell assets into our overall company and activity.
they've done a great job. it's been a safe combination. and we have just now begun bringing wells online with our vendors and our style of completion and things like that. so if you look at the pace of activity in the lower 48, we were going to bring on 500 completed wells throughout the year.
i think we brought on 90 in the first quarter. and so it's always been back-end loaded and building on a ramp of -- we closed the quarter with 22 drilling rigs in the lower 48 and 8 frac spreads. and we planned -- when we rolled out our 10-year plan and guidance, we were going to build that over the next 10 years. and we're still on track to deliver all that type of activity.
and so that's the plan we're on. that's what ryan described as not cutting our capital back, but trying to run a steady ship and get the most efficiency out of it. so if you look at the ramp in activity throughout the year, that's true across our asset base, especially true in the permian, 500 completed wells brought on throughout the entire year, but 90 in the first quarter. so it's going to build and be back-end loaded.
phil gresh -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. great. that's helpful. second question, i think, would be for bill.
clearly, significant reductions in net debt in the first quarter. you talked about the pay down of the gross debt and the targets you have there. i'm curious how you think about the right levels of net debt or cash that you're holding because i think you also have, what, $2 billion to $3 billion of asset sales still coming here. so it just seems like you -- even with the $10 billion return of capital, there's a lot of cash building up.
so any additional color there?
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. sure, phil. so i think that you can see it manifesting itself in the rebuild of our balance sheet with our cash growing to $7.5 billion. i think we're pretty happy right now with our pace in terms of debt reduction and how the program is set up.
we've got our glide path set up for the next five years. so i think you can look at just the natural maturities as we go through time. and i think we've been pretty opportunistic in the market to set that up and are quite happy with where that's at. but i think as you rightly noted, that we'll be continuing to build up cash on the balance sheet.
we're looking forward to some asset dispositions here later part of this year, and that's going to be going to generating cash.
operator
our next question comes from doug leggate from bank of america.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
may i first say, tim, it sounds like we're going to hear a little less from you in the future. and whatever you do next, i just want to say good luck, it's been great getting to know you over the last 10 years. so with that, i have two questions, if i may. my first one is probably for bill.
and i just wonder if you could give us an update, bill, with all the changes, given the shell acquisition and obviously concho, what is your current deferred tax position in the u.s.? when do you expect to see full cash taxes there? and my second question, if i may, is a big picture question for ryan. ryan, there's been two things came out, i guess, climate-related recently. one is the proposal from the sec on climate disclosure and the second is the api's suggestion of a carbon tax. i'm just wondering if you could offer conoco's perspective on those issues, please.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
great. i'll let bill talk about the cash tax, and then i can address the last part. but i would say, tim is not leaving us, doug. we look forward to his continued involvement in all the key decisions in the company.
so -- but let me turn it back to bill first.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. sure, doug. assuming that current pricing continues, we would expect to be moving into a u.s. tax paying position this year with payments beginning quarterly starting this quarter, in the second quarter.
of course, the amounts and timing are going to vary depending on pricing and other market conditions, but we do expect to return to a cash tax paying position this year and starting to make estimated payments in this quarter.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
and with respect to your last part, doug, certainly, we're all kind of reviewing in quite a bit of detail what the current climate suggestions that have come out of the sec in the rule-making process. we'll be commenting on that as part of industry as well. they're a bit problematic. i mean, we said all along, we're supportive of doing everything a company can do on scope 1 and scope 2 reductions as a company.
and we came out with our ambition to be paris aligned and net zero by 2050 with respect to the emissions that we produce as a company. and all companies ought to have a paris-aligned climate risk strategy in order to address that to deal with the emissions they create. i guess the problematic piece has always been the scope 3 because of the double counting, because of who's responsible for that, and should you hold a company like conocophillips responsible for a consumer's decision to buy a pickup truck versus a toyota prius. and i think those are things in the scope 3 side of things that we think are problematic.
if you report them, they change. they're subject to double counting. and they have a lot of problems associated with how you might actually report against those certainly in an sec sort of document that has to be included in your qs or your ks. it's, we think, quite problematic, which is why for quite a while as a company, we've been supportive of if you want to impact the demand side of the equation, you need to do something like a carbon tax.
so we've been a part of api and a part of that decision process within our industry association to say the best way to deal with this on the demand side is to have a heavy carbon tax. so we were a founding member of the climate leadership council with the dividend back to offset the regressive nature of attacks. but -- so consumers can make choices and decisions around the kinds of services and goods that they supply and understand what the carbon impact of that might be. we understand that that's a political hill to climb, and it's tough.
but it makes more sense to us than trying to regulate your way to a solution that let the markets work and price carbon into the market, which is why we've been supportive of that as a better way to deal with the energy transition.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
you've been leaders on this topic, ryan, so i appreciate the answer.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, doug.
operator
the next question comes from paul cheng from scotia howard weil.
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
two questions. i think it's actually really short. first one, i want to go back into the cash tax. bill, from an accounting standpoint, do you estimate the full year cash tax rate and then apply throughout the year in each quarter until the full year estimate has been changed over each quarter that's being estimated? that's the first question.
the second question, i think, is for tim. also real quick, what is the first quarter weather impact on your production by region or by the different play? and also that what's the second quarter weather impact in bakken that we see so far?
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. sure, paul. so for u.s. cash tax paying position, we estimate our annual taxes on a yearly basis and then we pay quarterly on estimated taxes.
and as i indicated, we expect to start making those quarterly payments in the second quarter of this year.
tim leach -- executive vice president, lower 48
yes, paul. on the weather question, we had weather impact in all our major basins in the first quarter. it was -- i'm really proud of how the team responded to that. we got things back on fairly quickly.
i would say the weather impact, while it affected almost all of our production, it was rather nominal, and we were able to overcome that. as to the second part of your question about up in the bakken. i think everybody is aware that is probably the most severe winter in recorded history up in north dakota, and we're still assessing the amount of time it's going to take to bring that back up to full production. so i think the assessment is still going on there.
nick olds -- executive vice president, global operations
paul, this is nick, too. i'll just add on to what tim was saying related to turnaround impacts for q2 and q3. so q2, we've got a fairly large turnaround activity, both in norway nonoperated and operated as well as surmont. so that will average about 35,000 barrels a day for q2.
and then we have less activity in q3, and that's focused on alaska, train 2, aplng, and then montney and canada and that will be 15,000 for q3. so 35,000, q2; 15,000 for q3.
operator
our next question comes from john freeman from raymond james.
john freeman -- raymond james -- analyst
first question, ryan, when you were talking about just given everything that's happened in the market, how you have to constantly kind of be evaluating the sort of a 10-year sort of macro and energy transition, demand impact, your view of mid-cycle pricing. and then one of the things that you mentioned that i was hoping you maybe expand a little bit on, as you said, maybe it would possibly change the view of how you think about kind of short cycle versus long cycle production?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, john. i'm just trying to make the point that i think the transition is not going to be a cliff transition. it's going to be a drawn out one and the pace of that -- the slope of that curve is pretty unknown. so the way you react to that is have the lowest cost of supply barrels that you can supply whatever that transition demand is going to look like and make sure that they're giving an adequate and competitive return.
and i think we're well set up to go do that. and the point i was making is that the -- in all these scenarios, even some of the iea scenarios that they look at and we monitor four or five different scenarios internally to the company, most of those suggest that there's going to be a need for oil and gas long past 2050. so -- but we have to supply that sustainably. we have to supply that with a low ghg intensity going to net zero by 2050 but we also have to supply low cost of barrels.
so when you look at that, it's going to be around a long time. so sure, medium- and longer-cycle projects are going to be needed in this industry. we just have to assure ourselves that they're competitive on a cost of supply basis and then they have a competitive ghg intensity as well. and so projects like willow and alaska fit that mode.
they're well under a $40 cost of supply. they are less than $10 a kilogram per barrel of co2 intensity. so they fit well within what the world is going to need in order to ratably and reliably supply the energy to a growing world where energy demand is going to be increasing over time. we have to figure out how to do that more sustainably.
john freeman -- raymond james -- analyst
and then my follow-up question for tim and jack. i know on the shell assets, you all stated in the past that the biggest opportunity there is transitioning from the 1 mile of the 2-mile laterals and to accomplish that, that's going to require coring up a lot of that acreage with some of the partners. and just kind of wanted an update sort of how that's progressing. and then if all sort of goes according to plan, kind of what would be a reasonable amount of that acreage that could be done with 2-mile-plus laterals?
nick olds -- executive vice president, global operations
yes. thank you, john. we're -- these trades and swaps are a core competency of the team. so we're continuing that.
the -- we've seen good opportunity there, and it's starting to manifest itself in some longer laterals, both on the operated and the non-op on the shell assets, and i expect that to continue.
operator
our next question comes from leo mariani from keybanc.
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
just wanted to follow up a little bit on some of your comments around lng here. really, what i'm just trying to get a sense of is, do you all at conoco, through your kind of extensive global marketing footprint, think can the u.s. really do anything in the next couple of years, say, '23 and '24 to add any incremental lng export capacity at this point in time? or are those adds more kind of mid-decade and beyond? just trying to get a sense of whether or not there can be more material connectivity between europe and asia and the u.s. in the next few years.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. sure, leo. this is bill. i think that if you look at lng export capacity today, it's running a little over 12 bcf a day.
the u.s. export terminals are running effectively at capacity or slightly above nameplate. i think that you've got several folks who are out in the market who are looking at taking fid, but there's a practical reality that once you take fid, it's several years to build these terminals. so i think if you're looking at impact in terms of immediate term or mid-decade, i'd say it's closer toward mid-decade before you start seeing these new import -- these new export facilities online.
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's helpful for sure. just wanted to ask a brief question on your canadian production, i guess, primarily in the montney here. as i'm kind of looking at your conventional non-oil sands volumes, it looks like they've kind of been dropping for the last four quarters based on the data you all provide.
do you expect those volumes to start growing at some point, maybe in the back half of the year or '23? what can you kind of tell us about the trajectory of the montney there?
nick olds -- executive vice president, global operations
yes, leo. this is nick. one of the factors that we have to look back at as we took a fairly large capital cost, obviously, in 2020, and then we're in maintenance mode in 2021. we didn't have any rigs or frac crews.
so we've restarted that program earlier this year, we started fracking the wells. that's pad 4, and then we're also drilling pad 5 and pad 6. so that drop that you're seeing over the last four quarters is really just a lack of work that we're doing up in montney. so we're started back to drilling both, like i said, pad 5, pad 6, we'll see some of that production come on stream in q3 and q4.
and then another thing, leo, that we're doing is we're working on our cpf2 facility expansion. that's where we're adding both gas handling, our condensate recovery and then water handling. we're about 30% complete on that, and that's on schedule and that will come on stream in 2023 as well. the condensate recovery unit will allow us to really monetize on that kelt acreage that we picked up a few years ago.

welcome to the q2 2022 conocophillips earnings conference call. my name is richard, and i'll be your operator for today's call. [operator instructions] i will now turn the call over to mark keener, vice president, investor relations. mr.
keener, you may begin.
mark keener -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, richard, and welcome to everyone joining us for our second quarter earnings call. first, let me introduce the members of the conocophillips leadership team taking part in today's call. we have ryan lance, chairman and ceo; bill bullock, evp and chief financial officer; dominic macklon, evp of strategy, sustainability, and technology; nick olds, evp of global operations; jack harper, evp of lower 48; and tim leach, advisor to the ceo. on the call, ryan and bill will provide some opening comments, after which the team is available to take your questions.
before i turn it over to them, just a few quick reminders. in conjunction with this morning's press release, we posted supplemental materials that include second quarter earnings results and highlights, earnings and cash flow summaries, price realizations and sensitivities for estimating earnings and cash flow and updated guidance for the third quarter and full year. during the call, we'll make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. of course, actual results may differ due to the factors noted in today's release and in our periodic sec filings.
and finally, we'll make reference to some non-gaap financial measures today. reconciliations to the nearest corresponding gaap measure can be found in this morning's release and on our website. with that, i'll turn it over to ryan. 
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, thank you, mark. and for those -- mark has elected to retire. so i want to start off by really thanking him for more than 30 years of dedicated service to our company and wish him well in retirement. and at the same time, i'd like to warmly welcome phil gresh, who will be joining our team next month as vice president of investor relations.
now before i get into the results for the quarter, i'd also like to touch on a few things that continue to be top of mind for us. the ongoing tragic invasion in ukraine and the residual implications from covid have significantly impacted supply chains around the world, with shock waves driving both product shortages and elevated levels of volatility, including large swings in commodity prices. the combination of these factors has brought into sharp focus their critical importance of u.s. and global energy security and reliability.
by fulfilling our triple mandate of responsibly and reliably meeting energy transition pathway demand, delivering competitive returns on and of capital and progressing toward achieving our net zero operational emissions ambition, we're playing a key role in providing secure, dependable energy solutions that are clearly needed around the globe. the guiding principles of our triple mandate were key to our recent actions and announcements regarding global lng supply capacity, as the use of natural gas in place of coal and refining products represents an opportunity for significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions around the world. we believe this reality is going to drive increasingly strong global lng demand and related opportunities well into the future. as recently announced, we entered into an hoa with sempra for a possible investment in the port arthur lng project that's currently underway.
the potential investment is designed to leverage our company's considerable strength as one of the largest gas producers and marketers in north america, while expanding our global lng business. this potential investment is expected to be project financed and, if executed, would afford us the opportunity to participate in additional strategically located lng projects, as well as to jointly pursue related emissions reduction opportunities. that announcement followed our recently completed 10% ownership increase in aplng, as well as our selection to participate in qatar's north field east project, adding to our long positive relationship with qatarenergy. our recent decision to join the ogmp 2.0 initiative is also in service to achieving our triple mandate, as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including methane is an imperative for our company and our sector.
applying the rigorous ogmp 2.0 reporting standard, which incorporates third-party verification will be a vital step on our path to net zero operational emissions. now before i turn the call over to bill to cover the second quarter performance, let's discuss for a moment on the equally important returns element of our triple mandate. looking at, first, at returns on capital, we generated a trailing 12-month roce of 24% in the quarter, 5 points higher than the 19% we delivered last quarter. turning next to our returns of capital.
once again, we've increased our targeted 2022 distributions to shareholders, taking the total full year expected returns to $15 billion. this represents a 50% increase from the target announced last quarter with the $15 billion to be distributed across our three tiers of ordinary dividends, share repurchases and vroc. at current strip prices, this represents a return to shareholders of slightly more than 50% of our projected cfo for the year. our commitment to achieving our triple mandate is unwavering and delivering competitive returns on and of capital to our shareholders through the cycles is a key component of that commitment.
now let me turn it over to bill to cover our overall performance for the quarter.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, thanks, ryan. and as you noted, we generated a return on capital employed of 24% on a trailing 12-month basis. on a cash adjusted basis, that improves to 27%. turning to earnings per share.
we generated $3.91 per share in adjusted earnings in the quarter. this was driven by strong realized prices and production of almost 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. as we previously mentioned, production volumes in the second quarter were reduced by scheduled turnaround, as well as some unplanned weather and other minor impacts. lower 48 production averaged 977,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter, including 634,000 from the permian, 233,000 from eagle ford and 91,000 from the bakken.
operations across the rest of our global portfolio also ran well, leading us to generate $7.8 billion in cash from operations in the quarter, excluding working capital. this includes roughly $750 million in distributions from aplng, and we continue to project full year distributions of $2.3 billion, with roughly $300 million expected in the third quarter. we also invested $2 billion back into the business in the second quarter, resulting in free cash flow of $5.9 billion. that more than covered the total $3.3 billion we returned to shareholders in the quarter, as well as the $1.9 billion used to reduce total debt.
these actions taken in combination with the $600 million in disposition proceeds and the repurchase of approximately $300 million in long-term investments, resulted in cash back of $8.5 billion as of june 30. turning to the second half. we provided a third quarter production guidance range of 1.7 million to 1.76 million barrels of oil equivalent per day and reduced our full year production from 1.76 million to 1.74 million per day. that's primarily related to risking of projected production from libya in the second half of the year, as well as some modest updates across the portfolio.
now in conjunction with these changes, we reduced dd&a guidance from $7.7 billion to $7.6 billion for the year. we also increased full year 2022 adjusted operating cost guidance to $7.5 billion from the prior $7.3 billion. now this is reflecting commodity-related price impacts. we reduced guidance for the corporate segment loss from $1 billion to $900 million, primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from our recent debt reduction and higher interest earned on cash balances, along with some restructuring efforts.
operating capital guidance for the year remains unchanged at $7.8 billion. so to sum it up, we have delivered another strong quarter across all aspects of our triple mandate. our diverse global asset portfolio continues to run well. we returned $3.3 billion to our shareholders in the second quarter, ended the quarter with $8.5 billion of cash and short-term investments, and increased our full year return of capital target to $15 billion.
we continue to strengthen our fortress balance sheet, and we have reduced total debt by $3 billion year to date. and we further enhanced our low-cost energy transition-oriented portfolio by expanding our current and future presence in the growing global lng market and by joining the ogmp 2.0 initiative. now with that, let's go to q&a.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question on the line comes from mr. neil mehta from goldman sachs.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning, team. and, mark, you will be -- definitely be missed, and congratulations to phil, who -- if you're listening on the line, looking forward to working with you in the new capacity. the first question is for you, ryan. big announcement in terms of incremental return of capital.
and the questions we got from investors this morning, given there's a variable element to it, is should we think of this as being oil price dependent in any way? or should we view this as a financial commitment from conoco that no matter -- assuming reasonable market volatility, that's a number you can count on.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, neil. i think if you're thinking -- if your question is specific to 2022, i think you can count on this return coming back to the shareholders in 2022. we took a broad look at the market from the volatility perspective that you described and felt comfortable that we could increase the distributions to $15 billion using the three channels that we've been using in the past. so you can count on that in 2022.

thanks. and, ryan, i'd love your perspective on some of the long-term growth projects that the company is leaning into here. the announcement in qatar potential investment in u.s. gulf coast and then making progress on alaska, how does that fit into the long-term conoco strategy? and do you think that the company is taking a little bit more of a growth orientation here relative to just a free cash flow orientation? thank you.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i wouldn't describe it as a growth orientation. i think we -- long term, we want to grow and develop our company. we're trying to do things, first and foremost, they fit within our construct of cost of supply in our portfolio.
so we recognize the volatility in the markets. we don't want to be investing anything that has a cost of supply over $40. we recognize we need to do that to generate the free cash flow and generate the returns on and of capital. so everything that we're doing is in service to that.
now we do recognize that certainly post-ukrainian invasion, and we've had long held this view that gas is going to be more of a transition fuel as we transition to lower-carbon alternatives going forward, and we wanted to play. we have a lot of capacity in the gas space, both lng and natural gas. we've got a very large position in north america, both between alaska, canada and the u.s. lower 48, and we wanted to augment that with additional lng liquefaction capacity.
so we've been looking at this for quite some time, and the opportunity presented itself with sempra. so, yes, there's some added scope. and clearly, we've signaled for quite some time that we wanted to participate in the expansion projects in qatar. we think that's some of the lowest-priced gas in the world, and it's going to fit well globally.
it could be directed to both asia and to europe going forward. so i think everything we're doing is in service to our cost of supply monitor in terms of how we think about the investments that we want to make, and that we're interested in growing the development of the company over the long term, and we believe we're at the front end of a pretty constructive cycle in the commodity business going forward just given our view of the macro supply demand dynamics in the business today. so when these fit with our construct around how we think about the projects we want to invest in, they make sense for the company, they're consistent with our capabilities and our stuff that we're really good at in the company. so they make sense.
sometimes you can't dictate the pace to these things. and when they come and make themselves available, we're very interested in participating, like the deal with -- the opportunity with sempra on the gulf coast liquefaction.
operator
thank you. our next question on line comes from mr. stephen richardson from evercore isi.
stephen richardson -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. thank you. i'd like to also thank mark for all the help and wish him the best. he will definitely be missed.
the first question, i guess, is just following up on those comments, ryan, on sempra. i was wondering if you could just maybe talk a little bit about, do you think about the returns here relative to the backward integration into your existing u.s. gas production? do you think about it much more on a merchant basis? and also just curious if you could talk about like why this project relative to the other opportunities and variable you looked at in terms of more gulf coast gas?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, stephen. i think let me take the last one first a little bit. this was a permitted kind of shovel-ready project.
we like the location, we know that area pretty well and we like the expansion opportunities that come with it and the optionality that it creates on the site, scale, and scope, which is why we chose sempra over some of the other opportunities that kind of presented themselves on the gulf coast. and also the action link that it has to the west coast lng that they have with their mexican opportunities that are going on there. so it was a really good fit. we know sempra pretty well.
we've worked with them in the past. a good fit culturally to the company and consistent sort of culture in terms of how we think about the business, the markets and where natural gas is going globally. more to your first part, yes, we think about this in a very integrated fashion. so it's not only liquefaction, but it's moving it into the market, and that it's a recognition that with the transactions we've done over the last year and the core assets inside the portfolio in the lower 48, both canada and the lower 48, we recognize we've got a large potential natural gas position.
and we want to create value for that position in a very integrated fashion. so it's the integrated nature of the project. not any one element, but they all tie together. the ability to supply gas to the liquefaction facility, the taking of the 5 million tons of commitment moving it into the markets that we know really well and getting into that fully integrated chain is what interested us the most.
stephen richardson -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's really helpful. thank you. if i could just have a quick follow-up on -- there's some movement, it seems in washington or at least discussions about cleaning up some of the permitting challenges that the industry face, particularly around nepa. and i'm wondering if maybe you could talk a little bit about what would need to happen to kind of push willow a little bit higher up.
that's the one project, obviously, we think about when you hear about nepa, but maybe you could address that, please.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. nepa needs reform, stephen. it can take 10 years or more cycle time. and it's not just our industry, it's all industries, even the guys that i talked to that are wind developers and solar farm developers complain to the same thing.
it takes a long time, the coordination through all the various government agencies that have responsibility within the nepa process, and it just takes a lot of time. so having some better coordination, giving some deadlines to response times, giving good public comment review periods, but don't let them extend and definitely like this administration tends to do a little bit and past administrations have tended to do for that matter. so you have a nepa process is in desperate need of reform to try to make it run smoother, quicker and have coordinating groups shepherd this through the various agencies that have some responsibility through the course of the process. and i understand they're looking at that, maybe it's a companion bill to the sharmila mulligan bill.
so it gives us a little bit of question as to whether or not it will get done, but it is in desperate need of some nepa reform. now willow specifically, we've been in this process a long time, so we're in the final throes of that. we've got the supplemental eis statement through the department of interior, it's out in the public comment today. again, we'd like to -- the public has had plenty of time to comment on this project.
i think we know where everybody stands. so it's time to make a decision to move forward. and we look forward to that record of decision coming here later this year so we can get moving forward on the project. we think we've satisfied all the concerns that the federal judge has had, and we're ready to move forward.
operator
thank you. our next question on line comes from jeanine wai from barclays.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone. thanks for taking our questions.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. good morning, jeanine.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
we'd also like to throw our congratulations to mark on your retirement, and thanks so much for your time, and you'll be very missed. our first question maybe dovetails on neil's question on cash returns. just maybe digging in a little bit more. does the increase primarily reflect a stronger-than-expected commodity price environment? or are there other factors that are kind of driving the increase? i mean, i guess we had anticipated some kind of increase given we saw a really strong free cash flow outlook, but we thought it would be kind of walked up over time.
so the $5 billion increase, it exceeded our expectations. i think it exceeded the market's expectations. so any color on how you're thinking about future potential there would be great.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
hello, jeanine. we look at a lot of things. we have an informed view of the supply demand dynamics and the macro where it's going. there's a lot of volatility as you know in the market.
so we wanted something that we could make sure that -- we could guarantee that we could deliver in 2022, even with the backward dated nature of the forward curve a little bit. but we have a pretty constructive on the commodity price. the other thing that kind of enters into our conversation is where we are on the balance sheet. we know we have a very, very strong balance sheet.
we're interested in rebuilding a little bit of cash after the last transaction earlier this year that we spent some cash on, which has been a very good transaction for the company. we're really pleased with how that's going. and jack can chime in on some of that if there's a later question. but i think it's -- where our cash position is on the balance sheet.
we still want to build some cash on the balance sheet for the volatility we see in the market and the terms that we see going forward, but we're pretty constructive over the next few years on the commodity price. so we feel like the progress that we've made was pretty good that allowed us then to maybe increase the distribution back to the shareholders above and beyond maybe what the market might have been expecting over the last few months.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you. our second question, maybe moving to capex and inflation. it continues to be a pretty tough operating environment out there between inflation and a tight supply chain.
can you maybe discuss how your costs are trending versus your expectations? and we kind of thought conoco would true up the capex budget for the recently announced participation in the north field lng project, but you reiterated the capex budget this morning. so if you're able to clarify for us if there's anything in the '22 budget for that participation, that would be very helpful. thank you.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. maybe i'll say a few high words. obviously, inflation is still with us. it's staying with us.
it's different around the old different pieces of the world. maybe i can ask bill to chime in on some of that. and then, nick, maybe you can address jeanine's question specifically on the timing of nfe.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. sure, ryan. so, jeanine, we continue to expect our overall company inflation to be in the 7% to 8% range, and that's what's reflected in our capital guidance of $7.8 billion, just like we talked about in the first quarter call. like everyone else, with our higher activity levels in permian, that's where we're experiencing the most inflation, what we're watching, and we're continuing to keep an eye on that.
nick olds -- senior vice president, strategy and technology
jeanine, this is nick. yeah, just on the north field expansion, so obviously, we got the 25% equity in half a train. so to put that in perspective, qatarenergy communicated that the total project, that's four trains of 8 million tons per ounce, so a total of 32 million is 29 billion for that. our effective working interest is 3.125%.
so if you take that that gives us an estimated incremental capex of approximately $900 million for the nfe project. now related to timing, as ryan mentioned, this project has been going on for a couple of years with drilling and putting in platforms. so we'll have an initial catch-up payment for our share of the project costs, either late this year or early next, and that's not determined at this point in time. and with respect to start-up of first lng as qatarenergy has communicated, that is in 2026.
again, this would be incremental to any guidance.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. so jeanine, that's incremental. if it did -- if a catch-up payment that did occur this year, that would be incremental to the $7.8 billion that we guided to.
operator
thank you. our next question on line comes from mr. roger read from wells fargo.
roger read -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yeah, thank you. good morning. and, mark, congratulations. you seem far too younger man to retire, but you got to do what you got to do, right? anyway, question i'd like to get on kind of comes back to the overall lng and tying it together your existing operations, and obviously, the two new seems, i guess, one for sure and one likely investment.
you're a big gas trader in the u.s., to some extent, globally. i was just curious does that create a new integrated sort of business we should think about down the road. and what would be the opportunities there? probably gets a little bit back to stephen's question about the return structure of the transaction overall with sempra.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. let me -- i'll start that. maybe i can have bill chime in a little bit on the commercial aspects of what we're doing in this space. but you're right, roger.
i think we look at it, again, very integrated nature. so we're marketing 7 to 8 bcf a day of gas every day in north america. so we're -- the opportunity to supply gas into a multiple train project at port arthur, texas is intriguing to us, then our commitment to take the 5 million tons, we've got a lot of experience moving it into the market. bill can describe.
there's a commercial team in london. we got a commercial team in singapore. we're used to both the european and the asian markets. we'll figure out how best to move that 5 million tons, and there may be a spot compliment to that.
we don't know. we'll work that out as we go through. but that very integrated nature all the way from the supply side through taking the gas and selling it to customers is what was of interest to us in looking at it on an integrated fashion. i don't know, bill, if there's any more color you might provide on the commercial side.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. sure, ryan. roger, as ryan highlighted, is this integrated nature that's most exciting about it. we are one of the largest marketers in north america, certainly a top five marketer.
i think lately, we're pushing no. 2. so we're very comfortable with supply, and we move orders of magnitude above our physical production. so the optionality that being able to supply lng regas facilities is pretty interesting to us.
it's also interesting to us in terms of ensuring strong flow assurance for our own production. and then we've got a history of well over 40 years of marketing lng through asia. we started the trade into japan with our kenai facility. we've been in the lng business for quite a long time.
as ryan mentioned, we've got offices in london, singapore, and japan. we've been moving spot volumes in the market here off of aplng. and so it's a part of the market we know quite well and pretty excited about this integrated nature of being able to create value across that chain.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
and the other part, roger, i would say -- jack could chime in too here, but just the gas resource that we have as a result of the transactions over the last couple of years, we've got a very large, high-quality gas resource that we could -- we hope to be pivoting to over time to even supply a lot of this gas.
roger read -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yeah, for sure. the other question, just coming back, you talked earlier about potential positives like a nepa reorg and all that sort of thing. i was just wondering in the ira bill with some of the issues on a methane tax, conoco has certainly been ahead of the game on overall emissions reductions and everything. but is there anything in that or any of the other aspects of the bill, 15% minimum tax, things like that, we should think of as headwinds?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i think, generally speaking, the sharmila mulligan bill is -- i'm not sure if it's a good time ever to the increasing taxes and increasing government spending, just as a general economic policy, and that's a large part of what this bill goes to. now specific to our industry, at least the agreement recognizes that natural gas and oil are an important part of the energy transition and they're going to be here for decades. so that's a positive. i think the methane feed to your point, it's got some books in it.
we'll have to see how it develops over time and comes out with the extra regulation coming out of epa. our general view is if you're going to regulate it, why do you have to put a fee on top of that. we'll have to see how that's structured. it generally won't, as we understand it today, maybe impact companies like conocophillips that have been very proactive in the emissions space.
and you saw our ogmp 2.0 agreement to join that, specifically targeting methane itself. so at least the agreement incentivizes some carbon capture by addressing the 45q. so it's uncertain right now. the earlier comment, i think, from stephen on nepa reform, too, there's supposed to be a companion bill that comes with this that addresses a lot of that, and that leaves a lot of uncertainty in the process.
so kind of mixed views at this point in time, roger.
operator
thank you. our next question on the line comes from mr. doug leggate from bank of america.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
well, thanks, everybody. and, mark, let me offer my congratulations to you as well. i'm not sure mr. gresh will be as much fun to travel with, but good luck in your retirement.i guess, bill, maybe i could start with you.
last quarter, you talked about the u.s. business moving into full cash tax. i wonder if you could just give us an update as to whether we're there yet. and what -- when you wrap it all together with the rest of the portfolio, including the recent norwegian changes, how should we think about the cash tax outlook for conoco going forward?
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, sure. happy to, doug. we moved into a u.s. tax paying position in the second quarter.
and of course, the amounts and timing through 2022 can vary depending on price and other market conditions. but the majority of our u.s. taxes in the second quarter were paid in cash with very minimal offsets from nols. and looking at the limitations on nols, we'd expect to be our tax payments through 2023 to be reduced only slightly, but not eliminated.
so at a high level, we're in a cash tax paying position. our effective tax rate for the second quarter was about 32%. moving forward, i expect our effective tax rate to stay in the mid-30s assuming production lines with our guidance and forward curves.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
so basically, if there is an e&p, there's no impact from you guys, it sounds like?
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. if you're talking about the 15% corporate minimum tax pursuit proposed an ira, we don't expect that to have any material impact on the company because we exceed a 15% minimum tax across our jurisdictions.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great stuff. thank you for that. my follow-up is i wonder if i could try and tackle the capex question from a slightly different angle. when you wrap all of the moving parts together, cash tax is changing, obviously, a little bit of inflation on the operating costs.
and then, of course, the overall capital budget, an issue that going back to when matt was around, we used to get a lot was the idea of what the sustaining capital breakeven was for the portfolio. so i wonder if i could ask you to, as you look to 2023, what does that look like? and obviously, gas prices have moved around as well. but if you could give us an update as to how you see that covering your sustaining capital as opposed to the total capital. and i'll leave it there.
thank you.
dominic macklon -- senior vice president of strategy and technology
yeah. thanks, doug. it's dominic here. yeah, there are some moving parts, and we'll be refreshing that as we pull our plans together.
we're just going through our annual planning cycle right now. i mean, i think looking at this year, our actual breakeven this year is still calculating out around $30 a barrel capital breakeven. so sustaining capital around $6 billion. now there's obviously some inflation pressure on that.
but the way we think about sustaining capital is you're probably going to be focused on that in a lower macro world, if you like, and inflation not quite so high. so we still think that structurally, this year, we're in about -- sustaining capital would be about $6 billion. clearly, that, with some long-cycle projects coming, longer cycle, low cost of supply projects coming, that will add to that for a temporary period, and we'll provide more information on that i expect by the end of the year.
operator
thank you. our next question on line comes from mr. john royall from j.p. morgan.
john royall -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. thanks for taking my question. so just a question on your cadence of production in the permian. i know you talked about it being back half weighted in the prior quarter and looks like a modest tick down in 2q.
so can you just speak to the cadence for the back half and expectations for 3q versus 4q? and then maybe just a broad update on your drilling program there.
jack harper -- executive vice president, lower 48
yeah, good morning. this is jack. in general, the production in both the lower 48 and in the permian is back-half weighted, and we expect low single-digit growth year over year on a pro forma basis. but on an entry-exit basis, we expect lower 48 to grow in the mid- to high single digits with the permian at the higher end of that range.
as for expectations for activity, good news is we're -- we plan to run steady in the back half of the year, and we are currently running the number of rigs that we plan to run for the rest of the year.
john royall -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. and then if you could just give some color on crude realizations, looks really strong in the quarter when you look at your slide there. very strong across the board, but north sea was particularly strong. so just anything going on there broadly or regionally to point out?
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, sure. if you look at our realizations overall, and we provided a summary of that in the supplemental information, total realizations for the quarter were about 78% of brent. that's really driven by four factors as we look at it, john. first is, that's the narrowing of the brent, wti spread.
brent increased about 12%. wti was about 15%. henry hub was up significantly more compared relative to brent, it was up 44%. so that's impacting the total realizations.
and then on the crude side, in particular, we had better realizations coming out of alaska for the quarter. that's really last to returning to more of its normal type realizations. in the first quarter, you may recall we had an impact for our hollyfrontier refinery downtime in the first quarter that was impacting our prices. and then we saw better realizations out of norway.
that's really driven by cargo timing across the quarters. so that's really what's impacting our crude realizations across the company.
operator
thank you. our next question on line comes from mr. paul cheng from scotiabank.
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
thank you. good morning. let me add my congratulations to mark. thank you for all the help over the years.
two quick questions, if i could. ryan, a lot of your peers have been doing some bolt-on -- some pretty large bolt-on acquisitions in, say, whether just in bakken or that in eagle ford or in permian. when you're looking at your portfolio, do you see a lot of opportunity for you to further firm up or strengthen your portfolio in those three through the bolt-on acquisition or that you think the value proposition is not really that attractive? the second one is, in the first half,  the split between dividend and buyback is roughly one-third dividend and two-thirds buyback. is that a good proxy for us to assume on a going-forward basis when aided to your distribution? thank you.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, paul. we're in the market quite a bit. i think a lot of our focus right now in the lower 48, and jack can comment on as well as doing a lot of the core up.
we noted that in some of our slides. so it's -- we've been a lot of focus right now on swapping and trading acreage with the large transaction that we did earlier this year to try to core up the acreage so we can make sure we're not drilling 1 mile, but we're drilling the -- we have the opportunity to drill the 2- and the 3-mile laterals. we've seen a lot of the -- we looked at the bolt-on that you described in the bakken here more recently. we follow the eagle ford.
i guess, the bar is still pretty high in our company, and we're pretty -- we rigidly follow our $40 and $50 cost of supply cutoffs. so all in, any acquisition comes in have to have a lower than $50 and the future exploitation of the asset has to have something that's lower than $40 to compete in our portfolio. so the margin is pretty high. we watch all of them, and we're doing a few of them, but more of them are around the swaps in the permian.
i don't know, jack, you might -- if you have anything to add there at all.
jack harper -- executive vice president, lower 48
yeah. i would just add that since the concho deal closed at the beginning of last year, the team has done 15 of these swaps and trades in the permian this quarter, about 25,000 acres. and we have about that same number of deals in various stages currently. and the significance about that amount of acreage is that's at least a year's worth of permian drilling activity, all of those extended lateral lengths.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, jack. and on to your second part, paul, i think the thing to remember this year is there's a little bit of the buyback pace was influenced by the swap that we had with cenovus swapping out of the shares that we own there into the shares of conocophillips. but we're going to watch the market. obviously, we're going to watch where our share prices are trading and how much we put to the cash side of it versus the share buyback.
i'd say somewhere in that two-thirds, one-third. so 60%, 40% is probably something that you should expect for the year, this year. and then we'll relook at that, revisit that next year as we go through our planning process. and that includes the typical fourth quarter increase to the ordinary dividend.
we'll take that under advisement with the board and be thinking about that. that cash return portion as we think about the market and think about where the company is positioned. but i think roughly what you see this year is probably something closer to a 60-40 split between buybacks and cash.
operator
thank you. our next question on line comes from mr. bob brackett from bernstein research.
bob brackett -- bernstein -- analyst
thank you, and please add my voice to the chorus praising mark as well. i'll come back to the willow question. it's my understanding that the 45-day comment period ends at the end of this month. can you talk about what the path toward fid following that looks like? what are the various steps? and can you talk about the various alternatives proposed in the supplemental as you think about the cost benefit of those?
nick olds -- senior vice president, strategy and technology
yeah, bob. good morning. this is nick. you're right.
the 45-day comment period has commenced. and again, just kind of backing up, that's a key milestone for the blm to publish the draft seis on july 8. now to your question on project schedule, we wouldn't take fid until we get the final seis and in a supportive record of decision by the blm. and so that would allow us to move forward with willow construction.
now related to fid, we would probably see that at the earliest later this year and most likely early next. now we are planning as far as scheduled to commence a 2022, 2023 winter construction season assuming we had a very favorable record of decision. now that will allow us, bob, to do civil construction and start putting roads in place for the project. i'll come to the alternatives here in a second.
we do continue to work on detailed engineering to refine cost and schedule, as well as the final development modifications. and the reason i raised the developed modifications is in the current seis, there's a new alternative, alternative e, that is responsive to the alaska district court order. and that is to minimize or reduce the surface impact on the teshekpuk lake special area. so that alternative, we think, is a good path forward.
it reduces the surface infrastructure and still maintains the estimated recoverable resources that we communicated in the market update of about 600 million barrels. still looking, bob, at 180,000 barrels a day gross before royalty for the project. again, we're committed to willow, and it remains competitive in the portfolio. we continue to see very strong stakeholder support, including the alaska congressional delegation, the trades, and unions.
so the key thing is really looking forward to that final seis and a supportive record of decision.
bob brackett -- bernstein -- analyst
that's very clear. thanks for all that color.
operator
thank you. our next question in line comes from mr. neal dingmann from truist securities.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
my first question just on value creation. specifically, you've got a great formulating plan out there talking about 30% plus of the cash from ops going to shareholders. and i'm just wondering -- and then also what appears to be certainly higher than growth, pure growth average production, which i'd like to see. so i'm wondering, how do you all anticipate sort of on a go-forward best trading value for shareholders? do you look at per share growth metrics? or what is the best way you like to define it.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, neal, we look at all the different ways of thinking about shareholder value. and i think it starts to your point earlier that we have a commitment to return at least 30% of the cash from operations. not free cash flow, cash from operations back to the shareholder. if you look at our track record, it's been well over 40% as the commodity prices strengthened and the quality of the investment program and what we're doing continue to lower cost of supply has been sort of an active mantra inside the company.
so i'd say what we're trying to do is reduce our capital intensity. we're trying to manage the capital as low as we can for the scope that we'd like to commit. so we go into our planning cycle thinking what is our view of the macro and that sets an amount. we can afford the capital we can invest, having taken 30% of our cash right off the top.
we think that's a better value proposition to the shareholders rather than just focusing on either growth or return to capital. so it is a combination of the two. we want to grow and develop the company over the long haul. we want to make sure that the shareholders are getting an adequate part of that cash back right off the top.
so we have to live with the capital or the cash that's left over. and then in the course of that, we recognize that the value of the balance sheet, which is like another asset, a huge asset inside the company, and we want to make sure that the balance sheet is as strong as it possible, which means we'll carry some cash and we'll carry some cash on the balance sheet because of the volatility we see in the commodity markets, the scope that we want to execute to grow and develop the company and we're not shooting -- we don't have a growth target in mind. it's an output from our plans to make sure that we're maximizing our returns on and of capital. so we'll adjust our plans to make sure that we're hitting those two really key components, returns on and of capital.
and then out of that comes a production number and a sequencing of the projects to allow the further growth in the development of the company over the long haul.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
yeah. i love that financial flexibility, ryan. i mean, a lot of even the bigger ones don't have it right now. and then lastly, maybe just a question for jack on domestic ofs inflation.
jack, is it prudent to lock in other than rigs? are you thinking about lock in maybe some other long-term contracts? i guess, where i'm going with this is, i heard some folks out there are lock-in in pipe even though they can't technically lock in the price, whatever it is, six months, nine months from now. and so i'm just thinking, as you see the tightness out there right now, what are you guys doing to mitigate that?
jack harper -- executive vice president, lower 48
sure. we value flexibility in general in the program. we do have some modest amount of our rigs and frack spreads contracted. but what we're doing to mitigate that are several things.
i mentioned those swaps and trades earlier. by the end of this year, we will have been able to drill 80 3-mile wells in the permian over the last two years. we're drilling those wells faster. we're employing some frack technology in various places.
and we're also keeping our programs steady, which we really have always valued, keeping a steady program, and also keeping competition among our vendors, and we have all those things in place right now. so we're doing all we can, but there is still inflation out there.
operator
thank you. our next question on line comes from mr. leo mariani from mkm partners.
leo mariani -- mkm partners -- analyst
hey, guys. i was hoping to get a little bit more color around kind of your longer-term lng plans. obviously, you guys have entered into a number of facilities, which will, i guess, come online in a handful of years. but some of the prepared comments, you guys referred to kind of reassessing some of your domestic maybe just north america and overall gas potential as potential feedstock for some of these.
so any just color around that? i mean, as you look to start-up date, is it possible you could be drilling more for gas here in the u.s. in a couple of years in ready debt feedstock for delivering into some of these facilities? and it sounds like that might be an economically advantageous thing for you to do.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i think, leo, we're trying to think ahead as well, and it may spur some different sort of development plans inside our lower 48 canadian portfolios. but just a recognition that we have quite a bit of gas resource and its associated gas primarily that comes with the oil production that we're doing. but we're thinking about that in terms of what the pipe add and the capacity adds coming both to the gulf coast and going west to california and down to mexico.
so we're -- as bill described earlier, we're a top three gas marketer in north america. so we know where these markets are going. we have an informed view of where these markets are going and how we can supply gas into those markets. and to make sure to the extent there's an arbitrage between domestic henry hub and europe and asian prices that we have the opportunity to step into that and take advantage of that arbitrage.
and we're not just stuck with one marker in north america that we're selling our gas to. so it is a very integrated look at it and a very informed look at it to make sure that when we see that these arbitrages open up between the various regions around the globe that we can take advantage of that and be in a position to take advantage of that when others can't do it.
leo mariani -- mkm partners -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then just a quick question on the eagle ford for you folks. i certainly noticed there was a pretty healthy jump in production in the eagle ford this quarter.
had kind of been declining a little bit in the last handful of quarters. is that kind of maybe now firmly back in growth mode? i know you guys have alluded to the past to kind of ramping that up in the next couple of years. and maybe this quarter, it was just better than expected, maybe you had a number of chunky pads come online all at once that kind of drove it. but just thoughts on eagle ford growth, is that going to continue to be sharply growing asset through the end of the year into next year?
jack harper -- executive vice president, lower 48
this is jack again. good question. yeah, first of all, i'm very proud of the work the team is doing down in the eagle ford in all aspects of the business. but in the second quarter, specifically, there were some disproportionately weighted completions in the eagle ford.
we're also having great success continuing that refrack program there. and in general, the eagle ford is growing toward its plateaued production, but it's not there yet. so it will be a continued source of lower 48 production growth.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from raphael dubois from societe generale. please go ahead.
raphael dubois -- societe generale -- analyst
hello. thank you very much for taking my question. the first one is related to qatar nfe. it will be very helpful if you could maybe give us a bit more color so that we can model what you will learn through this deal.
for instance, can you maybe clarify whether the gas to be sold will be oil-linked or will it be linked to a gas price hub? any premium maybe to expect from the fact it will be a low carbon footprint? or maybe can you compare the profitability of nfe with your two other lng participations? that would be very helpful.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
let me start, and i'll kick it to bill a little bit. i think a lot of that is still work to be done. i think raphael, in terms of the marketing of the gas will probably follow very similar approaches to what qatar has done in the past. but bill can supply a little bit of view.
i think the focus of the project right now is the construction in epc.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i think that's right, ryan. and i would just reflect on qatargas and qatarenergy has been very, very successful. they're one of the largest gas lng marketers in the world.
they've been very successful about placing those volumes, and the project will continue to have those places through that format. so i think watch the space, but just reflect that qatargas, qatarenergy have been very, very effective at placing gas over time into valued markets.
raphael dubois -- societe generale -- analyst
ok, great. thank you for that. and maybe another question. at full year results, you gave us your thoughts on the increase in u.s.
supply we should expect. and if memory is right, you mentioned 900,000 barrels per day. i was wondering if you could maybe refresh that thought eight months into the year? and maybe give us your initial thoughts for the next couple of years.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, raphael. i think we're still in that 900,000 barrel a day. and let me -- that's an exit -- entry to exit kind of number for 2022. and we see maybe a similar but maybe slightly lower number as we go into 2023 if these commodity prices stay at the kind of levels that we're seeing and we get the inflationary forces that we're seeing in the lower 48 and the constraints there are on the supply chain and on labor and some of the other key pieces of the spend that this industry does in the permian primarily.
so yes, we're pretty -- those are the kind of entry to exit kind of rates that we see for this year and next year.
operator
thank you. we have no further questions at this time. i will now turn the call back over to mark keener for closing remarks.

operator
welcome to the q3 2022 conocophillips earnings conference call. my name is richard, and i'll be your operator for today's call. [operator instructions] i will now turn the call over to phil gresh, vice president, investor relations. sir, you may begin.
phil gresh -- vice president, investor relations
yes. thank you, richard. and welcome to everyone joining us for our third quarter earnings conference call. on the call today are several members of the conocophillips leadership team, including ryan lance, chairman and ceo; bill bullock, executive vice president and chief financial officer; dominic macklon, executive vice president of strategy, sustainability, and technology; nick olds, executive vice president of global operations; jack harper, executive vice president of lower 48; and tim leach, advisor to the ceo.
ryan and bill will kick off the call with opening remarks. after, which the team will be available for your questions. just a few quick reminders. first, along with today's release, we published supplemental financial materials and a presentation, which you can find on our investor relations website.
second, during this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements based on current expectations. actual results may differ due to factors noted in today's release and in our periodic sec filings. finally, we will make reference to certain non-gaap financial measures. reconciliations to the nearest corresponding gaap measure can be found in today's release and on our website.
with that, i'll turn the call over to ryan. 
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, phil. before we get into our strong results for the quarter, including record production, i'd like to touch on a few big-picture thoughts that are top of mind for us. first, inflation and supply chain constraints continue across the entire economy and our industry. this is particularly true in the u.s.
shale, where rapidly escalating costs, combined with extremely tight supply, are limiting the pace of industrywide production growth. second, we believe that the world is going to need investments in medium- and long-cycle production, in addition to u.s. shale plays. the depth and quality of our u.s.
unconventional inventory, combined with our diverse global portfolio, has us well-positioned to meet these long-term supply challenges. and finally, a successful energy transition must meet society's fundamental need for a secure, reliable, and affordable energy while progressing to a lower carbon future. this requires an all-of-the-above solution. obstacles that prevent the global market from functioning properly are not going to help the american consumer and would be disastrous for our allies.
governments can help by enacting policies that encourage investments in developing lower-emission oil and gas resources that will be needed to get the world through the transition. this includes fiscal stability, streamlining permitting, and supporting critical infrastructure for an all-of-the-above solution. now, against this backdrop, we believe that conocophillips is well-positioned to win in any environment. we remain committed to delivering on our triple mandate of responsibly and reliably meeting energy transition, pathway demand, delivering competitive returns on and off capital, and progressing toward achieving our net-zero operational emissions ambition.
as further evidence of this commitment, our third quarter results demonstrated record total company production. lower 48 production hit a milestone in over 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we anticipate further growth in the fourth quarter. on returns, we generated a trailing 12 month roce of 27%. we increased our ordinary dividend by 11% to $0.51 per share.
and we announced a $0.70 per share vroc for the first quarter of 2023, and we increased our share buyback authorization by $20 billion. additionally, we'll return 15-day in the capital for 2022, which represents over 50% of our projected cfo, well in excess of our greater than 30% annual commitment. now, we believe that our cfo-based returns framework differentiates us relative to peers. and finally, our net-zero operational emissions ambition.
we recently announced a new medium-term methane intensity commitment consistent with our recent objectives of joining ogmp 2.0. from a strategic perspective, i wanted to provide an update on our global lng initiatives. first, we were recently selected to participate in qatar's north field south project, following our selection earlier this year to participate in the north field east, which adds to our long positive relationship with qatarenergy. second, we agreed to terminal services for a 15-year period at the perspective britain's vital lng import terminal in germany.
and third, we continue to progress our port arthur lng project with sempra, which we expect to reach fid by early next year. overall, we continue to believe the substitution of natural gas in place of coal represents an opportunity for significant reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions. this should drive global lng demand and related opportunities well into the future. putting this all together, we remain constructive on the outlook for the industry.
and we have a deep portfolio of short, medium and longer cycle, low cost to supply assets that generate strong cash flow as we continue to deliver on our triple mandate. now, let me turn the call over to bill to cover our overall performance for the quarter.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, thanks, ryan. from a financial standpoint, we had a solid third quarter. we generated $3.60 per share in adjusted earnings. production was over 1,750,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which included our previously guided approximately 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day impact from scheduled turnarounds, as well as some impacts from the temporary force majeure in libya in july.
for the fourth quarter. we do not expect any material turnaround impacts. lower 48 production averaged a record, 1,013,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 668,000 from the permian, 224,000 from the eagle ford, and 96,000 from the balkan. cash provided from operating activities was $8.7 billion.
now, this included a $15 billion benefit from working capital, primarily due to the timing of norway tax payments and lower receivables. excluding working capital, cash from operations was $7.2 billion. ap lng distributions were 257 million in the quarter. and we expect fourth quarter distributions to be about $600 million.
on capital, we invested 2.5 billion back into the business in the third quarter, including around 300 million for acquisitions. this resulted in free cash flow of 4.7 billion, which more than covered the 4.3 billion we returned to shareholders in the quarter. factoring in 400 million in disposition proceeds, ending cash and short-term investment were $10.7 billion at september 30th, up from 8.5 billion at june 30th. turning to guidance, we still expect full year production of 1.74 million barrels of oil equivalent per day with a fourth quarter guidance range of 1.74 million to 1.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.
on cost, we've increased full year adjusted operating cost guidance to 7.7 billion from 7.5 billion. this is driven by inflationary impacts. we have also increased full year organic capex to 8.1 billion from 7.8 billion, also driven by inflationary impacts and partner operator working interest. partially offsetting these increases, we have reduced full year dd&a guidance from 7.6 billion to 7.5 billion.
in terms of 2023 guidance, we anticipate providing full details with our fourth quarter earnings call in early february. we will also be hosting an analyst investor meeting next spring at the new york stock exchange. so, please stay tuned for more details. with that, i'll turn the call back to ryan.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, bill. now, before we go to q&a, i wanted to spend a minute discussing a few important organizational announcements. first, jack harper, our evp of lower 48, informed me that he will be leaving the company due to a family medical situation. i know i speak on behalf of the entire organization when i say that jack will be greatly missed.
now, in conjunction with this announcement, nick olds, who is currently our executive vice president of global operations, will become the executive vice president of lower 48; and andy o'brien, currently our vice president and treasurer, will become senior vice president global operations and join the executive leadership team. now, with that, i'd be -- i wanted to turn the call over to jack and give him the opportunity to say a few thoughts.
jack harper -- executive vice president, lower 48
thanks, ryan. as ryan mentioned, i will be leaving conocophillips due to a family medical situation. it has truly been a privilege to work for both concho and conocophillips over the past 16.5 years. when concho agreed to the merger with conocophillips, we did so because we believe that the transaction would create a uniquely strong and differentiated company.
and i could not feel better about how this has played out. this may be one of the most dynamic times that we've ever seen in the industry. and my competitive side certainly makes me wish that i could stay on board for what is ahead. however, i'm confident that we have set up the team for success with our organizational structure and planned transition over the next few months.
with that, let me turn the call back over to ryan.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, jack. and i know i speak for everybody at conocophillips. we have you and your family in all our prayers. so, with that, let me turn it back over to phil, and we'll get going with the q&a.
phil gresh -- vice president, investor relations
all right. thanks, ryan. just as a reminder, we ask that you ask one question and one follow up. and with that, richard, i'll turn it back to you.

operator
[operator instructions] and our first question on line comes from neil mehta from goldman sachs.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning, team. ryan, i want to kick off with you on the lng strategy. and we've seen a lot of interesting individual announcements, but maybe you could pull it all together and talk about how you see these coming together for how conoco thinks about lng as a part of its portfolio. and as it relates to that, maybe you could talk about risks around long-term lng as we have a lot of new supply coming in from qatar in the u.s.
by the middle of the decade. and do you worry about spending on these projects into what could be a sloppier market toward the end of the decade?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, thank you, neil. i appreciate the question. yeah, i think for some context around the company, you know, we've been involved in lng for a long, long time. you think about our liquefaction technology that we have that's been used by many, many operators around the world today.
we effectively started this business back in the '60s with our project up in kenai and delivering, you know, 40 years of gas to our japan marketing friends. so, we've been in this business for a long time. and then, when you look at the transactions that we've done over the last couple of years, you know, we have a growing resource position in the u.s. so, creating more demand and -- just makes a lot of sense coming out of out of the u.s.
so, as we step back and we started thinking about it, combined with our views of the energy transition and the view that lng is going to be a necessary fuel that can become replace coal, similarly, the way that gas has done that in the united states and reduce the emissions profile in the u.s. so, we think this is something the globe is going to be needing as we go through this energy transition. so, you put all that together. and we said back over a year ago and said this was a piece that we wanted to grow in our portfolio.
so, it started with the opportunity at ap lng. we picked up some more interest there. then, we got named in the north field expansion project, and then more recently here, in the north field south. and then combined with wanting to do something in the u.s.
to take advantage of a position that we have here and develop more demand for the product in the u.s., we looked at who we thought was the best positioned with permits and opportunity. and that's when we decided to join up with sempra. and as you've seen, we expect to reach out by the early next year at port arthur. and that gives us some optionality also on there -- the west coast of mexico opportunity that they have as well.
so, when we looked at all this, trying to build this business for the long term, and complemented now by our german regas opportunity that we've entered into. so, we want to get into that full value chain. we've got a great commercial organization that can optimize around this. and we just think this is going to be a business that's going to be long term and going to be substantial well into the future.
now, it's going to be -- there's going to be periods of time when supply exceeds demand and when the demand exceeds supply. and that's more to your point. there may be a period coming later this decade for, you know, a year or two, where, you know, the pricing maybe get a little soft because of a lot of projects are coming in. but again, we're entering in this in the 20- and 30-year contracts.
so, we just have a long-term view that this is going to be a really good business and one that conocophillips can excel at, given our history and the capability inside the company. and we expect to want to try to build more of this business over time.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah, that's really clear, ryan. the follow-up is just on capital spending for 2023, recognizing we're going to get more thoughts sounds like here in in february on it. but if we took the 8/1 as the starting point, what are some of the moving pieces as you go into '23 that we can break off of?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, neil. i would -- i guess i would start by saying i'd probably take the last half of this year, that kind of pace, annualize that for our base business. as we think about that going into 2023. we're not looking at trying to add scope into our lower 48 operation, given the kind of environment on inflation that we see.
so, starting there, we'll assess what we think inflation looks like for next year. and importantly, we'll assess what our partners are doing in terms of the scope that they're trying to execute that we have to fund our share of. so, those are some unknowns that we're going to. but i'd say take the base business, which is kind of ratable off the second half of this year as you think about going into next year.
and then the new businesses that we're trying to grow and expand and develop the company around, you know, nfe and nfs, the two qatar projects, we'll be funding that next year. again, we hope to reach fid at sempra, so some funding associated with that next year. and then finally, willow, you know, we hope to be getting into some construction activities next year with willow. obviously, we won't do that until we have a permit in place that allows us to go start up the funding of that project.
so, that's the base business. and those are the kind of adders as we look into 2023.
phil gresh -- vice president, investor relations
all right. thanks, neil.
operator
thank you. our next question on the line comes from stephen richardson from evercore isi.
stephen richardson -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you. ryan, i was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the cash return envelope for '23. just acknowledging there's a lot of variability in the environment, but obviously, you've had a really strong year this year. and then you talked last quarter about how we're trending kind of closer to, you know, 50% of cash flow from ops.
certainly, a lot higher than your baseline. and so, i think we get this question a little bit. it's just how do we think about '23 with the moving parts, acknowledging what you just talked about with capital and the environment is uncertain? but if we have the environment that we have today in the next year, i was wondering if you can maybe talk about how you're thinking about that.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. stephen, i think if we have a macro environment today that's similar to next year, that's similar to the average over the course of 2022, i think you should expect a similar level of distributions. and i think we, you know, signaled that a little bit with setting the first quarter of vroc at $0.70 a share. you know, that this 10 seconds, we look at the macro.
and if it's going to be similar next year, you ought to expect a similar level of distributions, which is in excess of our 30% commitment. but, you know, we're going to watch the macro because we think it's going to be incredibly volatile. but we think we've got the right value proposition and combination of vroc, base dividend, and how we're thinking about buying our shares back, that it's well set up for the kind of volatility we may see. but that would be sort of my comment as you think about going into 2023.
it's a function of the macro, which is, you know, reasonably strong right now.
stephen richardson -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's great. thank you. maybe just to follow up on -- on the lower 48, obviously, you've had some really, really strong results, and can't say the same of what we've seen in some of the productivity updates from, you know, elsewhere in the lower 48 across the industry this quarter. i was wondering if maybe you could talk a little bit about performance versus just, you know, the timing of wells and kind of how you're seeing the program evolve, particularly in the permian, where, you know, the lower 48 numbers were really impressive this morning.
jack harper -- executive vice president, lower 48
yeah. thanks, stephen. this is jack. yeah.
you know, the production is back half loaded like we've been talking about. i hope you saw that in the quarter with the progression. we've also seen our obo plans, our partners targeting increasingly longer laterals than we first anticipated, which, of course, yields a lower cost of supply and more economic return. in the lower 48, we do expect to see continued, you know, growth, as ryan mentioned in the fourth quarter.
and the permian should modestly exceed that kind of low single digits that we expect out of the lower 48. in terms of well productivity and our plans are progressing as we have planned, we monitor this very closely internally and with our peers externally and really like where we stack up.
phil gresh -- vice president, investor relations
great. thanks, stephen. next question?
operator
thank you. our next question on the line comes from doug leggate from bank of america. please go ahead.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good morning. and, jack, i wish you well, and i hope our paths cross again at some point. good luck. i have got two quick questions, if i may.
bill, i wonder if i could do first with the deferred tax in the quarter. i think we've heard you talk in the past about when you would hit, you know, full cash tax in the lower 48. has that been delayed somehow? or maybe you could just walk through what happened in the quarter. it's quite a big deferred tax number, which we're happy to see, obviously.
but any updated guidance would be appreciated.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, sure. happy to, doug. so, first up, the increase in third quarter tax rates on earnings reflects a shift in our geographic mix of earnings, primarily due to an increase in norway's pre-tax earnings. and you'd expect that given the high gas price environment we're seeing in continental europe.
so, as you know, norway's a fairly high tax environment. so, you've seen our effective tax rate increase from 39% in the third quarter from 32% in the second quarter. now, moving forward, i'd expect our effective tax rate to be in the mid- to upper-30s range, assuming a similar production level and that pricing falls with the forward curve. i noted the --
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
go ahead. thank you.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. as you noted, the deferred tax for the quarter was a source of cash of just over $700 million. and i'd expect the deferred taxes to be a source throughout the year. we did enter a tax cash paying position in the u.s.
in the second quarter. and we're now in a cash tax paying position in most of our jurisdictions around the world. so, assuming that prices and our capital program stays around current levels, i think you could see deferred tax to remain a modest source of cash, though cash taxes should be more close to our book taxes over time. and i do think it's important to note that trying to forecast deferred taxes and estimating cash tax etr on a quarterly basis is pretty tough.
it can be impacted by a number of items in any given quarter. so, i'd really encourage you to think about that as our effective cash tax rate across an annual time period. and i expect that to be getting closer to what we're seeing our effective tax rate on an income basis.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i understand the point about mix, and that's actually really helpful. so, thank you. i guess my follow-up, my question is on the permian takeaway. we're obviously seeing a lot of volatility around waha.
but you guys have obviously had a lot of changes in your portfolio. could you just give a quick refresh to what your takeaway looks like? i guess the differential widened a little bit this quarter on utilization. so, we're trying to get a handle on that. i'll leave it there.
thank you.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, sure. so, as you know, we're a large, globally diverse mp, so the overall cash flow impact from the waha pricing differentials that we've seen this last quarter was relatively immaterial for us. but that said, in our presentation materials, our realizations and lower 48 relative to henry hub decreased by 6% from 96% in q2 to 90% in q3. and that's primarily driven by lower permian in-basin month average prices in september relative to henry hub.
when we look at it based on foreign markets, we'd expect to be in the upper 70s to low 80s as a percentage of henry hub for the fourth quarter. so, there's a lot of volatility around that, doug, with what we're seeing in the market right now. and i'd expect that volatility is going to continue until we see the additional permian takeaway capacity come online later in 2023. and i guess the only thing that just as a reminder, we're the second largest gas market in north america.
we've got a really strong market position that's multiples of our portfolio, and we think that's really beneficial in this situation. we've worked hard to build our gas marketing capability in the permian following acquisitions, and we leverage that to ensure we've got flow assurance through these pricing events. we're really very confident with our in-basin flow assurance that we've got sufficient take away to manage through the short- and medium-term capacity constraints. so, for conocophillips, this is essentially a price issue, not a flow issue.
phil gresh -- vice president, investor relations
great. thanks, doug. next question.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jeanine wai from barclays.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
hi, good morning, everyone. good afternoon and thanks for taking our questions.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, jeanine.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
jack, thanks for the partnership, and we wish you well. so, our first question, maybe just following up on willow. can you provide an update on what the latest is on that project? any high-level commentary on what the moving pieces are relative to the original project, given that there's been a bunch of back and forth on it on the approvals? and i think the -- the last detailed update we got on it was in june of '21. and there was roughly a six-year lead time from fid to first production, and there was about $8 billion capital estimate.
nick olds -- executive vice president, global operations
yeah, jeanine. this is nick. i'll definitely -- i'll go through that. maybe as a reminder, i'll just walk back in time a little bit here.
you know, there was a key milestone that was accomplished in early july, and that was that draft seis. the comment period has been completed as well. and as i mentioned in the 2q call, the draft seis put forward a new three-pad alternative, reducing the footprint in that teshekpuk lake special area. and that is supported by conocophillips.
now, that addresses and is responsive to the alaska district court findings. now, with respect to schedule, we're still targeting the final seis and the supported record of decision by the blm end of this year. now, jeanine, as i mentioned previously, we would only take fid following a final seis and supported record decision by the blm, and we are targeting fid early next year. now, pending that successful record of decision, we expect to have 2023 capital spend for this upcoming winter season.
and that's mainly focused on civil construction. so, that be open up a mine site and laying some gravel roads. now, again, we won't take fid or make a significant investment until we have a clear path to development. we also continue to do detailed engineering and update our final cost estimates.
i know that you referenced that. we've recently went to market to update our project costs and have seen some inflationary pressures as expected. we're seeing that globally, as well as some of the impacts related to the updated scope due to the blm's alternative in their draft seis. but i want to leave you with this.
despite all the cost pressures, the project remains very competitive in our $40 cost supply framework. and finally, we'll provide more details on willow at the market update that bill referenced for next year.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
ok. great. thank you for all that detail. the follow-up, maybe just sticking with projects here, there's been a lot of investor conversations around conoco's capital commitments for major capital projects, such as, you know, the qatar project, sempra, willow, etc., and how that really impacts free cash flow and cash returns.
so, we know that conoco's cash returns, of course, is on a cfo metric, not a free cash flow metric. but it's all kind of circular in a way. so, we just wanted to check in again on just the level of strategic cash that you want to hold. and is that the same as it was previously? because i guess post the concho and shell permian deals, you could argue that you don't need to hold as much and then -- but on the other hand, you've got some major capital projects on the horizon that you need to reserve for.
and so, you ended the quarter with 10.7 billion of cash, so you have a lot of options there. thank you.
bill bullock -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, sure. jeanine, this is bill. so, first, based on our four prices, we'd expect to end the year with roughly $10 billion of cash. also, the same -- roughly the same amount that you noted for the end of third quarter.
and that's a -- i know it is predicated on us achieving our $15 billion of distributions to shareholders this year. now, the framework of how we think about allocation of cash balance really hasn't changed. it's continuing to be guided by our priorities of having a competitive shareholder distribution, strong balance sheet strength, and efficient organic and inorganic capital allocations. and the framework that we've laid out of intending to carry $1 billion for operating cash, $3 billion of reserve cash, and anything above that is strategic cash, continues to be the way that we think about that.
so, when you think about strategic cash, we think about that for the opportunity to capture value-enhancing opportunities, like you saw us do with the shell permian acquisition, is to fund our programs' used cycles and to fund mid- and long-cycle projects. so, the basic way that we think about our cash balances is unchanged.
phil gresh -- vice president, investor relations
great. thanks, jeanine. we're ready for the next question.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from scott hanold from rbc capital markets.
scott hanold -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yeah. thank you. i was wondering if you could go back to shareholder returns and, you know, just give us a sense of how you think about the mix of the shareholder returns. i mean, obviously, there are some companies that are, you know, highly, you know, formulaic, you know, with it.
but as you look into, you know, sending that vroc for, you know, the first quarter, like, what goes into play when you think of, like, what level you want that set at?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i think we try to look at a couple of things, scott. you know, where the -- where -- obviously where the macros at and project our cash flows forward into next year. and obviously, we're going to meet our 30% commitment. and in these kinds of commodity price, we're well in excess of that.
i think our five-year average is in the mid-40s. and this year we're 50 or more percent of the cash. so, i think, you know, you ought to be thinking about if a similar environment persists into next year, the same level of absolute distributions, as i said earlier. in regards to the channel, you know, again, we want to move on to growing a reliable base dividend that you can count on.
you can count on through the cycles. it's going to be growable. it's going to be competitive with the best in the s&p 500. and that's what we're trying to do on our base dividend.
we want to buy some of our shares back. we want to buy through the cycles. we think about, you know, how much shares do we top up to get our 30% commitment at a mid-cycle price that we think about. and then at these elevated prices, we know we're getting more cash, and that's why we introduced the third channel through the vroc.
the vroc is a combination of cash and shares. and it's got some flexibility because we're monitoring the market. we're monitoring the macro. and we -- as we think about going forward into 2023.
but we know it's going to be volatile. we could wake up, it could be 80, it could be $120 a barrel. so, you know, that's why the vroc is there to be that variable channel. and we like to top up some of our cash, as well as buy some shares.
as we think about it, as we set it for the first quarter, you know, that's kind of the ratable amount that we had through the course of last year, which should signal that we're pretty bullish on how we think about 2023.
scott hanold -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
well, that's great color. appreciate that. and actually, before i get to my second question, it just started out with this. but, jack, you know, all the best to you and your family.
i mean, you know, we've worked together over the past decade plus, so it was a pleasure to work with you all these years, and good luck. you know, but my follow-up question then is, you know, looking at the opportunities that you all have in norway, you look like you're progressing on tommeliten and eldfisk. now, can you give us a sense? is that more just a process of just maintaining production out there? or is there an opportunity really to grow that and, you know, really part of sort of this global, you know, gas opportunity? because i do believe it's a little bit more gas in a lot of these new developments.
nick olds -- executive vice president, global operations
yeah. no. this is nick. i'll give you a quick update on those developments.
we've got actually four developments that are in progress, two operated and two nonoperated. you referenced tommeliten. so, we've got tommeliten alpha and eldfisk north. both of those are subsea developments that are all tied back to existing infrastructure.
even the two nonoperated are tied back to existing infrastructure. that means they are very low cost of supply. we're talking in the low-20s, very competitive in the global portfolio. we hit a couple of key milestones here recently as well.
we just hit our subsea templates on both tommeliten alpha and eldfisk north, and we'll start drilling later this year. all four of those will come online throughout 2024. but the way i view that is probably more offsetting base decline within the greater ekofisk areas, as well as our partner-operated assets. but again, all four of those are very competitive.
phil gresh -- vice president, investor relations
next question.
operator
thank you. yes, sir. next question comes from john royal from jpmorgan.
john royal -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my question. so, just on the capex increase. if you could maybe give a little bit of color on the split between the nojv portion of it and the inflation piece.
i mean, i know it's relatively small overall, but that might be helpful. and then, on the nonoperated jv piece, is there any way to think about your exposure there in the lower 48? maybe a percentage of production or a percentage of capex or anything that could help us there.
dominic macklon -- senior vice president, strategy, sustainability and technology
hey, john. it's dominic here. just in this -- the split of capital in terms of the increase of 300 million, 200 million is really related to inflation and then about 100 million related to a change in working interest. we're seeing in our obo well mix.
and, you know, i think probably, we're seeing some of our partners maybe doing a little bit of capital management and shifting their own working interest down. and that's causing us to go up a bit. but there's still good well. in fact, i'll maybe just ask jack to comment a little bit on what we're seeing on our obo program there.
jack harper -- executive vice president, lower 48
yeah, we're very pleased with the results we're seeing. and as i mentioned before, we have some longer lateral development going on in that obo program. some of those wells will cross over into next year and hopefully provide a little bit of momentum.
john royal -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
yeah, that's helpful. thank you. and then, maybe just switching over to lng. a little bit of color will be helpful in the western mexico opportunity with sempra and how that could take shape and how we should think about potential timing there of you're getting involved relative to the 1q target that i think sempra has put out there for the port arthur fid.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i think the west coast, john, is longer dated. and that's an option we have to participate in expansion of that facility that is currently operating today. and it would be -- i think they're converting the regas portion of that into a small liquefaction plant and looking at some expansion opportunities.
so, our heads of agreement, our hoa that we have with sempra gives us the opportunity to participate in that down the road when -- if and when they decide to build another train at that facility.
phil gresh -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, john. next question.
operator
thank you. our next question on line comes from ryan todd from piper sandler.
ryan todd -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. thanks. maybe a follow-up on one of your earlier comments. in the permian, it sounds like you're saying that at least for now, the plan for 2023 would be to largely keep activity levels flat with the second half of 2022.
if that's the case, any early thoughts on what the trajectory would be for permian volumes during 2023? and maybe are you seeing any -- is it just a pricing issue? or are you seeing tightness in the base and that's challenging your ability to execute anything that you'd like to?
nick olds -- executive vice president, global operations
yeah, ryan, we're very happy with our execution out there and feel that it's prudent right now to keep a steady amount of activity going into next year. and, you know, i would say, our internal plans this year and going into next are very consistent with our long-term outlook on production out of the permian in the lower 48.
ryan todd -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. thanks. and then maybe just a follow-up on the cash returns. i mean, your position on the dividend has, you know, always seemed a little more reflective of your view on sustainability of the longer-term outlook.
given the sizable dividend increase, can you talk a little bit about -- you know, maybe the read-through of your outlook on commodities in sustainability longer term, is this -- you know, has your longer term view improved? and is that reflected in a nice uptick in the dividend?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, ryan, i think we'll get a chance to talk more about that in our analysts meeting that we have that we talked about early in the spring of next year. but, yeah, basically it's a longer-term view given the dynamics that are going on the market today. we've had a certain mid-cycle price that we've talked about over the last four to five or six years. and i think it is reflective that we think, you know, that mid-cycle price has moved up a bit.
and so, as a result, we can afford, you know, more base dividend and reflective of the raise that we announced here in the fourth quarter.
phil gresh -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, ryan. next question.
operator
thank you. our next question online comes from paul cheng from scotiabank.
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, paul.
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
the first one, maybe go back into the split between dividend and buybacks. in the third quarter. your split is about 65% in buybacks, 35% in dividend. if we're looking into the future, is that a reasonable proxy that how should we look at it, or that we can't really be prudent and saying that, ok, that's may be what you guys are going to do? so, that's the first question.
second question is on the qatar lng that -- congratulations, you're getting to the north and south. is there any capital number that you can share? i think in the north field expansion, your share of the commitment is about 900. and given the, you know, the same -- say, 1 million [inaudible] here. so, should we assume they're similar? and also, whether that the terms between the north field south and north field expansion are basically the same.
is there anything that maybe you can share? and also, that when the spending on north field south will kick in because that, i don't think, will come on stream until 2028.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. paul, let me try to take those. i may call a friend with nick through part of that. so, yeah, i think the first part split, i think, you had on the way we think about -- i think that was vroc, so between share buybacks and dividends.
i think the split that we've historically have, you mentioned 35-65. i think those are reasonable up to like a 50-50 split between cash and share buybacks is how we normally think about the vroc. but that, you know, that's subject to change based on how we see the macro and kind of how we see it. but nominally, that's probably not a bad place to start.
with respect to qatar lng, i think the north field south trains are going to be replicated from the north field expansion trains. so, relative to the same amount of capital, maybe adjusted for your view of inflation because they will be a little bit later starting. but yeah, they're going to be the same scope, same size, and exact same kind of train. so, that's how we think about it.
very similar to the north field expansion project. and then -- was the last one on cutter? oh, the timing. yeah, you're right. on the timing, i don't think there is much capital in the next couple of years associated with nfs.
anything you'd add, nick?
nick olds -- executive vice president, global operations
yeah. just to add, paul, just on -- as we talked about in the q2 call, remember north field expansion, that total net is 900 million for us. we will have catch-up payments. and so, once the condition precedents are set, we'll reverse qatarenergy for cop share in those nfe project costs.
that could have happened early next year or even late this year. again, 900 million net total for the project. start up again for nfe is 2026. and then, nfs will probably follow a year later.
phil gresh -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, paul. next question.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from raphael dubois from societe generale.
raphael dubois -- societe generale -- analyst
hello. thank you very much for taking my questions. seeing from this side of the pond, it looks like there is a bit of a trade-off between the industry increasing production or face windfall tax and/or extra tax on distribution. can you maybe explain what projects you could sanction if you were better incentivized to increase production? are there any resources that you could monetize faster if you received that some sort of guarantee from the u.s.
government in terms of permitting, as you mentioned in your remarks, or in terms of tax stability? that would be my initial question.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks. i think, you know, we're already growing our company. i think we're faced with some other issues in the short term around labor shortages, supply chain, and inflation.
they're probably dictating the pace of the industry. i think, generally, your question relates to a medium and longer-term outlook. eventually, more infrastructure is going to need to continue the growth in the development of the u.s. shale and then more infrastructure needed for growth up in canada and maybe even for exporting some of the product down into mexico and central america.
so, i think that's the issue we have with the policy choices that this administration is making. and things they could do to help is give more certainty on the long-term permitting and just the fiscal stability to make sure that, you know, we don't have large changes in the tax structure coming because these project takes -- these projects have cycle times and years associated with them and the more risky part in the front end, the less certainty you're going to have on executing some of that. so, that's why my remarks were around certainty, around the fiscal stability. you know, the whole conversation around windfall profits taxes is not a helpful conversation right now.
and then more certainty around permitting. and i would add on the permitting, if you want an energy transition, you need this permitting as well. certainly in the u.s. you need the permitting for onshore and offshore wind, for solar installations, for high-voltage transmission lines.
so, permitting relief is required if you want any chance of going through an energy transition and in having the support of trying to execute an all-of-the-above energy strategy. so, i think these are really important topics as we think about the next, you know, three or four or five years, and in the next decade or two for our business.
raphael dubois -- societe generale -- analyst
great. thank you very much. and my second question is, totalenergies has recently announced that they will spin off their holdings in stormont and fort hills. and i was wondering if you could tell us what it may change for the way stormont is run and whether it's something you could also consider to lower your ghg emissions intensity.
nick olds -- executive vice president, global operations
yeah, raphael, maybe i'll start with, you know, the way we look at stormont is obviously we value stormont greatly. it's a low cost of supply, low-capital intensity asset that's in our diverse portfolio. again, it offers up stable, level-loaded production with a significant resource position out there. we've continued to transform that asset through technology applications, piloting emission reduction opportunities, including, i don't know if you follow this, joining the pathways alliance, which is, you know, six likeminded companies coming together to lower emissions from overall oil sands industry, net-zero by 2050.
the asset continues to perform extremely well. actually, back in september, we hit a record production day of 158,000 barrels a day growth. so, we see this as, you know, staying in the portfolio. with respect to total's spinco or newco plans, we're continuing to understand what that looks like.
and i can't comment further beyond that.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
i would say, raphael, it does nothing for global emissions what total is trying to do.
phil gresh -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, raphael. next question.
operator
thank you. our next question on the line comes from jeoffrey lambujon from tudor, pickering, and holt.
jeoffrey lambujon -- tudor, pickering, holt and company -- analyst
good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking my questions. my first one is just on portfolio management on the acquisition strategy. i know you've talked about bolt-on as more of the focus, and we're obviously seeing that quarter to quarter. but i wanted to get any updated views you might have on the environment as you see it for larger deals, particularly for upstream assets in the permian.
i know that, you know, the cost of supply framework continues to be kind of the focal point in assessing those in terms of what opportunities would need to hurdle. but anything you'd say just around, you know, what you see today and where your bolt-on appetite might be, particularly the permian, would be great, just given the position you've assembled there over the years.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, maybe i can start, and i'll ask jack to comment on it as well because i know his team has been very active in this space over the last year, year and a half. we continue to look for opportunities to bolt-on acquisitions. we mentioned one. it was a smart opportunity in the eagle ford to core up what we were doing there.
so, we went ahead and ended that. but a lot of focus was going on what we're doing in the permian. and let me let jack kind of describe a little bit about what we're doing there.
jack harper -- executive vice president, lower 48
sure. thanks, ryan. yeah, we're always opportunistically looking to add to our core areas. and as we've talked about in previous calls, we find the highest value right now in swaps and trades.
the team has completed about 20 of these. and that approach is at 30,000 acres or so in court of land that allows for longer lateral development and lower cost of supply development. so, in addition to those 20-ish deals, we have about that many or more in the pipeline.
jeoffrey lambujon -- tudor, pickering, holt and company -- analyst
perfect. appreciate that. and then, lastly, just on the disposition side, i think the last time you'll tallied up what's been done since setting the target for the end of next year was with last quarter's earnings about 2.4 billion. with the noncore sales and today's press release, the incremental of that, was that included? and then, i guess bigger picture, it seems like lower 48 noncore positions, you know, represent the main opportunities that it looks like, or at least half, over the recent past.
is that the right way to think about some of those priorities going forward?
dominic macklon -- senior vice president, strategy, sustainability and technology
yeah, jeoff, it's dominic here. yeah. so, the -- we've sold -- well, since we closed the contran and the shell transactions, we obviously wanted to do a little bit of portfolio cleanup. so, we've sold 2.4 billion, as you said, of assets.
and that's inclusive of the 0.3 billion this quarter. and, you know, we're pretty pleased about that because that they represent really the property assets we had for sale, typically very mature, low-margin, or high-cost supplies. so, that's assets like indonesia, the high h2s field in madden, some legacy assets and central base platform, and so on. so, we've been pleased with that.
we've monetized those in a strong market. going forward, i would say, we're really just back into normal sort of high grade opportunity as usual. we're not focused on any target at this point. we're happy with where we are.
you know, we'll always look for opportunities. so, we're pretty happy that we've basically completed the main clean up that we wanted to do after those two big transactions.
phil gresh -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, jeoffrey. next question.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from neal dingmann from truist securities.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks for the time. again, jack, prayers are with you and your family. hope all goes well. ryan, my first question, i guess i would call it for the top news [inaudible] on shareholder return and capital allocation.
specifically, any change to how you are thinking about the shareholder returns versus or specifically the buybacks versus just particularly maybe accelerate your growth opportunities? i say that obviously, given the stock's hit an all-time high and, you know, knowing just the incredible high well opportunities -- high well return opportunities you all have.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, neal. no, i think, you know, we've tried to describe that in the release. we feel like, you know, obviously, we could ramp more in the lower 48.
but in this environment, it just doesn't make sense to be doing that right now. we just want to run efficient, stable programs right there. we do have opportunities to invest in more medium- and longer-cycle projects. we describe those around willow and sempra, and then the qatari projects as well.
so, you know, we are leaning into -- you know, we're going to need to supply long term as an industry. and we think these are important, and we believe our company, with our global diverse portfolio, has the kind of opportunities that are low cost to supply, fit our ghg emissions intensity profile, and our reductions that we're trying to make in that particular area. and these are going to be needed assets that we want to invest in to ensure that the supply is there long term.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
great to hear. and then my second question, probably for jack. on the permian and specifically the former shell assets now purchased, i guess it was about a year ago. i'm just curious to, now, when you look at those how well returns you've seen there, how those are stacking up versus, you know, those initial expectations maybe a year or more ago, and, you know, how you guys are, you know, or if you all are utilized.
and i think there was about, what is it, 600 or more miles of pipe there. i was wondering if that's being fully utilized.
jack harper -- executive vice president, lower 48
yeah. thanks, neal. well, in general, we're very happy with that deal. it's fully integrated.
i think we mentioned last quarter we've started to bring on some of the initial projects with our style of drilling and completion, and that continues. and the results are at least as strong as we had anticipated. and then on the other piece of that, the obo, as i mentioned before, you know, so far, an upside to the deal has been that we have seen lateral lengths extended by our partners. and that's better for everyone.
so, we'll continue to do that. but right now, it's completely folded in and business as usual.
phil gresh -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, neal. operator, i think we have time for one more question.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from leo mariani from mkm partners.
leo mariani -- mkm partners -- analyst
hey, wanted to quickly follow up around some of your prepared comments. you certainly discussed the lng deals that you've entered into, and you kind of alluded to the fact that there is some nice benefit with your kind of u.s., you know, production base, i guess particularly for the port arthur project. just as you're thinking about that, i mean, do you think there's obviously an ability to kind of fold some of those volumes into that in the next couple of years? and would you anticipate maybe trying to kind of increase some of your gas production as you look out into the middle of this decade to kind of take advantage of that as feedstock?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, as we said, leo, in our opening comments, that, you know, we think the gas resource is pretty plentiful in the u.s. you know i don't think there is -- i wouldn't think about it as physical integration between our assets. the market in the u.s. is a big liquid market.
we want to create -- you know, creating some of this more demand to exploit the resource in the u.s. is a good thing. and that's what we're trying to play. we see the resource in the u.s.
being quite substantial. we want to be involved in the liquefaction of that resource, in the shipping, and in the regasification as we move it to higher-value markets around the world.
leo mariani -- mkm partners -- analyst
ok. that makes sense. and i guess you also talked in your prepared comments about having to kind of start some of this medium-term major project capital in 2023 that we should kind of layer on top of this kind of second half of '22 annualized spend, if you will. you know, is it possible to operating, you know, order of magnitude on this? are we -- is this major project spend that we're talking kind of in the hundreds of millions? or potentially, could this be north of a billion?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i think it's too early to really -- as nick described in terms of some of the nuances on willow. will we get started? will we won't? do we have to do a upfront payment? how big is that for qatar? so, it's a little bit early for us to be kind of telegraphing what an absolute -- we're just saying, these are projects that make sense for us. we're going to fund them. we're going to lean in on some of these medium- and longer-cycle projects.
we think the world needs them. and again, that returns back to the shareholder aren't going to suffer because our value proposition is based on cfo. so, it's not based on free cash flow.
leo mariani -- mkm partners -- analyst
ok, thanks.
phil gresh -- vice president, investor relations
great. ok. with that --
operator
as we have no further questions, i will turn it over to phil for closing comments. please go ahead.

2022-Q4,COP,2023-02-02 12:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
welcome to the q4 2022 conocophillips earnings conference call. my name is michelle, and i will be your operator for today's call. [operator instructions] i will now turn the call over to phil gresh. vice president, investor relations.
sir, you may begin.
phil gresh -- executive vice president, investor relations
yes. thank you, operator, and welcome to everyone joining us for our fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. on the call today are several members of the conocophillips leadership team, including ryan lance, chairman and ceo; bill bullock, executive vice president and chief financial officer; dominic macklon, executive vice president of strategy, sustainability, and technology; nick olds, executive vice president of lower 48; andy o'brien, senior vice president of global operations; and tim leach, advisor to the ceo. ryan and bill will kick off the call with opening remarks.
after which, the team will be available for your questions. a few quick reminders. first, along with today's release, we published supplemental financial materials and a presentation, which you can find on our investor relations website. second, during this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements based on current expectations.
actual results may differ due to factors noted in today's release and in our periodic sec filings. finally, to make, we will make reference to some non-gaap financial measures. reconciliations to the nearest corresponding gaap measure can be found in today's release and on our website. with that, i'll turn the call over to ryan. 
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, phil, and thank you to everyone for joining our fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. as we sit here today, there are a number of cross-currents in the global economy. while the energy sector is not immune to potential macro headwinds, our fundamental outlook remains constructive. on the demand side, we think that growth will continue in 2023, aided by a normalization in china mobility following the loosening of covid restrictions.
on the supply side, we believe the continued producer discipline and the expected impacts of russian oil and product sanctions are likely to keep balances tight. so, while commodity prices are currently not as high as they averaged in 2022, we see duration to this upcycle. stepping back, we remain steadfast in our view that a successful energy transition must meet society's fundamental need for secure, reliable, and affordable energy, while also progressing toward a lower carbon future. while we all recognize the challenges that global energy policymakers face to achieve the goals of the paris agreement, it is clear that doing so requires an all-of-the-above approach.
this can be done by enacting policies that encourage the development of lower emission energy sources and oil and gas resources. these policies should include efforts aimed at fiscal stability, streamlining of the permitting process, increased transparency on timelines, and supporting critical infrastructure. these are not just necessary for the oil and gas industry, but also for nuclear, hydrogen, and renewables, all of which will be necessary to deliver on the energy transition. at the end of the day, it's critical for our administration to remember that north american energy production is a stabilizing force for both global energy security and meeting energy transition demand.
meeting that demand will require investments in medium- and long-cycle projects in addition to short-cycle u.s. shale. this is why you see conocophillips leaning a bit further across our deep and diversified portfolio in 2023. whether it's the lower 48, where we achieved record production in 2022, or our diversified global portfolio, conocophillips is well positioned to meet the world's long-term energy needs, while also reducing our own emissions footprint.
shifting to our 2022 performance, conocophillips showed continuous strong execution across our triple mandate. we generated a trailing 12-month return on capital employed of 27%, the highest since the spin. we delivered on our plan to return 15 billion of capital to our shareholders, which represented 53% of our cfo, well in excess of our greater than 30% annual through-the-cycle commitment. and we further advanced our net zero operational emissions ambition with a new medium-term methane intensity target consistent with our recent commitment to joining ogmp 2.0.
now, looking ahead, conocophillips is well positioned to further deliver on our triple mandate in 2023 with a well-balanced capital allocation strategy. this morning, we announced a plan to return 11 billion of capital to shareholders, which represents about 50% of our forecast in cfo at $80 wti. the other half of our cash flow will be dedicated to reinvesting in the business. from a portfolio perspective, our deep and well-diversified asset base is well positioned to generate solid cash flow growth for decades to come.
this is further evidenced by our organic reserve replacement ratio of 177% in 2022. we're also enthusiastic about our new lng opportunities we are participating in, in qatar and the united states, which are highly complementary to our existing lng business. and we look forward to providing you a comprehensive update about our long-term strategy and our financial outlook at our up and coming analyst and investor meeting on april 12 at the new york stock exchange. now, let me turn the call over to bill to cover our fourth quarter performance and 2023 guidance in a bit more detail.
bill bullock -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, ryan. starting with fourth quarter results, we generated $2.71 and adjusted earnings per share. fourth quarter production was 1,758,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which included a 27,000 barrel a day negative impact from weather in the lower 48. lower 48 production averaged 997,000, including 671,000 from the permian; 214,000 from the eagle ford; and 96,000 from the bakken.
moving to cash flow. fourth quarter cfo was $6.5 billion, excluding working capital, at an average wti price of $83 per barrel. ap lng distributions were $639 million. and fourth quarter capital expenditures were 2.5 billion, including 2.1 billion of base capital and 300 million for acquisitions and north field east payments.
on capital allocation, we returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through ordinary dividends, vroc payments, and share buybacks, while also reducing gross debt by $400 million. full year cfo was 28.5 billion, excluding working capital, at an average wti price of $94 per barrel on 2022. full year ap lng distributions were $2.2 billion. and full year total capex was 10.2 billion, with base capex achieving our guidance of $8.1 billion, and 2.1 billion of acquisitions and north field east payments.
full year return of capital was $15 billion, while 3.4 billion went to debt reduction with cash and short-term investment ending the year at 9.5 billion. turning to 2023 guidance. we forecast full year production to be in a range of 1.76 million to 1.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, which represents 1% to 4% organic growth. our first quarter production guidance range is 1.72 million to 1.76 million, which includes 35,000 of planned maintenance, primarily in qatar and the lower 48.
our full year plan maintenance is expected to be similar to 2022. on capital spending, we expect a range of 10.7 to 11.3 billion, which i would discuss in more detail in a moment. we expect operating costs of 8.2 billion, dd&a of 8.1 billion, and corporate segment net loss of 900 million. for 2023 cash flow, we forecast $22 billion in cfo and $80 barrel, wti; 85, brent; and 3.25, henry hub at current strip prices for regional differentials.
included in our cash flow forecast is 1.9 billion in ap lng distributions, with 600 million expected in the first quarter. now, regarding capex, we provide a waterfall in our prepared materials bridging 2022 actual spending to 2023 guidance. starting with base capital spending, we forecast an increase from 8.1 billion in 2022 to range of 9.1 billion to 9.3 billion in 2023. the remaining 1.6 billion to 2.0 billion is allocated to longer-term projects.
of this amount, 1.5 to 1.6 is for lng projects, which includes port arthur, north field east, and north field south. for port arthur, specifically, after factoring in expected project financing, we forecast that conocophillips net investment will be just under $2 billion over the five-year investment period. however, more than half of this capital investment will be in 2023. for willow, we're guiding to 100 million to 400 million of incremental spending with the higher end of this range, assuming that the project is sanctioned this year.
in summary, we're happy with our strong 2022 results, which would not be possible without the hard work and dedication of our talented workforce. and we are well positioned to balance investing in our deep and diversified portfolio this year, while also continuing to return capital to our shareholders. that concludes our prepared remarks. i'll now turn the call back over to phil.
phil gresh -- executive vice president, investor relations
great. thanks, bill. as a reminder, just before we go to the q&a, we ask that you please keep it to one question and a follow-up. with that, michelle, we're ready to turn over to you for q&a.

[operator instructions] our first question will come from neil mehta with goldman sachs. your line is now open.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah. good morning, team, and thanks for taking the time. our first question is around willow, and recognize, there are still some gating factors to getting it toward fid, but it seems to be moving in the right direction. so, just talk about how you're thinking about that project, what remains outstanding to get it to fid.
and then, any thoughts on costs as well? the latest number we have is $8 billion all-in. is that still good to go by? or how should we think about that?
andy o'brien -- senior vice president, global operations
hey, neil. this is andy. yeah, there's been a lot of moving parts on willow since the last earnings call. so, let me just step through where we are in the overall approval process, and then i can clear where we are with capex and scope.
so, with the approval process, i think most people saw that the final supplemental environmental impact statement was released by the biden administration earlier this week. now, that should be published in the federal register in the next day or so. and then, that starts the required 30-day clock before the rod can be issued. now, given the biden administration's commitment to the alaska congressional delegation, we can expect to receive that rod in the first week of march.
once the rod has been issued, our focus for 2023 will be to immediately initiate gravel road construction, ramp up fabrication and supply chain activities. now, we need to take a look at the rod in some detail. but assuming it's consistent with the blm's three-pad preferred alternative, and there are no new unworkable restrictions added, we would then proceed to final investment decision. so, switching to capex, 2023 is very dependent on the rod timing.
and as bill mentioned, we've been given a range. so, with the rod timing, any resolutions of outstanding issues, what we're guiding is about a $100 million to $400 million of incremental spend in 2023. in terms of the total project costs, we have recently gone out to market to update our cost estimates, and we have seen some inflationary pressures. we've also refined the scope, including an update to accommodate the blm's three-pad preferred alternative.
so, we're in the process of finalizing our cost estimates, but we anticipate the afe to first production to be in the $7 billion to $7.5 billion range. of the increase versus the update we provided in 2021, it's split about 50/50 between inflation and scope refinement. hope that gives you a pretty good update on where we are with willow. and then, at our april investor day, we're happy to go into some more details.
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's $7.5 billion, andy, compared to the $6 billion before, it sounds like, apples to apples. and then --
andy o'brien -- senior vice president, global operations
that's correct. that's an apple --
neil mehta -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. that's great. and then, the follow up is just around return of capital. last year was an outstanding year, 53% back to shareholders and -- of the cash flow.
and in the guidance this year, $11 billion also implies very strong return of capital number. i know we often anchor to the 30% or greater than 30%, but is the message we should be interpreting that there's a new normal here around return of capital and the bar has been reset higher?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, we're not trying to message that, neil. but what i remind people is the 30% commitment that we have is a through-the-cycle commitment. we've also signaled to our results and told the shareholders that when prices are above our mid-cycle price, you should expect higher distributions from the company. and that's consistent with what we've done over the last number of years.
so, as we look today at where the strip is trading, where the regional differentials are at, you know, we've kind of picked $11 billion at an $80 price deck. so, that's how we're going into the year. it represents about 50% of our cash flow. but, again, that 80 is well above our mid-cycle price, and our commitments tied to the through-the-cycle kind of mid-cycle price call.
and it just represents that we are constructive with the environment that we see today, and we expect the prices to be above our mid-cycle price call, which should inform that the distributions would be above that 30% as well.
phil gresh -- executive vice president, investor relations
great. thanks, neil.

next question.

our next question will come from doug leggate with bank of america. your line is now open.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
well, thank you. good morning, everyone. happy new year, guys.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, doug.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
so, bill, i think i didn't actually get to write down the numbers quickly enough. could you just go through again the expected cadence of the three lng projects? full disclosure, i think we had expected a slower pace on sempra or in port arthur, i guess. so, can you just walk us through how you expect that cadence to look, please? that would be really helpful. and i've got a follow up, please.
bill bullock -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, sure, doug. i'm happy to. so, let me just kind of start with a bit of a high-level view. we put on the bridge from 2022 to '23 in our documents for today.
and i'll start with kind of our exit rate. so, if you look at our fourth quarter base capital spend, that would annualize out to about 8.9 billion with a low single-digit inflation rate versus '22 exit rate. and we've got some phasing in norway and the additional incremental emissions reduction. that gets you to about 9.2, which is the midpoint of our guidance.
and then, really the incremental spend is on lng project and willow, and that gets us to $11 billion midpoint of the guidance range. and i think the primary issue here on cadence is likely the front-end nature of port arthur lng spend, which, really, the market had no way of knowing. so, as you'll recall, sempra communicated a phase 1 gross cost of $10.5 billion for the epc. on top of which, there's going to be owners costs and other miscellaneous costs to bring the project online.
and the project currently winding up debt financing for a portion of the spend. so, you roll that all together, we would expect our 30% share of the net equity capital to be just under $2 billion over the five-year investment period. but the front-end nature of the equity component is going to result in over half of that $2 billion occurring in 2023. that's what we've included in our 2023 capital and guidance.
now, the project is still waiting on fid, but we do expect that in the first quarter, and we will be talking to more about this in april. but if you'd been modeling a more ratable spend over five years for port arthur, that would be about $400 million in 2023, or about $600 million to $700 million less than our guidance. so, i think that that might be some of what you're seeing in kind of the lng spend. and i think it's obvious with over half of the port arthur spend in 2023, obviously, the spending 2024 and beyond is going to be less than a ratable rate.
but i think that's probably the main gap in lng spending that you're seeing.
doug leggate -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
that's really helpful. you're exactly right. we were not expecting half. but, of course, that means the other half is, you know, is probably more ratable, i'm guessing, over time.
but that's really helpful. my follow up is a favorite topic of mine. bill, i hate to get in the weeds here, but again, another sizable deferred tax credit this quarter, although it does kind of look a little bit more like you're almost like you're moving to a new normal based on your us spend and, you know, thinking over issues and things of that nature. can you maybe just -- you know, am i thinking about that right? should we be expecting a ratable deferred tax credit going forward in your cash flow? and i'll leave it there.
thank you.
bill bullock -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
well, yes. so, deferred taxes were a source of $0.5 billion in the fourth quarter, doug, and we had a source of about $700 million in the third quarter. now, the source of those deferred taxes is primarily due to the impact of intangible drilling costs and generating deferred tax liabilities now that we're in a u.s. cash tax paying position.
now, as we look at 2023 at current investment levels, we'd expect deferred taxes are going to continue to generate a source of cash on a normalized basis. but i'd expect the deferred tax source full year to be lower in 2022. now, we are in a u.s. cash tax paying position for the full year, but we also utilized all significant u.s.
net operating losses, nols, and eor credit carryforwards in 2022. and that utilization generated a larger source of cash last year compared to what we're going to be seeing in 2023.

our next question comes from steve richardson with evercore. your line is now open.
steve richardson -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you. ryan, there is been a lot of focus on the permian basin of late, certainly from an industry perspective. and, you know, not all of it has been good, you know, we'd say. and i'd love if you just took a moment and help us differentiate conoco's assets in the basin, what you're seeing from your asset.
and certainly, some of the performance speaks for itself, but i'd love if you could address that today.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, steve. let me make a couple of comments, and then i'll turn it over to nick for maybe a couple of his thoughts in a bit more detail. you know, we're not worried about, you know, our long-term development plans in the lower 48.
we see durability to our plans. and i know there is been a bit of noise about productivity and length and durability. and, you know, we've been there for a long time. we know what we're doing after the acquisitions that we made over the last year and a half.
and i don't have any concerns about the durability to length, the efficiency of our program. and maybe i'll let nick provide a few more detail and color on that comment.
nick olds -- executive vice president, lower 48
yeah, good morning, steve. so, i'll give a little more color on that one. let me start with just the well performance that we're seeing versus the tight curves. so, if you look at our 2022 development wells, they have been performing, you know, slightly above the curve expectations across all four basins, including the permian basin.
and that strong performance reinforces and validates the development plans that ryan just mentioned, which is our focus on maximizing returns and recovery while minimizing the future interference. so, if we step back in time, you know, we've been incorporating a lot of the learning curve from our developments over the past three to four years. in fact, you know, when you look at our accelerated learning curve, we've drilled the most horizontal wells in the delaware and midland basin, more than any other company. so, when you combine that data along with our significant operated by others' portfolio and then the learnings in our mature development in the eagle ford and the bakken, that's really helped us hone in on the best development approach of the stack.
so, in summary, steve, if you look at our production performance, you know, at or slightly exceeding type curve expectations, combined with the development strategy, we're very confident in our long-term outlook for these assets. and we will update you more at aim.
steve richardson -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's great. thanks. i really appreciate it. i mean if i could -- just one quick follow-up, nick.
could you just address the 25,000 acres of swaps and coring up that you mentioned this morning. i would -- i mean one of the questions that i got is --
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
you were breaking up, steve. steve, you were breaking up, sorry. no, we didn't catch your question. thanks.
steve richardson -- evercore isi -- analyst
sorry, must be the phone line. the question is on the -- you have the 25,000 acres on the core-up. and i'm just wondering if you could address, nick, how much more to go is there on that side? and where are you just looking at the checkerboard of the map down there?
nick olds -- executive vice president, lower 48
yeah, steve. maybe i'll just go back for the whole audience on what we've done in that space. we've been very focused on the acreage optimization, as you mentioned on trades and swaps. last year, we completed 15 trades and that gives us a total of about 25,000 acres since the concho transaction.
now, a couple of points i just want to address. these core-ups have doubled the average laterally of more than a year's worth of inventory that's at our current level of drilling activity. now, the ability to drill extended laterals greater than one mile can reduce our cost of supply by 30% to 40%. so, that's significant.
now, to put that in perspective, steve, our quality position in the permian has an inventory with roughly 60% of our wells that are greater than two-mile laterals, 60%. and then, if you look at 1.5 miles or greater, that's an additional 20%. so, that's a robust inventory that we have out there. now, if you will continue to, as you mentioned, the core-up in 2023 through acreage and swaps there, but we've got a significant deep robust inventory with those longer laterals.
steve richardson -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks so much.

you guys haven't done one for several years. anything on what we can expect from the presentation in terms of the longer-term plan, or maybe a breakdown of certain assets or projects. so, just any color on that would be great.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, john, thanks. so, we -- i think we will show how we're pretty excited about where the company has gone. we've got a better plan. it's the, you know, strategic and the financial plan of the company got better duration, better depth.
and we will show that to you what it means for the company for decades to come. i mean, so we're pretty excited about where it's at. we will do a deeper dive into where we're at in the lower 48, our global portfolio, as well as the lng business that we've been developing here over the last a year and a half. so, i look forward to sharing kind of our excitement around our plans, where it's headed and just the quality of what we're doing both strategically and financially.
john royall -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
great. thanks, ryan. and then, just a question on the guidance for 1q production, a little bit below the full year guide and you guys called out the maintenance number there. but maybe just some color on would be helpful on how you expect production to phase in throughout the year? should we expect it to be more back-end loaded or maybe more toward the middle or the later 1q?
dominic macklon -- senior vice president, strategy, sustainability and technology
hey, john, it's dominic here. so, yeah, i think as bill remarked, we do have above normal seasonal maintenance in the first quarter. that's at qatar train 6 and 7, but also eagle ford sugarloaf, our stabilizer facility down there. we've actually been preparing that for a bit of expansion.
so, that explains the q1 sort of rate. but thereafter, our expectation is that each quarter will be around 2% to 3% year-on-year growth. so, that's really our base case.
phil gresh -- executive vice president, investor relations

our next question comes from jeanine wai with barclays. your line is now open.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
hi. good morning, good afternoon, everyone. thanks for taking our questions.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
good afternoon.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
good morning, ryan. our first one, maybe following up on neil's question on the cash return for the year. we realize that it's still early in the year, but you've already declared vroc for the first part of the year. how are you ultimately thinking about the split of the $11 billion of total cash return between cash and buyback? and is the buyback more of a function of your mid-cycle price assumptions?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i think the majority of our buyback is tied back to ratably buying our shares in our mid-cycle price assumptions. so, we try to ratably buy some shares as we go through the year. and then, we buy some variable shares depending on where we see the market.
i would say, as we're going into 2023, right now, we're thinking roughly 50/50 percent between cash and shares in terms of the absolute return back to the shareholders. so, the $11 billion would be split roughly 5.5 and 5.5. that's our thinking as we start the year, but we will watch the commodity price and where things develop as we go through the course of the year.
jeanine wai -- barclays -- analyst
ok. very helpful. thank you. i'll pencil that in -- our second question, sticking with '23, but moving to capex here.
we noticed that there is about 500 million to 600 million of incremental inflation included in the budget versus 2022. and there is some noise with the categorization of the port arthur spend. but it looks like lower 48 will comprise about 60% of total capex for '23. and so, our question is, how much of that 500 million to 600 million of incremental inflation is in the permian and lower 48 versus maybe other parts of your portfolio? and what's your estimate on how inflation ended up by region in '22 and maybe any assumptions that you have in your budget for '23 inflation? thank you.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. let me take a quick high-level shot at it. i think if you're kind of looking at exit rates from 2022 going into 2023, it's kind of low single digits. if you're kind of looking at what's the increase annually year over year, it's more like mid single digits.
i think the difference we're seeing this year maybe relative to last year is we see that mid single-digit inflation applying across the whole global portfolio, and it's slightly higher in the permian to the question that you asked. so, yeah, we're in -- we're seeing some categories of spend that are key to the company actually start to plateau and maybe even roll over a little bit. one that -- one we're watching pretty closely is octg, the, , you know, tubulars. some of the raw materials that are going into making those are starting to come down and be slight a little bit, so we're starting to see that category spend sort of roll over.
we're seeing the rate of increase kind of in the onshore rig market start to lessen a little bit, which is good. we need that. and so, when we kind of wrap all those categories to spend together for the company, it kind of manifests itself in an annual year-over-year inflation in the mid single digits.

our next question comes from ryan todd with piper sandler.
ryan todd -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. maybe a follow-up on the permian. i am not sure if you mentioned this earlier, but can you talk a little bit about what is assumed in your current guidance, i guess, both capital and production for the year. it sounds like the guide assumes kind of flat activity levels in the permian versus late 2022.
is that correct? and in terms of how we think about activity levels and how should we think about the trajectory of production in the permian over the course of 2023?
nick olds -- executive vice president, lower 48
yeah, ryan, this is nick. yes, let me walk you through that. so, as you mentioned, we've assumed a level-loaded steady-state program for 2023 based on that second half of 2022 for rigs and frac crews. the focus for this year will really be around improving capital and operating efficiency.
now, we do expect some modest growth in partner activity as the year progresses. and then, we have some larger operated pads that will come online in kind of 2q, 3q. so, our lower 48 plan will deliver production in that mid-single digits, with the majority of that growth weighted to the permian. now, with respect to the profile shape, it will be kind of mid to back-end weighted in 2023.
and as we talked about, dominic mentioned this, we do have that eagle ford sugarloaf stabilizer maintenance that's going on. and actually, i'm pleased to mention that the turnaround that dominic referred to is five days, and we completed that successfully in january. now, we will have a little bit of brownfield modifications on that stabilizer through mid-february as well. and then i'll mention, too, kind of month to month, we will have, you know, wells, a little bit of lumpiness.
but in the back end, it will be weighted in 2023 for a production profile.
ryan todd -- piper sandler -- analyst
great, thank you. that's very helpful. and then, as we think about your emerging kind of global gas strategy, how should we think about your approach to the gas portfolio on these projects? should we expect the majority sold under long-term contracts with a percentage held for spot cells when you look to correspondingly build out your global gas trading capability similar to your european peers? and maybe, as you're out marketing these volumes, are you seeing anything to comment on in terms of the environment, whether global gas tightness is helping, you know, the sales pricing out there? so, any high-level views on your global gas strategy there would be great.
bill bullock -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, sure. this is bill. so, i'll just start with -- you know, we've got a really strong understanding and presence in the lng market have had for several years. we're regularly selling spot volumes into asia of our aplng venture.
and we do think that europe is going to be a long-term market for u.s. gulf coast. and you will see, where we recently secured, regas capacity in germany, which we're really happy about and excited about. and so, we're looking at the best options in terms of long-term placements, but these are 20-year projects off the gulf coast.
and so, we think that the long-term strength of international pricing relative to u.s. gas is going to be pretty interesting. and that driver and that strength in lng, we think, it's going to be driven by its role in energy transition and reducing carbon emissions. so, as you see us build out our lng portfolio over the next few years, we may take some longer-term contract decisions in there.
but right now, we're not really disclosing where we're at for competitive reasons in terms of how we're developing that market.

our next question comes from devin mcdermott with morgan stanley. your line is now open.
devin mcdermott -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey. good morning. thanks for taking my questions. so, i wanted to first follow-up on some of the capex questions.
earlier, you laid out the 1.6 billion to 2 billion of spending this year on major projects, and you talked with some good detail about port arthur. it's not necessarily ratable across the projects. but when you put it all together, i was wondering if you could talk about how you see the magnitude of major projects been evolving or changing over the next few years. outside of port arthur, what were some of the key moving pieces that we should be thinking about across the projects that could move that number higher or lower?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i think we tried to explain kind of a bit about the front-end loading of the port arthur project. so, you ought to expect that's going to come down, you know, as you look into the two, three, four years. some of the other moving pieces, you know, we -- if the commodity price environment supports it, we want to see some ramp in our lower 48 activities up to our optimized plateau across the various assets.
you will see willow ramping up if we get an adequate projects approval from the federal government. so, that will come in. and then, obviously, there are some inflationary forces as well as we think about where it's going. so, there is a lot of moving pieces, but, you know, that's kind of how you should think of the different pieces that we are looking at as we kind of think about the longer term nature of the capital.
and we will be prepared to talk about that at our analyst meeting coming up in april.

ryan, can i go back into permian? you guys are talking about earlier in your prepared remarks on the inventory for the three-mile well. i think the industry also think that the three-mile may actually work even better. can you talk about that? i mean based on where you are today, what's the inventory then on the three-miles and whether that there is a lot of opportunity there. and also, i don't know whether there is an update you can provide on the petrol -- longer-term petrol rate that you expect for permian and that when that you will be able to get there? so, that's the first question.
the second question that i have to say, i was super impressed that your bakken production is actually flat sequentially from the third quarter, given that the winter storm hit and so severely. i mean, how about the 27,000 barrels per day, i mean how much is on the bakken? and how you would be able to get it so that you can actually get it flat?
nick olds -- executive vice president, lower 48
all right. yeah, this is nick there. i will just kind of walk you back through kind of the inventory related to our longer laterals as we have done the core-up. again, over 60% is greater than two-mile laterals, and that does include the three miles as well.
so, that's a significant part of our inventory in the permian basin. we have actually, this last year, in 2022, brought on, i think more than 30 wells that are in the three-mile category and are seeing very encouraging results. so, we will continue to execute those as we are going forward. as we continue to core up and do swaps, that will give us more inventory as well for that longer lateral execution.
again, you will see probably cost of supply of about 30% to 40% reduction as we drill those longer laterals. the expected plateau --
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
i'm sorry, dominic, for the 60% you are talking about, how much of -- what percent of them is actually in the three-miles category?
nick olds -- executive vice president, lower 48
yeah. paul, i don't have that in front of me at this point in time, but let's wait until aim, and i will give you a further update on that overall three-mile categorization.
paul cheng -- scotiabank -- analyst
ok.
nick olds -- executive vice president, lower 48
ok. on your second part of that first question related to plateau. again, we will update the group on overall permian plateau, eagle ford, and bakken at the april 12th investor day. obviously, there is a number of factors that go into that.
the macro, maintaining execution efficiency, continuing to capture the learning curve and capital efficiency. you know, right now, with our middle -- mid-single digit growth, we feel that's right in line with what we have communicated earlier. and then, your second question was related to weather. glad you brought that one up.
again, bill, you had mentioned 27,000 barrels a day for fourth quarter 2022. just a quick breakdown on that. that's 13,000 barrels for permian, 10,000 barrels for bakken, and then last 4,000 barrels in eagle ford. i think you asked kind of maybe quarter to quarter, q3 to q4, you are right, it was flat.
we are at 96,000 barrels equivalent per day. and, paul, the main driver for that is we had some really strong operated wells that carried into q4. and then, on the operated by others, we had some larger pad projects come online in q4 that offset that weather.
phil gresh -- executive vice president, investor relations
thanks, paul. next question.

our next question comes from bob brackett with bernstein. your line is now open.
bob brackett -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
hey. good morning. a bit of an old-school question on your reserve replacement. historically, lng fids were big blocky chunks of gas reserves going into the portfolio.
that's not really going to be the case for a midstream asset like port arthur. but i am curious, can you go into a little more detail on the oil-gas mix shift on the reserve replacement and how to think about the cadence of lng coming in through that?
dominic macklon -- senior vice president, strategy, sustainability and technology
hey, bob. it's dominic here. yeah. so, let me talk a bit about that.
i mean, we are obviously very pleased with our organic reserve replacement ratio this year, 177%. the real drivers for that, i mean, obviously, the lng, we did have some bookings there from nfe as we commenced payments on nfe. we also saw some bookings to make lng performance and for some project advancements in norway. so, our international portfolio is contributing.
but the main area this year was actually in the lower 48 development program. and that's particularly in the permian and that included an increase to our pud bookings by extending the approved era we established by reliable technology, which is an sec term. so, it's consistent with sec requirements. and so, basically, we have a very extensive geoscience and reservoir engineering data set across the permian now that allows us to support that.
and you will be aware, bob, just the rigor and the process and the controls governing the reserves booking process. so, this further demonstrates the depth and quality of our lower 48 inventory. so, that's really the story this year. going forward, you know, we will continue to see bookings in the lower 48.
we will see bookings in alaska, obviously with pending fids. and then, we will continue to see some lng bookings as well, particularly on the resource projects as we call them, nfe and nfs. you are absolutely right what you are saying about port arthur. but -- so, i think you will see a mix going forward.
right as it stands now, you know, our lower 48 represents about 46% of our reserves and the remainder across the international. so, yeah, we are certainly appreciating the performance of our sort of diversified portfolio around our reserves booking. so, thanks for the question.
bob brackett -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
very clear. a quick follow-up on the portfolio. great opportunities in 2020 to rebuild the portfolio, '21 again in the permian, '22 was very much an lng-themed year. is the star of the show for '23 willow fid? or how do you think about the portfolio where it stands today?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
you know, we are pretty pleased where the portfolio is at. i mean dominic did a good job of kind of going across the globe. i think we spent a lot of time over the last five years really coring up the portfolio, really focused on getting it as low cost of supply as we can, getting the margins as expanded as we can leading to kind of the returns and the productivity that we are seeing today. so, we are just hyper-focused on making sure the efficiencies are there and the returns are there.
and pretty happy with where we stand today. and then, as you rightly note, bob, we are leaning in a bit on some of these mid and longer-cycle projects because we are just very constructive. the world is going to need this all. it's going to need low greenhouse gas and emissions intensity oil.
it's going to need low-cost supply oil. that's what we are all about. that's what we are doing in our portfolio. and most recently, leaning in on the lng side because we think the world is going to need this gas as part of the transition that we are going through.
bob brackett -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
thanks. very clear.
phil gresh -- executive vice president, investor relations
thanks, bob. next question.
operator
our next question comes from neal dingmann with truist. your line is now open.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
good morning. thanks for the time. my question is around just production and maybe around the permian. i am just trying to get a sense of -- you have got i think the 1% to 4% type overall growth.
so, i am just trying to get a sense of expectations for the permian, if you would back out, obviously, what's going on up in alaska. have you all clarified or, you know, kind of said what the expectation is at? and it sounds like -- second part of that, it sounds like it's going to be pretty -- that growth you expect in the permian, i assume, would be pretty linear for the entire year, if you could comment on those two things.
nick olds -- executive vice president, lower 48
yeah. neal, this is nick. again, for the lower 48, we will deliver production growth in that mid single digits. and again, the majority of that growth is going to be weighted to the permian.
with respect to the profile shape, it's going to be more of mid to back-end weighted. so, we have got some operated larger pads that are going to be coming on kind of the mid-year to third quarter. and then, we have got a modest operated by other growth going through the year with more on the kind of the back end for lower 48. does that help?
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
that's very clear. and then, just one last one. you all are obviously in a fantastic position financially. you have done some, you know, really positive m&a deals in the past.
i think actually in the last couple of years among the best that i have seen out there. my question that comes in, i mean, how do you view the landscape today? i mean, obviously, prices are up, maybe -- you know, commodity prices are up so maybe expectations are higher. but just wondering, overall, how do you view the m&a landscape?
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, neal. i mean we're in the market every day. you know, we're trading.
we're thinking about the market, we see what's going on every day. we think, you know, generally, there is more consolidation that's needed in our business. it's pretty tough that these kinds of elevated prices, but, you know, we watch it every day. i think it -- we have been pretty clear and consistent about our financial framework and how we think about m&a.
that has not changed. so, as we think about cost of supply, we think about assets that we can make better or can make our company better or improve our long-term plan, we know the assets that we like. and so, we watch those constantly. but, you know, it's a tougher market at these kinds of prices to transact.
and some of the transactions that have occurred this year, we have looked at them. we have seen them. we have watched them. they just don't feel our framework.
so, they don't make us a better company.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
that's very clear. thank you all.
phil gresh -- executive vice president, investor relations
next question.
operator
our next question comes from paul sankey with sankey research. your line is now open.
paul sankey -- sankey research -- analyst
hi, everyone, and thanks as always for the great disclosure. in fact, you guys have been leaders in the industry in many ways, starting with really the first capital discipline, cash return framework. you are in a position to make acquisitions at the bottom of the cycle. and now, you are saying that you are leaning in is the word, ryan -- words to sort of mega project development using an $85 oil price assumption.
is this an indication that the industry is going to have to follow you? or is it more that these major opportunities have come up in 2023? and further, to the $85 price assumption, could you just remind me what gas price assumption you are using? and what would you cut if oil prices went to, say, 60 over the course of the year? thanks.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks paul. no, i think we are -- our view pretty constructive over the next number of years and through the decade. so, the time you want to do some of these big projects sort of front end of the cycle.
we probably are a bit unique given our global diversified portfolio. we have opportunities in alaska and norway, in the far east, in the middle east. so, you know, we look at those, make sure they fit our framework around cost of supply and what we want to go invest in. and as we look forward, we believe, you know, now is the time to be doing these projects, which is why you see us leaning in on the lng side.
we are constructive on the gas and why, you know, we are moving forward with our little project up in alaska. and i will make a side comment, you know, this is what the administration has asked us for: u.s. production that's low ghg emission production. this is exactly what the administration has asked us to do as an industry, and that's what we are trying to do as a company.
now, looking forward, you know,, i think we will talk at aim about where we think mid-cycle price is. and frankly, we think it's probably come up from where we have been over the last five, six years. we will show that to you at aim. and then, finally, to your last question, yeah, we have set a cash return target at 80 wti, 85 brent.
and i think it's 3.25 henry hub. those are the assumptions we made that underpin the 11 billion. the price would have to go down considerably. i mean you said, you know, into the 60s, full year average, i think, before we would talk about changing that.
and we are prepared to use our cash on the balance sheet to fund these projects. that's why we have that cash. that's why we have that financial strength and that resilience. so, we are happy to use the cash if we need to.
so, i think it's resilient across a broad range of prices in terms of what we have established as our distribution target for the year.
paul sankey -- sankey research -- analyst
great. thanks. and then, following on the leadership, you were instrumental in the export ban being lifted. can you talk a little bit more about willow? there is obviously some -- you know, you mentioned low ghg.
can you talk a bit about how it fits alongside what you just said about the administration asking for this in terms of its environmental footprint? thank you very much.
ryan lance -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. it will be some of the lowest ghg emission production in the world, less than 10 kilograms per barrel. so, it's going to be something that we believe is what the world needs right now as we go through this energy transition. we need more oil and gas.
we need more base load to supply the world reliable and affordable energy. and coming to the united states and north america broadly, in general, is the right thing to be doing right now. and it comes from companies like ours that have over 40-year experience on the north slope. we know how to do this.
we know how to do it responsibly. and all the stakeholders support it, including the native community on the north slope, the congressional delegation, the union labor leaders who need this opportunity for employment in alaska. so, there is full alignment behind what we are trying to go do there. it's just the politics in d.c.
paul sankey -- sankey research -- analyst
thank you, sir.
phil gresh -- executive vice president, investor relations
thanks, paul. michelle, i think we have time for one more question.
operator
our last question comes from bill janela with credit suisse. your line is now open.
bill janela -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey. good morning. thank you. i wanted to ask on the pace of capex as you move through this year, i'm wondering with all of the major project components that there are some quarters that might be chunkier than others, or if there are any other timing or seasonal factors to consider.
so, any guidance you can give there in terms of how to think about the progression of quarterly spending for some of those bigger ticket items, as well as the base business would be very helpful. thanks.
dominic macklon -- senior vice president, strategy, sustainability and technology
thanks, bill. it's dominic here. yeah, the way it's going to work out we think is pretty ratable through the year. you know, we have got consistent activity in the lower 48 level loaded.
you're right that there is going to be a bit of lumpiness around some of the project spend. so, for example, in the first quarter, we do have a modest upfront payment in q1 on port arthur, assuming that's sanctioned. but, you know, if you are running a fairly ratable profile, that would be a good estimate.
bill janela -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. thank you.
phil gresh -- executive vice president, investor relations
ok. great. thank you. operator, i think this would wrap up the call.
