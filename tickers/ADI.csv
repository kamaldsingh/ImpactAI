[operator instructions] our first question comes from john pitzer from credit suisse. please go ahead. your line is open.
john pitzer -- credit suisse securities (usa) llc -- analyst
yeah, good morning, guys. appreciate the question, and congratulations on the strong results. prashanth, i just want to talk a little bit about how the model unfolds from here. i mean clearly you talked about already hitting the gross margin trough for the year, but you're guiding eps sort of flattish on up revenue. i'm just kind of curious, how should we be thinking about opex from current run-rate levels? and specifically, is there incremental opex needed because of the tight supply situation or what are the puts and takes as we go throughout the balance of the year?
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yeah, thank you for the questions, john. so the way to think about opex is that if you recall in the proxy, we identified that last year in the first half we had a particularly low bonus payout as a reflection of the macroeconomic environment. in the first half of this year you're going to see the opposite effect of that. so on average, it's a normal bonus payout but you do see a significant upswing in our variable comp which is impacting both the first and the second quarter compares. in addition, we have the merit increase, so that if you remember, we put that merit increase in several months later than normal as a result of the pandemic last year. so you're beginning to see that on a full year run-rate basis in first quarter, and that'll carry into second quarter. so beyond these comp-related items, opex is really at a steady level. we are not requiring any additional investment at the opex level to support the demand that we're generating.
john pitzer -- credit suisse securities (usa) llc -- analyst
perfect. thank you, guys.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
thanks, john. we'll go to our next question.

thank you. our next question comes from ambrish srivastava from bmo capital markets. please go ahead. your line is open.
ambrish srivastava -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. thank you very much. prashanth, and vince, i just wanted to get back to the current constrained supply condition that the industry is facing. so could you please comment on your lead times? and then what are you seeing in the cost increases that you're experiencing? and are you able to pass along pricing to the customers? and more importantly, does it change your approach? is there structural change that you see happening? prashanth you talked about capex running a little bit higher. where is the additional capex going? in the backend? front-end? and i just wanted to get a better sense of how things change from here on, on the supply chain front for adi. thank you.
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
great. okay. okay. so there's a lot packed into that question, ambrish. let me take a couple pieces of it. so we are producing and shipping at record levels, and the second quarter outlook is going to be a record. we have enough capacity to meet the guide, but significant additional upside versus that guide will depend on what we're able to procure, both from an external wafer standpoint, as well as the capital that we are in the process of deploying into our internal facilities to support that. what we're doing to help alleviate that situation is we have been consistently building inventory since last summer to deplete what was pulled down during the pandemic shutdowns.
we are adding additional supply, both internally, and i mentioned the capital that we're deploying, which is mostly going to the backend, and then externally, we've gone out and acquired additional wafers from our partners. so i think the answer to your question on capex is that it's mostly for test and then on the capacity side, where we can get additional capacity from our partners, we're doing that. but even with this additional capacity, it's very likely that the strength of demand is going to outpace supply for some period of time, so i think we will be chasing demand, at least for the balance of this year. from a capital deployment standpoint, some of that, as we guide as a percentage of revenue, some of that is dependent on how strong the year continues to roll out, so when i say, slightly above 4%, it could come down to 4% or maybe just a hair below if revenue continues to cripple on here.
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, just on the lead time question, ambrish, so we entered our first quarter with what we would have called normal lead times, but during the quarter and into the early part of this quarter, we've seen lead times extend, which i think is pretty consistent with the industry at large. so while we see some hot spots, we're really talking about is a few weeks of extension in different places. i would remind you too that we run this company, we run our manufacturing plans, the operating plans are run to pos rather than poa, so what we're seeing right now is a good balance between pos and poa, but as prashanth said, we're preparing for quite a bit of upside during this year, and we've pretty substantially increased the capex in our backend.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
okay. thanks, ambrish.
ambrish srivastava -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from stacy rasgon with bernstein research. please go ahead, your line is open.
stacy rasgon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for taking my question. i wanted to ask about comm. so it's down sequentially and year-over-year, i guess, into q2. is that the trough for the year for comm? and do you think the comms segment overall can grow year-over-year for the full year 2021?
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yeah, you want to take that one? okay, i'll take the first part of that, stacy. let's break comms into wired and wireless. on the wired, we're looking for continued growth as carriers and data centers, our upgrading networks. on the wireless, we've said that the u.s. deployment of 5g was always going to be a second-half event, and our view on that has not changed. what we have seen is a bit more of a slowdown in china as they're digesting kind of the 5g that they've deployed, and the channel counts are a bit lower. so we do think comms troughs in second quarter, and then begins to pick up in the second half with the global 5g. in terms of our view on whether we can grow comms on a year-over-year basis, given the significant headwind we have from huawei going to zero, that's a tough ask.
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think as well, i'll remind everybody that the three-year cagr for comms has been 7%, and that's with that very, very significant headwind in china, so i think when you look at adi and the comms business, it's tremendously diverse. many, many hundreds of customers, 5g is a critical part, wireline is an increasingly critical part, so very, very hard to predict in a lumpy business, but our expectation is that when the [indecipherable] will produce better than mid-single digit growth for that business.
stacy rasgon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
i'm sorry, was that a longer -- a long-term statement? that didn't sound like that was this year.
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
over the next few years, i think, stacy. we will produce something better than mid-single-digit growth in that business.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
yeah, stacy, i think what prashanth says, we don't think we will grow this year in fiscal '21 due to, i will say, the huawei headwinds as they go to zero and lower channel count in china, but then pivoting to vince, over the long-term, we should grow -- we've been growing 7%. there's no reason going forward we can't grow at least in line with that. and with that, we'll go to the next question.
stacy rasgon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
didn't you used to talk about double-digit growth, though, in this business?
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
we did, stacy. i think the world has changed over the past two years quite a bit. could it grow double-digits? sure, it could. there's no reason it can't, but i think as we look today with the pressures you're seeing geopolitically, those are things we didn't know two years ago.
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
i think high single-digits is a reasonable expectation. the early stages of 5g i think being able to grow at double-digits is very plausible, but we're working off a bigger numerator at this point in time. so i think if we can produce something in the high-single digits, we will be in very, very good shape.
stacy rasgon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
got it. thank you, guys.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
thanks, stacy. cheryl, the next question?

and our next question -- pardon me. our next question comes from tore svanberg from stifel. please go ahead. your line is open.
tore svanberg -- stifel, nicolaus & co., inc. -- analyst
thank you, and congratulations on the results. vince, you talked about a second design win for your wireless bms solution or second oem using that technology. could you elaborate a little bit on how quickly this technology is going to penetrate the auto market? could you potentially get to six, seven oems embracing this technology this year or next?
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
well, that's certainly our expectation. i think in terms of getting to market, the latter part of this year will see the start of production, and i think between now and the end of 2023, say, we should expect four to five oems to adopt that technology. we have a strong pipeline, but also remember we have a very strong wired portfolio in bms. so we've got those two tailwinds working for us. but i think over time it will be a kind of a hybrid between wired and wireless, but clearly, wireless is the bright star at this point in time. and our expectation is that we will have at least a handful of oems using this technology by the start of 2024.
tore svanberg -- stifel, nicolaus & co., inc. -- analyst

and our next question comes from vivek arya from bank of america. please go ahead. your line is open.
vivek arya -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. vince, i wanted to talk about just fiscal '21 and the sustainability of growth. so you're starting the year off very strong, right, 20% growth rate in q1 and the q2 outlook. how should we think about the second half of -- whether you want to talk about the fiscal year or the calendar year -- which market do you think right now are overheated because of whatever reasons -- which are kind of only -- which are in line with demand? and which ones can actually accelerate going into the second half? so just how should we think about how the segment mix changes as you go toward the second half of the year? thank you.
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, thanks for your question. so typically 1q is the low point for adi. we had a reasonably strong first q compared to kind of normal pattern. but i will stress there's still a tremendous amount of uncertainty out there, and i don't want to get into the business of making strong speculative predictions here, but we can only kind of guide one quarter at a time, particularly in this varying market. but if i look at the market and just kind of peel the story back a little bit for you, so our industrial business, which represents about half of the company's revenue was down. we had two consecutive down years in '19 and '20, but we produced a record quarter in the first. we expect ongoing strength in that business.
and one thing i'm very, very pleased about is that the most diverse part of our industrial business is automation. and i think given the strength of our opportunity pipeline, the new products we've got coming to market, i expect to see a multiyear tailwind in the automation part. i think right now in automotive there's a big push to electric vehicles. and i see that, as i said in the prepared remarks that is expected to grow by 2030 from kind of 7 million deployed electric vehicles today to over 200 million by 2030. and we talked a lot in the last quarter about the strength of our cabin electronics business: active noise cancelation, premium audio, our a2b bus deployments. and all that, too, provides good tailwinds for the company going ahead.
comms, as we've just narrated, weakened the first half of '21, but, really, i think that's about the timing of deployments. and my expectation is that that business will snap back in the second half of '21, and continue into '22. last but not least, our consumer business has shown now a couple of sequential growth quarters, and we no longer have the overhang of one big socket and one big customer. so with the diversity of our business, we're addressing more applications, we have a stronger product portfolio than we had say three years ago. i think we're on a growth track in that business, and we're certainly off to a very, very good start. so we believed that 2020 was the bottom of that business, and certainly the signals are that is the case.

thank you. our next question comes from toshiya hari from goldman sachs. please go ahead. your line is open.
toshiya hari -- goldman sachs & co. llc -- analyst
hey. good morning. thanks so much for taking the question. vince, you guys talked about growing capacity both internally as well as externally with your foundry partners. how should we think about the step up in your capacity, again both internal and external, over the next couple of quarters? the magnitude at which you can grow capacity for the overall business? and secondly, a couple of your peers have talked about signing long-term contracts with customers. is that something that adi is thinking about or considering? thank you.
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think what you've got to remember is that first and foremost we're producing and shipping products at record levels. 2q will be an all-time record for the company, so we're certainly keeping ahead. our investments are keeping ahead of these revenue levels, obviously. like most of our peers in the industry, there are supply constraints in parts of the business, so we're not able to meet all of the demand, particularly in auto, which has been very, very well-publicized. and the constraints continue across the front end in wafer procurement, and also the backend.
but i want to remind you, too, we produce about half our silicon inside adi, and the other half we procure with external partners. so i think something else worth noting is that we've been building inventory since last summer in terms of die stock and finished goods, which was heavily depleted during the pandemic shutdown. so, as i said, internally we're ramping up our own manufacturing operations, and we've been successful in acquiring additional wafers from our external partners. so i think that's the best i can give you in terms of the atmosphere that we're working within. we're certainly keeping capex deployments ahead of where we think the revenue could be this year based on the demand patterns we now see.
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
toshi, i would expect that our guide for each of the subsequent quarters is going to be partly influenced by what we're able to supply. so as i said earlier, i think we're going to be chasing demand for the rest of this fiscal year, and we will use our guidance range to inform how we think -- what we can build to based on our ability to get capacity third parties as well as increase capacity internally.
toshiya hari -- goldman sachs & co. llc -- analyst
and then the long-term contracts, is that something that comes up in conversations or not really?
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
i think it depends. we do have long-term contracts, but we're doing that on a more strategic basis than tactical, let's say.
toshiya hari -- goldman sachs & co. llc -- analyst
got it. thank you so much.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
thanks, toshiya.

our next question comes from craig hettenbach from morgan stanley. please go ahead. your line is open.
craig hettenbach -- morgan stanley -- analyst
oh, yes, thank you. any update on just the linear cross-selling synergies and efforts? i know a little while back you talked about the pipeline, but just how you're seeing that kind of unfold? and any particular markets for product segments that you're seeing the most traction on along those lines?
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so, craig, there's a couple of ways to look at this. obviously, the battery side of things is very, very strong. we've more than doubled the size of that since we acquired lt. and overall, when i look at, for example, power, the mixed signal portfolio, as well as the battery management side of things, we have more than $500 million worth of new revenue going into production this year, and that's just the beginning. so in terms of areas where we're winning, we've got notable wins in communications, in wireless as well as and data center and cloud. in automotive, we're strongly attaching to our infotainment business, the autonomous radar systems.
and the strongest surge in terms of growth in industrial for the lt portfolio, the additional cross-selling is instrumentation tests and micromodules generally speaking across the board. we're seeing very, very strong demand for those products. so i think all that said, we had expected that we would double the ltc growth from 3% to 4% historically to high-single digits in a five-year period. and that's quite similar to how we viewed our opportunity with hittite at the beginning and what also has materialized. so that's the story in terms of the markets and the expected growth.
craig hettenbach -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. appreciate the color. thanks, vince.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
cheryl, can we have our last question, please?
operator
thank you. our next question comes from c. j. muse from evercore. your line is open.
c. j. muse -- evercore isi -- analyst
yeah, good morning. thank you for taking the question. i guess, vince, to follow up on that last question and to kind of go back to what you talked about a quarter ago, i think you said factory automation turned positive for the first time in quite a while year-on-year yet was still significantly below the q3 '18 levels. so i was hoping we could level set where we are today in your industrial bucket. and as you think about where you are relative to prior peak, what kind of acceleration in growth should we be able to see in '21 and '22 particularly around factory automation, a&d and instrumentation?
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i'd say i mean, just, mike can give you some numerical color. i'll just give you a couple -- headline here. so what we're seeing, as i said in the prepared remarks, is an acceleration of the market in general, but we're still well below the previous peak. and given the pipeline of opportunities that we've got, the technologies and the products that we've got, i think the long-term trends are going to be very, very strong, accelerated of course by the obvious need for resilience and driven by automation as a result of the pandemic. but, mike, you might want to add?
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
yeah, sure. c. j., you're right. if you look at our industrial business, we did just achieve a record quarter and we're guiding to another record quarter. so i'll clarify that. but what's interesting is if you peel back a bit, we have six application areas within industrial. only two of them are above previous peaks. so there's a lot more room for upside across all the verticals. but even if you look back at previous peaks, there's still four application areas we still have more room to run before we hit those peaks, automation being one of those as well. so i think, as vince said, it's a long term growth market, automation and industrial, and you're starting to see that business turn late last year into this year. and i think that continues hopefully into 2022.
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
maybe just to close on that, c. j., we've been gaining share in industrial, and we've been gaining share over the last couple of years while the market hasn't been as strong. now you're going to see the compounding effect of a growing market with the benefits of the share that we've picked up. so i think you will see significant outperformance for adi's industrial business versus our peers over the balance of this year.
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
i think healthcare as well, c.j., is worth noting that -- it still remains considerably above pre-covid levels. we obviously got a boost during the upsurge in covid-19. and again, i think this has been growing at kind of 10% for the past five or seven years. it's, i think, a multiyear growth market, and we're beginning to see also the acceleration of demand as a result of the pandemic getting healthcare capabilities to anywhere so to speak. so i think -- we look across industrial as an area where we've been, i'd say, steering a lot of our r&d over the last decade or so. it's kind of a long-burn business, but we're seeing the benefits now in terms of strength of our technology pipe and our customer engagements.
c. j. muse -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
all right. thanks, c.j., and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. a copy of the transcript will be available on the website. thanks for joining the call and your continued interest in analog devices. have a good day.

operator
good morning, and welcome to the analog devices first quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web.
i'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, mr. michael lucarelli, senior director of investor relations. sir, the floor is yours.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
thank you, cheryl, and good morning, everybody. thanks for joining our first quarter fiscal 2021 conference call. with me on the call today are adi's ceo, vincent roche; and adi's cfo, prashanth mahendra-rajah. for anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com. now on to the disclosures; the information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, including statements relating to our objectives, outlook and the proposed maxim transaction. these forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as further described in our earnings release and our most recent 10-q and other periodic reports and materials filed with the sec.
actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements as these statements reflect our expectations only as the date of this call. we undertake no obligation to update these statements except as required by law. our comments today will also include non-gaap financial measures, which exclude special items. when comparing our results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. reconciliations of these non-gaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap measures and additional information about our non-gaap measures are included in today's earnings release.
and with that, i'll turn it over to adi's ceo, vincent roche. vince?
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
thanks very much, mike, and good morning to you all. so i'll start my remarks with a review of our results before providing insights into how we are shaping a more connected, safer and sustainable future. in the first quarter, we delivered strong results that came in at the high end of our outlook. revenue was $1.56 billion and increased 20% year-over-year. the strength was broad-based with growth across all end markets, highlighted by a record quarter for our industrial business. we delivered gross margin of 70% and op margin of nearly 41%. all told we produced adjusted earnings per share of $1.44. over the trailing 12 months, we generated $1.9 billion free cash flow, equating to a 33% free cash flow margin, placing us in the top 10% of the s&p 500.
so overall, i'm very pleased with our team's performance this quarter. now, i'd like to discuss how we are advancing our mission of engineering good for the planet, social health and economic prosperity, which, in turn, will create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. awareness of the world's environmental degradation and climate change specifically is growing tremendously with a global call to action building momentum. semiconductors, as the bedrock of the modern digital economy, have a major role to play in improving our standard of living while protecting our planetary health. at adi, our technologies sit at the intersection of our customers' and society's most pressing challenges and we're uniquely positioned to drive positive impact.
our industry-leading portfolio, with its breadth of capabilities, defines the edge of performance and inherently delivers sustainable benefits. with each generation of chip design, we increased efficiencies while enhancing the performance of our customers' systems. this portfolio supports customers of all sizes and spans industries that are aligned with key secular trends. so today, i'll focus on where adi's entering goods across the automation, electrification and connectivity sectors. firstly, the automation of human routines, factory floors, and supply chains is critical to our future, and the pandemic has further accelerated this paradigm. the world economic forum is predicting that by 2025, over half of all tasks will be performed by machines, a first in human history.
to support this trend, our industrial customer base is boosting deployments of robots and cobots. over the next five years, the global robot-installed base is expected to increase by about 60%. with industrial motors currently consuming 25% of all the world's electricity, we urgently need to deploy technologies that not only deliver speed and accuracy, safety and flexibility, but also energy savings. now, let me share a few examples of how our technologies are meeting these challenges in automation. so firstly, variable speed drives can reduce motor energy consumption by up to 40% in a robot. our precision signal chain, isolation and power management technologies together increase response time and improve power conversion.
secondly, our time-of-flight sensory technology allows robots to sense and interpret the world around them so our customers can deploy more robots per square foot and improve worker safety. thirdly, our auto-sense condition-based monitoring solution presciently identifies motor inefficiencies, enabling customers to proactively optimize and repair machinery. this avoids costly downtime and lowers energy consumption by 10%. importantly, these technologies that improve motor efficiency and robotic control can save almost 1 gigaton of annual co2 emissions, the equivalent of 330 million residential homes. in total, automation is a key component of our industrial business, supporting tens of thousands of customers. we expect this accelerated digitalization to drive continued growth in 2021 and beyond.
now, i'll turn to electrification and discuss the important role adi is playing as consumer demand for greener transportation accelerates. the world economic forum predicts that by 2030 there will be approximately 250 million electric vehicles on the road, up exponentially from about 7 million today. adi's solutions are embedded across all phases of the electric vehicle journey, from supporting ev infrastructure to forming and managing the vehicle battery. so i'll share now how our technologies are impacting this ecosystem. first, the shift to renewable energy sources drives great environmental benefits, but also creates new obstacles in distribution, transmission and stability. this requires the smart grid, which can digitally monitor and adjust performance.
our control and sensing technologies are critical to ensuring the grid parameters remain stable and prevent shutdowns. this shift also requires energy storage systems to mitigate intermittency issues related to variable user demand. here, our high accuracy monitoring and efficient power conversion technologies help extend systems' battery life by more than 30%. turning to the battery, which is the most expensive vehicle part. our battery management system, or bms, enables up to 20% more miles per charge than our competition. as the market leader, over half of the top 10 electric vehicle brands use adi's bms technology today. in addition, last fall, we introduced the industry's first wireless bms platform.
this has all the benefits of our wired solution by lowering vehicle weight and enabling a scalable battery architecture, paving the way for reuse in storage systems. gm's ultium platform uses our wireless bms technology, which is expected to be deployed across 30 different models by 2025. interest in our wireless bms technology is rising, and last quarter we recorded our second oem design win. importantly, the environmental impact from our bms capabilities is notable. in 2020 alone, vehicles equipped with adi's bms technologies prevented approximately 70 million tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. our solutions utilized at the battery formation stage enable more current density, thereby shrinking our customers' equipment footprint by up to four times and reducing per channel costs by nearly half.
our technology makes it possible for factories to recycle more than 80% of the energy used during the formation back into the power grid. based on today's production levels, energy recycling during formation reduces co2 output by about 1 million tons annually. so all told, electrification not only represents a highly valuable market with long-term revenue growth opportunities but one that will be critical to the preservation of our precious natural ecosystem. so finally, let me turn to connectivity. in the face of the pandemic, connectivity has been the foundation that is sustaining and powering our society and the economy. and while the communications market is not known historically for its sustainability benefits, this ability to stay connected and productive from anywhere has also had a positive impact on the environment.
a clear proof point is the reduction of global carbon emissions by a record 7% in 2020. by 2030, forecasts suggest mobile traffic will increase by about 17 fold. this exponential increase in wireless data, combined with pervasive cloud computing puts ip traffic on pace to double every 2.5 years, and adi is playing a critical role in building out the next generation infrastructure to support this exponential increase in data from capturing the signal at the base station air interface and transferring the information to the data center while substantially decreasing power. so adi has invested ahead and reshaped the 5g radio architecture. our software-defined transceivers with complementary precision signal chain and power technologies are vital to enabling the 5g massive mimo architecture.
when comparing 5g to 4g, our solutions help deliver a 90% decrease of energy per bit at the air interface by decreasing the channel count by 10 times while maintaining the radio size and terminal performance. with the exponential upswing in data generation, our customers are upgrading their optical infrastructure from 100 gigabits per second to 400 gigabits per second. our precision signal chain technologies help enable these optical modules maintain constant power while operating at four times the data rate. and with the customers looking to increase to 1 terabit and beyond, adi's opportunity will continue to expand.
capturing and transporting data efficiently is important, but computing and data centers is the primary source of energy consumption in the connectivity ecosystem. currently, data centers generate more than 130 million tons of co2 per year globally. so this is where the transition from 12 volt to 48 volt power distribution can reduce power loss and increase compute density. our 48 volt to core micromodules power and power system monitoring solutions are enabling this transition, and according to alphabet, this approach can improve data center energy efficiency by 30%.
all told, adi is part of the ecosystem, enabling greater efficiency in wireless and wired data capture, transmission, and of course computing, and our solutions help customers to scale their investments and build next-generation networks economically and resourcefully. so stepping back, i'm incredibly proud of the progress we've made on our mission to engineer good, but a lot remains yet to be done. we're focused on partnering with our customers to develop increasingly innovative technologies that create successful business outcomes, enrich people's lives and leave a greater impact on our world.
and so with that, i'll hand it over to prashanth.
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
thank you, vince. let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. my comments today, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, will be on an adjusted basis, which exclude special items outlined in today's press release. adi delivered a strong first quarter, with results at the high end of our outlook. revenue increased 20%, nearing an all-time high; operating margin expanded to 40.7%, in line with our long-term model; and adjusted eps grew 40%. we saw tremendous breadth this quarter with all market segments growing year-over-year, the first time in over three years, and b2b revenue increased 2% sequentially and 22% year-over-year, with double-digit growth across each end market.
industrial which represented 55% of revenue during the quarter, increased 5% sequentially and 24% year-over-year. this represented a record quarter for industrial with broad-based strength across applications, customers and geographies. specifically, demand across our automation, instrumentation and energy businesses accelerated this quarter. communications, which represented 18% of revenue during the quarter, decreased 10% sequentially but increased 16% year-over-year. both wireless and wireline revenue grew double digits, despite zero revenue from huawei this quarter. automotive, which represented 16% of revenue, increased 7% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. with the industry aggressively ramping up production, we saw double-digit year-over-year growth across all applications.
bms exhibited the highest growth, a trend we expect to continue given our growing design pipeline. and lastly, consumer, which represented 11% of revenue, increased 2% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. we saw strong growth in hearables, wearables and home entertainment. this quarter's inflection puts us on track to return to full year growth in 2021. and now for the rest of the p&l, gross margin, which is seasonally weaker in the first quarter, finished flat sequentially at 70%. we anticipate our first quarter gross margin will be the trough for the year as we benefit from a strong top line, improving utilization and capturing the majority of the ltc cost savings.
opex in the quarter was $456 million, up sequentially and year-over-year due mainly to variable compensation. op margins finished at 40.7%, above the guided midpoint. non-op expenses were $27 million and better than our outlook due to an investment gain. our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 12%. so all told, adjusted eps came in above the high end of guidance at $1.44. this included a $0.04 benefit from an investment gain that was not in our prior outlook. moving on to balance sheet and cash flow, inventory dollars increased modestly, while inventory days finished at 119, down from 121 in the fourth quarter. channel inventory as measured in weeks was flat sequentially and remained well below our seven- to eight-week target.
capex in the quarter increased to $67 million or roughly 4% of sales. we are working judiciously to add capex to meet this record demand and anticipate that capex will run slightly above our long-term target of 4% for fiscal 2021. turning to cash flow, over the trailing 12 months, we generated $1.9 billion or 33% of revenue. you'll recall that during the last year we paused our share repurchase program for a few quarters due to the pandemic and our proposed maxim acquisition. therefore, in 2020, we returned 80% of free cash flow to shareholders after debt repayments. this quarter, we've reinstated our share repurchase program, and given our current 1.5 leverage ratio we're committed to returning 100% of free cash flow for the year.
looking at the first quarter, we executed nearly $160 million of repo and we also announced an 11% increase to our quarterly dividend at $0.69 per share, which marks our 18th increase over the last 17 years. before moving on to guidance, i want to provide some context on the current state of supply. a sharper-than-expected recovery in the economy, coupled with a lean inventory backdrop, is fueling unprecedented demand for semiconductors, and putting stress on the global supply chain. while the industry at large is aggressively working to meet this historic demand, it's more than likely we will be operating in a constrained supply environment for the balance of the year.
at adi, we're confident in our ability to outperform in times like this. our flexible hybrid manufacturing model, healthy balance sheet inventory and diversified product and customer base position us well. in addition, we're working to secure additional capacity from our external partners and ramping our internal operations to increase output. now let me provide our second quarter outlook. revenue is expected to be $1.6 billion plus or minus $50 million. at the midpoint, this guidance reflects what would be record revenue.
we expect double-digit year-over-year growth for automotive, industrial and consumer markets, but we do see a decline in our comms. based on the midpoint of guidance, op margins expected to be 41% plus or min 70 bps, and our tax rate is expected to be between 11% and 13%. based on these inputs, adjusted eps will be $1.44 plus or minus $0.08. so in summary, i'm encouraged by the near-term trends we're seeing across our end markets. and while we're mindful of the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, we are optimistic that a broad-based recovery is under way. and with maxim expected to close this summer, 2021 will be a transformative year for adi.
let me now pass it back to mike to start our q&a.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
thanks, prashanth. let's go to the q&a session. we ask that you limit yourself to one question in order to allow for additional participants on the call this morning. if you have a follow-up question, please requeue and we'll take your question if time allows.
with that, cheryl, can we have our first question, please?

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from john pitzer from credit suisse. please go ahead. your line is open.
john pitzer -- credit suisse -- analyst
yeah. good morning, guys. congratulations on the solid result. vince, prashant, 90 days ago when you sort of guided for the april quarter, the key gating factor was your ability to grow supply. i'm curious as you look at the july quarter, are you still in a supply constrained environment? and i guess
more importantly, given the internal capex you're spending and your work with your foundry partners, how do we think about your ability to grow supply beyond sort of the july quarter guidance?
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, john, thanks for the question. yeah, we are constrained. we've got a very, very positive book-to-bill. but what we have forecast for the july quarter factors in all the elements of supply across silicon supply both internally, externally, as well as all the back-end operations, assembly and test. so, we feel very confident in that number. and beyond that, there is opportunity to ship more. there is more demand out there. but at least in the july quarter, we feel very comfortable with what we have forecast.
john pitzer -- credit suisse -- analyst
and how do we think about supply growth beyond july? is july a good proxy to what you should be able to do sequentially for the next couple of quarters? or are you getting a particularly strong uplift in july and things moderate going forward?
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think -- i mean, ultimately, everything will depend on demand. but we are increasing our capacity. we are getting more wafer supply in general. and we are, as prashant said in his remarks, we've been investing in capital equipment inside the company to expand our back-end operation. so, you will see sequential improvements in adi's output over the coming months. so, as prashant said, in the second half of the year, given our confidence in supply, we will have a better second half than first half.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
thanks, john.
john pitzer -- credit suisse -- analyst
helpful. thanks, vince.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
our next question?
operator
thank you. our next question comes from tore svanberg from stifel. please go ahead. your line is open.
tore svanberg -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
yes. thank you, and congratulation on the record results. prashanth, you talked about disti inventory being sort of way below the seven to eight week target. could you tell us where exactly the numbers are right now? and also, do you expect to get back to seven to eight at some point? or is this kind of like a new norm now where disti in the channel is going to be sort of running below at what it has historically?
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, tore. inventory is very lean. we entered the quarter below seven weeks and it decreased again in the quarter. so, we would like to build inventory back up. it's unlikely that that's going to happen. whatever they get their hands on, sells through immediately. so, until the supply gets improved over the coming quarters, i don't think you'll see us return to normal inventory levels in the channel. but i would say that we do maintain the view that sort of that seven to eight weeks is the right balance for us to have in the channel.
tore svanberg -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
great. thank you.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
thanks, tore.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from vivek arya from bank of america securities. please go ahead. your line is open.
vivek arya -- bank of america securities -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. vince or prashanth, i was hoping you could quantify lead times and book-to-bill and various end markets to the extent possible. where are lead times stretched the most? and importantly, what are you doing to prevent double ordering? are you implementing any firm price non-cancelable programs like your -- some of your peers are? any perspective on how do we quantify the state of supply demand imbalance? and how do we get some assurance that this will be resolved, i guess, peacefully is one word that comes to mind, i think that'll be very helpful. thank you.
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yeah. thank you, vivek. maybe just start with some comments on where demand is coming from. so, we are experiencing significant growth in demand, and it's very broad based, all of our markets. and when you rewind and think how we got here, our customers entered the pandemic with pretty lean inventories. then we had this synchronized government stimulus, both fiscal and monetary. we had very strong growth during the pandemic, consumer electronics with high use of cloud compute connectivity. we're coming out of the pandemic now with gdp driving industrial and that's driving companies to rethink both where they manufacture and upgrading the style by which they manufacture.
so, on the supply side, we've been planning for additional capacity, as vince mentioned, since late summer of 2020. and as we add capacity, our revenue forecast is increasing. and that's really what helped us deliver a better q2 guide up for q3 and feel good about q4. so i think supply will eventually match demand, but i don't see demand really going away. so, this feels -- given the secular drivers behind it, it feels that this is going to be with us for a while.
book-to-bill for the past quarter was above one and it was the same for all end market. so it's -- again very broad based, and i think it's really just a reflection of the incredible role that adi's products play across the manufacturing ecosystem.
vivek arya -- bank of america securities -- analyst
and any pricing programs that you might have put in place like your peers?
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
well, so -- i guess a few comments to make there. we are efficiently managing our orders. we're working with our customers, both large and small, across all markets to understand the demand timing and to allocate the supply based on end demand. remember that while we report on a poa basis, we actually run the business on pos. so we look through distribution to understand what's happening at customers. we've also put in a non-cancellable non-returnable for up to 90 days to help give us better visibility into the backlog, and that helps customers sort of manage what they can expect to get from us. so at this point, i would say, the focus really has been on communication. and that's the feedback i think vince as heard from customers as well. it's that what's important to them is communicating what they're going to get and when they're going to get it, so they can plan their respective downstream production requirements.
vivek arya -- bank of america securities -- analyst
thank you.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
thanks, vivek. we'll go to next question, please.
operator
and our next question comes from ambrish srivastava from bmo. please go ahead. your line is open.
ambrish srivastava -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi, thank you very much, prashanth and vince. i wanted to just to unpack the gross margin comment that you made, prashanth. excuse me, you are at the model 70% plus, and when you talk about gross margin incrementally getting better, what's the right way to think about it? and you referred to the cost savings that you will be getting from factory consolidation. is there a impact from pricing? and then kind of related to that, how are you managing the input cost, which seem to be going up across the board, versus pricing? and is that also playing a factor in the gross margin? and, sorry, related to that is, would you be building inventory as you go through the second half? thank you.
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
thanks, ambrish. do you have a few more add-ons to that? i will -- so, let me -- let's start with -- let's do a quick one on pricing. so, net impact of pricing changes are immaterial to gross margin. so, we are managing our cost increases to net those out from a net price standpoint. the gross margin lift that you're seeing really is the productivity that we're driving. so, i did say in the first quarter earnings call that that would be the bottom of gross margins for the year and we would expect sequential improvement, you're seeing that in the q2 results that printed, you see that in the guide that we've given for q3, that is coming from the manufacturing consolidation of the linear factory closure, which we have talked about and also some step up in utilization. so, that's kind of a tactical way to think about how gross margins evolve over the balance of this year.
our model remains 70%. and, i don't know, vince, if you want to give some guide on how we think about our gross margins long-term.
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. look, the root of our value creation really is innovation. we're spending over $1 billion a year. and we like to have the highest performing products out there that we got well paid for. and i think also the diversity of our product application and customer demand helps us protect margins, as we've seen through the pandemic here. so, 85% -- we've got a 125 customers -- 125,000 customers, and 85% of our sales comes from products that individually contribute less than 0.1% of our revenue or even less. so, that's the model of the company. so, there is a lot of resilience, there's a lot of optionality and resilience built into it.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
thanks, ambrish.
ambrish srivastava -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
beautiful [phonetic]. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from blayne curtis from barclays. please go ahead. your line is open.
blayne curtis -- barclays -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question, and good morning. and just kind of curious on the industrial segment. i think last quarter you talked about two to six segments being at peak, you talked about all being up in april quarter. so, just any color by segment there? and if any more of them are at record revenue? that would be helpful. thanks.
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. what we've seen -- this is a very, very highly diversified business. we saw broad growth across all the individual sectors. in fact, all applications grew double digits year-over-year and sequentially. and i believe there's a lot more upside to come, because we are in a multi-year growth cycle driven by secular trends, industry 4.0, etc. i would say, the -- we've seen really strong acceleration in the automation sector. and i think that's driven by such things as the need for onshoring more flexibility and more robust and connected supply chains.
if i just pick healthcare, it is already been a multi-year growth market for adi. and the pandemic kind of underscore the importance of information technology in managing our healthcare systems. so, we've seen an acceleration in our digital healthcare business as we began to migrate the hospital environment to the clinic and the home with point of care solutions or healthcare anywhere mentality.
and as i mentioned in the prepared remarks as well, the energy sector, with the move through renewables and this charging infrastructure that's being laid into support these electric vehicles, those are some of the areas that we're seeing strongest growth within the industrial area. but i think automation underpins it. also, i would say, i've been very pleased with the results that we're getting in the very broad bench scientific and test equipment, analytics equipment and so on. and so, it's been very, very broad.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
and, blayne, just to touch on your last point about the record applications, you're right, i think last quarter we said two or three had records. we increased that, and four of our six applications are record. so i think i echo what vince said is that we're early stages of the cycle, and yes, at some point, we expect all of our applications to be at record, probably, in the next year or so.
and with that, we can go to next question, please.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from toshiya hari from goldman sachs. please go ahead. your line is open.
toshiya hari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you for taking the question, and congrats on the strong results. vince, i had a multi-part question on your bms business. you guys talked about revenue more than doubling in the quarter. i was hoping you could speak to kind of the breadth of your customer profile there in the quarter on a year-over-year basis? and i guess, more importantly, based on some of the comments that you've made on past calls and also this call as it relates to your design win pipeline, should we expect some of these wireless bms projects to ramp in fiscal '22, or is it more fiscal '23 and beyond? and lastly, as it pertains to the combination of -- with maxim, how should we think about how your position in bms evolves over time post the combination? thank you.
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, toshi. well, first off, we are the market share leader in the electric vehicle battery management systems. and as you know, we have really two portfolios. we have the existing -- we like to call it the wired portfolio, the more traditional way of moving data from the battery system. and we've introduced a wireless version, a robust cognitive radio based wireless system. so i think the next 12 months will be driven by the traditional wired battery technology. and after that in late '22 into 2023, we'll begin to see the upsurge of the wireless battery technology, that will complement the wired.
so, what i believe will happen is today, what do we got, two, three million cars per year being produced, electric vehicles being produced, that's going to move to, we believe, somewhere 10x at least over the next seven, eight years. so, this is a multi-multi-year cycle. we are -- our bms chips today are being used in over half of the top 10 selling ev cars globally, and we're gaining share in each of those areas. today, our best position is in north america and china. and as i mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're beginning to make real tracks [phonetic] in europe as well as japan and korea. so, ultimately, if a manufacture wants the most miles per charge, they're going to turn to adi. so, that's what we are working on.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
thanks, toshiya.
toshiya hari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
go to our next question, please.
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
cheryl, we'll take our next question. cheryl?
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
cheryl, can you hear us?
operator
please go ahead, ross seymore from deutsche bank. your line is open.
ross seymore -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi, guys. can you hear me?
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yes, we can, ross.
ross seymore -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. great. glad cheryl came back. just had a couple of questions on your communications business. i guess in the tactical sense, it looked like it was better than you expected in the quarter, the april quarter. was that specific to the wired and wireless side, or was it just the supply coming on? and then more importantly, looking forward, can you give a little bit more color on what your expectations are for the wireless side? obviously, we had some difficult comms [phonetic] with what happened with huawei year-over-year, but how do we think about that returning to year-over-year growth given the second half commentary that you talked about with some ramps in north america and beyond?
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yeah, thanks. so i said in the prepared remarks that the communications business for the second quarter was really driven by very strong growth in the wired. i think it was up double digit. wireless remains lumpy. but we feel pretty good, the comms has bottomed in the second quarter and we're going to see growth in the second half, i think. and i'll let vince jump in with some of the customer conversations he has been having. but with the completion of the c-band auction, we feel very good that you're now going to see the build out of 5g for which we are the largest participant certainly in the -- with the transceiver product for both the u.s. and starting to see that in europe as well.
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, ross, what i want to mention is that, at this point in time, rest of world is three times larger than china for adi. i think that's very, very important to remember. and we're certainly seeing 5g momentum pick up on a global basis. north america, we've recently -- obviously, the c-band auction is complete, and we're beginning to see orders today that we expect will accelerate during 2022 and beyond. even in europe where there has been relethargy in upgrading their communication systems in general over the last several years, we're beginning to see signs of life in the deployment of 5g. india is also -- india has a significant government-funded program to make 5g a reality there. we're beginning to participate in trials. and last but not least is o-ran, we already have revenue as a company with rakuten, the online shopping company in japan. and we're very well positioned given our ecosystem position there to unlock potential in what is a brand new stream of revenue, particularly i think as it gets deployed into private networks for machines.
ross seymore -- deutsche bank -- analyst
perfect. prashanth, one quick clarification.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
thank you, ross. go for it.
ross seymore -- deutsche bank -- analyst
just one quick clarification from what prashanth said. double-digits in the wired, was that a year-over-year or sequential comment? thank you.
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
that would be year-over-year.
ross seymore -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
thanks, ross. next question, please.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from stacy rasgon from bernstein research. please go ahead. your line is open.
stacy rasgon -- bernstein research -- analyst
hi guys, thanks for taking my question. i actually wanted to follow up on the comm question. so, if i go back last quarter, you'd kind of talked the comm trajectory down a bit and it was at china statement. so i just want to clarify, is that -- it doesn't sound like that's changed, it does sound like the uptick you're seeing right now is outside of china, u.s., europe, india. i guess, is that correct? i guess, why didn't you see that uptick 90 days ago -- expectations for that uptick 90 days ago versus today? and then what are your broad thoughts on 5g rollout in china going forward from here? how does that -- how does the rest of that play out given all the dynamics that are happening there?
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, i think first and foremost, china's opportunistic for adi at this point. we will sell, i think, a lots of components, and therefore, it is more opportunistic. prashanth, you can talk about the specifics.
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yeah. i think, stacy, we have always said that we expected 5g deployments in north america to come next and be followed by europe. when we gave you the commentary for the -- leading into the second quarter, we were focused on the pause in china. but we have seen now the auctions are complete, and particularly, verizon being much more public about what they are -- what they intend to do in the 5g space, as vince mentioned, orders are starting to come in for that. so, the trajectory for communications or for wireless specifically, it's going to be up in the second half.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
thanks, stacy.
stacy rasgon -- bernstein research -- analyst
thank you.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
can we go to our last question, please?
operator
thank you. and our last question comes from william stein from truist securities. please go ahead. your line is opened.
william stein -- truist securities -- analyst
great. thanks so much for squeezing me in. guys, i'd like to ask about the cost function. we have two potential looming problems. i think one is inflation broadly, not just materials, potentially labor as well. and then on the opex side, the return to work face-to-face sort of operations suggest maybe we start spending on travel and things like that. and i wonder if you can comment as to how we might sensitize our models to these factors? thank you.
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
so, let me take the inflation piece first. so, i think it was ambrish who asked the question, and we are seeing cost increases from our supply base, but we feel that we're guiding margins, on a net basis, are going to be neutral for that, because we are where we can pushing that price first. so, i'm not as concerned about the inflation side. we have been very mindful of the labor side. and i would say that the data we're seeing is that it's taking us about a week longer than normal to fill jobs at the factory level. so, our u.s. factories are facing a little bit longer time to fill jobs, but it's not anywhere as dramatic as what we're hearing in the media in terms of filling these high paying manufacturing jobs.
and then for return to office, that is something we spend a lot of time on -- there is no doubt that there will be some return to travel. i think it's -- i think that's going to be universal across all companies. but more specifically to how adi is thinking about return to office, maybe, i'll let vince talk about how we're thinking about that.
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, we've instituted three day per week policy to start with here at adi for those who have been working remotely, and we will see where things go from there. but my sense is on the opex side of things, we will probably not get back to per capita travel spend, entertainment spend, and so on and so forth.
the other thing i'll remind you, will, is that we work relentlessly at the company on taking costs out of the business. so, we work hard on cost of goods, we work hard on making the business efficient below the cost of goods line as well. so, inflation is nothing new. we'll see how it moves over the next -- if we see an acceleration in inflation, then we'll figure out what actions to take.
william stein -- truist securities -- analyst
so, we shouldn't be modeling some step-up cost function in opex related to travel and such activities? i know there's some increase you've already guided to for i think bonuses and such, but for travel now?
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think that's true. and when do you look at the expenses today, our opex is laden with some very rich bonus payouts, because the business in terms of growth and profitability is doing very, very well. but we will -- overtime, i expect that the growth will moderate and the bonuses will also moderated.
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
will, maybe i can wrap up by saying, we're expecting second half revenue to be strong. we indicated, the second half gross margins are going to continue to increase, which is going to give you incredible leverage, and therefore there is no reason you won't see a meaningful lift in op margins as each quarter rolls out. so -- and all of that is going to translate into more cash flow, which we will have available to deploy since we're not doing any further debt reduction that's coming back to shareholders.
william stein -- truist securities -- analyst
okay. thank you so much.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
thanks, will. and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. a copy of the transcript will be available on our website. all our reconciliations will also be there. you can also find our new csr reported that vince outlined in his script on our analog investor relations homepage.

operator
good morning, and welcome to the analog devices second quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web.
i'd now like to introduce your host for today's call, mr. michael lucarelli, senior director of investor relations. sir, the floor is yours.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
thank you, cheryl, and good morning, everybody. thanks for joining our second quarter of fiscal 2021 call.
with me on the call today are adi's ceo, vincent roche; and adi's cfo, prashanth mahendra-rajah. for anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com.
now on to the disclosures. the information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as further described in our earnings release and our most recent 10-q and other periodic reports and materials filed with the sec. actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking information as these statements reflect our expectations only as the date of this call. we undertake no obligation to update these statements except as required by law.
our comments today will also include non-gaap financial measures, which excludes special items. when comparing our results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. reconciliations of these non-gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measures and additional information about our non-gaap measures are included in today's earnings release.
and with that, i'll turn it over to adi's ceo, vincent roche. vince?
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, mike, and good morning to you all.
so, i'm very pleased to share with you that we delivered record revenue and earnings in the second quarter, exceeding the high end of our outlook. the strength was driven by our disciplined operational execution and our ability to capture the value presented as our solutions become more vital in the modern digital economy.
the supply and demand dynamics in our industry have been well publicized. broadly speaking, the economic recovery has materialized faster and stronger than initially anticipated, placing unprecedented stress on supply chains globally. late last year, adi moved with speed and agility, proactively making capital investments to add capacity, positioning us to navigate this disruption and better serve our customers. that said, we like many others in the industry will face a supply constrained environment through the balance of 2021. despite this backdrop, we are positioned for a strong second half as our continued capital investments are aligned with robust demand.
moving to a summary of our results. revenue was $1.66 billion, increasing 26% year-over-year. the strength was broad based, highlighted by record quarters for our industrial and automotive markets. gross margin expanded to nearly 71%, and operating margin to approximately 42%. adjusted eps of $1.54 increased 43% year-over-year. over the trailing 12 months, we generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow. this equates to a record 36% free cash flow margin, maintaining our position in the top 10% of the s&p 500. so overall, i'm very proud how the adi team executed this quarter to deliver these impressive results.
at adi, innovation is the root of how we generate value. and to maintain our virtuous cycle of innovation-driven success, we invest more than $1 billion in r&d annually. this commitment, coupled with the diversity of our business across customers, products and applications, positions us to deliver long-term profitable growth. now, let me share a few customer highlights with you.
adi solutions are embedded across the electrification ecosystem from developing and managing the vehicle battery to the distribution and storage across the digital grid. with the rapid shift to evs, we're seeing new and increasing investments in battery manufacturing capacity. this quarter, we secured a design win with the supplier of one of the world's top battery producers. our innovative solution reduces system cost by half by integrating all measurement, control and diagnostics functions. and our portfolio of wired and wireless bms provides unmatched accuracy to deliver market-leading vehicle range, as we grow and diversify our bms business. this quarter, we added volvo as well as three additional large auto manufacturers, including a prominent luxury brand in europe and two leading brands in asia.
moving on to energy infrastructure, here, energy storage systems are required to make renewable energy a reality, and to build the charging infrastructure to support ev proliferation. our precision signal chain, power management and bms portfolios deliver the level of accuracy necessary to ensure consistent supply across the digital grid. we've design wins at more than 80% of the top customers, from traditional energy and industrial companies to new entrants.
another area of increasing importance for adi's connectivity, which, of course, is becoming more pervasive across demographics and industries, presenting new opportunities for us. for example, in our communications business, we announced a complete radio platform for the 5g o-ran ecosystem. this radio platform builds on our market leading integrated transceiver position by expanding into the digital front-end. our full system solution enables significant size and performance improvements while reducing customers' design cycles. o-ran represents a new vector of growth in the communications market by enabling new entrants and applications such as private networks that support connected factories. in addition to partnerships with intel and marvell, we are working with key carriers and system integrators to enable this ecosystem.
in our space business, our beamforming solution will be used in telesat's lightspeed leo satellite constellation, schedule to launch in late 2023. this win speaks to the breadth and depth of our rf portfolio and domain expertise at adi, which is supporting the adoption broadly of leo communications satellites.
additionally, we continued to have strong design momentum across our diversified industrial market, the largest, stickiest and most profitable business at adi. over the years, we've established a heritage of providing the most precise and efficient solutions required by our factory automation customers. i believe we're at a tipping point in industrial 4.0, as customers are looking to add sensing, edge processing and connectivity to make supply chains more robust, more efficient and flexible.
we recently won an ultra high frequency wireless solution at a key automation company. our solution is being used in advanced robotic systems to reduce downtime and costs. on the wired side, customers are beginning to upgrade to deterministic ethernet to ensure machines are constantly conducted and monitored. this quarter, we secured numerous design wins for our robust ethernet solution, including two of the largest european industrial machine manufacturers.
we recently hosted a deep dive on our instrumentation and test business. this is truly a performance-driven market that requires adi's most advanced technology and solutions, making it a great fit for our high-performance precision signal chain power and rf portfolios. our broad diverse instrumentation business, comprised of automated test equipment, electronic test and measurement, and scientific instruments, is aligned with all secular growth trends across our industry. the increase in complexity of these applications is driving the need for solutions with more advanced technology capabilities. as a result, we expect to [indecipherable] to increase by over 20% in the next five years.
now, these examples represent only a fraction of the incredible work across adi. our team is partnering with our customers every day to develop increasingly innovative technologies that not only creates successful business outcomes, but also enrich people's lives and leave a greater impact on our world. to that end, i wanted to share an exciting updates on how we are leveraging innovation to advance our mission of engineering good.
in april, we launched an innovation accelerator with the woods hole oceanographic institution. as part of this program, we'll be combining adi's engineers and technologies with whoi's science and technology platforms to continuously monitor critical oceanographic conditions. this effort supports our overall climate agenda, which includes our commitments to achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050. we also published our 2020 corporate responsibility report last week, which provides additional information on how our technologies will continue to play a major role in improving our standard of living, while protecting our planetary health.
so, in closing, the last year has underscored semiconductors as the bedrock of the modern digital economy and information age are increasingly important to accelerating digitalization across all industries. we're encouraged by our results this quarter and the momentum in our pipeline sets the stage for continued profitable growth in the years ahead.
so with that, i'll hand you over to prashanth, who will take you through the financial details.
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
thank you, vince. good morning, and let me add my welcome to our second quarter earnings call.
my comment today with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which exclude special items outlined in today's press release.
adi delivered a record second quarter, as revenue, operating margin and eps finished above the high end of our outlook. as i mentioned last quarter, upside to our second quarter outlook would be predicated on our ability to increase production. and thanks to early strategic investments in capacity, as well as strong execution by our manufacturing operations team, we did just that.
now, let's look at performance by end market. industrial represented 59% of revenue and increased 14% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. this quarter marks the second consecutive all-time high for industrial. we saw strength across all applications and geographies with all sub-segments growing double-digits sequentially and year-over-year.
communications represented 17% of revenue, fell slightly sequentially and was flat year-over-year. wireline increased double digits year-over-year, which balanced softness in wireless. as we outlined in the last call, 5g built have been muted year-to-date, however, we anticipate momentum to pick up as 5g deployments broaden globally in the second half of this year, especially in north america now that the c-band auction is complete.
automotive represented 16% of revenue and increased 5% sequentially and 42% year-over-year. again, we saw double-digit growth across every major application as industry production has picked up notably from a year ago. bms grew the fastest, more than doubling year-over-year.
and lastly, consumer decreased 12% sequentially in the seasonally weaker second quarter and represented 9% of revenue. importantly, consumer grew 8% year-over-year, positioning us to deliver growth in fiscal '21.
now, covering the rest of the p&l. gross margin finished just under 71%, up 90 basis points sequentially and 320 basis points year-over-year on higher utilization and better product mix. we expect additional gross margin expansion in the second half, as we realize savings from the consolidation of our manufacturing operations. opex in the quarter was $484 million, up sequentially and year-over-year. merit increases went into effect during the second quarter and we also recorded higher variable comp due to the strong results. this netted operating margin of 41.7%. non-op expenses were $44 million, down nearly 10% from the prior year, driven by lower interest expense. our tax rate was approximately 12%. and all-in adjusted eps of $1.54 exceeded the high end of our outlook and marks an all-time high.
now, moving onto the balance sheet. relative to the first quarter, inventory dollars increased $23 million to a record $641 million. this increase was driven entirely by raw material and work in process, as we ramp utilization to better meet the strong customer demand. days of inventory were relatively unchanged at 118. weeks of channel inventory finished lower sequentially once again, and due to the strong sell-through at our distis, we anticipate remaining below our seven to eight week target through the end of the year. capex for the quarter was $59 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $127 million or more than double compared to the second half of 2020. we expect to continue to increase capital investments and for capex to trend above our long-term model of 4% this year.
turning to cash flow, we generated $2.2 billion over the trailing 12 months, which equates to a record 36% free cash flow margin. and over the same period, we returned approximately 75% of free cash flow after debt repayments via dividends and repos. this is below our long-term target as we paused our buyback program, given the pandemic uncertainty and the pending maxim deal. we ended the second quarter with $1.3 billion of cash and equivalents on our balance sheet and our net leverage is now 1.3 on a trailing 12. we're comfortable with the leverage and do not plan to reduce debt. as such, we remain committed to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders.
so, let me finish up with our third quarter outlook. revenue is expected to be $1.7 billion, plus or minus $70 million, up sequentially as additional capacity comes online. this is in line with seasonality after a very strong q2. at the midpoint, we expect each of our b2b markets to increase slightly sequentially and consumer to be up low double digits. based on the midpoint of guide, op margin is expected to be 42.5%, plus or minus 100 bps. and our tax rate is expected to fall between 11% and 13%. based on these inputs, adjusted eps is expected to be $1.61, plus or minus $0.11.
so in summary, adi delivered a very strong quarter, highlighted by record revenue, earnings and free cash flow conversion. importantly, bookings and backlog remained very strong, and we're continuing to invest to increase production for the balance of the year, giving us great confidence that our second half will be stronger than our first.
we've also made meaningful progress toward closing the maxim acquisition. shortly after the deal closes, we are going to hold a conference call to provide an update regarding our capital return plans. as a reminder, once combined, we anticipate having more than $3 billion of cash and a leverage ratio well below one.
let me now pass it back to mike for the q&a.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
thanks, prashant. let's go to the q&a session. we ask that you limit yourself to one question in order to allow for additional participants on the call this morning. if you have a follow-up question, please requeue, and we'll take questions if time allows.
with that, cheryl, can we have our first question, please?

[operator instructions] your first question is from vivek arya of bank of america securities.
vivek arya -- bank of america securities -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. vince, you mentioned demand far exceed supply. i was hoping if you could help us quantify that. are you under shipping by 5%, 10%, how much of a demand question does adi have right now? and kind of part b of that is how much incremental capacity are you planning to bring online in the next year? and is that kind of a proxy for what kind of sales growth we should be looking at? thank you.
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, vivek. so demand continues to grow across our markets. all end markets are up. and our book-to-bill was above 1.2. supply is also expanding. we grew 4% sequentially in the third quarter. and we're -- at the midpoint, we're going to be up another 3% for the fourth quarter. so you look at that math and it says the supply demand gap is growing or said another way backlog is increasing quarter-over-quarter, and it now extends well into 2022. our view is, this gap is likely to persist into calendar year '22, given the long lead time it takes to add supply in the industry plus just the broad strength of the demand.
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yeah, i think the second part of that question, vivek, i will just add a little bit of color. so, we're layering in investments in capex to support our growth objective, so particularly on the back-end of our operations, assembly and tests. and we need this capital now to meet the -- meet the demand, but also in the longer term, we're very, very optimistic about the tailwinds in -- right across our business from automation to electrification, connectivity and so on and so forth. so the outlook we've just given you is supply feasible, and it is certainly the governor i would say right now on revenue for the company.
vivek arya -- bank of america securities -- analyst
thank you.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
thanks, vivek. go to next question, please.

your next question is from tore svanberg of stifel.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
yes, thank you. i was hoping you could just elaborate a little bit more on the maxim merger. you said that you still expect it to happen within the time frame you had announced, but i believe you had said the summer of 2021, correct me if that was wrong. and related to that is, again, china, the only remaining obstacle before you can close the deal?
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
yes, thanks, tore. so look, our confidence of the closing remains unchanged. and as we said in the prepared comments, our discussions with the chinese regulatory authorities have been productive -- positive and productive. and we are working toward closing within the initial time frame. so china is the only outstanding regulatory approval need at this point in time. and i will remind you as well that all of the other regulatory bodies across the globe have approved our deal without condition, without remedies.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
great. thank you for that, vince.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
thanks, tore. go to next question.
operator
your next question is from john pitzer of credit suisse.
john pitzer -- credit suisse -- analyst
yeah, good morning, guys. thanks for letting me ask the question. vince, i want to pick up on your prepared comments about your industrial business. you're now going in the third consecutive quarter of sort of record revenues in that business. you have to go back to i think april of '18 before -- which was the last peak, but the year-to-date -- fiscal year to date, that business is up about 30% year-over-year. and for a lot of investors, their concern that perhaps that represents more cyclical excess than sort of structural sustainability. and so, i'm kind of curious as you break apart your industrial business, what do you think is being driven by the quote-unquote cycle versus stuff that's a little bit more sustainable?
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, john. i think first and foremost, i'd like to remind everybody that adi's industrial business is built on a foundation of many individual market segments like automation, instrumentation that i talked about, healthcare, our space business and energy as it moves to renewables and charging infrastructure, for example, the whole need for grid efficiency and stabilization. so that's the foundation. it's a highly diverse business. we've got many tens of thousands of customers. and the life cycles in the business are kind of 15 years plus. and it's a very, very, very sticky sort of sockets that we've got.
so those of you who followed adi for a long time, remember we -- about a decade ago, we fairly dramatically increased our focus in terms of r&d, go-to-market activities, and ensuring that we could really grow that business. the last few years have shown that we've been gaining market share across the board there. so i think there is a certain amount, john, of -- there were a lot of programs that were stalled last year. so there is a certain amount of catch-up there, but i do think that the breadth of the portfolio that we now have, the investments we've been making in terms of customer engagement, r&d activities, and the secular trends that we've got, all these concurrent secular drivers are propelling that business beyond the market.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
yeah, i'll add one thing, john. you're right. as we said in prepared comments, all our markets did increase double digits year-over-year. of our six applications that vince outlined, two are still below pre-peak levels. we do think fiscal '21 marks a record for all of them, and we don't see why they won't hit another record in '22. i'm giving the strong trends that vince outlined. and with that, we'll go to our next question.
operator
your next question is from stacy rasgon of bernstein research.
stacy rasgon -- bernstein research -- analyst
hi guys. thanks for taking my questions. i had a question on the pricing environment. given just the tight supply and the shortage situation, we're starting to see some hints of some of your peers starting to take prices up. and i was curious what you guys are seeing in the pricing environment. are you seeing that? are you able to actually do that, or are you trading your own pricing environment more conservatively?
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yeah, thanks for the question, stacy. so, i would say that for the results that we printed, pricing is our net neutral. we're passing on cost increase, so that we're not impacting margins. but we've made a decision not to take advantage of our customers by structurally increasing pricing in this environment. our long-term model is unchanged, and that is 70%-plus. so, the goal really is to drive the revenue growth and make the trade-offs that are necessary to drive that revenue growth, focusing on delivering on the op margin and the free cash flow. so you'll see on a -- if you back out the ip license impact, we had a 71.2% gross margin in the third quarter. and while we don't guide to gross margins, if you impute it from the guide that we give you -- gave you, fourth quarter is going to be a -- probably be a record for adi in terms of gross margins.
stacy rasgon -- bernstein research -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. thank you.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
thanks, stacy. next question.
operator
your next question is from toshiya hari of goldman sachs.
toshiya hari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi guys. good morning. thanks for taking the question. i wanted to ask about the comms business. vince, you talked about 2022 being a growth year. and you talked about north america, europe and korea being the key drivers for you guys going forward. how should we think about the shape of the recovery going forward? is it going to be a fairly gradual recovery? could it be sort of a v-shaped recovery over the next couple of quarters? and when you talk about return to growth in '22, what sort of implicit assumptions are you making for china? thank you.
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
okay, thanks. we're going to split that into two. let me just quickly talk about what happened, and then i'll let vince speak to it kind of more broadly. so in the second quarter, as a reminder, we did call the bottom on comms, and so that we would grow on a sequential basis. we delivered that in the third quarter, and we are on track to deliver that for the fourth quarter. so, we believe we're really well-positioned for strong growth into fiscal '22.
and between kind of the two sub-segments there, wired demand remains strong, and we expect that to continue as both carriers and data centers continue to do the upgrades to their networks. and wireless, while it's always lumpy, growth in the past quarter was really driven by rest of the world, north america. we do think china bottomed in the third quarter, so that should also represent some growth momentum for us, as we go forward. and then, i'll hand off to vince to kind of speak more broadly about what we're seeing.
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
yes. toshi, why do i have the confidence i have about '22 being a strong growth here? so maybe i can unpack that a bit for you. so i think our comms revenue mix is seeing a benefit from the rest of world beginning to emerge in 5g. so today, rest of world, outside of china, is 3x in terms of tam [phonetic]. so that's number 1.
if you look at then the geographies, north america, the auction -- the c-band auction is complete. revenue is really just beginning here. and all the indications are that 5g revenue here will accelerate in 2022 and indeed beyond.
europe, i would say a step behind, but we're beginning to see good signs of life in that region, and -- but i think it will be more a late 2022 driver. we've talked several times on various calls here about oran what's happening, but we're beginning to see revenue. we've talked before, the rakuten in japan. that business continues to accelerate. and european carriers are looking right now to make it also an important part of their 5g offering. i mentioned during the prepared remarks as well that vodafone is a major player there, and we happen to be very well represented in their systems.
and i'm also having conversations with customers about the use of 5g and oran beyond the classical consumer market. so, it's early days, but the characteristics of flexibility, scalability, quicker time to market, cost savings, and so on is enabling private networks to be configured in factory environments for example. so that's all still on the comm, but that gives you a sense for our confidence in 2022 and beyond.
toshiya hari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
thanks, toshiya. we will go to the next question.
operator
your next question is from ambrish srivastava of bmo.
ambrish srivastava -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. thank you. good morning, folks. i had a question on maxim. and so, my investment case for adi has not been maxim and you have a very sticky shareholder base who have been with you before maxim, but i get this question a lot. so i think it's a fair question to ask. if maxim was not to go through, what you think about capital allocation? do you then go back to the playbook and say you would be changing how you think about capital allocation, or you would continue on the m&a path and look at other opportunities? thank you.
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
so, ambrish, let's do this. let me just remind everyone what the capital allocation policy is today because i think that we have a very shareholder-friendly capital allocation policy, which is that first call is really to invest in the business and that although not a traditional definition, we do consider that organically kind of how we spend our r&d and that is heavily pointed toward the b2b markets. and then we think about inorganic really more, as it helps the technology portfolio or finds other ways to help us become more important to customers. but our commitment is to return 100% of free cash flow to customers.
so, we are -- we're at a 1.2 level leverage today. we do not need to reduce debt. so on a -- in an environment -- despite the confidence that we have in the maxim deal closing, in an environment where that was not to have happened, would not look for us to really be changing that view of having all our incremental free cash flow go into the return to shareholders either through buyback or through dividend. and as a reminder, i think over the past three years, we've averaged about a 10% increase in our dividend. so, a very healthy commitment for our fixed income-focused investors as well as the -- as well as the repo. i think we're on track this year for an all-time high in terms of our repo activity.
back to the m&a, i'm going to hand that one to vince to talk more about the alternatives there.
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
yes, so as you know, you've seen over the years, we've always acquired very, very high-quality assets. and that will remain to be our view on things in the years ahead as well.
ambrish srivastava -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay, thank you.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
thanks, ambrish. next caller.
operator
your next question is from blayne curtis of barclays.
blayne curtis -- barclays -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking the question. just curious on if you look at the b2b guidance, it's fairly flat, as i think industrial probably is flat, given the segment [phonetic] guidance you gave. so i'm just kind of curious as you look at this, obviously, you had strong comments on the bookings, is that gap really supply, or are you starting to see demand trend start to settle out at this level?
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
that is purely supply. i think i mentioned in maybe the first or second question that book to bill for the quarter was over 1.2 and that's across all markets. so, we're seeing very strong interest in products across all markets. mike indicated in one of the other q&as that they were likely to have the industrial market hit an all-time high collectively for fiscal year '21 and expect that to continue to be on track to another record in fy '22, so very much a supply constrained environment.
blayne curtis -- barclays -- analyst
thanks. and i just wanted to follow-up on the gross margin, prashanth. so you indicated the gross margin will be up. and i think that's with the license impact as well. so you saw a benefit from the linear. i was curious how much more there is of that as a benefit, and then maybe just talk about utilizations and other pulls in gross margin as you look over the next couple of quarters?
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yes, so i presume you're asking kind of with respect to the guidance. so in the fourth quarter, we -- and we're not guiding gross margins, but we're pretty confident we're going to hit a new record for gross margins that is coming from the ltc synergies. we're continue -- i think we hit the final phase of closing down the manufacturing operation in california. we still have an opportunity as soon as the supply environment allows us to get some additional savings out of asia because we haven't closed that facility yet because we have no time to ship the tools to their new location.
utilization is also going to provide some level of increase. i would say mix is a bit of a headwind into the fourth quarter. and fourth quarters typically have some level of challenges in terms of -- in terms of holiday shutdown, so we need to -- we need to manage through that which can provide a little bit of a headwind for us as well that we got to work ourselves around.
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
the foundation for our gross margins being where they are, the number 1, innovation. we produce the best performing -- the best performing solutions between the physical and digital worlds. and we get a premium. we get very, very well paid for doing that. also, the diversity of our product and customer portfolios 125,000 customers with i think i've said this before, 85% of our sales come from products that individually contribute less than 0.1%. and the pricing environment, as we said earlier in the call, has been very, very stable, very steady.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
thanks, blayne, for that two-part, one-part question. we'll go to the next caller, please.
operator
your next question is from harlan sur of jp morgan.
harlan sur -- jp morgan -- analyst
good morning, and congratulations on the strong results in quarterly execution. channel inventories continue to remain below your target seven- to eight-week range. you guys can also monitor direct customer inventories, at least for those that are on consignment programs [phonetic]. any signs that customers have been able to build inventories. i mean it seems unlikely because the entire value chain appears to be sort of hand to mouth from a chip supply perspective, but wanted to get your views and when do you believe customers will be in a position to start to build back inventories? i'm assuming the soonest is sometime in calendar '22, but wanted to get your views as well.
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yeah. thank you, harlan. i'll take that. so first, a couple of comments on inventory. inventory on our balance sheet is up year-over-year and sequentially, but that is exclusively due to raw materials and width [phonetic]. we can't keep a finished good in stock. so when it's produced, it either goes to the customer or goes into the channel, and then it goes out of the channel immediately. so we are struggling to build finished goods inventory both in adi warehouses, as well as in our channel partners.
roughly, well, let's say, a significant amount of our auto business is on consignment, which gives us good visibility for that direct business as to what's happening there. and that is also we are seeing that demand kind of pull-through pretty quickly and no opportunity for those auto customers to build the inventory within their warehouses, but that's on our book. so, it's still very much hand to mouth and the focus that we have, as we've talked throughout this call and in the prepared remarks, is on increasing our capacity or ability to supply by making some significant investments in capacity. i don't see this balance coming into some sense of normalcy until sometime in calendar year '22.
harlan sur -- jp morgan -- analyst
all right. thank you.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
all right. we'll have our last question, please.
operator
your next question is from william stein of truist securities.
william stein -- truist securities -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. prashanth, you just talked about inventory not coming to some level of ability to rebuild anytime until sometime in '22. you talked about the supply/demand balance lasting well into '22, what point [phonetic] to book to bill, etc.? would we look out to the next quarter, the january quarter, typically that's a sequentially down quarter in automotive, industrial, consumer and for the whole business as well. but given these supply constraints of this very significant backlog, should we think about that seasonality as different in the coming year? should we expect maybe some visibility to sequential growth for the next several quarters? thank you.
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yeah, i think the way to answer that would be say that seasonality in today's environment is a bit of a meaningless concept because revenue growth is really dictated completely by supply. so the print for q1 is likely to be driven by what more capacity we can get online between the fourth -- over the fourth quarter to allow us. again, now we've got a couple of things we need to work through in the first quarter that would be a little bit of an offset in first. there is the holiday season, so we do need to adjust factory capacity for that. and consumer, fourth quarter is kind of the key quarter for consumer. that is when they build for the holiday season. so, there is always going to be a little bit of seasonality impact for consumer just because of the -- they don't need it in the first quarter -- our fiscal first quarter, as that is the holiday period. so maybe that's kind of where i'll finish.
mike, anything you want to add to that?
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
yes, sure. so i guess if we look back, you're right. i mean we talked about seasonality not being as meaningful now, but just to give you a bit of a history lesson, if you look past -- over the past 10 years, you're right, our b2b markets i would say in good times, which i would call now good times is usually flat to down slightly in 1q and consumer, i would say, good and even kind of normal times down 5%, maybe more in 1q.
and with that, i want to thank everyone for joining the call this morning. a copy of the transcript will be available on our website, and all reconciliations and additional information can also be found in the quarter results section. thanks again for joining and your continued interest in adi.

good morning, and welcome to the analog devices third quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web.
i'd now like to introduce your host for today's call, mr. michael lucarelli, senior director of investor relations. sir, the floor is yours.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
thank you, shelby, and good morning, everybody. thanks for joining our third quarter fiscal 2021 conference call. with me on the call today are adi's ceo, vincent roche; and adi's cfo, prashanth mahendra-rajah. for anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com.
now on to the disclosures. the information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as further described in our earnings release and our most recent 10-q and other periodic reports and materials filed with the sec. actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking information, as these statements reflect our expectations only as the date of this call. we undertake no obligation to update these statements, except as required by law.
our comments today will also include non-gaap financial measures, which exclude special items. when comparing our results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. reconciliations of these non-gaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap measures and additional information about our non-gaap measures are included in today's earnings release.
and with that, i'll turn it over to adi's ceo, vincent roche. vince?
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, mike, and very good morning to everybody. so, adi delivered a second consecutive quarter of record revenue and earnings. despite the challenging supply environment, our strong performance was driven by continued operational excellence and insatiable demand as semiconductors power the modern digital age.
broadly speaking, the economic recovery continues to take shape with demand still far exceeding supply. we, like many others in our industry, will face a constrained supply environment into 2022. despite this backdrop, our business continues to achieve record results as our investments and design wins over the last few years are matched with strong demand across our end markets. so looking ahead, the combination of robust bookings, lean inventories, and ongoing capacity additions position adi to close fiscal '21 on a high note and continue to grow in the next year.
so moving to our third quarter results. revenue was $1.76 billion, up 21% year-over-year. all markets increased sequentially, with industrial and automotive once again achieving records. gross margin expanded to over 71%, and operating margin over 43%. adjusted eps of $1.72 increased 27% year-over-year. despite elevated capital spending to increase our capacity, free cash flow over the trailing 12 months was $2.2 billion. this equates to a 34% free cash flow margin, maintaining our position in the top 10% of the s&p 500. so overall, i'm very pleased with our performance and our team's outstanding execution.
as you know at adi, our ethos of innovation and deep customer engagements ensure that we stay ahead of what's possible. we invest more than $1 billion annually in r&d, focused on strengthening our core franchises and capturing market opportunities presented by secular growth factors, which have accelerated in the economic recovery.
now let me share some recent highlights with you. our industrial business is our most diverse segment across customers, products and applications and features sticky long product life cycles. our largest industrial segment, instrumentation and test, is comprised of automated test equipment, electronic test and measurement, and scientific instruments. this is truly a performance-driven market that aligns perfectly to our high-performance precision signal chain, power management and rf portfolios.
importantly, instrumentation and test is aligned with all secular growth trends from connectivity to evs to sustainability. the growing technology complexity of these applications requires more testers with more advanced performance capabilities. today, adi is the leader in communications tests, and we're collaborating with keysight for example to advance the development of oran solutions. this partnership will enable the fastest path for designing cost-effective and power-efficient radio units. looking ahead, we are already beginning to partner with our customers to test emerging 6g technologies.
our innovations in the instrumentation market also have a positive impact on human and planetary health. one particular area is our environmental monitoring business, where there is an increased need for highly reliable and accurate instruments to improve the standard of living globally. our market-leading portfolio of precision converters enables 10 times greater measurement resolution of fine particulate matter, better identifying trace pollutions.
the next largest industrial segment is factory automation. over the last year, many of our customers are rethinking their factory floors and supply chains to make them more resilient, cost-effective and flexible through automation and connectivity. to achieve this, our customers will further automate their businesses with intelligent and connected factories and increase their use of robots and cobots.
specifically, cobots require adi's precision signal chain and power franchises, sensing technologies, and robust wired and wireless connectivity. this new vector of growth increases our sam opportunity by three times that of a traditional robot. to that end, our precision motion control business is on track for a record year of design wins, including a recent win at a leading japanese robotics company for its next-generation cobots. in addition, we are leveraging our domain knowledge and system-level expertise in a collaboration with universal robots to design smaller, smarter and easier-to-use robots that help scale tasks safely and transform workforces.
well, turning now to our communications business. 5g is beginning to broaden globally, especially in north america, as carriers look to deploy newly acquired c-band spectrum and oran continues to gain momentum also, with several of the largest european carriers setting ambitious 2025 oran deployment targets. this includes vodafone, where our technologies are very well represented.
this quarter, we extended our market-leading position in 5g radio solutions with the introduction of the industry's first software-defined transceiver that includes a fully integrated digital front end. our innovative radio architecture greatly improves power efficiency, thereby reducing radio weight, size and carrier expenses. this high level of integration eliminates fpgas to simplify implementation and facilitate the proliferation of these emerging oran networks. our next-generation transceiver platform is already designed in at a major tier 1 global supplier that is gaining share in these 5g and oran deployments across north america as well as europe.
stepping back, we expect our communications business to return to growth in 2022. we have strong design momentum and our geographic mix has shifted with north america, europe and korea representing our largest sources of revenue.
moving now on to automotive. over the last two years, we've realigned our business to focus on electrification and in-cabin human experience. we're seeing the benefits of this strategy, as we continue to scale our market leadership in battery management, power management, audio systems and connectivity.
starting firstly with our battery management systems, or bms. our wired and wireless portfolios provide unmatched accuracy to deliver market-leading vehicle range and can measure all key battery chemistries, including zero-cobalt lfp. additionally, our solutions incorporate asil d functional safety and an ultra-low power continuous monitoring feature that ensures the battery remains stable even while parked, which is the first in the market.
in addition, this quarter marked the first time we recognized revenue for our wireless bms solution, as general motors prepares to ship its first of 30 ev models powered by the ultium battery platform. and this is just the beginning for this groundbreaking bms technology, as oems realized the power of wireless data in scaling their fleets.
turning to audio systems and connectivity, as complexity continues to increase. there is very strong demand for our market-leading audio systems with signal processing, a2b connectivity, and active road noise cancellation. our solutions offer the highest fidelity performance in the market, while reducing vehicle weight, removing nearly 100 pounds per vehicle. during the quarter, two leading oems adopted a2b and a top 3 european vehicle manufacturer implemented a2b as its audio connectivity standard across its entire fleet.
in total, a2b is now designed in over 30 oems, including 18 of the top 20 global automotive companies. furthermore, interest in our active road noise cancellation feature continues to intensify. we are designed in at nine oems, up from five just a year ago, including hyundai and a leading ev manufacturer. this added capability can more than double the value of our a2b solution.
in all, these are just a few of the countless examples of the tremendous work underway at adi. we remain focused on delivering breakthrough innovations to stay ahead of our customers' needs.
so in closing, i have never been more confident about adi's future. over the last decade, we've built an industry-leading portfolio with unparalleled breadth and depth of capabilities that's aligned with more profitable end markets and our portfolio and leadership position will only get stronger with the acquisition of maxim, enabling us to deliver strong returns in the years to come.
and so with that, i'll hand you over to prashanth.
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
thank you, vince. good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. my comments today, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.
adi delivered exceptional third quarter results, underpinned by our ability to increase production. revenue and eps reached all-time highs for the second straight quarter with continued gross and operating margin expansion.
if we look at performance by end market, industrial represented 57% of revenue and increased 3% sequentially and 29% year-over-year. notably, this business surpassed $1 billion of quarterly revenue for the first time. we experienced broad-based strength across applications and geographies. all sub-segments increased double digits year-over-year, except healthcare, given the elevated pandemic demand a year ago.
communications represented 16% of revenue and decreased 21% year-over-year, while up 4% sequentially with growth in both wireless and wireline. as we outlined last quarter, we believe our communications revenue has bottomed and will continue to grow as 5g deployments broaden globally, especially in north america.
automotive represented 16% of revenue and increased 13% sequentially and 80% year-over-year. strength was broad based with double-digit growth across every major application. bms and a2b remain our fastest-growing applications and both are on track to nearly double in size this year. as vince shared earlier, adi has been strategically pivoting resources to focus more aggressively on electrification and the in-cabin human experience. as part of this strategy, we are licensing select radar ip to a large european tier 1 auto supplier. this resulted in immediate revenue recognition of $24 million in the quarter.
consumer represented 10% of revenue and increased 16% both sequentially and year-over-year. our strategy to diversify and grow this business in fiscal '21 is working, as strength across home entertainment, hearables and wearables more than offset a decline in portables.
and now moving to the p&l. gross margin expanded sequentially and year-over-year, finishing at 71.6%, mainly due to the cost savings from the ltc manufacturing optimization and the ip license agreement.
opex in the quarter was $493 million, up modestly sequentially due to a full quarter of merit increases and continued strong variable comp. this netted in op margin of 43.6%, which marks the fifth straight quarter of year-over-year op margin expansion, underscoring the strong leverage in our business. non-op expenses were $37 million, below our typical quarterly run rate of approximately $43 million due to an investment gain. and our tax rate was approximately 12%, which gives us an adjusted eps at $1.72, including $0.05 of upside attributable to the ip licensing agreement.
moving on to the balance sheet. we finished the quarter with an ending cash balance of $1.5 billion and a net leverage ratio of 1.2 times. relative to the second quarter, inventory dollars increased $16 million, driven entirely by raw materials and work in process. days of inventory were unchanged at 118 and weeks of channel inventory remained well below the low-end of our seven- to eight-week target, as sell-through remains stronger than selling.
capex for the quarter was $86 million, up meaningfully sequentially as we continue to add capacity to support our robust and growing order book that now stretches into fiscal '22. we will continue to increase capacity in the fourth quarter, resulting in full-year capital intensity above our long-term model of 4%.
and turning to free cash flow. we generated more than $2.2 billion over the trailing 12 months, up 23% from a year ago and this represented a 34% free cash flow margin. over the same period, we have returned nearly 85% of free cash flow after debt repayments via $970 million in dividends and over $500 million in share repurchases.
and now on to the fourth quarter outlook. revenue is expected to be $1.78 billion, plus or minus $70 million, up sequentially as additional capacity comes online. at the midpoint, excluding the automotive ip licensing revenue, we expect each of our b2b markets to increase sequentially, led by communications and consumer to be up high-single digits. based on the midpoint of guide, we expect to deliver a record gross margin and for operating margins to be 43.7%, plus or minus 100 bps. our tax rate is expected to fall toward the upper end of our range. and based on these inputs, adjusted eps is expected to be $1.72, plus or minus $0.11.
so before moving to the q&a, i'd like to give a brief update on maxim. our discussions with the chinese regulatory authorities have been productive and we are working toward closing within the initial time frame. we plan on closing no later than the third business day after china approval has been granted. as we shared before, shortly after the close, we will hold a conference call to provide an update on our capital return plans. once combined, we anticipate having nearly $4 billion of cash on our balance sheet, a leverage ratio well below one, and more than $3 billion of annual free cash flow.
i'll now turn it over to mike to start the q&a.
michael lucarelli -- senior director of investor relations
thanks, prashanth. let's get to our q&a session. [operator instructions] with that, can we have our first question, please?

operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of john pitzer with credit suisse.
john pitzer -- credit suisse -- analyst
yeah, good morning guys. thanks for letting me ask the questions; and congratulations on the solid quarter. vince, prashanth, if i exclude kind of the maxim revenue in the october quarter, the core adi business just came in line with the midpoint of your original range, which is clearly not horrible, but just given strength of business and kind of your pension to tend to give upside and the view that maybe maxim was more supply constrained than adi. i'm just wondering, if you can help us understand that dynamic, and maybe it's getting rectified in the january quarter being guided above seasonal. but were there supply constraints in the quarter that impacted either revenue and/or margins? and any kind of conversation around that would be helpful?
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yeah, thank you for the question, john; and it's a pretty straightforward answer. in the past quarter, our organic supply had some impact from some covid shutdowns in southeast asia, that affected much of the industry. we still did grow sequentially in the fourth quarter, but as we've been talking about for the last couple of quarters, our supply has been limited and revenue really is a function of supply. so that pickup dip a little bit of pressure on the revenue line and you'll see that correct itself as we go forward.
john pitzer -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you.
michael lucarelli -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, john.

your next question comes from toshiya hari with goldman sachs.
toshiya hari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi guys, good morning. thanks for taking the question. and mike, congrats on the promotion. i guess, i had a question on pricing also long-term supply agreements. quite a few of your peers in the industry have talked about approaching customers or customers approaching them about long-term agreements. i think you gave a couple of comments on past calls, but if you can update us on how you're thinking about initiatives of that sort, that would be super helpful? and how you're balancing that with your long-term purchases of wafer capacity? any comments on how to think about pricing broadly going forward would be super helpful? thank you.
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, toshiya. why don't i take pricing and i'll let vince just kind of speak how we think about it longer-term. so in the -- the short answer is, for 2021, we've been talking about rising cost inflations over the course of the year and we've been raising our prices with a goal of neutralizing the impact to margin. i would say that in the fiscal year that just finished, cost increases and price increases were not completely synchronized. so it's very likely that cost inflation outpaced our pricing actions for the year, and we're likely at a modest headwind to the year.
as we go into '22, we're looking for the inverse of that, we're looking for pricing net of inflation to be a modest tailwind to the year as the price increases that have begun -- begin to get more traction and we believe that while we still will have some cost increases over the course of the year, most of those are now baked into the run rate.
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
toshi, i can take slightly longer-term views -- things. i think it's true to say, certainly, from our standpoint, price increases aren't new, we've been systematically raising prices as a company from many, many years, i think we've talked about before. we continue to deliver increasing value in our new product streams and we also maintain products for our customers that are often more than 20 years in -- 20 years old in vintage terms. we've taken a very measured approach to pricing over the last year and we've been very transparent with our customers as well, that price increases are really more of a passing on costs rather than looking to enhancing our margins.
last comment on pricing, i think the industry as we approach this kind of post moore's law era, we are in an era and now i believe of structural price increases rather than cyclical. in other words, i think you'll start to see inflation sustained for the industry in the years ahead. it's been proven over the last couple of years for certain that semis are the root of the modern digital economy. and i think customers understand as well that importance in the value that is increasingly created by semi. so, i believe that, as i said inflation will persist, it will moderate, but i think it's a facet now of the business structure of the semi industry and indeed adi's business.
toshiya hari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you.
michael lucarelli -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, toshiya.

your next question is from tore svanberg with stifel.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
yeah. thank you and congratulations on the record results. vince, you're probably not going to share revenue synergy numbers with us probably until the analyst day. but could you perhaps just give us some examples of potential revenue synergies between maxim and adi, please?
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, thanks tore. yeah, i think, i mean, there are many, many -- i think i mentioned in the prepared remarks for example that maxim is very under-represented in the industrial space, where adi is very, very strong. half our business -- total business is industrial, and it's a very, very small part of maxim's business. and where i see the opportunity there is really on the power side of things, power management in particular, it's the fastest growing segment in the analog space. and i think generally across the board, we're still under-represented as a company in power. we will -- we today have approximately $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion of combined power revenues. my sense is, we can double that in a reasonable period of time. and we'll give a lot more detail on that, when we get to the investor day over the next couple of months. and from an application of market standpoint, i'd just like to point to data center, you know the power management solutions that maxim has for companionship with cloud processors, ai machines, accelerators and so on. i think will combine very nicely with adi's data center, micro modules.
and then in automotive connectivity, maxim's gmsl, high-speed link technology are used in our in-cabin connectivity portfolio, will enable us to optimize solutions and address a lot more applications in the car, and that's a nice companion as well to adi's a2b connectivity solution for audio. and last but not least, maxim has added a lot of heft to our bms portfolio, and our portfolio now is double the size it was pre-maxim. so -- and as i mentioned in -- again in the prepared remarks, we now sell to seven out of the top 10 oems in the electric car area. so -- and there's a lot more examples, but they're the primary ones, i'd like to point out at this stage.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
that's really helpful. thank you, vince.
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, tore.
operator
your next question is from vivek arya with bank of america securities.
vivek arya -- bank of america securities -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. vince, i just wanted to get your perspective on the shape of kind of fiscal '22 sales growth. your q1 outlook implies, i believe about 19% pro forma sales growth, that's well above your closest analog pis with an acceleration from q4. and if i were to assume that q1 is kind of the low point of the year and you grow supply sequentially, that points to a double-digit sales growth. so i know you're not giving full year guidance, but are we thinking about it the right way? and what could be the puts and takes from a supply, and then also a mix perspective as we go through the year?
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, vivek. so i'm going to at least give you some shape on that. so when we look across -- when we look into '22, we can see growth across all the various market sectors for the year. i think it's possible that we'll see another double-digit top line year for adi and the primary reasons, well, we've got a very strong backlog as we enter the year, we're seeing broad-based demand continue. i think also we're seeing some improvement, generally speaking, with each passing month, we are seeing improvements in supply. so i think that line of sight gives us increased confidence, and that's both internally as well as externally. we are in catch up mode in pricing, so i think you'll see some significant contribution in 2022 from pricing activities. and also inventories continue to remain low in the distribution channel, and of course on the customer side, pretty much on a broad-basis. so i think overall '22 should shape up to be a good year and we've got many, many drivers there on our site.
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
vivek, maybe just double clicking on the supply item to provide clarity. we have -- we put in a fair amount of equipment orders for the legacy adi operations. so we would expect adi capacity to continue to increase quarter-on-quarter over the coming fiscal year. on the maxim side, we've done the same, but that -- those orders only went in when the deal closed. so given the long lead times from the semi-cap guide, we're probably unlikely to see a meaningful increase in maxim's ability to supply until the tail end of the year. so unfortunately, i think maxim from a fiscal year basis will probably be a little bit of drag on growth, just because it -- we can't get the tools fast enough.
vivek arya -- bank of america securities -- analyst
got it. very helpful. thank you.

your next question is from ambrish srivastava with bmo.
ambrish srivastava -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi, thank you very much, and actually thanks to mike for providing --.
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, ambrish.
ambrish srivastava -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
good morning, folks. i just wanted to say thanks to mike for providing all the web schedule that really goes a long way in transparency, so i really appreciate that. my question is on lead times and the expedites. i just wanted to see what you're seeing versus what ti [phonetic] highlighted, which was very different than what we heard from other companies. so specifically, are you seeing expedites narrow down? and then where are your lead times, i think at the last earnings call, you had mentioned or in my call back, you had mentioned that -- you had 25% hotspots. so color on those would be helpful. thank you.
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
sure. ambrish, we're really not seeing much of a change. the customer -- on customer buying behavior book, book-to-bill is well above one in the fourth quarter. so our outlook to grow quarter-on-quarter for the first quarter in what is normally a seasonally weaker quarter is a reference to that. our backlog increased and we're starting 2022 with a very high level and we have not seen much change in cancellations or push out. so we're continuing to do what we have been doing and that is, we're reviewing with sales and ops for red flags that would indicate there is some level of turning in the market, we haven't seen anything notable, really, it's pretty strong across all end markets and all geographies. and as we've said before, we manage our business on sell-through. so we really look through distribution to get insight from where our products are going on a sell-through basis to understand what's happening in terms of who is buying and where it's being shipped to. so we're prepared for things to change, but i would say right now it continues to feel as it did a quarter ago.
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think ambrish, at least from my perspective, the number of conversations that i've been having with customer certainly hasn't slowed down. and then these conversations, it's pretty clear to me that what we're being requested to support as real demand. so our customers are trying to get products out of the door and they're not building inventories at this point in time.
ambrish srivastava -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
got it. and have the lead times changed versus where they were last quarter?
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
it depends on the product and it depends on the market. so we have some areas where that continue to extend and others that have stabilized. so overall, lead times are above normal and it's not where we want them to be. but it's very product and market specific, given the diversity of what we make and where we make it.
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think it's fair to say lead times have stabilized.
ambrish srivastava -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. thank you for the color. appreciate it.
michael lucarelli -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, ambrish.

your next question comes from stacy rasgon with bernstein research.
stacy rasgon -- bernstein research -- analyst
hi guys. thanks for taking my questions. i wanted to ask a little more about the shape of the synergies. i think you'd said the cost synergies would be in 40% this year and the remainder next year. could you give us some idea how do those split out between opex and gross margin and cogs? and what is the proper sort of all-in baseline for opex that we should be building those synergies off of? and i guess finally with gross margins, along the same lines, given you've got pricing and other stuff as a tailwind and you see revenue growth, do you still think that q1 gross margins wherever they want to coming out is that -- or is that the trough for the year, given how everything else flows through?
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so stacy, the way to think about the cost synergies is, we said roughly 40% in the coming fiscal, and then the balance in 2023. the majority of the coming fiscal will actually be in cost of goods, and then in 2023, you'll see that flip to be the majority of that's coming in opex. what else can i tell you there, the -- anything mike that's relevant? the --.
michael lucarelli -- vice president of investor relations
i'll call that -- that would be -- that's phase 1. we will talk more about phase ii at the analyst day, and we'll look to increase that synergy target at that time. and i think your second question on gross margin, i'll pass it back to prashanth. [speech overlap]
stacy rasgon -- bernstein research -- analyst
what's the proper sort of like current like folding run rate for opex right now?
michael lucarelli -- vice president of investor relations
if you look at our one -- our first quarter guide and that's probably a good level of run rate opex. i would say we -- in that guide, there is about $20 million of annual opex we took out in our fourth quarter. so maybe add $20 million to that for the run rate [speech overlap]
stacy rasgon -- bernstein research -- analyst
i'm sorry. [speech overlap]
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yeah, on gross margins, the -- so first quarter seasonally tends to be a little bit lower, because we got the holiday shutdowns. and this first quarter here, we'll have a full quarter of maxim, which as many of you know had lower gross margins than stand-alone adi, so we've got some headwind coming from that. the tailwind is, we've got the revenue that's coming in strong and pricing, as i mentioned earlier is going to be -- start to be mildly accretive. so, all-in, i would think gross margin is kind of sequentially i think flattish is a safe model.
stacy rasgon -- bernstein research -- analyst
got it. that's helpful.
michael lucarelli -- vice president of investor relations
yeah. stacy, thanks for that. and then, you're right, on the gross margin for the year, the plan is for it to continue to rise throughout the year, assuming demand remains strong and mix doesn't change, given synergies and also our pricing actions.
go to next question, please.
stacy rasgon -- bernstein research -- analyst
thank you.

your next question is from harlan sur with jpmorgan.
harlan sur -- jpmorgan -- analyst
good morning. congratulations on the strong results and execution. on the inventories, i think you mentioned that they continue to be below your target range of seven weeks to eight weeks. and i know that on the finished goods perspective at least through q3, that was down year-over-year, it was down year-to-date versus an increase in total inventories, which implies to me that consignment or direct customer inventories are also quite lean and demand is strong. and so i guess, what's your view on when the team and your customers will be in a position to build back inventories, or is it just hand to mouth for the next several quarters?
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yeah, i think it probably looks to be continued hand to mouth for the next couple of quarters. our inventory numbers are a little bit confusing, because of some of the math that's in there. so i'll just go back to what i said in the prepared remarks. days of inventory was down slightly, the internal inventory balance was up, as we've built raw materials and wip. you have some noise in there from maxim's inventory being added into ours middle of the quarter, as well as the purchase accounting math, which requires us to do a step above that. so adjusting for all of that, we were up slightly in terms of adi balance sheet inventory and most of that was in wip. on the channel side, it remains very lean and well below where we want it to be and that caused us some challenges on customer service as it does for everyone in the industry. we don't see that abating at least for the first or second quarter. and we -- it's hard for us to see further out than that.
harlan sur -- jpmorgan -- analyst
great. thank you.
michael lucarelli -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, harlan. and stephanie, can we go to our last question, please.
operator
your last question is from cj muse with evercore.
cj muse -- evercore -- analyst
yeah, good morning. thank you for taking the question. i guess a question on supply and gross margins. as you look at fiscal '22, can you speak to the growth you anticipate from internal versus external supply? and then based on that, how should we think about the implications to your gross margins? thank you.
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
internal versus external supply. yeah, so cj the -- well, let's break down the dynamics. on the internal supply, i mentioned that adi's internal capacity will continue to improve as we go through every quarter, as we bring more equipment online. on the maxim side, i mentioned that is pretty much flat for most of the year, we're optimistic that we might be able to see some improvement toward the tail end of the year as we get more equipment in. on the external side, i will say that vince himself is personally involved in conversations with our foundry partners and looking to get additional wafer capacity when he -- when we can. but it's very much driven by what nodes are available and maybe i'll pass to vince here to add a bit more comments since he have been having a lot of those conversations with [speech overlap]
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
i think the best answer we can give you cj is that, we've indicated, we expect gross margins to increase throughout the year. and we've got a hybrid model, so we expect to -- against that, we are not expecting any kind of external, internal perturbations that will impact gross margin, but we expect it to increase throughout the year.
cj muse -- evercore -- analyst
all right.
michael lucarelli -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, cj. thanks everyone for joining the call this morning. a copy of the transcript will be available on our website, and all available reconciliations, and additional information can also be found there. thanks again for joining us and your keen interest in analog devices. have a great thanksgiving.

operator
good morning, and welcome to the analog devices fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web.
i'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, mr. michael lucarelli, vice president of investor relations. sir, the floor is yours.
michael lucarelli -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, stephanie, and good morning everybody. thanks for joining our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 conference call. with me on the call today are adi's ceo, vincent roche; and adi's cfo, prashanth mahendra-rajah. for anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com.
now on to the disclosures. the information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as further described in our earnings release, adi and maxim's periodic reports and other materials filed with the sec. actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking information as these statements reflect our expectations only as of the date of this call. we undertake no obligation to update these statements, except as required by law.
our comments today will also include non-gaap financial measures, which exclude special items. when comparing our results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. reconciliations of these non-gaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap measures and additional information about our non-gaap measures are included in today's earnings release.
please note, we published a table on our investor webpage of historical pro forma combined end market revenue aligned to adi fiscal quarters. as part of this exercise, we also mapped sub-segments to match adi's groupings. as a result of this reclassification about $150 million of annual revenue moved from industrial and communications to consumer for the maxim business.
and with that, i'll turn it over to adi's ceo, vincent roche. vince?
vincent roche -- president and chief executive officer
thank you very much, mike; and a very good morning to you all. once again, we delivered record revenue and profits in our fourth quarter, closing out what was a milestone year for adi. our success was driven by our industry-leading high performance portfolio and our team's strong operational execution, enabling us to better meet the insatiable demand for our products.
now stepping back a little, 2021 truly demonstrated the vital importance of semiconductors to the modern digital age. we invested ahead of this inflection, building a comprehensive portfolio to better solve our customers' most complex problems in this ubiquitously sensed and connected world. as we enter 2022, our backlog and bookings remain robust, and we continue to invest in manufacturing capacity, positioning us well for another successful year ahead.
now moving on to our results. our fourth quarter revenue was $2.34 billion and eps was $1.73, both exceeding the midpoint of guidance. and for 2021, our revenue was $7.32 billion and eps was $6.46. looking at organic adi, we delivered new high watermarks on revenue and profits. industrial and automotive achieved record revenue this year, while consumer returned to annual growth for the first time since 2017. and communications revenue declined as continued strength in wired was offset by weakness in wireless-related to the china market.
in 2021, we generated a record $2.4 billion of free cash flow, equating to a free cash flow margin of approximately 33%. this maintains our position in the top 10% of the s&p 500. in line with our revised capital allocation strategy to return 100% of free cash flow, we returned $3.7 billion to shareholders in 2021 through dividends and share buybacks. it was not only a record year for performance and shareholder returns, but also for investments that positioned us to better capture market opportunities presented by secular growth drivers in our business.
first, we took decisive action to add capacity throughout the year. with more than $340 million in capital expenditures, this is enabling us to better navigate the near-term supply demand imbalance, while achieving our long-term growth objectives. and in 2022, we're planning to expand our internal manufacturing capacity at our factories in the u.s. and europe. these additional investments will create more profitable, flexible and resilient manufacturing capabilities at adi. at our core, we are an innovation-driven enterprise. and together with maxim, we will invest more than $1.6 billion in r&d annually, to ensure we continue developing solutions that define the edge of possible.
as you know, to complement our organic efforts, we selectively used m&a to expand both our scale and our scope. in 2017, the acquisition of ltc reflected a strategy. since acquiring the franchise, we delivered on our goal to double its historical growth rate. equally impressive was our ability to improve on linear's industry-leading gross margins. more recently, we completed the acquisition of maxim integrated. similar to previous acquisitions, we're combining the best from adi and maxim to develop a new operating system that enhances customer engagement and drive long-term profitable growth. and i'm very pleased with the progress that we've made already.
on the customer engagement side, the integration of our field teams has brought a tremendous degree of excitement. the team is already beginning to identify cross-selling opportunities and building out our opportunity pipeline. from an engineering and operations perspective, our teams are coming together at a remarkable speed and we're aligning product and technology roadmaps to help accelerate growth in the years ahead. this combination also strengthens the diversity of our portfolio and enriches our resilient business model. to that end, we now have approximately 75,000 product skus and 80% of these products individually account for less than 0.1% of our total revenue.
and the addition of maxim and provides us with a more comprehensive power portfolio, maxim's primarily application focused power offerings are highly complementary with adi's more general purpose or catalog power portfolio. this adds new sam in all our markets and enhances cross-selling opportunities, accelerating revenue growth in our $2 billion plus power portfolio. given these investments, we enter 2022 with an unparalleled portfolio of technology and talent, aimed at capitalizing on the secular growth trends across all our markets.
and now, i'd like to share a few examples of how our business is at the heart of these emerging trends. starting with industrial. 2021 was a better year for our highly diversified and profitable industrial business. with all applications achieving all time highs, our unrivaled high-performance portfolio continues to benefit from the mass digitalization movement across industries. our largest industrial segments, instrumentation and test, is comprised of automated test equipment, electronic test and measurement and scientific instruments. these applications must combat increasing test times, a system complexity and metrology requirements rise exponentially. for example, processors and memory in data centers are leveraging final no geometries with higher levels of integration, which can double the test time, this challenge is our opportunity. our innovative purpose-built solutions are bringing test time back to parity, while increasing our content by more than 50%.
factory automation is one of our largest industrial segments. i believe, we're at a tipping point in the industry 4.0, as customers are looking to add sensing, edge processing and connectivity to make their supply chains more robust, efficient, and of course, flexible. adi precision signal chain and power franchises, sensing technologies and robust wired and wireless connectivity are critical to enabling these efforts. looking ahead, we have an enormous opportunity to connect maxim's rich power portfolio, which is under-represented in the industrial sector today, with adi's strong position.
shifting now to automotive. in a year dominated by chip shortage headlines, we achieved record revenue as consumers and manufacturers are embracing electric vehicles and an enhanced in-vehicle experience. these two areas need additional semiconductor content and align very well with the strengths of both adi and maxim. in electric vehicles, our market-leading wired and wireless battery management systems or bms offer customers the highest levels of accuracy, reliability and safety, as well as flexibility to scale across all battery chemistries, including the more environmentally friendly zero-cobalt lfp. our bms position is further strengthened with maxim, we now sell to seven of the top 10 ev manufacturers, and our increased technology and product scale enables us to address new sam. our efficiency is also critical in electric vehicles to better optimize performance and range. here maxim's strong and growing power management capabilities complement our portfolio.
now inside the vehicle automakers are enhancing the in-cabin experience. adi's market leading audio systems with signal processing, a2b connectivity and active road noise cancellation continues to gain traction. in 2021, our a2b franchise was designed in at five major oems. and since its launch in 2016, we've shipped over 50 million a2b nodes, and we expect this to double within the next three years. with maxim, our in-cabin connectivity offerings, expand to include their industry-leading gmsl franchise, which is critical in architecting advanced driver assistance systems.
turning to communications. 2021 was an uneven year, as strength in wired was offset by weakness in the china wireless market. encouragingly as we look to 2022, the proliferation of 5g is gaining momentum globally, especially in north america. in the wireless markets, adi is the leader with more than double the market share of our closest competitor. this year, we introduced the industry's first software defined radio transceiver, that includes a fully integrated digital front-end. this next generation transceiver platform, enables us to defend and extend our position in traditional 5g and emerging o-ran networks. additionally maxim's power portfolio will support our goal to increase our power attach rate in the wireless market.
in our wired business, we grew again this year as data centers and networking became increasingly vital to accelerating digitalization. maxim more than doubles our exposure to data centers and adds new growth vectors with its power management solutions for cloud processors and accelerators. and momentum is building with a strong pipeline across traditional customers, as well as hyperscalers.
finally, moving on to consumer. our business delivered double-digit growth this year, as we executed on our strategy to diversify our customers, products and applications. maxim further builds on these efforts, bringing additional power, audio and sensing capabilities and adding new applications like fast charging and gaming. given the strong pipeline and design wins for our signal processing solutions, across hearables, wearables and professional audio, video, combined with our power management capabilities, i'm confident that we're on the path for continued growth.
now i'd like to focus on esg just a little, which is now an integral part of our business strategy. broadly speaking, i believe semiconductors can play a major role in improving our standard of living, while also protecting our planetary health. for example, adi's technology is critical to optimizing global energy efficiency, from evs and charging stations to sustainable energy and smart grids. we're not only investing in these applications, but they represent a meaningful and growing portion of adi's revenue today. so we've made substantial progress on our esg initiatives in 2021, including a commitment to increase the use of sustainable energy for 100% of our organic adi manufacturing activities by 2025, up from 50% today. actions like these will help us achieve our goal of carbon neutrality by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050. we launched the ocean and climate innovation accelerator consortium focused on the critical role of oceans in combating climate change. and we've enhanced our disclosure and transparency on esg topics, especially around diversity, equity and inclusion. in the year ahead, we look to extend our esg initiatives across the combined company, and of course, make further progress toward our goals.
so in closing, i'd like to thank our employees and partners who worked tirelessly throughout this past year, helping adi achieve these historic results. we're off to a strong start in 2022, with continued robust demand and line of sight to capacity additions. and i've never been more optimistic about adi's future. our industry-leading position is stronger with maxim, as we expand our capabilities to capitalize on emerging secular drivers, positioning us for faster growth in the years ahead.
and with that, i'll hand you over to prashanth.
prashanth mahendra-rajah -- senior vice president, finance and chief financial officer
thank you, vince. let me add my welcome to our year-end earnings call. except for revenue, my comments on the p&l and our outlook will be on a non-gaap or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. also the acquisition of maxim closed on august 26th, as such, i will discuss results inclusive of maxim's contributions for approximately 9.5 weeks.
i'll begin with a brief review of 2021. we delivered sequential revenue growth every quarter, leading to a new all-time high of $7.32 billion. gross margins of 70.9% increased 180 basis points, due to favorable product mix, stronger utilization and the savings from a legacy ltc plant optimization. operating margins of 42.4%, increased 250 basis points, reflecting gross margin fall-through and disciplined discretionary spending. all told, adjusted eps increased more than 30% to a record $6.46.
turning to the fourth quarter. revenue of $2.34 billion, exceeded the midpoint of our updated guidance. maxim's contribution to revenue was $559 million. looking at the end market results and to give a better view into the underlying trends, i'll focus my remarks on organic adi results, but this will be the last earnings call, where we provide adi organic commentary. industrial represented 57% of revenue and increased slightly sequentially, and 25% year-over-year with growth across every sub-segment. for the full year, industrial increased 28%. this strong performance once again is a testament to our sustained relative outperformance in the industrial market.
communications represented 16% of revenue and was flat sequentially while decreasing year-over-year. for the year, we delivered record wired sales, while total comps declined due to the weakness in china wireless, largely related to geopolitical tensions. excluding this region, total comps grew more than 20% in 2021. and overall, our comps geographic mix shifted with north america, europe and korea, now representing our largest sources of revenue. automotive represented 15% of revenue and was down 9% sequentially, as the third quarter included revenue from an ip licensing agreement, excluding this, auto was flat sequentially. on a year-over-year basis, auto increased 15% with bms more than doubling, reflecting our leadership position in the electrification ecosystem. for the year, auto exhibited robust broad-based growth finishing up 36%.
consumer represented 12% of revenue and increased more than 20% sequentially and year-over-year, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of annual growth. over a year ago, we said consumer would grow in 2021, and the team delivered on this commitment with consumer increasing 12% for the year.
moving on to the rest of the fourth quarter p&l, i'm going to speak to the results inclusive of the partial quarter of maxim. gross margins were 70.9%, up 90 bps year-over-year. operating margins finished at 43.1%, up 140 basis points year-over-year. non-op expense was $44 million and the tax rate was 12.7%. all-in adjusted eps was $1.73 above the midpoint of guide and up more than 20% year-over-year.
if we look at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $2 billion of cash and equivalents and on a trailing 12-month pro forma basis, our net leverage ratio was 1.1 turns. building on our esg efforts, we continued to strategically leverage sustainable financing. we're proud to be the first u.s. tech company to deploy three sustainable finance instruments, with our inaugural green bond issuance, a sustainability-linked revolving credit facility, and a sustainability-linked bond offering. specifically, this bond offering was part of our $4 billion refinancing efforts during the quarter. and as a result, we lowered our weighted average coupon to 2.7%, while extending the average duration of our total debt by nearly 10 years. inventory dollars increased slightly sequentially, after adjusting for the partial quarter of maxim activity and the fair value step up of inventory related to the acquisition, while inventory days were down slightly. channel inventory declined and remains below the low-end of our seven week to eight week target.
moving to the cash flow statement. for the year, cash flow from operations increased 36% to more than $2.7 billion. we generated a record free cash flow of $2.4 billion or approximately 33% of revenue, despite capex more than doubling to $344 million or 4.7% of revenue. we also returned a record $3.7 billion or more than 150% of free cash flow to shareholders this year, via dividends and buybacks, including 80% of our $2.5 billion asr program. as a reminder, we plan to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. this was accomplished by growing our dividend annually with a 40% to 60% dividend payout target and by using residual cash flow for buybacks.
we enter 2022 as a much larger enterprise with an attractive long-term outlook. as vince mentioned, we plan to increase our capacity investments to support revenue growth and reinforce the resiliency and efficiency of our hybrid manufacturing model. as such, we anticipate capex being 6% to 8% of revenue for 2022, above our long-term model of 4%. this step-up in capex will not impact the commitment we made in september to buyback $5 billion of shares by the end of calendar '22.
so now on to the first quarter outlook. revenue is expected to be $2.6 billion plus or minus $100 million. based on the midpoint, we expect operating margin to be 43.3%, plus or minus 70 bps. we expect non-op expenses of approximately $50 million, a 12.5% tax rate and a share count of approximately 530 million. based on these inputs, adjusted eps is expected to be $1.78 plus or minus $0.10. for additional context, using the fourth quarter pro forma combined revenue as a base, our guide at the midpoint implies low single-digit growth quarter-on-quarter for -- in q1, for what is normally a seasonally weaker quarter. this growth is driven by an increase in b2b quarter-over-quarter, while consumer is down sequentially.
so before closing, i want to give a brief update on our maxim integration progress. phase 1 of shareholder value creation is well underway, building conviction in our cost synergy timeline. we anticipate realizing over 40% of the initial $275 million opex and cogs synergy target in fiscal '22, with the remaining coming in fiscal '23. i'm proud of the team's effort and confident this pace of execution will continue. at our analyst day next spring, we'll update investors on our progress, as well as provide more details on phases 2 and 3, which relate to additional savings from infrastructure optimization and revenue synergies respectively.
before turning to q&a, i'd like to congratulate mike lucarelli, on his promotion to vice president of investor relations and financial planning and analysis. look forward to working with you mike in this continued partnership. let me hand it over to you to take q&a.
michael lucarelli -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, prashanth. all right, with that, let's get to our q&a session. we ask that you limit yourself to one question in order to allow for additional participants on the call. if you have follow-up question, please requeue, and we'll take your question if time allows. with that, can we have our first question, please.
