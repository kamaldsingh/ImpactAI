ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the marvell technology group fourth-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, today's program is being recorded. i would now like to introduce your host for today's program, ashish saran, vice president, investor relations. please go ahead.
ashish saran -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. welcome to marvell's fourth quarter and fiscal-year 2021 earnings call. joining me today are matt murphy, marvell's president and ceo; and jean hu, our cfo. i would like to remind everyone that certain comments made today may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations.
please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the sec today and posted on our website, as well as our most recent 10-k and 10-q filings. we do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. during our call today, we will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures. a reconciliation between our gaap and non-gaap financial measures is available on our website in the investor relations section.
with that, i'll turn the call over to matt for his comments on our performance. matt? 
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. let me start with a recap of marvell's highlights for fiscal-year 2021. our gaap revenue was $2.97 billion. gaap gross margin was 50.1%, and gaap loss per diluted share was $0.41.
on a non-gaap basis, our gross margin was 63.3%, and non-gaap earnings per diluted share was $0.92. our consolidated revenue grew 10% year on year, led by our networking business, which grew 22% year on year. revenue growth, combined with strong operating leverage from our business model, enabled non-gaap eps to grow 39% year on year. i am very pleased with our outstanding performance during what has been an otherwise challenging year.
our growth initiatives in 5g, cloud and automotive drove results in these key end markets, which, collectively, more than doubled in revenue from the prior year to represent more than 25% of fiscal-year 2021 revenue. we are really pleased with the performance of avera and aquantia, who both delivered revenue above our expectations. we successfully completed the integration of both businesses and overachieved on our synergy targets. we also made great strides with our technology platform, announcing the jump to five nanometer, and along with it, the industry's first 112-gig serdes for cloud data center infrastructure.
this move was a direct result of our multiyear strategic shift to focus on data infrastructure and brings our process node cadence to the cutting edge. the power of our five-nanometer platform and the benefits it provides for customers is evident in our opportunity funnel which has grown significantly since we adopted this new node. the activity level on five nanometer continues to accelerate, and we have already secured multiple leading-edge design wins, each meaningful from a revenue perspective. our advanced technology is also a key enabler of our custom asic offering, which has continued to gain momentum, particularly in cloud.
following on from the design win we announced last quarter, activity levels continue to increase, and we are now involved in advanced discussions with multiple hyperscale data center customers. our ability to offer customization, coupled with marvell's leading standard product ip, has proven to be highly compelling to cloud customers. given its strategic importance, let me provide some more detail on the evolution of the custom asic model, bringing to light some of the key trends that make the opportunity so compelling. traditionally, the primary customer base for custom asics has been large-system oems whose core business is developing hardware to sell as a product.
these customers design their own system hardware and build unique technology into the hardware itself through custom chip development to differentiate their products. we do much of the chip design directly and work with a semiconductor partner to license ip and manage the physical layout in front and back-end manufacturing. today, in addition to these system customers, hyperscale data center operators are also designing their own silicon, and i'm often asked if this trend is good or bad for marvell. we believe this trend is very good for us as we believe we are ideally positioned to help them solve their unique challenges.
their core business is the cloud service they provide, not the hardware itself. they are building custom hardware because they need incredibly efficient and optimized infrastructure. as a result, they are looking for a semiconductor collaboration that goes well beyond the traditional custom asic model and allows them to leverage ip that the silicon partner already has available. the design is typically done in true partnership with the customer focusing on the portions proprietary to their use cases and marvell bringing our own unique compute, security, networking and storage ip to the table.
therefore, the end solution is a semi-custom design, which represents the best of both worlds and provides a faster time to market. because these engagements use our ip, we believe this leads to a more strategic and valuable relationship with these key customers. in addition, compute is becoming increasingly important in this market as hyperscalers are looking to move beyond standard x86 servers and integrate custom arm-based compute solutions into their architecture. as this trend accelerates, marvell should be an even more important partner.
our long history in successfully developing and delivering multiple generations of highly complex, multi-core, arm-based processors, including server processors, is unique in the industry. marvell is emerging as an ideal partner for these customers, and our recent cloud engagements involve deep engineering collaboration on all key aspects of design, including chip architecture, memory density, high-speed serdes integration, advanced packaging, power optimization and flexible processor implementation. now let me move on to our quarterly results and expectations. revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 was $798 million, $13 million above the midpoint of guidance, growing 6% sequentially and 11% year over year.
adjusted for the divestiture of wi-fi, year-on-year revenue growth was even greater at 15%. our gaap income per diluted share was $0.02. our non-gaap earnings per diluted share was $0.29, growing 16% sequentially and 71% year over year. as expected, supply constraints limited our ability to fully meet the growing demand for our networking products.
we also saw strong demand for our storage products, which drove the upside in revenue relative to the midpoint of our guidance. although these industrywide supply shortages are now well known, i expect that they may still be a topic of particular interest during our q&a session. so in anticipation of your questions, let me provide as much detail as i can for you now. as you are aware, despite or perhaps more accurately due to the impact from covid-19, demand has grown significantly across a range of semiconductor end markets as data infrastructure has become even more critical to the world's economy.
however, the supply chain was not completely prepared for the surge in demand and needs time to increase capacity. while we are confident that the industry will respond to these challenges, we anticipate a supply gap for at least through fiscal 2022. lead times have extended across the board. we are seeing shortages for multilayer complex substrates, ic packaging capacity and fab constraints in certain technology nodes important for our products.
from our vantage point, the increase in demand we are experiencing for our 5g, cloud and auto products appears closely tied to the long-term secular growth drivers present in these end markets. this, combined with the sole source nature of most of our design wins, would suggest that most of the demand we are not able to satisfy in the near term is not perishable. marvell is collaborating even more closely with our customers to manage demand forecast over an extended time horizon, and our operations team is continuing to drive our suppliers to match supply appropriately to mitigate impacts and minimize disruptions. in addition, we are taking extraordinary measures, including securing capacity in advance, over much longer-than-typical time periods.
and we are working with customers to get their assistance in helping absorb some of the incremental costs associated with prioritizing their continuity of supply. let's now discuss our two businesses in more detail. first, in our networking business, revenue during the fourth quarter was $439 million, consistent with our outlook of being flattish to the prior quarter. year-on-year growth remained robust with revenue growing 24% compared to the fourth quarter fiscal 2020 results, adjusted for the divestiture of wi-fi.
the year-on-year growth in networking was led by our 5g and cloud businesses. in addition, revenue from our ethernet switch and phy portfolio grew significantly as new design wins started to ramp. let me provide some color on sequential revenue movements in networking. in 5g, we delivered our sixth straight quarter of sequential revenue growth.
this growth was driven by standard and semi-custom product shipments to samsung and nokia, partially offset by a decline in 5g asics as deployments in china take a pause. looking past the typical lumpy nature of individual regional rollouts, 5g infrastructure deployments are expected to continue to strengthen worldwide. as an example, the u.s. recently concluded the first phase of the c-band spectrum auction.
this was the highest grossing spectrum auction ever held in the u.s. with gross proceeds exceeding $80 billion. a record level of interest is a clear indicator of the potential revenue opportunities carriers expect from 5g technology. other regions around the world are also opening up spectrum for 5g services, and wireless industry experts expect deployments to gather strength later this year.
we launched our open ran platform in december 2020 and are gaining traction in the marketplace. for example, we recently announced that we are joining the evenstar program, and we'll be working with facebook connectivity to provide a 5g open ran distributed unit design. this design will be based on our leading octeon fusion baseband processors and arm-based octeon multi-core dpus. evenstar du design will enable a new generation of ran suppliers to deliver high-performance, cost-optimized, interoperable du products to the rapidly expanding open ran ecosystem.
we recently announced that fujitsu will be using our industry-leading octeon fusion baseband processors in its new 5g base stations and also plan to engage with us on open ran distributed unit products. they are the second 5g regional customer i referenced last quarter. in cloud networking, we benefited from strong customer demand in the fourth quarter for our smartnic dpus, while the cloud asic declined, as expected. looking forward, we expect to continue benefiting from the secular growth in cloud capex on semiconductor solutions for data processing.
turning to our automotive business. quarterly revenues crossed into the double-digit million run rate, driven by the ramp of multiple ethernet design wins in model year 2021 vehicles. engagements are expanding as additional large oems and bookings have continued to strengthen. we believe that fiscal 2022 is shaping up to be a breakout year for this business.
the fourth quarter was robust for our ethernet switch and phy business with product ramps at multiple customers. the design wins we won over the last couple of years are now starting to ramp, and we expect these will contribute higher levels of revenue as we progress into fiscal 2022. let me now discuss the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 for our networking business. reflecting strong demand, despite continued supply constraints, we project revenues to grow close to 10% on a sequential basis and continued strong year-on-year growth exceeding 20%.
we expect this growth to be broad-based, led by our cloud dpus, standard and semi-custom 5g solutions, automotive products and ethernet networking solutions, partially offset by softness in 5g asics. turning now to our storage business. storage revenue for the fourth quarter was better than expected across all product lines, growing 18% sequentially to $326 million. this was a very strong quarter for our storage business with 10% year-on-year growth, driven by our custom ssd controller and cloud hdd products.
i'm very pleased with the tremendous progress we have made over the last few years in enabling high-capacity nearline hdds, which are critical for cloud customers. we have extended our long-standing relationship with toshiba, and we recently announced that our controllers and preamps are powering their new 18-terabyte cloud-scale hdds. toshiba's 18-terabyte products deliver industry-leading data storage capacity by utilizing mamr technology and advanced signal processing developed in close partnership with marvell. the close coupling of marvell's rechannel and preamplifier ip enables leading-edge features and hdd capacity to extend toshiba's position in the cloud data center market.
let me now provide some additional color on storage revenue on a sequential basis. in the fourth quarter, our custom ssd controller revenue benefited from the ongoing ramp at a tier 1 oem, as well as the initial ramp at a major cloud customer. in hdds, demand was strong across multiple end markets, including enterprise, smart video, retail and client, and our business benefited from aggregate hdd unit tam growth of about 10% sequentially. our revenue from cloud hdds also grew on strong customer demand for our products.
in our fiber channel business, demand recovered significantly from the covid-19 impacts earlier in the year. our operations team was able to increase supply to help our oems restock and deliver more product to their customers. looking to the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we project a seasonal decline in storage controller demand. in addition, after last quarter's inventory replenishment by customers, we expect a more than seasonal decline in fiber channel demand.
as a result, after a very strong fourth quarter, we expect our storage revenue to decline in the low teens sequentially on a percentage basis. however, we expect a continued year-on-year growth of over 10% in the first quarter. in closing, needless to say, last year was a very challenging period as we adjusted to operating in the presence of a pandemic. it was almost exactly a year ago today when shelter-in-place policies were coming into effect and we're in the midst of taking action to protect our 5,000-plus employees and an extended support team of contractors and suppliers.
none of us really knew how the year would evolve or how the pandemic would impact our productivity or the demand for our products and technology. i can now look back and applaud a strong performance by the marvell team in the face of adversity: incredible program execution, record design win achievement, stronger customer relationships, double-digit revenue growth and significant margin expansion. i'm very proud of our employees, and i would like to thank them for their collective efforts in positioning marvell to emerge even stronger from the pandemic. we ended fiscal 2021 on a strong note, and we are kicking off fiscal 2022 with solid growth expectations, guiding revenue at the midpoint for the first quarter to grow 15% year on year, despite ongoing supply challenges.
we expect strong year-on-year growth from both our networking and storage businesses in the first quarter. non-gaap eps at the midpoint for the first quarter is now -- is projected to grow by 50% year on year, demonstrating the operating leverage in our business model. in fiscal 2022, we expect revenue growth from custom ssd controllers, preamplifiers, automotive ethernet and enterprise networking, in addition to our expanding 5g and cloud businesses, which is still early in their growth cycles. our team is also focused on closing key design wins from the large funnel of five nanometer and cloud engagements i discussed earlier.
we are getting closer to completing the inphi transaction. and as part of integration planning, we recently concluded a series of joint strategic planning sessions. the conclusion of these meetings, our teams walked away more excited than ever about the depth of technology and the level of talent across the combined company. the addition of inphi broadens the opportunity set for the combined company, and this will be a key factor in setting future investment priorities.
as a reminder, the closing of the inphi transaction remains subject to obtaining shareholder and regulatory approvals and satisfying other closing conditions. with that, i'll turn the call over to jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.
jean hu -- chief financial officer
thanks, matt, and good afternoon, everyone. i'll start with a review of our financial results for the fourth quarter and then provide our current outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. revenue in the fourth quarter was $798 million, $13 million above the midpoint of our guidance. networking represented 55% of our revenue, and storage contributing 41%.
revenue from other accounted for 4% of our revenue. gaap gross margin was 52.8%. non-gaap gross margin was 63.9% of revenue, both consistent with our guidance. gaap operating expenses were $423 million and include the cost of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, legal segments and acquisition and divestiture-related costs.
non-gaap operating expense were $283 million, just above midpoint, due to slightly higher project costs. gaap operating loss was $2 million. non-gaap operating profit was $226 million or 28.4% of revenue. for the fourth quarter, gaap income per diluted share was $0.02.
non-gaap income per diluted share was $0.29. now turning to our balance sheet. during the quarter, cash flow from operations was $158 million. we returned $40 million to shareholders through dividend payment.
during the quarter, we paid down $150 million of our term loan and exit the quarter with $748 million in cash and cash equivalents and total debt outstanding of $1.2 billion. our net debt-to-ebitda ratio was 0.5 times on a trailing 12-month basis. we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to the pending acquisition of inphi. for the full fiscal year of 2021, we returned a total of $186 million to shareholders through $161 million in dividends and $25 million in share repurchases.
in addition, we paid down $250 million of our term loan. during fiscal 2021, we also generated strong cash flow from operations of $817 million. turning to our guidance. for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $800 million, plus or minus 5%.
we expect our gaap gross margin will be approximately 52.5%. we project our non-gaap gross margin will be approximately 63.5%. we project our gaap operating expense to be approximately $391 million. we anticipate our non-gaap operating expenses to be approximately $300 million.
we expect our non-gaap tax rate of 5%. we expect our basic weighted average share outstanding will be 677 million, and our diluted weighted average share outstanding will be 619 million. as a result, we anticipate gaap earnings per share in the range of a loss of $0.05 per share on the low end to an income of $0.05 per diluted share on the high end. we expect non-gaap income per diluted share in the range of $0.23 to $0.31.
finally, two housekeeping points. as a reminder, our gaap eps is calculated using basic weighted average shares outstanding when there's gaap net loss, and they're calculated using diluted weighted average shares outstanding when there is gaap net income. non-gaap eps is calculated using diluted weighted average shares outstanding. in terms of expenses, you should expect us to continue to invest in our long-term growth with disciplined resource allocation.
we expect our operating expense growth to be well below our revenue growth. our opex increase year over year will be primarily due to employee merit increase and the normal inflation on items such as eda 2. our outlook for operating expense in the first quarter reflects the seasonal increase in payroll taxes. this seasonal effect is expected to dissipate in the second quarter, offset by a partial quarter of merit increase.
the full impact from merit increase will be present in the third quarter. by the time we exit the fiscal year, we estimate our non-gaap operating expense in the fourth quarter will increase in the range of 3% to 4% on a year-over-year basis. operator, please open the line and announce q&a questions. thank you.
",":
operator
certainly. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of harlan sur from j.p. morgan. your question, please.
harlan sur -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. appreciate the commentary on supply constraints. and i'm not asking the team to endorse higher revenues in the second half of the year, but i would expect china 5g spend to come back in the second half.
5g outside of china remains strong. sony is going to double their ps5 shipments this year, and then you have continued momentum in cloud. but if the backlog supported higher revenues in the second half, let's say, 10% higher versus the $800 million in april, is the team confident that you can support quarter-on-quarter revenue growth through the second half? or do you think that that will be a challenge, just given the tight wafer substrate and assembly and test capacity constraints?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure. thanks, harlan. yeah. no.
i think you highlighted some of the growth drivers. so just a few comments. i think the first is we are -- we have been planning for growth in our fy '22. i think we're off to a good start for the year.
if you look at our q1 guidance alone, it's going to be up 15% year over year versus a year ago. we've got some very strong secular growth drivers. you mentioned 5g, and there's certainly some positive signs, especially for the second half there. we have our cloud business, which is also growing on a secular basis, as well as our new product ramps.
and actually, we also have automotive, which is really off to a good start this year, and we see that continuing. so we've got that as a tailwind behind us. i'd say we've been able to drive growth, even if you look at fy '21, pretty consistently. we've been growing each quarter, quarter over quarter and year over year.
q4, we were able to actually exceed guidance and make up -- service some of the demand that was there. so that was a positive side. i think -- so i think the message is we've been delivering well. there's been a new sort of increased surge, and that's really where we're focused is working with our supply chain partners to be able to capture that upside above and beyond the growth rate that we've already been achieving.
so bottom-line answer to your question is i'm very confident that we can grow revenue in the second half based on the capacity that we've secured and worked hard with our supply chain partners to put in place. and we're also going to look to see if there's upside opportunity to pursue that as well. and that's not only for this year. but as i look even into our fy '23, we're starting to work with our supply chain partners there as well to really give them advanced notice because we see those trends like 5g, cloud and automotive being even stronger in the out-years with new products ramping, new customers coming online.
and we're pretty excited about our future there. so yes, i think we'll be in -- we're working hard on the -- on all fronts.
harlan sur -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thank you, matt.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of vivek arya from bank of america. your question, please.
vivek arya -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. matt, when i look back at this earnings season, most semiconductor companies reported and guided to trends well ahead of expectation, right, so much so that investors, right, have often complained about over shipments or pull-in of orders. but when i compare your q4 and q1 against expectations, it's been more measured. i'm curious how much of this would you attribute to a different end market mix, right.
how much of this is due to supply constraints? and then more importantly, what changes or gets better the rest of the year so you can start to accelerate your sales growth? thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure. yeah. think, vivek, it's a couple of things. i think, first, it has a lot to do with the end markets that we're in.
i mean, fundamentally, remember, we're one of the only pure-play infrastructure companies, so we don't have consumer demand that's sort of very volatile, maybe good one quarter, maybe not so good in two quarters. we don't have a lot of demand that sort of comes and goes. we tend to -- and this is sort of by design, by the way. the business model that we've put together is to bring together these various end applications and drive consistent and ideally predictable growth.
so while we may not be as flashy in some quarters as certain companies that really have some explosive demand, but then maybe it abates later, we're focused on slow and steady wins today and continuing to execute and grow our company quarter over quarter and year over year. certainly, there's opportunities out there to secure some upside, and we're working on that. but i think, even if you saw in q4, for us, we were quite pleased with the overachievement on revenue, and we're very comfortable with the first-quarter guide as well. so i think it's more around we've been one of the faster growers in the last few quarters and also our end-market dynamics.
ideally, we'll deliver more repeatable and sustainable long-term growth with maybe less quarter-to-quarter variation. that's been the strategy.
vivek arya -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
and anything changed in the second half versus what you have seen in the last two quarters? what gets better from here?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
in terms of the demand or the supply?
vivek arya -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah, on the demand and the market -- end market mix.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure. yeah. well, i think a couple of things are going on. if you -- as i indicated in my comments earlier with harlan, we certainly have -- 5g in the second half will continue to accelerate.
we have -- there are new geographies coming online. we believe that the u.s. will -- shows very good prospects for the second half. we believe that china, as well, will go through their digestion phase, and then you have japan and you have new countries.
even india is talking about potentially pulling in their spectrum auction. so that's all positive. so we expect that to continue. our cloud business continues to grow, and we see that continuing, both on a secular basis, as well as new products, including our asic storage and our dpus, which are doing quite well in terms of smartnics.
automotive, the same thing. we've got a good ramp going with our calendar -- our model year, sorry, '21 ramps. we've got more to come in model year '22 with additional oems coming online, as well as expanded content. and even some of the new automotive, i call it, the new breed of automotive oems, the ev-only focused companies, really aggressively adopting our solutions.
so we're positive there. and then we've got custom ssd controllers, both for cloud as well as for our system oem. and finally, on top of that, our enterprise business has done extremely well if you look at -- which was surprising, but if you look at even our results in last year, that business with our switch and phy products grew significantly, primarily on our own product cycle, and we also are very optimistic about that as well. so there's a number of good things that are happening in our business, vivek, both from an end market as well as a product cycle standpoint.
and so as harlan pointed out, we've got to go, just continue to make sure we've got the right supply profile to meet that, but we're working hard on that.
vivek arya -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of timothy arcuri from ubs. your question, please.
timothy arcuri -- ubs -- analyst
hi, thanks. matt, i just had a question on the storage business. it was well above seasonal q4 and a little below seasonal for fiscal q1. i guess i'm a little surprised that it will be below seasonal for fiscal q1, while all your customers are talking about controllers being on allocation.
so i guess i wanted to just talk about that. and then i was wondering if maybe you can talk about what sort of you see as normal season in fiscal q2. i think, typically, it's up like mid-singles. do you also have flatter tail happening as well? so can you just sort of talk about those two factors?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure. maybe, jean, i'll have you answer the first part on storage. and then, tim, i'll have you repeat your question. you broke up a little bit on the second part of it.
but jean, why don't you go ahead and give us some comments around storage?
jean hu -- chief financial officer
yeah. hi. on storage side, in q4, we really had a really strong quarter, and the performance, really, is a combination of our own product cycle and also strong end-market demand across the board. so in hdd and the fiber channel, certainly, we see the demand in nearline, which our business performed really well, and also just broad demand for -- on the client side, too.
on fiber channel, we do see the demand bouncing back and also the customers are restocking because of the supply challenge in the last year has caused a lot of problems in fiber channel. so fiber channel is a little bit lumpy. and then if you look at the q1, frankly, the storage controller business, when you look at hdd and ssd, they are actually quite seasonal. it's declining quarter over quarter, very consistent with the broad market.
the fiber channel is where it becomes really lumpy. the q4 performance is pretty good and strong, but the customers also are restocking. so we do see q1 fiber channel, again, is declining much more than seasonal. but if you look at the overall, in the longer term, fiber channel business actually is quite stable.
so the quarter-over-quarter lumpiness is definitely exaggerated last year by the supply chain constraints. i think you need to repeat your second question because we did not hear it clearly.
timothy arcuri -- ubs -- analyst
thanks a lot. ok. you can hear me now. so i guess the question was just given all that movement, how you think about what normal seasonal is for fiscal q2, like it's typically up sort of mid-singles.
is that the right way to think about it into fiscal q2? thanks.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think we'll -- i think, tim, so first of all, i think we're -- we have a -- i don't even know what the new normal is in storage anywhere -- anymore, but there certainly is a seasonality effect to that, but we're not really guiding out that far at this point. what i want to emphasize, though, is that even on the sort of lumpiness of fiber channel, which has definitely started, i think, with the shelter-in-place orders that went into effect earlier in 2020, there's just been a -- it's been a lumpier business than normal, and so it had a very good q4. and then, obviously, we've guided it down for q1.
but if you just sort of step back, storage, overall, for marvell is up 10% year over year in q1 is what we're guiding. so -- despite some of the lumpiness. and this is a higher sort of beta business than the rest of our businesses. we're still pretty pleased with the trajectory of this business.
and we do expect the fiber channel portion to normalize throughout this year, assuming that there's no more supply chain surprises.
timothy arcuri -- ubs -- analyst
ok, matt. thanks much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of john pitzer from credit suisse. your question, please.
john pitzer -- credit suisse -- analyst
yeah, good afternoon, guys. matt, glad to see the 10% sequential growth expected in networking in the april quarter. but i'm kind of curious, when you look back at the january quarter, i'm a little surprised that networking was down sequential. i mean, it was essentially flat, in line with your guide.
but just given the level of delinquencies, did the supply problem get worse? or is this maybe a function that when you look at the networking business, there's portions that are just tied to campus and enterprise? and then there's sort of the growthy parts of your business. i guess, that the growthy parts grow sequentially, and there was an enterprise overhang. as you look out throughout the balance of the year, how do you think about just a reopening trade around enterprise and the impact it's going to have on your networking business?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. no. i think, as we've said, the supply impacts we've seen have been more pronounced in the networking business. so that has limited our ability to deliver upside, like we want to.
even then, you got to remember, too, our -- the compare is a little bit tough because we did have a very strong q3. i mean, you've got to now go back to sort of what are you comparing it to. if you remember, q3 was up very significantly from our q2. and then year over year, it was up a ton.
so the flat compare, while we wish we could have done a little better, it's still, on an annual basis, still growing really well. i wouldn't really break out that there was sort of weakness in one or the other. i think we're coming off a big q3 and then also the 5g was up and enterprise has continued to be up, and we've actually seen, from a year ago, everything growing. so i think it's more of a sequential issue.
and certainly, we're pleased with the q1, 10% up, and that business continues to do very well for us.
john pitzer -- credit suisse -- analyst
and then, matt, just on the cost side, how much are you absorbing versus being able to pass on? is it material to gross margins? and is that something that sticks around for most of this fiscal year? or is that something that could reverse itself in the second half?
jean hu -- chief financial officer
hey, john. this is jean. yeah, i'll take this question. so definitely, as matt mentioned earlier, we are working with the customers to share the increased cost.
and the way we're looking at it is our first priority is to really meet customer demand, especially with the increased demand for our product. as far as the gross margin, we are very pleased with our q4 performance and the q1 guide. and the q1 guide, if you look at it, it's primarily driven by mix and we'll continue to improve our gross margin to our target level. we discussed during our investor day, which is 65%.
i think the pace of that improvement is probably different in today's supply constrained environment versus a normal environment because we do want to make sure we meet customers' demand, increase the demand on this current supply constraint situation. so the pace will be a little bit different, not as we expected during our last investor day.
john pitzer -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of blayne curtis from barclays. your question, please.
blayne curtis -- barclays -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thanks for taking my question. just i just want to ask, i know you answered a lot on the storages and said it would be short all year. you did miss some shipments in january, and i thought at the time you were thinking of catching up in april.
so as you look to the guidance of 10% for networking, one, i just wanted to know, you're catching up on some of those january shipments within that 10%. and then i think i heard you say basically everything but 5g asics would be up. i was wondering if you could give us any more color as to what the primary drivers of that growth is.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
well, yeah. no. on the second part, you're right, other than 5g asics, which were mostly tied to the china deployments in 5g, which were extremely strong in calendar '20. and we're seeing that digestion now.
yeah, the rest of it is up, but there's not necessarily a catch-up, per se, in q1. i mean, we are seeing demand increase. and i think we've -- we see revenue going up, and we see -- so i'd say it's more demand-driven than just, oh, well, we've caught up and now the demand is flat. we actually have a pretty robust demand picture for that particular business, both year on year and sequentially.
jean hu -- chief financial officer
and overall, to just add to what matt said, overall, we continue to have a similar delinquency, right, so it's certainly supply chain constraint.
blayne curtis -- barclays -- analyst
thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of c.j. muse from evercore. your question, please.
c.j. muse -- evercore isi -- analyst
yeah. good afternoon. thank you for taking the question. i guess to clarify, jean, are you implying opex in fiscal '22 is growing roughly 2.5%? and then i guess for the primary question, matt, can you discuss your engagement with hyperscale customers? can you kind of walk us through the initial work on perhaps discrete asics and how that kind of relationship is evolving to perhaps more custom solutions across increased areas of processing? thanks so much.
jean hu -- chief financial officer
yeah. our opex year over year, you can think about, is around 3%, the typical inflation year over year. we are managing our resource allocation to ensure we continue to invest in all the growth platforms we have. so that's how you can model it.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. c.j., i'll take your other question. so i think the -- if you even go back to our purchase of avera, there was really two -- we had a thesis there on two fronts. one was to be more relevant in the 5g market and be able to offer full custom design capability, along with the semi-custom that we had developed with our lead customer.
and as you've seen, that's gone really well. the second was that the recognition that in the cloud hyperscale market that more and more of the -- particularly compute-based solutions, were going to go to full custom or even semi-custom but a need to really have a full asic capability. and these are -- there's a range of applications, by the way. these things could be anything from ai or ml chips to server-class cpus to networking products, smartnics, so there's a variety of applications.
and as i said in my prepared remarks, this trend is here to stay, and we think it's good for us. i think there is a world that, that's post x86 or certainly coexist with it where more and more of the compute and more and more of these solutions are moving to very, very customized products. and we have all the ideal pieces to support that in terms of our process technology, our in-house ips, like our serdes, both for short reach and medium and long-reach at the highest frequencies, including 112 gig. and our ability to really partner closely and deeply and be flexible in our business model as well.
and what i mean by that is we can do standard asics that are the traditional model you think of. but increasingly, what i'm seeing is the engagements with the cloud companies are really more partnership-oriented where it's solutioning together and it's proposing architectures and proposing four different ways to do something and then coming up with a model that really suits their needs. and so i think sort of our go to market, plus our technology road map and then having all these key pieces, whether it's networking ip, very, very strong compute portfolio with all of our history from the cavium side and arm-based processors to security, to storage. and then within phy coming in, obviously, the optical connectivity.
so i think we're going to -- we can be an ideal partner here, and we think this is going to be a very big opportunity, and it's going to be one that's here to stay.
c.j. muse -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of ross seymore from deutsche bank. your question, please.
ross seymore -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for letting me ask a question. just a clarification then a question. the clarification, just, jean, usually, you give a little color on what the other segment is going to do.
but the main question for matt is on the 5g side of things. i think everybody knows the digestion period that's going on in china now, some of the transitions going on geographically and the optimism people have in the second half, but you're really outperforming that -- during that transition period that we have right now and it sounds like you'll continue to in the back half. so i guess what i'm getting at is when you think about your company-specific drivers, separated from the market as a whole, improving in the back half, do you think that outperformance you're delivering now accelerates or decelerates? and what are the drivers of that performance above and beyond what the end market itself is going to do?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure. why don't i take the 5g question, then jean, you can comment on other. so yeah, ross, i think you're right. i mean, we've we performed really well on the cycle.
we had six quarters of sequential revenue growth in 5g, and we were able to power through as new products ramped. and new customers came online when some others maybe felt different paces of digestion. so i think we're pleased with that outperformance in that run. the china, in particular, deployments last year were very large.
and so as you pointed out, i think a number of companies are going through a similar digestion, but we do expect this business to accelerate and continue to outperform for a couple of reasons. i think one is our lead customer has certainly gained momentum in some of the markets that we'll be ramping in the second half, plus in calendar '22. so that's a positive sign. and there's also -- within them, there's programs where we have new sockets where content is also -- it's new content for us.
and then we have our second customer, nokia, which, this year, will be our first full year -- not even a full year. it's ramping this year into production with our baseband product. it will be a full year in '22. and then we have additional content with that customer, which was all publicly announced last year that will start to phase in after that.
so i think there's -- yeah, there's a number of marvell -- very specific marvell drivers with some of the most important companies in this space. and then even looking beyond that horizon, we've got really good traction with our oran initiatives. and we're in the mix on a number of very important sockets across all the oems that will keep driving growth here. so we feel very good about our 5g position that it can continue to outperform and accelerate going forward.
jean hu -- chief financial officer
yeah, ross, on the other question, just a reminder, other is largely for our printer business today. and quarter over quarter, it's actually going to be just up a couple of million dollars sequentially.
ross seymore -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of tore svanberg from stifel. your question, please.
tore svanberg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yes. thanks. and i'll keep it to the one question. so matt, you referenced some strategic meetings with inphi.
i know the deal is not going to close for a few more months. but from those meetings, could you perhaps give us a few examples on how the two companies are combining the ip to go out and target some new opportunities?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so yeah, let me give you a little background on what we did, how we're thinking about it and maybe some broad brush strokes on the opportunities. certainly, we're not -- we're still two separate companies, so i think more to come on that, tore. and some of the opportunities as well, some are pronounced and some are nuanced, but the bottom line is, first of all, ford and lloyd, the founder of n5, put together just an incredible team.
i mean, we've now gotten exposure through this process, which was great. their key engineering leadership, their key product marketing people, their business unit leaders and also same on our side. so it was really a very, very powerful, i'd say, joint meeting where we reviewed all of our various businesses, and we were able to identify a number of exciting areas where we certainly can work together. in general, the technology is obviously very complementary, but we do sit in the same systems.
and certainly, there's things like process road map and customers where we can go in together. so i'd say the net -- and the way we -- the reason we did this is we're really approaching this as a merger with the inphi team. and so we're going to bring them in, and we're going to look at really the combined company spending and identify jointly the best opportunities to get the highest roi and drive the best top line growth. and so what we found is we believe this is going to give us an opportunity to allocate some additional spending in some very targeted areas within the inphi team to actually accelerate some of their ambitions and growth.
and i can tell you from our side and my entire management team, multiple layers down, is very excited about the team coming over and their product lines and their prospects. and i look forward in future meetings to actually start articulating some of these in a lot more detail. but i'd just end it by saying thematically, combined, i think we've become much more important and much more relevant in the cloud hyperscale market than either company would have been independently. and i think, together, given the system-level complexity that these companies are dealing with, the cutting-edge performance they need, the deep sort of real technical and strategic partnerships they're looking for, we believe that this can be as important and strategic a market and probably larger market combined than 5g.
and so i think we're -- our strategy we laid out at the investor day, which was a little bit before inphi, but certainly was on our mind, which was really think about 5g as this wave of growth that we're seeing right now, the cloud then following that. and certainly, inphi layering in will accelerate our opportunity there. and then we have a lot more to share at a later date as well on our automotive opportunities, which is starting with ethernet, but it's now branching out into other aspects of marvell, including storage and security, compute, asics, and some other additional networking type of solutions. so all in all, i think the combined company is going to be very, very relevant in this cloud market, especially.
tore svanberg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thank you for that context.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of christopher rolland from susquehanna. your question please.
christopher rolland -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
thanks for the question. going to the asic side of the business, maybe piggybacking on some that have already been asked, but maybe you can talk about where this new design pipeline is coming from? is it storage? is it networking? is it compute? where are you getting the most traction there? and then as we look out, let's say, five years, matt, what percent of your business do you think or expect or would like asics to be?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think -- let me give you the backdrop. so i think the exciting part of our asic opportunity, and i would even broaden that to say our broader, i'd call it, advanced technology opportunity, of which asic is certainly an important piece. this would be what i would call our five -- just think about our five-nanometer platform as its own potential growth opportunity.
we publicly announced this in august of 2020, but we have been securing designs in this technology as early as end of 2019 type of time frame, early 2020. and so since that time frame, we've grown this design opportunity funnel to be very significant size relative to anything we've seen before on a single sort of process node. and it's very broad, chris. i think that's sort of the point i want to make.
i think there are -- if you go by market, certainly, there are 5g designs that we've already won and secured as an example there, and there's a large pipeline in front of us as people move from sort of 12-, 14-, 16-nanometer type of products, and they want to go all the way down. there are significant cloud hyperscale opportunities, some of those i mentioned earlier. but also in enterprise, we've had good success in promoting our octeon-based cpus into that market. that would be more of a standard product, by the way, not a custom.
and then even in storage, we've seen some very important customers in the storage market take a leadership role and work directly with us to develop state-of-the-art flash controllers for things like data center and enterprise applications using our five-nanometer technology. so it's -- this is much broader, chris, than just, oh, well, marvell has got a five-nanometer thing and they can go offer asics with a standard sort of model, and that will generate some revenue. it's really a transformational platform for us, which we're -- we could use for traditional asics. but increasingly, we're finding that these custom opportunities that people come and ask us for, several of them have now converted into marvell products where we're designing the entire product based on a spec.
and designing the product for them rather than -- and then, of course, there's more value that can be captured there. it's a more stickier engagement. and these are all very significant type of opportunities, in particular, in the cloud market. so i hope that's helpful context to sort of broaden it because certainly, we had a view maybe going back to when we bought avera.
hey, this will be great. we can have a nice big asic business, but it's turned into much more than that. and yes, and we're excited to talk about that in the coming quarters as we close designs and we take advantage of the pipeline that our sales team and our business units have developed, which is extremely strong.
christopher rolland -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
and what percent do you think it could be in five years?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
that's hard to say. and i think it depends on what you mean, like is it -- how much is asic versus how much is semi-custom versus how much is in 5g, but this is clearly a -- this is the future growth of the company. so you should assume these things are multibillion type of opportunities for the whole platform going forward, right? i mean, this is where we're going to be the growth engine of the company. so it's very significant.
these are not nichey one-off designs that we're winning that will kind of be a nice sort of headline news product, this is going to be really the driver of the company's revenue growth. so in aggregate, all of this becomes a very significant portion of our future company revenue.
christopher rolland -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
excellent.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of joe moore from morgan stanley. your question, please.
joe moore -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you. in terms of the constraints, i wonder if you could talk to -- you mentioned substrates as being maybe the biggest factor and then certain geometry wafers, which geometries are those? and then just as a bigger picture aspect to this, it seems like from marchex, that networking chips in general are tighter than other things, even though there's tightness in graphics and that you have to be able to grow quite a bit. is there something different with substrates and things like that, where this is affecting the infrastructure businesses more than it's affecting other areas?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think on the first question, joe, it's hard to say. i mean, this is such a dynamic environment, right? we've been reviewing every part of the supply chain as a team for months, right? and we're finding that we solve one issue and then another one seems to appear. and if you even go back to our last earnings call, i remember there were some questions there like, tell me about the supply chain issue and you fast-forward three months and the u.s.
automotive industry is in disarray because they can't get chips, right? so things are moving at a very rapid pace. i will note that we're supplying quite well actually on our automotive products, so don't make that comment with marvell. that's more of a general one. but we do see point capacity stress with complex substrates, for sure.
we see some of the ""older nodes"" and what i would mean by that is this isn't sort of five, seven-nanometer type of things. these are more going back to, call it, 28 and above, right, that have different pain points that companies are working with. and that's where a lot of this automotive, i think, tends to sit. so it's -- there's not a silver bullet.
it's just going to take a lot of hard work. and even things like -- i think i noted in the last call, things like wire bonders have -- those lead times have stretched. so our osats are just having a hard time keeping up. now they're spending money, and they're certainly adding capacity, and we're engaged in that planning process to make sure we're ok, but that's maybe a little bit more detail on that side.
and then what was your second question?
joe moore -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah. no. that was basically the question is just, is there something different --
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
oh, on the networking chips, yes.
joe moore -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah. i mean, graphics chips are in short supply, but people are kind of growing 20% faster than they thought and then constrained at that level where it seems like the networking shortages are just as severe. we're hearing about them from your customers, but demand doesn't seem to be on that kind of crazy trajectory.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. it's hard for me to benchmark since we're not in the graphics business. i know that's a little bit of a different scale. but certainly, the complexity level of these products when you look at just the complexity of the substrates alone, i mean, i think the number of layers, if you go to these advanced products in, call it, 14, 16 nanometer and below, have probably doubled in terms of the complexity of the substrates.
and they're just extremely large die. these are thousands of ios and some of these die are virtually the size of a credit card. so you've just got very low die per wafer, and you got a lot of demand. and it's been difficult for people to keep up.
there's also test constraints that the test times on these things are very long because of the complexity of the product. so there's just -- maybe that's the reason. but i run an analog business and now i run marvell, but i've never run a graphics business. i don't --
joe moore -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah. no. i'm just trying to compare and contrast. just comparing and contrasting.
that's very helpful. thank you so much.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, you're welcome.
operator
thank you. and our final question for today comes from the line of srini pajjuri from smbc nikko. your question, please.
srini pajjuri -- smbc nikko securities -- analyst
thanks for squeezing me in. hey, jean, i have a question on opex and also on the margins. i guess as you ramp some of this five-nanometer designs and as you engage more in five nanometer, i'm just wondering how you're thinking about opex, if there's going to be more volatility as we go forward? and also, i guess, as we go to second half of this year and beyond, and 5g and asics become a bigger portion of your revenue, do you see any further opportunity to improve your gross margins from these levels? thank you.
jean hu -- chief financial officer
yeah. on opex, right, our team has done excellent job to manage operating expense. but you're right, there are some variabilities quarter over quarter due to the project cost. and also, we are working with our customer together.
sometimes the customer portion of it may accelerate or push out, so there are variations, but i feel quite comfortable. look at the overall for fiscal '22, we can manage the opex at the same time investing. so for instance, our q4, our opex is slightly higher because of project cost, but we'll manage it overall. on the margin side, i think our no.
1 objective is really to meet the demand. we have significant opportunities for the company, and we have increased the demand across all the growth platforms, as matt mentioned, the 5g, cloud and also automotive. so that's actually our no. 1 objective, and we certainly will continue to improve gross margin and make sure we get the most margin dollars out of our business.
srini pajjuri -- smbc nikko securities -- analyst
got it. thanks, jean.

2022-Q1,MRVL,2021-06-07 16:45:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good afternoon, and welcome to the marvell technologies fiscal first-quarter 2022 earnings conference call. all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [operator instructions] after today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. please note that this event is being recorded.
i would now like to turn the conference over to mr. ashish saran, vice president of investor relations. please go ahead, sir.
ashish saran -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. welcome to marvell's first-quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings call. joining me today are matt murphy, marvell's president and ceo; and jean hu, our cfo. i would like to remind everyone that certain comments made today may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's expectations.
please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the sec today and posted on our website at, as well as our most recent 10-k and 10-q filings. we do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. during our call today, we will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures. a reconciliation between our gaap and non-gaap financial measures is available on our website in the investor relations section.
we closed the acquisition of inphi on april 20, 2021. therefore, the results we reported today for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 include the results from the inphi business for 10 days of the fiscal quarter. revenue from the acquired inphi business is reported within our networking product group. to provide a direct comparison to the first fiscal quarter business outlook we provided in our earnings call on march 3, we have provided a table in our earnings press release, which breaks out marvell stand-alone non-gaap results for the first quarter, excluding partial quarter results from the acquired inphi business.
we are providing marvell's stand-alone non-gaap results on a one-time basis. as a reminder, there are no gaap results for stand-alone marvell. matt and jean's first-quarter commentary will primarily focus on the non-gaap results from the stand-alone marvell business as it relates to the guidance we provided on our march 3 call understated otherwise. please note that the financial outlook for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 includes expected results from the acquired inphi business for the full quarter.
on the subject of revue reporting, as you know, we currently report revenue in three broad product groups: networking, storage, and other. however, as you may recall, during our investor day presentations, we also describe our addressable opportunities by end market. this market focus will provide more information and transparency about the key growth drivers of our business and was received positively by the investment community. we are now taking steps to align our external revenue reporting to our end markets.
we believe this will provide investors with a better and more granular understanding of our business. accordingly, we will discontinue reporting revenue by product group and instead, we will report revenue from the following five end markets: data center, carrier, enterprise networking, auto industrial, and consumer. please note, we will implement this change starting next quarter when we report results for our second quarter of fiscal 2022. in that earnings release, we will report revenue by end market for the second quarter and provide historical end market revenue data for the preceding seven quarters.
mass discussion of business results and expectations are also transitioned to this end market view. in our second-quarter earnings results, on a one-time basis, we will provide revenue results under both the current product group process and the new end market process. with that, i'll turn the call over to matt for his comments on our performance. matt? 
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. i'll start with a summary of our first-quarter gaap results for the combined company. revenue for the combined company was $832 million. gaap gross margin was 50.2% and loss per diluted share was $0.13.
i'm now going to review stand-alone marvell non-gaap results, excluding those of inphi. we began fiscal 2022 on a strong note, delivering solid results in the first quarter, driven by the strength of our core businesses and continued operational excellence. marvell stand-alone revenue for the first quarter was $810 million, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. revenue grew 17% year on year, driven by robust growth in both our networking and storage businesses.
higher revenue, coupled with stronger gross margin and lower operating expenses drove non-gaap earnings per share of $0.02 above the midpoint of guidance to $0.29. non-gaap eps grew 61% year on year, demonstrating the significant operating leverage in our business model. i'm pleased that marvell delivered the fourth straight quarter of double-digit year-on-year revenue growth despite industrywide supply constraints that have tightened considerably over the same time period. in fact, our year-on-year growth rate accelerated in the first quarter on strong and growing demand across all our end markets, and i'm pleased that our operations team rose to the challenge in a difficult environment.
but we have more work to do. the majority of our products are proprietary and sole-sourced, and demand for our solutions continues to grow. we need to support our customers with a flexible supply chain capable of delivering the upside demand within a reasonable lead time, something that has not been feasible this year. to further improve our supply, chris koopmans, who has played an instrumental role in marvell's ongoing transformation, has been appointed as our chief operations officer to lead our global operations and supply chain organization, in addition to his current role leading marketing and business operations.
chris is leveraging his deep understanding of our markets and customers to prioritize and align supply to our key growth initiatives. we are extending our planning horizons, strengthening strategic supplier partnerships, and using our balance sheet where appropriate, to build more flexibility. our suppliers value marvell's focus on data infrastructure as a source of sustainable growth, driven by favorable secular trends compared to other cyclical end markets. and as a result, they are excited to partner with us.
looking to the second half of this fiscal year, we are confident that we have secured sufficient supply to enable accelerating year-on-year revenue growth for stand-alone marvell, above that of the first half. we expect supply to further improve next fiscal year. in a few moments, i'll discuss inphi's business, where we also expect strong revenue growth throughout the year. moving on to our merger with inphi and related organizational changes.
we received regulatory approval to merge with inphi in april, earlier than originally anticipated, and began integrating the talented inphi team. we have emerged from this transaction as a u.s. corporation, which we believe better positions the combined company for long-term success. reflecting the larger scale and broader scope of marvell, several key inphi executives have my direct staff.
loi nguyen and nariman yousefi will manage the inphi businesses and have also increased their scope to include additional marvell businesses. laurence tse, inphi's central engineering leader, will manage marvell's analog and mixed-signal organization. in addition, raghib hussain has taken on a broader elevated role as president, products, and technologies, to drive strategy alignment and growth across the company. similar to our prior acquisitions, we expect the infusion of inphi talent will add scale and further strengthen the capabilities of the combined company.
we have built a world-class management team with deep technical expertise, vast industry experience, and a proven track record in driving growth and value creation. let me move on now to discussing our two businesses in more detail. networking. first, for marvell stand-alone networking, revenue grew during the first -- revenue during the first quarter was $476 million, consistent with our outlook for strong growth.
on a sequential basis, revenue grew 9%, underpinned by growth in all key product lines with the exception of 5g asics. however, overall 5g revenue continued to grow, marking our seventh straight consecutive quarter of growth. year-on-year growth was a very robust 21% in networking with solid contributions from multiple end markets. in 5g, growth was driven by standard and semi-custom product shipments to samsung and nokia, partially offset by a decline in asics as deployments in china paused.
in cloud networking, we continue to benefit from strong customer demand for our smartnic dpus. in automotive, we are growing rapidly with our ethernet product shipping into multiple model year 2021 vehicles. our enterprise networking business also delivered solid results, extending the double-digit growth trend established last year despite a soft end market. this performance is a result of our expanding market position, driven by our refreshed ethernet switches and multi-gigabit phys.
to the extent the enterprise spending recovers later this year, that would be another tailwind to our business. not only are we winning and ramping in the access, aggregation, and core switching markets, we are also making in-roads in the data center with our feature-rich and scalable multi-terabit family of switches. as a reminder, these products leverage a modular architecture to deliver multiple capacity points from 3.2 terabits per second to 12.8 terabits for a broad range of data center applications. we have been winning new sockets and expect these design wins to start contributing meaningfully of higher levels of revenue next fiscal year.
let me now discuss the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 for our networking business. this outlook includes revenue from inphi's complete electro-optics platform comprised of their industry-leading pam and coherent dsps, high-performance broadband analog drivers, and tias highly integrated silicon photonics and data center interconnect modules. for the second quarter, we anticipate networking revenue to grow just over 70% year on year. let me walk you through the growth expectations from the marvell and inphi businesses implicit in this guidance.
we expect marvell's stand-alone networking to drive strong year-on-year revenue growth in the high teens on a percentage basis and be up slightly on a sequential basis. similar to the prior quarter, we expect broad growth from multiple products offset a pause in china 5g. this outlook reflects ongoing supply constraints, which have been more acute for our networking products. however, as i discussed earlier, we believe we have line of sight to supply improvements later this year and next year to support our growth plans.
as we look forward, we expect a strong second-half ramp compared to the first half in stand-alone marvell's networking business, including an acceleration in our 5g business from both our own product ramps and an increase in 5g adoption in the u.s. and other regions. from the acquired inphi business, we expect approximately $215 million in revenue in our second fiscal quarter. i am very pleased that at this level of revenue, we expect the inphi business will be accretive to our non-gaap earnings in the first full quarter as a combined company.
we expect this business to drive strong growth above marvell's growth rate benefiting from the demand for high-speed connectivity inside and between data centers and in the carrier market. let me briefly discuss inphi's data center growth drivers. inside data centers, as demand for bandwidth continues to increase, a generational shift is under way from traditional nrz signaling to more advanced pulse amplitude modulation, or pam, which enables a significant increase in bandwidth. this is one of the biggest changes in data center connectivity, and inphi is leading this industry transition.
inphi is the largest provider of pam4 dsps to the optical connectivity market, having shipped millions of devices. as the market continues to transition to higher speeds, 400 gig adoption has been accelerating. and last year, we started sampling our next-generation 800-gig solution, which is seeing strong traction with customers. in collaboration with microsoft, inphi pioneered pluggable transceiver technology to directly interconnect regional cloud data centers at lower cost, complexity, and power compared to traditional optical transport solutions.
the first product, colorz, use pam4 technology to enable 100 gig per wavelength, which could be multiplexed to support up to 4 terabits per second of bandwidth over a single fiber for data center interconnect or dci applications. this product has been shipping in volume and established inphi's leadership in this category. building on the success of colorz, which was deployed primarily by one hyperscaler last year, inphi introduced colorz 2, the industry's first pluggable transceiver compatible with the 400zr industry standard, which enables 400 gig per wavelength using coherent technology. we expect to maintain our leadership position in the dci market and project that colorz 2 deployments will start this year.
with an industry-standard now in place, we see multiple hyperscalers and additional customers adopting pluggable zr technology, which creates a significantly larger revenue opportunity for our dci platform. turning now to our storage business. storage revenue for the first quarter was $303 million, growing 17% year on year and declining 7% sequentially. results were better than our expectations as we benefited from stronger demand for ssd controllers.
the stellar year-on-year results were driven by ramps in our custom diy ssd controller programs and ongoing growth in cloud demand for nearline drives, which benefited from -- benefited our hdd controllers and pre-amplifiers. the sequential decline was primarily due to our fiber channel business. looking to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect storage to deliver another strong performance driven by the nearline hdd and data center ssd markets. we are projecting revenue to grow year on year in the mid-teens and in the double digits sequentially on a percentage basis.
our recent results and expectations for ongoing growth reflect the significant transformation of our storage business. in our hdd business, data center has become the largest revenue contributor relative to other markets. our preampflier business is now ramped up to an annualized run rate of over $50 million, and we believe that we can more than double this run rate. we are continuing to step up the technology cadence for our ssd controllers, and we recently introduced the industry's first pcie gen5 ssd controller family designed to address the data movement and security challenges in cloud infrastructure.
we are excited to collaborate directly with hyperscalers and nand vendors to bring this leading solution to market. in addition, i'm pleased to announce that a key nand oem has chosen to partner with marvell to develop custom pcie gen 5 and gen 6 ssd controllers for their enterprise and cloud solutions. the gen 6 product will be built on our five-nanometer process. in the storage market, this is a quantum leap and process node cadence and is a testament to marvell's advanced technology platform.
we expect to leverage the leading-edge ip we are developing to be deployed in additional advanced node storage solutions. our strategy to refocus this business on the data center market has been a huge success. data center has grown to over 60% of storage revenue from less than 20% in fiscal 2017. in closing, we had a great start to fiscal 2022, and i'm very excited about the growth prospects in front of us as a combined company.
when we announced the acquisition of inphi, we increased our long-term target model for revenue growth to 12% to 16% annually. i'm pleased that our recent results and near-term expectations are, in fact, currently trending above the high end of this target range. this is primarily due to our own product cycles, combined with sustainable secular growth trends in our data infrastructure markets. the acquisition of inphi has increased our exposure to the data center, which is our largest end market.
and within that, cloud is the largest growth opportunity across marvell, significantly bigger than our 5g opportunity. inphi has already established a strong position within cloud, addressing an opportunity growing at a 60% plus cagr. the marvell organic opportunity in cloud is also substantial, which we are addressing with our merchant, semi-custom, and flexible asic model for compute, networking, acceleration, security, and storage applications. at our analyst day last year, we discussed this opportunity growing at an expected 19% cagr to over $5 billion by calendar 2023.
the adoption of arm processors in servers continues to gain traction, and this further increases our cloud opportunity. we expect cloud revenue for the combined company to grow rapidly. as marvell's five-nanometer products come to market, we expect a substantial step-up in our cloud revenue. i'm very pleased to report that we have been recently awarded a number of significant design wins, leveraging our advanced technology platform.
respecting customer confidentiality, we will not be in a position to discuss any specific win. they are with multiple customers across a variety of applications and business models. we expect these products to start ramping into production in calendar 2023, achieving peak revenue in the calendar 2024 to 2025 time frame. as i approach my five-year anniversary at marvell, i've never felt stronger about our growth prospects, and i'm grateful to all our employees who have worked hard to transform the company to position us for what we believe will be a very exciting future.
with that, i'll turn the call over to jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook. 
jean hu -- chief financial officer
thanks, matt. good afternoon, everyone. i'll start with our gaap results for the first quarter for the combined company followed by marvell's stand-alone non-gaap performance and conclude with our outlook. please note, our gaap financials include 10 days of results from the inphi business and the impact of purchase price comping items, share-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, vehicle segment, and acquisition-related costs.
revenue was $832 million. gaap gross margin was 50.2%. gaap operating expenses were $500 million. gaap operating loss was $82 million.
gaap loss per diluted share was $0.13. turning to the balance sheet. inventory at the end of the first quarter was $538 million, which include the impact of setting up inphi's inventory by $187 million due to purchase price accounting. we amortized the $40 million of this step-up into cost of goods sold in the first quarter, and we anticipate amortizing the remaining balance by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2022.
during the quarter, we paid $140 million in cash for fees related to the inphi transaction. excluding those one-time payments, our cash flow generation from operations would have been $100 million. as a reminder, our cash flow generation has seasonality and tend to be lower in our first fiscal quarter due to the payment for annual cash bonus to employees. in the first quarter, we distributed $41 million to shareholders in dividends.
we exited the quarter with $523 million in cash and short-term investments. our long-term debt was $4.7 billion and currently carries the blended interest rate of approximately 2.5%. our gross debt-to-ebitda ratio was 3.9, and net debt-to-ebitda ratio was 3.4, based on combined pro forma ebitda. we continue to have a strong investment-grade credit profile.
our capital allocation priorities over the next 12 months are to maintain our current dividend level and utilize our free cash flow to pay down debt used for the acquisition for inphi. we believe we can drive strong revenue growth and free cash flow generation to quickly achieve our target ratio of two times gross debt-to-ebitda. i'll now move on to stand-alone marvell non-gaap results. as ashish had noted earlier, we are providing stand-alone marvell results on a one-time basis this quarter because our previously provided financial outlook for the first quarter excluded any impact of the inphi acquisition.
reconciliation of our stand-alone and combined performance, as well as gaap to non-gaap results available in our press release. stand-alone marvell revenue in the first quarter was $810 million, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. networking represented 60% of our revenue with storage contributing 36%. revenue from other accounted for 4%.
non-gaap gross margin was 64.3%, above our guidance and the 150-basis-point improvement from a year ago, primarily due to better product mix and our team's continued effort to drive operational excellence. non-gaap operating expenses were $297 million as we continue to tightly manage our expenses while investing for growth. non-gaap operating margin was 27.7%, an 810-basis-point increase from a year ago, demonstrating the strong operating leverage in our business model. non-gaap earnings per diluted share was $0.29, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.02, and is up more than 60% year over year.
let me now comment on our plan for operating expenses going forward. after closing the inphi acquisition, the starting pro forma operating expense trend rate for the combined company was approximately $375 million per quarter. we expect our operating expenses to grow annually in the range of 4% to 5% as we continue to invest to support our long-term growth, including incremental r&d spending for inphi. however, we expect to more than offset this operating expense growth through deal-related synergies.
we expect total cost of synergies for $125 million from the inphi acquisition with approximately $100 million coming from operating expenses. the midpoint of our second-quarter opex guidance of $372.5 million includes $10 million of synergy achievement on a run rate basis. we expect to achieve half of our targeted opex synergy exiting fiscal 2022 and the full synergy realization by the third quarter of fiscal 2023. we'll continue to be disciplined in allocating resources and expect to drive revenue growth significantly higher than opex growth to deliver strong earnings expansion.
the remaining $25 million of cost synergies will come from cost goods sold, which we expect to start to take effect in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and be fully realized by the third quarter of the same year. our team has a strong track record of integration execution from prior acquisitions. i'm very confident about our synergy achievement plan. now turning to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, which included a full quarter of inphi.
we are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.065 billion, plus or minus 3%. at the middle point of this outlook, we expect approximately $250 million of revenue contribution from the inphi business. as matt mentioned earlier, at this level of revenue, we expect the inphi business will be accretive to our non-gaap earnings. we expect our gaap gross margin in the range of 34.8% to 37.5%.
we project our non-gaap gross margin to be approximately 64%. in a tight supply environment, we expect our non-gaap gross margin in the near future to remain around this level, subject to product mix change in any given quarter. we project our gaap operating expense to be in the range of $633 million to $643 million. we anticipate our non-gaap operating expenses to be in the range of $370 million to $375 million.
following the inphi acquisition, the company domicile changed from bermuda to delaware. based on tax deductions and credits we have, we expect our non-gaap tax rate to remain at 5% for the remainder of the fiscal year. and the current tax laws, we expect our non-gaap tax rate to increase by approximately 100 basis points each year for the next couple of years. we expect other expenses will be approximately $34.5 million, which include interest expense of $33 million.
we expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be 822 million. and our diluted weighted average share outstanding will be $835 million. as a result, we anticipate gaap loss per share to be $0.37, plus or minus $0.04. we expect non-gaap income per diluted share to be $0.31, plus or minus $0.03.

thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] and our first question today will come from john pitzer with credit suisse. please go ahead.
john pitzer -- credit suisse -- analyst
yeah. good afternoon, guys. congratulations on the results. matt, i'm just sort of curious, when you look at sort of this quarter and the guide, can you help us better understand relative to your ability to capture supply? did deficiencies grow this quarter? you did a nice job in the core networking business growing almost 9% sequentially, but i'm trying to get a sense as to whether or not demand continues to outstrip supply.
and if you could help us understand, is this a wafer issue? or are there other issues? and as you think about resolving them in the back half of the year, why so confident?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. great, john. thanks for the question. yes, we're very happy with the results in networking.
i mean, as you pointed out, that was a sequential number. so clearly, business has been very, very good for us in networking. and certainly, year over year, to do 20% plus is great. the demand, john, continues in q2 and beyond.
we're continuing to work on improving the supply on our networking products. as it turns out, and as you've probably seen, the complexity on our networking business in terms of the manufacturing, cycle time supply chain is much more complex and challenging than on the storage side. so we've been able to meet some more of the upsides on storage than we have networking. but no, john, business continues to be strong.
we do have line of sight to the supply improving in the second half, which is encouraging. and that's why we're continuing to be very bullish about the outlook for our overall networking business because the demand is clearly there, and we've now got supply coming online in the back half, as well as into next year. so things are improving for sure.
operator
and our next question will come from vivek arya with bank of america securities. please go ahead.
vivek arya -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. matt, i had one more and to kind of extend that question into the second half visibility from two aspects. one is the supply aspect, that is supply coming online gradually. or are you planning to see perhaps a faster improvement on the supply side? and the other perspective on this is how much of your second-half growth, fiscal year growth is dependent on enterprise and china 5g recovery, which have tended to be quite volatile?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure, vivek. yeah. i think -- look, in this environment, in general, supply is coming in, not in large chunks. although i would say given the ramp we had been planning for some time, in our case, you know, we do see more significant amount of supply coming in, in the second half.
so that will improve, and we have visibility of that, both on the wafer side, as well as on the back-end side. and at the same time, as we ramp our supply position, as i mentioned to john, the demand side continues to outstrip our ability to supply at all, but we're making good progress there. on your second question. in both cases, both in enterprise, as well as china 5g, those are not comprehended to have market-related comebacks in that time frame.
on enterprise, as you've seen, i mean, we've been growing that business well above double digit for some time, including in our q1, and we do anticipate that to continue. now that's mostly on the back of our own product cycles, ok? and we've been very successful, i think, in our enterprise and campus switching, also in our phy business. and so that continues. so that's -- and by the way, and what's been viewed as a very soft market, both by the oems, as well as other semiconductor peers.
so if that end market improves with return to work and vaccinations improving, that would be a pretty significant tailwind on our business. as it relates to 5g in china, maybe just to kind of frame it in the bigger picture, i think, first, our own team internally, i want to give them credit, they did a good job for, in the first half, telling us last year that the mapping out the digestion phase, which is what's happened, so that's actually been in line with our plan. and we're not necessarily counting on a big recovery in that in the second half. if it does, that would be great.
but just to frame it, vivek, in the bigger picture, the -- our 5g business and exposure in china is actually less than 20% of our overall 5g business, both now and even going forward. and in fact, it probably slowly becomes a smaller percentage over time as our new oems ramp up and some of these other initiatives kick in. so again, either of those two came back very strong, that would also be a tailwind on our business.
vivek arya -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks, matt.
operator
and our next question will come from timothy arcuri with ubs. please go ahead.
timothy arcuri -- ubs -- analyst
thanks a lot, matt, i know it's probably early to ask this question, but can you give us a sense of sort of what kind of synergies you might see on the revenue side? i know you're not putting any of those into the model, but can you talk about that? and then i guess also, jean, i was just wondering if you can talk about what the normalized gross margin is. i know you're guiding to 64%, but it sounds like that's still being hampered by some constraints. so i'm kind of wondering what is the right normalized number if you didn't have those. thanks.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, tim, i'll take the first part, and then we'll hand it to jean. so yes, as you noted, you know, historically, we've -- just by practice, not tried to articulate or size revenue synergies when we announced the deal. it's just very hard to do. and quite frankly, it's very hard to even measure in the rearview mirror.
but that being said, you know, on all of these transactions we've done, we can look back and we can actually point to cases where one plus one was way over two. and it kind of comes in two pieces. the first is really what i would call the customer revenue synergy, tim, which would be we have products that we can sell, for example, into 5g or the cloud, and inphi, in this case, would as well. and in those discussions, the notion that we can be a better supplier together really comes together.
i mean if you remember back in the -- after the cavium transaction, i think that was very significant, what happened with -- in 5g and with samsung, where together, we were able to get effectively the whole platform, where a part we had actually very little content. so i do -- i'm very encouraged by what we see. i think customers really like the combination to a person, and those are very strong. and i believe we will see cases we can point to.
it's already under way. the second part of it is really more of a technical one, which is how do we actually incorporate the intellectual property of the two companies, put it together, and deliver better solutions. those discussions are also going well, in particular with the inphi serdes, ip as it relates to our asic business, our road map into co-packaged optics, and our vision of optics everywhere and not just copackaging and with the switch, but also in things like ai and ml asics and dpus. so that's going to be a very critical piece of the puzzle as we enter these complex markets and more and more the connectivity moves to electro-optic solution.
so that, i think, tim, is -- we're very, very excited about all that. i think it's going to work out very well on both of those fronts i mentioned. let me hand it over to jean to cover the second question.
jean hu -- chief financial officer
tim, on your gross margin question, as you remember, when we announced the inphi deal, we actually guided the combined company gross margin to be in the range of 64% to 66%. we are actually very pleased with our q1 gross margin performance. marvell stand-alone actually achieved 64.3% under a very tight supply chain environment. as we said before, inphi actually is accretive to our gross margin.
i think the dynamics, as all you know, is supply chain is very tight. and we are trying to really manage it through the supply chain challenge, but we do think the combined company with the inphi margin higher than 65%, we're going to trend higher going forward when we combine both companies, drive the top-line revenue growth.
operator
and our next question will come from blayne curtis with barclays. please go ahead.
blayne curtis -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thanks for taking my question. just curious on the storage outlook, i heard you say nearline in ssd. is that kind of the seasonal ramp of diy and any other drivers to point out? and i'm just curious on fiber channel spend kind of yoyo.
is that going back in july as well?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yes. great question, blayne, on storage. so a couple of things. so on the ssd side, yes, that's actually multiple diy programs now.
those are kicking in, in various end markets, and we see that trend being obviously way up year over year this year, but growing strongly into next year. so i think that strategy to really work closely with some of these system-level oems, whether it be in the cloud or other applications, it's a pretty compelling business model. so that one is going well. on the cloud or on the nearline side, yes, i mean, i think if you just look at the performance of these large cloud properties and how they're performing in terms of their own revenue growth, there's certainly a scaling that goes on with storage.
so the need for increased capacity in cold storage continues. we're well-positioned with that with our controllers and our preamplifers actually, which is a new revenue stream for us as well. so that's still continuing, and that's very strong. and then finally, the fiber channel, it was one of our most stable businesses, blayne, going back even when cavium owned it, even when it was qlogic, it.
certainly have a lot of choppiness this year with manufacturing supply disruptions in southeast asia. that's been -- that's started to stabilize. actually, fiber channel grew quarter over quarter and will continue to get better. and we hope that that will -- just by design, that should be a much more stable business.
so yeah, overall, just i think you've heard in my remarks, i mean, we're just -- it's been a journey on the storage side, and i've just got to thank our entire team for fundamentally transforming a business, which, if you go back five years ago when i showed up, and this wasn't just me, the whole management team, this was a business that was highly concentrated, hdd controllers only, selling all into two and a half-inch notebooks, ok? and that was sort of the story and the melting ice cube people were worried about. and so i'm very proud of the team when i fast forward five years, and we've now got greater than 60% of our storage business in data center and these high-performance applications and then really the bulk of the balance being in very sticky, stable markets. and the exposure to things like notebooks being de minimis, i think it's been a great transformation story. and the fact that we're having calls talking about our storage business growing double digits and continuing to do that is a great effort.
and by the way, we're not milking this business either. i mean, we've been very aggressive to move our platform to five-nanometer, which effectively jumped at least a node for most people, probably for most people with two or three nodes. but for these high-performance applications, blayne, especially in the data center, you get tremendous power savings by doing this. so that's going to be a first step into a broader platform of products in storage, as well as in our traditional networking businesses like processors and switch chips.
blayne curtis -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
thanks, matt.
operator
and our next question will come from ross seymore with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
ross seymore -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks a lot. looking forward to hearing the end market split last quarter, so thanks proactively for doing that. matt, i want to go to the networking business again.
and the last four quarters has kind of been up 10% then flat, up 10% and now guided flat again. overall, year-over-year growth is really, really strong. so no complaints, but is that lumpiness something that's just inherent to the markets that you're addressing? was it supply driven? and perhaps more importantly, you talked about an acceleration in the back half of the year. can you just talk about a few of the marvell-specific drivers that will allow that acceleration? and do you expect that lumpiness to go away as the breadth of the business improves internally and with the addition of inphi?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. great questions. so just quickly on the first one. actually, we're -- i'm pretty excited about moving to the end market reporting.
i think it's going to give investors a much clearer view of our growth drivers. it actually reflects how we think about allocating the capital of the company. i mean i've actually managed the company from a market-based philosophy from the very beginning. and so to now be able to show you our data center business, there's also peers that report those numbers, so it will give investors a sense of our relative growth rates.
and then carrier, you can capture our 5g anyway. so i think that will be a real positive thing for everybody. on the networking side, it's interesting, ross, that individually, some of these businesses are inherently lumpy. i mean i think we all know that the carrier telecom-type businesses tend to be lumpier than others.
that being said, when you blend actually our combined networking businesses across things like enterprise and carrier and even right now, automotive is reported in our networking, actually, from an end demand standpoint, you do get a smoother profile, which has all been up into the right by the way. i think in the last year, the dynamic on the quarterly moves has been more supply related than it has been just, hey, networking was up and then everybody kind of slowed down together and everybody is up. actually, business has been very strong, ross, since last year. if you recall, we started growing the company double digits year over year in q2 of last year.
so we've been on this double-digit growth rate. now we're -- it's actually accelerating. and during this time frame, if we could get more supply, it would probably look a lot -- look smoother, if you will. but i think you're right to integrate it over maybe a few quarter period, first half, second half, or even one-year period to get the full view just because the manufacturing cycle times of some of these products can be several quarters.
so if you get upside, there's a time to react. but no, if you just sort of blended end demand, ross, you'd see a very steady increase. and the nice thing is we have a very diversified business in networking. so it's spread across all these end markets, as i mentioned.
operator
and our next question will come from ambrish srivastava with bmo capital markets. please go ahead.
ambrish srivastava -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you very much, matt. i wanted to ask about a comment you made at the top of the call, which was you're feeling really confident about just starting a new phase of a multi-year growth. i just wanted to double-click on that. what are the underpinnings of that confidence? can you talk a little bit about the design wins you have on the cloud side? and then you also gave a bit of a hint when you talked about cloud being a much larger opportunity than 5g.
just kind of frame that discussion in -- with that in mind as well.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure, ambrish. i mean i would say both in the relative near term, ok, and over the next several years. i actually break it into three phases. there's the sort of second half of this year, looking into next year and the year after, and then i would say, out a few years beyond that.
i think -- and i didn't quite answer ross' question, but i'll weave it in here. his last one was what do you see in the second half? so in networking, for example, i mean, we have the 5g ramp for us will pick up, will accelerate. that's primarily due to increased adoption in the united states and deployments there plus design wins that we have won several years ago ramping into production. you've got a very strong marvell business in the cloud with our smartnic product line, that's been growing very, very nicely and will continue in the second half.
i'm surprised no one asked the question about inphi yet, but we're very pleased to guide two 15 for inphi in q2, which is, i think, well above what anybody thought. that business is also going to continue to accelerate in the second half, both on the intra-data center business in pam4, as well as the 400 zr ramp, which we think will be meaningful next year, but also starting this year. and then finally, as i mentioned, the ethernet switch and phy business, you could also throw automotive in there. i mean we got almost all of these growth drivers we mentioned continue.
so that's right in front of us. i think what i get very excited about, as you alluded to, is the design win momentum in the company has been extremely strong. and probably -- not probably, as strong as i've ever seen it in the past five years i've been here and any kind of prior record i could find. and those are things that, as we noted in my remarks, would be designs we win now that would ramp up starting probably in calendar '23, '24 and then go beyond that.
and that's also -- you should kind of tie it together with that was when our five-nanometer platform will be really in full production across multiple end customers, end markets, and end applications. so that's one that kind of layers on top of all of this and candidly, would extend beyond what we talked about at the last investor day. so i think if you draw a line between here and there, there's all kinds of goodness in different areas, ambrish, but i think we're feeling really good about the investments we made. i think the acquisitions that we did position us really well and they fit together in their own way.
and i think -- and finally, i would say that the customer go-to-market, our brand promise to our customers, the way we engage, the way we partner resonates really well in this environment. and we're just -- we're viewed as a very credible and reliable partner with scale now, especially with inphi and to really deliver the most complex critical products that our customers need.
ambrish srivastava -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
matt, i'm sorry, just a clarification. this design win momentum does not include inphi. so that would be on top of this, right? so this is what you're talking about, the organic business has been working on, right?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. this is just marvell, stand-alone. so all those comments on largest sort of design win type achievement we've seen plus the funnel, that's all from the organic marvell business, ok? starting next quarter, we're going to have the inphi team in our results and in our internal results in terms of our design win funnel and momentum. but yeah, they've done a great job, too.
i mean that's the whole other story. but i'm just saying stand-alone marvell with our five-nanometer platform and our 5g cloud strategy, automotive, all the things we articulated at the investor day, pre-inphi, that's all tracking the in line or better than we thought.

and our next question will come from harlan sur with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
harlan sur -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good afternoon, and congratulations on the results and outlook. on the newly acquired inphi business unit, it looks like inside cloud data center upgrade to 200- and 400-gig pam4 optical connectivity is accelerating as we move into the second half with two more cloud titans just starting to upgrade cycle. and then on top of that, it looks like the first one or two cloud titans are starting to fire on the data center to data center dci optical upgrade, the new 400-gig zr standard. as you mentioned, the team has a strong leadership position in both of these areas.
are you guys already starting to see this ramp in your bookings or backlog for the second half or maybe even some of these already starting to fire here in the july quarter? and it seems like we're still in the very early innings of both of these upgrade cycles, but just wanted to get your views.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, harlan. yeah. no, i think we are -- to start maybe at the end first.
we're in the early innings of both these upgrade cycles. i think your commentary overall is right. both of those are accelerating. on the pam side, i would say probably by the end of '23, certainly between -- if you draw a line between now and the end of -- i'm sorry, calendar '22, our fiscal '23, you'll see most of this conversion from these legacy nrz solutions move over.
and that's still a decent amount of the connections today. so there's a big lift between now and then. that's pretty exciting. and then, of course, you've got other hyperscalers around the world outside the u.s.
on 400 zr, that is also just at the beginning phases. i think that's going to be much more broad, obviously, than colorz was, which was 100 gig, and it was really for one customer. and that is -- both of those, we have strong backlog, bookings, visibility, heads down to plan the supply and to plan the ramp. so those are very much intact, which was really part of our deal thesis for doing it in the first place.
harlan sur -- j.p. morgan -- analyst

christopher rolland -- susquehanna financial group -- analyst
thanks for the question. matt, you did mention the pause in spending -- 5g spending, and you also did talk about china as well. but i was wondering if maybe we could talk about some of the other geographies, how they're ramping. and then in terms of your 5g lead customers, how close do you think we are to a full run rate in terms of their ramps? thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure. yeah. no, i think in general, the 5g momentum is quite strong. i think, obviously, you saw the impact on people last year with china, which was very meaningful.
and that will, by the way, over time, we're debating, is it second half or when is it? but those deployments will obviously continue. they're not done. then the u.s. is really, i think, where we're going to see a lot of traction this year.
india is a little more unclear. i think the latest is certainly trials will be conducted at the end of this year. candidly, i think, with impact of covid-19 in the country that's probably delayed things. we saw that last year.
if you remember, there was supposed to be a much larger u.s. build-out and covid delayed that. we're watching that. but no, i think, overall, it's been a very meaningful technology transition.
and so we were -- we think that's going to be very broad. we've still got a ways to go, to be honest with you. there's a lot in front of us relative to getting to full run rate with the full platform at our two lead oems. in one case, we have the platform, but they're really ramping their business based on the geographies that they participate in.
and then with our second customer, those chips are still -- a lot of those are in development, although our first products are ramping very nicely, and we're pleased to see that both those companies are participating very actively in the global 5g rollouts. so that was all positive. and yeah -- and by the way, i mean, even with china stays flat, as i mentioned, it's -- we do see a very strong second half for our 5g business. and we just came off our seventh quarter in a row of growing that business sequentially.
so it's been a real tailwind for us. i did want to just make one comment before we move to the next question. i actually misspoke earlier, there was a question about fiber channel. and i think it was ross about it being lumpy.
so i had my quarters off. so it was down -- fiber was down in q1. that was part of the lumpy down. it's going to be up in q2, and then we anticipate it -- unless there's some other disruptions, that should be a generally flat business going forward.
and obviously, in the scheme of things in the combined company, i don't -- and reported by end market, i don't anticipate we're going to be having lots of discussions about fiber channel anymore. but if something happens, we'll let you guys know.
operator
and our next question will come from gary mobley with wells fargo securities. please go ahead.
gary mobley -- wells fargo -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my question. on the topic of covid spreading in different geographies, i guess we get a little tick-up in taiwan. i'm wondering if you can share with us based on your conversations with your supply chain, whether or not you're possibly facing any production interruptions out of that region.
and then, jean, given the different moving parts in the opex, the 5% growth as you articulated over the long term and then the leaving in at the $125 million of synergies, when would you expect the quarterly opex to bottom, whether in absolute terms or relative terms that $372.5 million q2 guide? thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. gary, i'll take the first one. i think it's -- i think you're just highlighting a very important reminder for everybody on this call, who i believe probably everybody here is calling in from the united states, where things are opening up and things are feeling like they're getting back to normal. and as you point out, we're monitoring very closely the situation, not only in taiwan.
obviously, we don't have production in india, but many chip companies have significant india operations in terms of r&d. you've got other countries in southeast asia that are having outbreaks. malaysia would be one. so we're watching this very, very closely.
it's been just an unprecedented year between weather and the virus on the supply chain. but we're watching it, and that's -- we've comprehended as much as we could on any of these things into our guidance. we do that every quarter. but certainly, it's a dynamic situation.
i mean we had a water issue in taiwan recently. i guess, with the recent improvement there, some of that's backed off. so yes, it's something we've got to watch and manage very dynamically, gary, but we've comprehended all of that in our outlook. jean, do you want to answer the second question?
jean hu -- chief financial officer
yeah. ok. gary, on the opex side, given the opportunities and the revenue momentum we have been seeing in front of us, we definitely want to continue to invest. the 5% increase for next year, really, it's incorporated the marvell side, for regular increase, we typically at the 2% to 3%.
but on the inphi side, there are tremendous opportunities, so the r&d investment is higher. so we are looking really just the next year. and on the synergy side, we talk about the $100 million opex synergy achievement. the way to think about it is exiting fiscal '22, we should be able to achieve 50% of that $100 million run rate synergy.
and then as you know, q1 always seasonally opex is a little bit higher because of payroll increase in q1 than q2, q3. by the q3 time, we should get the to the run rate, which achieved the full synergy at the same time, contemplated the increase, offset the increase of the year over year. in the longer term, you should expect us to continue to focus on to grow revenue significantly faster than opex so we can expand the earnings quickly.
operator
and our next question will come from quinn bolton with needham and company. please go ahead.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
two for matt. first, sort of near term, matt, with supply, line of sight to supply increases in the second half of the year, have you been able to stabilize lead times to customers? and then my second question is kind of a longer term. with the ramp of 400- and 800-gig modules in the data center, that business potentially being even bigger than 5g for you, are you starting to get questions from customers about marvell developing its own internal switch fabric? or are customers happy for you to partner on serdes and optical co-packaging and other opportunities without owning the switch fiber?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. great. thanks, quinn. yes, on the first one, yes, certainly, we have, as i mentioned, line of sight on our supply through the end of the year and encouraged by what we're seeing also for next year as well.
look, lead times are very extended for everybody at this point. we've asked our customers for significant backlog to -- and not only the backlog, but really the detailed sort of discussion behind the backlog relative to what are the drivers, how much of it is for buffer, or how much do you have now? what are your plans so we can get better line of sight to allocate the material? and we've also worked with many of them and are in the process of doing that to really firm up those orders relative to their ability to reschedule and cancel them, but we're giving them time to sort of figure that out. so i think that's been a healthy exercise, but lead times are not coming down. they're extended, not because we want to keep them extended, but the supply chain given the -- just the volume on it, there's just queues and you just have to make sure you plan for that.
and then on the data center side, we certainly have many of the key pieces, if not almost all the key pieces to really be a big player in the cloud infrastructure side with our asics, with the pam products you mentioned, i mean, o-ran, all kinds of things. on the switch side, it's an interesting discussion because we're very aggressively promoting and developing a co-packaged optics solution that will be very much open source for the industry. so we want to be an enabler of that. we think that's going to be a good thing, whether somebody wants to do their own asic or co-packaged it with a partner.
and that's a discussion that we're having. i think we're encouraged because when you look at our -- and i noted in my comments, we introduced about 18 months ago, our multi-terabit switch family, where just as -- for a reminder, these are at 3.2, 6.4, and 12.8 terabits per second. it's a modular design architecture. now it's fully featured, which has its advantages in many applications because that's really what customers want.
on the other hand, there's a lot of optimization you can do if you really want to do a high-end switch for just speeds and feeds. and i think everything is on the table in terms of looking at all that in the context of inphi coming in, in particular. and those are just some very active discussions we're having. but the road map notwithstanding, we're extremely pleased with this high-end platform that we announced, it's done really well in the market.
revenues ramping significantly, and it's going to have a very good year next year and beyond. so i think that was a good investment that we made. and that really positioned us, quinn, as a full provider from smb switches to enterprise and campus, which is core in aggregation, all the way into the fully featured data center-type applications. so it would be logical for us to consider, you know, broadening the portfolio there.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
thanks for that detail.
operator
our next question will come from srini pajjuri with smbc nikko.
srini pajjuri -- smbc nikko securities america, inc. -- analyst
that's smbc nikko. i have a clarification question. matt, first, on the outlook for the networking segment, if my math is correct here, i think you're guiding inphi to be up at least mid-teens sequentially. and your core networking business, you said it's going to be up slightly.
so i'm just trying to understand, is the difference primarily on the supply side? or is it the demand, if you can clarify that? and then my second question, more of a longer-term question. you mentioned arm servers and obviously, you've been the leader in that market for a long time. and there's been a lot of buzz, as you mentioned lately, and some of your peers are also announcing design wins. so my question is, when can we expect to hear from marvell in terms of the design wins and revenue contribution from that market?
jean hu -- chief financial officer
srini, maybe i'll answer your first question on the inphi guide, right? so what we guide for q2 combined company inphi revenue, we said, is about $215 million. so in q1, we only had $22 million of inphi business. so you really cannot compare sequentially year over year, if you look at $215 million inphi revenue, it means almost 24% year-over-year increase. on the marvell side, i would say we guided basically, as matt has said earlier, slightly up sequentially for the marvell networking.
so if you add marvell networking plus inphi's $215 million, that's what our guide for q2 networking business. i'll let matt answer the -- your second question.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, that's right, jean. and i mean i think the bigger picture, srini, on the first one is just the blend of these two businesses are growing around 20% a year on networking kind of plus, right? so it's a very strong performance. and i noted the issues earlier on our side. on arm, it really is a trend that's been happening.
we certainly have a lot of capability in this area. there's a lot of confidentiality around this market. i can't really comment on us or the other people because i think it's also a little dangerous at times to talk about things. is it a development type of opportunity? is it a real production thing? so i think we -- and our pivot and our business model last year was really to move this business from being one where, in a lot of ways, our thunder product line really was a prototype type of capability that we enabled the whole industry on.
but in the end, what we found is nobody actually wanted to buy the standard products. so we're very pleased with the pivot we made. we have -- we believe, the best set of ip true ability to stitch together these very large, high-end complex processors. i mean if you think about the things that we're doing for 5g or for networking or even what we built on thunder, we have a second to none capability there.
and you should just assume that we're very active in this market, but in a different kind of a business model where we engage directly with these customers, there's an nre type of arrangement. we build them exactly what they want. and the use cases and the benefits of moving to arm are significant. and i think publicly, it's out there, the instances that are being moved more and more with an aws platform to graviton, which is their own, we obviously don't participate in that, but it's just a great proof point for the industry.
it's real and it's happening, arm and infrastructure, and we're -- our view is we would be the leading company for anyone to talk to about not only be able to design the chip and productize it but then to supply it in the kind of volumes that's required. it's -- that's a key part of the equation now.
srini pajjuri -- smbc nikko securities america, inc. -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and our next question will come from chris caso with raymond james. please go ahead.
chris caso -- raymond james -- analyst
yes. thank you. good afternoon. just some clarification regarding the additional supply.
and with that additional supply coming on, at what point do you expect to be back at the level where you're shipping all your customers' orders? do you think you get there by the end of the second half? or is that going to take longer?just following on from that, we've heard from a lot of others, obviously, with the tight supply conditions, order visibilities stretching out customers, or placing orders for in advance. it sounds like from your prior comments that you're not forcing those customer orders to be noncancelable at this point. maybe just clarify that a little more and talk about what additional visibility that gives you going forward.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure. yeah, chris. thanks for the question. as i noted earlier, you know, we've been growing this company double digits since a year ago, and it's only accelerating.
and as we've done that, that's been great. but candidly, we haven't made a real dent in the delinquency. and in fact, i think our business momentum is growing, but i think the demands on us are growing even faster than our supply. so we're working hard on it.
but i would say anybody that tells you in this industry that they know when this is going to get better, like, hey, it's going to happen in a quarter. it's going to -- i don't think that you're probably getting a realistic answer is my view. i think it's very dynamic. it's unprecedented.
and at this point, there are so many industries that are up and to the right and everybody is clamoring for product that -- but we're working on it. and like i said, we're the type of company, chris, that i think we're more focused on the long term, slow and steady, keep cranking it out every quarter, keep blocking and tackling through this time period. and keep making sure our customer are up. and then on your second question, no, we are ensuring that we have protection and not only protection, but i would say mutual commitment with our customers around the supply.
so we do have a large portion of our backlog, which is only getting more, to be honest, that is noncancelable. we are being somewhat flexible around building in some reschedule capability. maybe you can do it once. and we're trying to work with our customers on this, but we're having to make commitments, especially with the growth that we see in front of us, which i'm very comfortable doing, but i also want to have the backstop of my customers.
and this environment has created a dynamic where pretty much the ceo level at all of our major accounts, they're willing to engage in this type of discussion, activate their materials teams, and get everybody together so that we can plan this thing as a combined team, a marvell team and a customer team versus two independent entities off doing their own thing and the era of customers being secretive about their volumes or hiding the ball or not one you're doing just in time, that's kind of all-out the window at this point. and so the visibility is pretty good that we're getting, but we are ensuring that we -- when we're making commitments, we've got some backstop from the customers that want the product.
operator
and our next question will come from harsh kumar with piper sandler. please go ahead.
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
yeah. hey, guys. first of all, congratulation on solid results and also being so clear about all the numbers. it really helps us out.
i had a question, matt. i was wondering if you could break down your networking business. let's say, just even for core marvell organically, the split or rough color between 5g, cloud, and enterprise. and also if nokia is -- is it running at ramp? or has it got still room to run from here?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. well, harsh, all of your wishes are going to come true next quarter because we're going to break out for you in detail the data center business of marvell, which is going to have the cloud data. we're going to break up the carrier, which you'll be able -- we'll build it. and we'll talk to all of these, by the way, right? so you'll be able to get a sense of the moving pieces of 5g.
we're going to have an auto industrial, which is -- obviously, the big growth there is going to come from the automotive. and then our enterprise networking, which i think is a great proxy as well. so i think we're going to give you what you want, and we're going to give you seven quarters of history, and we're going to guide it. so you'll be like a kid in a candy store.
and then on the second question on nokia, yes, that's still ramping. you've heard their commentary. they're ramping up. we're kind of replacing their legacy solutions within their -- they have their recharge portfolio.
we're part of that. they talk openly about sort of replacing fpgas with recharge. so we're just part of that growth. and then, of course, we've got future opportunities where we're going to intersect with them with new sockets over time.
so that's still in a ramp phase though. it's still early.
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
understood. thank you, guys.

operator
good afternoon, and welcome to the marvell technology's fiscal second-quarter 2022 earnings conference call. all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [operator instructions] after today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. please note, this event is being recorded.
i would now like turn the conference over to mr. ashish saran, vice president of investor relations. please go ahead.
ashish saran -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. welcome to marvell's second-quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings call. joining me today are matt murphy, marvell's president and ceo; and jean hu, our cfo. i would like to remind everyone that certain comments made today may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations.
please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the sec today and posted on our website, as well as our most recent 10-k and 10-q filings. we do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. during our call today, we will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures. a reconciliation between our gaap and non-gaap financial measures is available in the investor relations section of our website.
as discussed during the prior quarter's earnings call, we have implemented a change in how we report revenue. starting with the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we have started to report revenue by five end markets. in our earnings press release we issued earlier today, we have provided historical and market revenue data by quarter starting with the second quarter of fiscal 2020. in this press release, we have also provided revenue results by product growth.
going forward, we intend to only report revenue by end market. in today's call, matt will comment briefly on our revenue performance by product group for the second quarter before transitioning most of his discussion through our results and expectations for each of our five end markets. with that, i'll turn the call over to matt for his comments on our performance. matt. 
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. i'll start with a summary of our second quarter gaap results. revenue was $1.076 billion, gaap gross margin was 34.6%, gaap operating loss was $267 million, and loss per diluted share was $0.34. building on the strong results we delivered in q1, our second-quarter results, which include a full quarter of inphi, were equally robust, driven by strength in our diversified end markets and continued focus on operational excellence.
revenue for the second quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance and grew 29% sequentially and 48% year over year. i am now going to review our non-gaap results for the quarter. non-gaap gross margin was 64.8%, 80 basis points better than expectation. non-gaap operating expenses were lower than expected, and we delivered $331 million in non-gaap operating income. revenue, non-gaap gross margin, and non-gaap operating income were all record achievements for marvell.
higher revenue, coupled with stronger non-gaap gross margin and lower opex, drove non-gaap earnings per share to $0.34, $0.03 above the midpoint of guidance. non-gaap eps grew 62% year over year. our non-gaap operating margin climbed above 30%, demonstrating significant operating leverage in our business model. in the second quarter, the stand-alone marvell business delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth in the high teens on a percentage basis, similar to the growth rate we saw in q1. i am also pleased with the strength of our inphi business, which delivered revenue above expectations and was accretive to our non-gaap earnings in its first full quarter within marvell. on a product group basis, networking revenue was $702 million, above the midpoint of expectations, and grew 41% sequentially, and 73% year over year.
storage revenue was $342 million, also above the midpoint of expectations, and grew 13% sequentially, and 18% year over year. our storage business, which i would note does not include any contributions from inphi, is now running at an annualized revenue run rate of approximately $1.4 billion. this business has been growing double digits year over year in recent quarters, reflecting its remarkable transformation from significant pc exposure to now being focused largely on the data center. based on the significant improvement in the mix of end markets combined with design wins we have secured for ssd controllers, hdd controllers, and preamps, we expect our storage business to continue to grow strongly over the next several years. let me now move on to discussing our five end markets. i'll start with a recap of the substantial improvements we have driven over the last few years in focusing the company on data infrastructure, which is evident in the historical data we have provided today.
as a result of our strategic multiyear transformation, we have significantly increased our exposure to the data center and carrier end markets, which are characterized by long product life cycles, sticky design wins, and multigenerational engagements. at the same time, we have substantially reduced our dependence on the consumer market, which tends to be more volatile with shorter product life cycles. the consumer market is now only 15% of our total revenue. factors contributing to this change include significantly higher growth we have driven from the other end markets, our de-emphasis on pc, hdd, and ssd controllers, and the sale of our wi-fi business. in sharp contrast, data center is now our largest end market, and at 40% of total revenue is about twice as large as any of our other end markets.
we believe that data center is positioned to become an even bigger part of marvell over time when we combine our growing market share with the numerous secular growth drivers in this end market. over the last few years, data center has become our most diversified end market with revenue contribution from nearly every marvell product line. cloud is the primary growth driver in this end market, and it's exciting to note that cloud now represents more than half of our data center revenue, making cloud on its own larger than any of our other four end markets. we have grown our data center business through organic investment in our nearline hdd controllers and preamps, ssd controllers, as well as significant m&a. we added cavium's liquidio and liquidsecurity dpus, which have been adopted by multiple cloud customers. the avera acquisition added a custom asic platform, which we coupled with marvell's leading standard product ip.
this has proven to be extremely compelling to hyperscale customers who are building custom hardware to deploy incredibly efficient and optimized infrastructure. we recently added inphi's market-leading electro-optics portfolio for high-speed connectivity both within and between cloud data centers. finally, the proposed acquisition of innovium will add their cloud-optimized ethernet switches to our data center portfolio of products. with the broadest technology platform in the industry, we believe marvell is well-positioned to become a semiconductor leader in data center, and expect this end market will be the most important growth opportunity for the company over the next several years. in carrier infrastructure, we have been significantly growing our dollar content base station, winning new customers, and growing our overall market share in the 5g market. just over the last two years, our carrier revenue has nearly tripled, representing approximately 20% of our total revenue.
we expect a sustained period of strong revenue growth from this end market, driven by an increase in 5g deployments, which are still on the early stage of worldwide adoption and the ramp of our full platform of 5g products and multiple customers in their current generation of base station. we have also won additional sockets in five nanometers, which will go into production next -- in next-generation base station launches over the next several years, extending the growth from our carrier end market over a long time period. the enterprise networking end market comprises approximately 20% of our total revenue. the revenue contribution from this end market has grown rapidly and kept pace with the strong growth in marvell's total revenue over the last few years. this is a solid accomplishment against the backdrop of challenging end-market dynamics. in fact, over the last two years, our enterprise revenue has grown at 23% annual cagr with the majority of the growth coming from stand-alone marvell ethernet switch inphi products.
these refreshed platforms have been instrumental in driving outsized revenue growth, a testament to the competitiveness of our products and technology. we believe that we are well-positioned to continue outperforming the market, and are looking forward to a recovery in enterprise spending that would serve as an incremental tailwind to this business. our revenue from the automotive and industrial end market has begun to accelerate in recent quarters, benefiting from the ramp in our auto ethernet connectivity business. our automotive business is in its early stages of growth. given our design win traction and the growth expected in the adoption of ethernet technology in cars, we expect the revenue contribution from this end market will become a larger portion of our total revenue over time. let me now move on to discussing our second-quarter results and third-quarter expectations for each of our end markets starting with data center.
in our data center end market, revenue for the second quarter was $434 million, growing 57% sequentially, and 62% year over year. strong growth was driven by contributions from the acquired inphi business and ongoing growth from the stand-alone marvell business. cloud customers drove the vast majority of the growth in our data center end market. our electro-optics products continue to benefit from the adoption of pam-based connectivity inside cloud data centers, as well as the adoption of dci, or data center interconnect, between regional locations.
marvell's dpus and storage products also contributed to growth in this end market. last quarter, we discussed a number of significant design wins, leveraging our advanced technology platform with multiple cloud customers across a variety of applications and business models. these are expected to drive a substantial step up in our cloud revenue in the calendar 2024 to 2025 timeframe. development is in full swing on these projects, and i am pleased to report that our cloud design win momentum continues this quarter with an additional custom asic design secured for a cloud networking application. we expect to continue to win sockets and gain share in this market, leveraging the strength of our portfolio, and growing engagements with key cloud customers. in our third fiscal quarter, we are expecting another strong performance from data center, projecting robust sequential revenue growth in the double-digits on a percentage basis.
we expect year-over-year growth will be considerably higher and project data center revenue to just over double from a year ago. we expect sequential growth to be driven by cloud with virtually all of our product lines contributing to growth. i am also pleased to note that in the third quarter, we expect to start ramping our second generation of colorz dci products, 400-gig zr into volume production. with our proposed acquisition of innovium, we are looking forward to adding their cloud-optimized switches to marvell's broad data center portfolio. we received very positive feedback from multiple key customers following our announcement of the planned combination.
they are excited about the prospect of collaborating more closely with us once the acquisition closes to address their need for high-performance switches going forward. turning to our carrier infrastructure end market. revenue for the second quarter was $197 million, growing 17% sequentially, and 38% year over year. in addition to the contribution from inphi, year-on-year growth was enabled by a stand-alone marvell's wireless business. our wireless revenue growth was driven by ongoing deployments of 5g, as well as product ramps at samsung and nokia, partially offset by an expected decline in custom asics shipping into china.
design win progress continues in 5g, and i am pleased to report that we have won a next-generation asic design, leveraging our five-nanometer technology platform within the radio unit at a key base station customer. with this win, we have now secured five nanometers design at three tier 1 base station customers. our o-ran and vran platform, which includes our card-based layer 1 accelerator, also continues to be adopted by multiple cloud customers and wireless base station oems. in the third fiscal quarter, we expect sequential revenue growth from the carrier end market, driven by strong growth from wireless, partially offset by a decline from wired. we project the strong growth in wireless in the double-digit sequentially and on a percentage basis to come from an increase in 5g deployments in multiple regions. in addition, we expect growth from 5g to significantly accelerate in the fourth quarter.
on a year-over-year basis for our carrier end market, we project strong revenue growth to continue above 20% in the third quarter. moving on to our enterprise networking end market. revenue for the second quarter was $223 million, growing 27% sequentially, and 41% year over year with the majority of the growth coming from stand-alone marvell products. this remarkable level of organic growth in the enterprise end market was made possible in part by a strong effort from our operations team to address pent-up customer demand. while we expect strong demand to continue for the foreseeable future, we expect supply constraints will impact our ability to sustain this level of revenue attainment in the third quarter. from a product perspective, growth in the second quarter was driven by our ethernet networking portfolio, benefiting from ongoing share gains and the beginning of multigig adoption.
we are also encouraged by strong demand for our products from customers that we believe indicator recovery is underway in this end market. looking ahead to the third quarter, while we expect a sequential decline in revenue due to supply constraints, we anticipate strong year-over-year growth approaching 30%. turning to our automotive and industrial end market. revenue for the second quarter was $57 million, growing 24% sequentially, and 125% year over year, driven by the ongoing ramps in our auto business. marvell continues to gain recognition from customers for its commitment to automotive-grade quality and reliability.
during the quarter, we received a prestigious global supplier award from the bosch group in recognition of marvell's outstanding performance and quality in the manufacture and supply of leading-edge data infrastructure semiconductors. we are looking forward to our continued partnership and long-term collaboration with bosch on our broad and growing group of automotive customers and partners. turning to the third fiscal quarter. we expect our revenue from the auto and industrial end market to grow sequentially. year over year, we project growth will continue to be very strong and expect revenue to nearly double in the third quarter.
we also expect to attain an important milestone in the third quarter. our automotive business is projected to cross over a $100 million annualized revenue run rate, earlier than the prior expectation. moving on to our consumer end market. revenue for the second quarter was $165 million, declining 1% sequentially, and growing 23% year over year. most of the revenue in this end market is from stand-alone marvell and the strong annual growth is driven primarily by our custom diy ssd controllers.
looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect revenue to grow sequentially while year-over-year revenue growth will remain strong in the double-digit on a percentage basis. in closing, we expect our business momentum to gather strength in the second half of fiscal year 2022. our recent results and near-term expectations for revenue growth continue to trend above the high-end of our target model. demand for our products continues to significantly outpace supply, and our global operations team is aggressively securing more capacity. we are working closely with our supply partners, leveraging our scale and balance sheet to improve our ability to win strong, secular growth and demand we expect for our data infrastructure products, both in the short and the long term. for our third fiscal quarter at the midpoint of guidance, we expect revenue to grow 6% sequentially and 53% year over year.
we expect growth from the stand-alone marvell business to accelerate to over 20% year over year in the third quarter compared to the high teens we achieved in the first half. additionally, we expect the inphi business to continue to perform well and grow faster than stand-alone marvell. our integration of inphi is proceeding very well and we successfully achieved our one erp milestone ahead of schedule. leveraging the larger scale and broader set of key technologies, the combined teams are working closely together on winning new opportunities at multiple tier 1 customers. we are also looking forward to completing the proposed acquisition of innovium, which will broaden our ethernet switch platform and further increase our exposure to the fast-growing cloud data center market. i am also pleased to announce that we will be hosting our investor day this year on wednesday, october 6, 2021 at 8:00 a.m.
pacific. similar to last year, this will be a virtual event, webcasted live on our website. we will provide more event details in a press release shortly. with that, i'll turn the call over to jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook. 
jean hu -- chief financial officer
thanks, matt, and good afternoon, everyone. i'll start with a review of our financial results for the second quarter and then provide our current outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. revenue in the second quarter was $1.076 billion, $11 million above the midpoint of guidance. networking represented 65% of our revenue with storage contributing 32%.
revenue from other accounted for 3% of our revenue. as ashish mentioned earlier, starting with the third quarter, we'll only report revenue by our five end markets to provide more transparency about the key growth drivers of our business. gaap gross margin was 34.6%, which included amortization of inphi inventory step-up cost. non-gaap gross margin was 64.8% of revenue, 80 basis points above the midpoint of guidance, primarily due to a better mix. gaap operating expenses were $638 million. non-gaap operating expenses were $366 million, approximately $6 million below the midpoint of guidance, primarily due to faster-than-expected inphi synergy achievement and disciplined opex management.
i am confident that our team will achieve the remaining inphi integration synergies based on the plan we discussed last quarter. given the significant growth opportunities ahead of us, we are turning our focus to ensuring continued investment to support our long-term profitable growth. as a reminder, our operating expenses can vary quarter to quarter affected by factors such as the number of tapeouts within a particular quarter, and these tapeouts are becoming more expensive in newer process geometry. the cadence of nre payment, which we treat as the contra opex can also add variability. our gaap operating loss was $267 million.
non-gaap operating profit was $331 million, or 38.8% of revenue. for the second quarter, gaap loss per diluted share was $0.34. non-gaap income per diluted share was $0.34. now turning to our balance sheet. during the quarter, cash flow from operations was $222 million.
we returned $49 million to shareholders through dividend payment. our long-term debt was $4.7 billion. our gross debt-to-ebitda ratio was 3.4 times, and net debt-to-ebitda ratio was three times. inventory at the end of the second quarter was $460 million.
we amortized $156 million of the inphi inventory step-up cost in the second quarter due to purchase price accounting, and we anticipate amortizing the remaining balance of $17 million by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2022. now turning to our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. please note this guidance does not include any contributions from the pending acquisition of innovium. we are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.145 billion, plus or minus 3%. we expect our gaap gross margin in the range of 46.3% to 48.3%. we project our non-gaap gross margin will be in the range of 64% to 65%.
we project our gaap operating expenses to be in the range of $584 million to $594 million. we anticipate our non-gaap operating expenses to be in the range of $365 million to $370 million. we expect non-gaap tax rate of 5%. we expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be 824 million and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be 841 million.
as a result, we anticipate gaap loss per share in the range of $0.10, plus or minus $0.04. we expect non-gaap income per diluted share in the range of $0.38, plus or minus $0.03. operator, please open the line and announce q&a instructions. thank you.

we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question will come from john pitzer with credit suisse. please go ahead.
john pitzer -- credit suisse -- analyst
yeah. good afternoon, matt, jean. thanks for letting me ask questions, and congratulations on the solid results. matt, relative to your enterprise commentary, you talked about supply constraints impacting the october quarter.
i'm wondering when you look at the overall business holistically, where are things relative to the supply side of the equation? are you still unable to ship to full demand by sort of what amount? and earlier this week, there were some rumors in the popular press of the foundry guys raising pricing. i'm just kind of curious if you guys have embedded that into your gross margin guidance. and how you're thinking about kind of the current inflationary pricing environment, can you pass that on, or is that something that you can't pass on?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. great. thanks, john. so, with respect to enterprise, let me just frame it at the whole company level.
we are still carrying pretty meaningful levels of delinquency across all of the end markets as our business has accelerated in terms of topline growth, which we've been very pleased at. i guess the downside is that the demand has continued to grow. well, i guess it's a good thing. the demand is growing faster than supply, but we need to catch up.
so, enterprise is impacted, but so are the other end markets. although i would say given the complex nature of our networking products, there's -- we're carrying relatively more, you know, we're relatively farther behind there. we were pleased that we were able to have a strong performance in q2 and catch up because, as you can see, there was a fairly meaningful step up in revenue. most of that is coming from organic stand-alone marvell. there is some contribution from inphi, but it's not as -- you know, it wasn't large for inphi.
so, this is all marvell, and in fact when you look into q3, in our guidance, that still implies a 30% year-over-year growth rate in enterprise. so, we could ship a lot more if we could get the products. and i think you could also view this as another sign that the enterprise business, which we had been saying a quarter or two ago could be a real tailwind for the company. this business is definitely picking up both at the end market and demand level, as well as our own design wins layering in.
so, we're going to be working hard to increase our revenues here and catch up on the delinquency. on the foundry side, and just in general with the pricing environment, i mean, as you recall, there was a lot of commentary at the end of last year and early this year from all the major semiconductor companies relative to the supply chain cost increases that have been occurring on an ongoing basis. and that's everything from foundry to backend to substrates. you know, we said earlier this year, we're able to work with our customers on that. and so, as you can see in our margin performance, we've been able to work with them to pass that on.
we've done that pretty fairly and in a neutral manner. i anticipate as we head into calendar 2022 that, you know, there will be additional increases across the industry and input costs. and i'm confident, as part of marvell, we're able to work with our customers to, again, neutralize that impact. but the key focus we have right now, john, is planning our business together, focusing on long-term supply, and making sure that not only can we meet the short-term but also engage in multiple long-term agreements where we really have much stronger visibility to long-term supply. so, that's been the priority for us.
that's been the priority for our customers. and i think the pricing has been second at this point.

our next question will come from ross seymore with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
ross seymore -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for letting me ask some questions, and echo that congrats on the results. matt, i want to go a little bit into the carrier business. you talked in your press release about the 5g business accelerating in the third quarter.
and then taking this, i think, you've called it a significant step up again in the fourth quarter. can you give us just a little bit of a ballpark, how much of your carrier business is that? what's driving that 5g step-up? and i guess this is kind of the deductive logic, what's driving the step down on the wired side implicit in your fiscal third-quarter guide?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. great. thanks, ross. yeah.
so, wireless has performed, you know, very well for us. historically, as you recall, we had seven straight quarters of sequential growth in our 5g business. that took a pause this past quarter, which we had signaled with the china 5g digestion. and then on the positive side, you know, we see that business reaccelerating and growing in q3, and then even more in q4.
that's primarily on the back of new design wins that we had achieved several years ago, ramping into production, and those geographies that are being serviced through those are primarily non-china. so, that's really part of the -- now the global rollout, which we're well-positioned with our key customers there. so, it's a combination of global rollout plus new content kicking in, which we had been signaling for some time. so, that's all going well. the balance as you mentioned is wired.
that business historically wasn't terribly large for marvell. we picked up some wired revenue from inphi really in the coherent franchise, which does link in some ways to the growth of global data traffic. so, we feel good going forward about the wired portion, that's the inphi piece. but in general, that business is lumpier.
that business also, you know, has pretty significant supply constraints around it as well. and so, you know, i'd say the traditional marvell wired business isn't necessarily a growth business. the carrier business over time will be driven by the wireless portion, as well as some of the inphi business. and just big round numbers, the wireless portion is roughly half the carrier number, and that will grow over time, obviously, as wired probably stays flattish without inphi.
inphi will grow, and then, obviously, the 5g rollouts will really be what's going to drive the carrier growth over the next few years.
ross seymore -- deutsche bank -- analyst

our next question will come from vivek arya with bank of america. please go ahead.
vivek arya -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. matt, you're guiding q3 sales up by, i think, $69 million, $70 million, 6% or so. is that really the absolute dollars of supply equivalent that is becoming available? and if that is the case, is that the range of supply dollars that could be available for the next several quarters? so, i know you're not guiding more than a quarter out. i'm just trying to get a better sense of how many supply dollars are kind of becoming available for the next handful of quarters because it seems like that is really what's going to get what we assume from a growth perspective for you over the next several quarters.
and i think part b of that on the 5g side, you know, you alluded to that 5g ramp in q4, would that be incremental to that kind of supply available, or do you think that is kind of captured in those dollars? so, just trying to get a better sense for what the flexes on the supply side over the next handful of quarters. thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure. yeah. i mean, i think it's fairly straightforward in terms of how we think about the guidance and just the broader commentary that we gave, which very much comprehends the supply that we see available, you know, and we're obviously been pushing hard to increase that. and i would note, we have increased that.
if you look even going back to a year ago or more, even at the beginning of calendar 2020, we started growing the company double digits, and that growth rate for the stand-alone marvell has actually accelerated, right? it was in the double-digit range, you know. now, you get to the first half of this year. we had 17% kind of growth, both in q1 and q2 in the stand-alone marvell business. we've said that that's going to pick up in q3, right, more like 20% year over year, and we expect that we can continue going, you know, at that kind of rate. so, we've been actually accelerating our ability to get supply.
and then on top of that, we've got inphi kicking in, which has also been able to grow their business meaningfully. so, you know, that's -- we've been signaling for quite some time to our supply chain that -- and our suppliers that we have needs and here they are. and so, you know, you should expect that we're going to keep working on that, we're going to keep driving the supply higher as available. you know, we've had, i think, a lot of productive discussions and negotiations with our key suppliers, not only for this quarter, next quarter but next year, and even beyond in terms of really lining up where we see our business heading. the advantage, i think, we have over some of the other industry peers perhaps is that our product life cycles, vivek, in data infrastructure are very long.
these are typically five, sometimes seven-year life cycles, so we've got very good visibility. and so, we're in those discussions right now, both this quarter, next quarter blocking and tackling, as well as planning our calendar 2022, and then even planning out even farther with some long-term agreements we're putting in place. but just to circle back to the main question, yeah, everything we give you is centered around what we can actually supply. there's -- like i said, every one of our end markets, we could ship more right now if we could get the parts.

our next question will come from blayne curtis with barclays. please go ahead.
blayne curtis -- barclays -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question, and thanks for the additional segment guidance. just curious on -- you mentioned another cloud asic win, and that can span a lot of storage or dpus, cpus networking, and now maybe optical. so, i was wondering if you could give any color on that one, or maybe just in general, all these wins that you've had, you know, where you're seeing the most traction across several asic capabilities would be helpful.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure, blayne. thanks. yeah, i'd say that if i frame it more, you know, broadly as you mentioned the dynamic is that the asic and semi-custom wins that we're getting are across a broad range of applications. so, it's all the above.
they're everything from compute, ml, ai, networking, storage, and i'm pleased with the breadth, and it's across multiple customers, multiple applications. i believe in my prepared remarks, on the one that we just secured, was actually in the networking area. so, it's in a bunch of different applications. but it's all leveraging fundamentally, blayne, the five-nanometer technology platform that we introduced in the summer of 2020, which is leveraging all of the high-performance standard marvell ips.
that's all going very well. and just as a side note on our five-nanometer programs are with multiple products now that have taped out this year, we actually have the first silicon on five-nanometer coming back now imminently. and we're very happy with all the benchmarking performance, you know, etc. i'd also say that we're in a strong period of design win momentum, primarily because we introduced the platform in 2020. there's a whole range now of rfqs that we've been successful on closing on.
and that's not just in the cloud, by the way, we also noted we won an important 5g asic just recently. and even across some of our other end markets, we've also secured some very important programs on five-nanometer. so, yeah, so, i think over time, you know, what you'll see is a very diverse offering of cloud, set of custom and semi-custom sockets across multiple end markets and multiple applications.

tore svanberg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yes. and congrats on the record results. matt, you mentioned that 400zr is going to be ramping now. is that which sort of inphi's anchored customer, or are you starting to see ramps with multiple hyperscalers for that particular product? thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. what i'd say, tore, is on 400zr, unlike the initial colorz product, which was primarily at one hyperscaler, you know, the engagements are much more broad with 400zr. and so, you know, i'd say there are a number of different design opportunities and wins that are at various stages of trials, qualifications, and production ramps. but we anticipate that 400zr will be multicustomer, multiyear, and a very important product cycle for marvell.
but there is one primary customer ramping now, but it's going to continue beyond that.

our next question will come from harlan sur with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
harlan sur -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good afternoon, and congratulations on the strong results and execution. as i look beyond q3 and the growing demand profile for your products, right, combined with strong product upgrade cycles, you've got 400-gig in your pam for optical business. as you just mentioned, you are ramping new data center interconnect business on 400zr, 5g wireless, as you mentioned, and continued strong demand for your nearline hdd and enterprise ssd controllers. this would suggest a high-level sequential growth into q4.
does the team have the supply commitments, both wafers and packaging substrates, to drive quarter-on-quarter growth in q4 if the backlog supports it?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks for the question, harlan. we do, we see an increase in supply,you know, each quarter. our backlog today and firm purchase orders firmly support that plus the supply that comes with it.
so, we do expect sequential growth in q4. and as you mentioned, you outlined a number of growth opportunities. this isn't just going to be a q3, q4 type of phenomenon. each one of these really carries into our calendar '22, and in many cases, accelerates.
so, that's why i said earlier in one of the prior questions, you know, there's blocking and tackling in q3 and q4, but we've been really working for the last six months in detail, even longer, on how do we line up continued strong growth in calendar '22, '23, '24 because this is going to be, you know, multiyear. and many of these engagements, by the way, are also multi-generational. so, we tend to transition from one platform to another, and we're going to see that in our 5g business as an example. so, yeah, bottom line is we do have supply lined up, and we're going to keep working hard to make sure we can chunk away that delinquency. and we're very focused on customer set at this point.
i think that's the main driving force of what we do right now, harlan, is just to make sure that we're not the long pole in the tent that we're meeting what our customers need, and that we're also planning our business together, and i'm quite pleased with how that cooperation is going. and i think we have a very, very clear outlook for what we need to go get done in the next few quarters and through next year.

our next question will come from srini pajjuri with smbc nikko securities. please go ahead.
srinivas pajjuri -- smbc nikko securities -- analyst
thank you. matt, i have a question on the hyperscale business. obviously, you have several product cycles in the 400-gig, 400zr, and you also mentioned dpus. what i'm trying to figure out is that many of your peers are also reporting very strong demand from hyperscale? so, i'm trying to understand to what extent your business is mostly structural versus also benefiting from some of the spending increase and the cyclical factors? so, as we go through the next few quarters, i guess, some of the cyclical factors slow down.
just trying to figure out how we should think about your core business that goes into the hyperscale customers?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think, srini, it's both. so, clearly, you know, the peer companies are -- i mean, there's probably one notable exception. but in general, the peer companies are reporting very strong growth in hyperscale.
so, i think that is secular, and i think that's very much happening. you know, if you just look at our organic growth, and you can do the math because you know sort of where inphi was a year ago, it's very, very strong. and in fact, as i look to q3, it both grow from inphi, but as you pointed out -- and it's not just dpus from marvell, it's also our networking products with our storage products. i mean, we sell a number of product lines, let's call it 10, maybe 10-plus product lines, just going into cloud alone.
almost each one of those is up even sequentially in q3. almost all of them are up. and then if you look at year over year, the growth in our data center business actually -- and cloud business from marvell stand-alone would actually be even growing faster than the inphi business. so -- and that's all on the basis of new designs and new ramps contributing to that. so, i think we've got both, we've got, you know, strong secular demand happening in the hyperscale, but it's our own unique cycles. as you mentioned, the transition from nrz to pam, and 400-gig, and 200-gig intra-data center, the ramp now of 400zr, the attach rate of dpus, attaching more and more as a percentage to cpus.
and then you've got our own product cycles, whether they're new design wins and diy storage for flash. i mean, i could go through the whole list, but it's -- i think that's the exciting thing about our portfolio, that's very differentiated in the semiconductor industry relative to the hyperscale accounts. we have so many product lines, very unique and very differentiated both in the silicon, and the software, and firmware we provide. and you know, we're just at the early stages in some of these, quite frankly, in terms of the ramp cycle.
so, when you look at the guide, we're going to be, you know, obviously, our guide for data center is about two times the rate of growth for the whole company just from q2 to q3. and certainly, we have very strong expectations heading into next year on the data center.

ambrish srivastava -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. thank you very much, matt and jean. on gross margin, despite all the input costs, you have been able to keep it to the higher end of the long term. and matt, you made a comment about next year kind of expecting additional input -- not additional -- ongoing input cost increase.
so, should we expect gross margin to kind of stay in the higher end of the range like you're guiding to, or is there an offset? and i do realize that there's a product mix impact as well. so, just please helps us understand how we should think about the overall gross margin.
jean hu -- chief financial officer
hey, ambrish. this is jean. yes, firstly, we're very pleased with our strong q2 gross margin performance. and i think a lot of the things we discussed in the past is the primary driver of our gross margin is really a product mix.
and what we have been doing with the customers, as matt mentioned, is that we're working with the customers, really try to minimize the impact from all the input cost increase. but overall, if you think about the product portfolio we have in data center, as matt just mentioned earlier and also enterprise in q2, we see our enterprise business, networking business growing 27% sequentially. all those significant performances on the product portfolio on the revenue side actually are very favorable to our gross margin. fundamentally, it's a reflection of our investment in the ip. so, i don't think that will change because we continue to innovate, we continue to invest to drive the portfolio and the topline revenue growth.
so, we're going to be in the range, and we'll continue to work with the customers to set priorities and to make sure we meet the customers' needs first. and then, definitely, we want to make sure our operating model continues to leverage to expand the operating profit going forward.
ambrish srivastava -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
got it, jean. so, we should assume at the higher end of the long-term range then, right, given how the product mix is shifting more toward --
jean hu -- chief financial officer
the range is the product mix because we have five end markets. quarter over quarter, you're going to see the variability of the mix change. frankly, you know, what we discussed, the 64% to 65%, that range is potentially you are going to see in the long term.

joseph moore -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you. we appreciate the additional revenue classifications and the color there. i'm curious how you're thinking about building the development team? are you going to focus on these end markets more? i noticed there are storage controllers, i think, going into four of the five segments, so are you going to maintain vertical market focus on storage, and then have kind of a go-to-market? and just how should we think about this impact not just where we see your business but how you're seeing internally?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks for the question, joe. actually, it's pretty insightful. so, we -- we're a product company, we're a technology company, we're organized by business units, we have divisions, business units, and product lines, and each of those is really responsible for driving technical excellence in everything we do, product differentiation roadmap.
and that's going to continue. what i would say though is, when i look at my level and when we look at what i -- and this has been consistent for five years, you know, i had a philosophy when i became ceo, which was that the semiconductor companies that adopted a market-based approach relative to looking at the r&d investment profile across its portfolio those companies that made that shift, we're going to have the biggest level going forward. i mean, i'm just -- i appreciate it internally all the time, which is the market always wins. and so, we had an era -- when i started in the industry, which was -- you just did parts as many parts as you can, put them out in the data book, so you buy the parts, best part wins. there was a shift to, hey, go focus on customers, find a customer, sell a basket of products. but in the end, it's really the end market orientation and concentration, which ultimately drives your business, and those --  that the -- shifting that mix is like one of the hardest things to do in business, ok. you can sort of shift your product line, you can move some investment around, but to get it to flow through to the p&l is really tough. and so, i think one of the things -- when you just take a 30,000-foot view, joe, of what we've accomplished in the last five years, you know, consumer, when i joined was probably 70% to 80% of the revenue, right, it's 15.
i think the total contribution from cloud and 5g and auto was if it was $75 million bucks a year, we'd be lucky, ok. it's like doing -- you know, it's in the billions range today. so, that's really -- where i've been taking the firm over the last five years through the m&a, through all the investments, through the r&d changes we've made so that we can achieve an end-market mix that really meets our long-term strategy. and we're not there yet.
you know, i think, we're pleased we've sort of unveiled this thing. we're 40% in data center, we're 20% in carrier, we're 20% in enterprise, we've got this automotive thing that's growing really fast. so, that concentration now and where we want to be is very high, but the key focus areas like cloud, 5g, and auto, those are going to continue to increase as a percentage of our total. so, maybe a longer answer, joe, we organized by business unit, but we run the company and ultimately the capital allocation framework ultimately around the end market, and even where's the r&d going.
and it's a very rigorous process we have internally, and you can see the results over the last five years of what we've been able to accomplish with that framework.

the design wins we have today are extremely broad, and we've got something like 24 -- 20 to 24 car oems, not models, not individual products, but the actual oems themselves who are adopting marvell ethernet technology. in many cases, they've elected to go sole source with us in those engagements, primarily to ensure interoperability because as you add more and more ecus and modules inside the car that you want to hook up via ethernet, you actually want to make sure that the link is highly reliable. we have wins both with the established leading tier 1, you know, call it top 10 car oems, but also a very strong position in the emerging challengers. you know, all the ev start-ups, which when you add it all up, and of course, tesla is a big part of the number, but there's like $700 billion, $800 billion worth of market cap tied up and new emerging ev entrance. so, we've got sort of the new guys that are designing our stuff in, and that's a call option on growth.
and then we have the established players as well. relative to the financial -- you know, the potential, we've said that we believe it's going to be about a $1 billion market over the next few years. and at our analyst day, you know, we gave line of sight to this being a multihundred-million-dollar type of business. that -- the business has accelerated. we had signaled last year that we were hoping to get to $25 million a quarter exiting the year.
we guided now that we're going get there in q3, and this business has got tremendous momentum, and you can look at the data we provided now to see how far that business has come over the last seven, eight quarters. most of that growth that you see has been driven by the automotive contribution. so, it's a big opportunity, and i think that ultimately -- that $1 billion market, you go out 10 years, it'll be probably $2 billion, and we obviously hope we can get a big, big share of that. so, it's a big opportunity. and i think the last point i would make is that it's really an entry now because it's such a key part of the car architecture that we're very, very focused now on applications outside of ethernet.
so, compute applications, additional networking products, security, and storage, and we've really proven ourselves. final point, we've shipped millions and millions of units now into cars that are on the road. we're running at -- an astonishing one dppm type of quality rate, or actually less. in fact, the most recent update i got is we were in the 800, 900 ppb, which i can tell you having a lot of experience in the automotive market, it's really hard to get under one.
and the products have been engineered extremely well. we put it in place like a world-class automotive flow. so, we can leverage that, toshi, for many other marvell technologies and products outside of ethernet. and you should expect to hear more from us on this in the future.

our next question will come from gary mobley with wells fargo securities. please go ahead.
gary mobley -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hi, i have a couple of questions for jean. jean, i would assume that you're in sort of the sweet spot of the opex synergy realization from the inphi acquisition. you're guiding for roughly 1 million sequential growth in non-gaap opex for the third quarter. and so, just given all the different moving pieces in your investments and the synergies to be realized in inphi, is it realistic to think that you could see fourth-quarter opex drop sequentially, and then eventually, tick back up in the first quarter per year usual -- you know, first-year increases? and then for the non-gaap tax rate, if i'm not mistaken, your expectation is for it to increase going forward.
should we think about that maybe 100-basis-point to 200-basis-point annual increases going forward? thank you.
jean hu -- chief financial officer
maybe the easy one first. on the non-gaap tax rate for next year, you'll probably can just model about 6% because we do have a lot of the tax deductions as part of our merger with inphi. so, that's the assumption you can model. on the opex rate, our team did a great job to integrate the one erp one quarter ahead of the time.
so, if you look at the synergy achievement we outlined last quarter, we basically achieved the one erp one quarter earlier, so the opex came off in q2, and then q3 guidance. frankly, as i said earlier, we do see the pattern of synergy achievement just exactly the same as we outlined last quarter. so, q4, typically, there are variabilities of opex. i think, i will leave it to you to model it, but from our perspective, we are quite confident to achieve the inphi synergy. at the same time, the seasonality of opex in q1, you're absolutely right, typically q1 because of the payroll tax, the opex will step up.
i just want to make sure, right, the team at marvell is very thoughtful in managing opex, but at the same time increases the investment to drive the long-term revenue growth, especially given the tremendous opportunities we have ahead of us. we are going to make sure we invest, but at the same time, we always going to drive revenue growth significantly higher than the opex growth.

our next question will come from chris caso with raymond james. please go ahead.
chris caso -- raymond james -- analyst
yes. thank you. good evening. the question is just a clarification of what's included in the new segmentation, specifically for data center.
and i think your comments that half of -- more than half of that business was cloud-based. what's the other half? is that more in the area of campus networking? if you can clarify that. and maybe you could talk to the relative growth rates of cloud versus the noncloud that you're expecting within the data center segment going forward?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure, you -- 
jean hu -- chief financial officer
maybe i'll try to give -- i'll give you the definition then matt can add. on the on-premise data center, that part of the data center is really -- frankly, it's our -- some of the hdd business, fiber channel business, and the networking business, it's on-premise data center. but more than half, it's actually cloud data center. matt, you can add more.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure. so, think of this as our traditional industry standard servers, host bus adapter cards, enterprise mix, things like that. so, that business, historically, has been pretty flat. and just to clarify the campus networking products, that's an enterprise networking, so that moves to the enterprise line.
so, we've gone through pretty carefully and just figured out which -- what our revenue concentration is, specifically in the enterprise on-prem side. so, that, we assume, it's going to be a flattish business. it's been a flattish business. it'll have its ups and downs here and there.
all the growth is going to come from cloud. and so, as we mentioned, it's over half of the revenue today. and even if you look to q3, the acceleration and growth you see is coming from that portion, and we expect the cloud to be probably one of the biggest growth drivers of the whole company over the next few years. i mean, cloud alone is larger than carrier, larger than enterprise, larger than consumer, larger than anything else. just on its own, if you had it, it is its own line item, and that should continue to see very outsized growth for the foreseeable future.

our final question will come from quinn bolton with needham and company. please go ahead.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
quinn, are you there?
operator
hi there, quinn, your line might be muted.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
can you hear me?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
barely, quinn.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
sorry, can you hear me now?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. there you go.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
ok. sorry about that. matt, i was just going to ask on the 400zr ramp, how much of that business for marvell will be optical modules, complete modules versus just selling dsps to other module vendors? and the reason i ask is if you look at your market share sort of by dsp, what share do you think you may ultimately achieve in the zr market if you're just counting dsps?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think you're asking some great questions. let me give you maybe a higher-level view, and then we've got -- as we mentioned, our analyst day coming up in october, where you're going to be able to hear actually from, you know, the various executives running these groups, and they'll talk in a lot more detail about sort of the questions you're asking because that's fairly specific. but at the highest level, 400zr is going to be a combination, ok, of both modules, as well as stand-alone dsps.
we've -- the team has lined up with a number of partners, both for the zr applications, zr plus, there's an open version of that. and then there's also applications for this that are not dci, right, that are actually in the carrier market. and so, there's a broad opportunity here, quinn, besides just, ""hey, we take the one hyperscaler we had, we are moving to 400zr and then it's done."" it's not that at all. it's -- and the initial ramp we are seeing is based on modules and we're continuing to be committed to that. that's good business for us.
but the inphi team, i think, had done a great job of lining up a broader ecosystem set of partners to drive dsp sales as well. so, we can -- we'll give more color on those dynamics, you know, when we get into the investor day and we start talking more about our products and our technologies.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
great. thank you, matt.

operator
good afternoon, and welcome to marvell technology's fiscal third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to mr. ashish saran, vice president of investor relations.
please go ahead.
ashish saran -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. welcome to marvell's third quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings call. joining me today are matt murphy, marvell's president and ceo; and jean hu, our cfo. i would like to remind everyone that certain comments made today may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations.
please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the sec today and posted on our website, as well as our most recent 10-k and 10-q filings. we do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. during our call today, we will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures. a reconciliation between our gaap and non-gaap financial measures is available in the investor relations section of our website.
we closed the acquisition of innovium on october 5, 2021. therefore, the results we reported today for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 include the results from the innovium business for 25 days of the fiscal quarter. revenue from the acquired innovium business is reported entirely within our data center end market. please note that the guidance we have provided for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 on august 26, 2021, has not included any expectations or results from innovium.
the financial outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 provided today includes expected results from the acquired innovium business for the full quarter. with that, i'll turn the call over to matt for his comments on our performance. matt? 
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. i'll start with a summary of our third quarter gaap results. revenue was $1.21 billion, which was above the high end of our guidance and represents another record achievement for marvell. gaap gross margin was 48.5 percent, gaap operating loss was $33 million, and loss per diluted share was $0.08.
revenue grew 13 percent sequentially and 61 percent year over year, an acceleration from the first half of this fiscal year. we saw great momentum in all five of our end markets, with revenue growing both sequentially and year-on-year. our data center, carrier, enterprise networking, and auto/industrial end markets all achieved record revenue and performed above guidance. excellent operational and financial execution resulted in revenue 6 percent above the midpoint of our guidance.
our operations team continues to do a great job in sourcing incremental supply, and we are starting to see the fruits of their labor. supply was better than expected in the third quarter, and we expect continued improvements as we move into the fourth quarter and next year. the additional capacity has better positioned us to catch up to the growth in demand, which so far has outpaced increases in supply. moving on to our non-gaap results for the quarter.
non-gaap gross margin was a record 65.1 percent, and we delivered $418 million in non-gaap operating income. non-gaap operating margin was also a record at 34.5 percent. higher revenue, coupled with stronger gross margin, drove non-gaap earnings per share to $0.43, 13 percent above the midpoint of guidance, growing 72 percent year over year, which represents phenomenal growth in earnings. these are tremendous accomplishments, and i am very proud of the outstanding execution by our entire marvell team in driving such strong results.
let me now move on to discussing our five end markets, starting with data center. in our data center end market, revenue for the third quarter was $500 million, growing 15 percent sequentially and 109 percent year over year, exceeding our guidance. both the stand-alone marvell business and the acquired inphi business delivered strong growth, driven by robust demand from cloud customers. i would note that our on-premise data center business also grew sequentially and year-over-year.
data center is our most diverse end market with multiple product lines contributing to sequential revenue growth. these include 200-gig and 400-gig pam4 electro-optics, data center interconnect zr modules, ssd and hdd controllers, cloud-optimized socs, and ethernet switches. in addition to strong end-market demand, the majority of these product lines are also benefiting from the start of new product ramps, which we expect will continue to drive sustained growth. as an example, in our ssd business, we benefited from a strong ramp of diy controllers directly to a tier 1 cloud customer.
remember, you heard at investor day, marvell has been winning a large number of incremental cloud-optimized silicon designs, and these are now in development. in addition, the design win funnel and level of activity on cloud-optimized silicon engagements continues to accelerate, and we have won -- recently won another socket with our storage accelerator. at our investor day, we discussed this new $500 million market for our storage business and cloud storage accelerators and disclosed our first design win with a cloud customer. now, a key storage partner, kioxia, recently announced production availability of their nvme over fabric ssds, which will also use our storage accelerators.
these ssds are for ethernet bunch of flash systems designed for applications such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and high-performance computing. the kioxia ssds connect to the network fabric natively using ethernet by integrating a marvell storage accelerator, which converts nvme into 25-gigabit ethernet. we are excited to see this new opportunity take shape with multiple customers starting to adopt our storage accelerators. turning now to innovium.
during the quarter, we closed the acquisition, adding their cloud-optimized switches to our broad data center portfolio. we're pleased that company co-founder and cto, puneet agarwal, and the r&d team, have become a part of marvell. we are confident that our combined switch business -- businesses are now well-positioned to be a strong provider of ethernet switches to data centers, and we see an incredible opportunity ahead for marvell in this high-growth market. we expect the acquisition of innovium will result in $150 million in incremental revenue next fiscal year as we ramp switches into a large tier-1 cloud customer they had won prior to the acquisition.
we are also looking forward to supporting additional cloud customers such as linkedin, who are deploying innovium's teralynx-based switches in production across multiple data centers with the sonic network os. sonic is an open network operating system, which provides cloud customers with more choice and interoperability, as well as the ability to scale. we recently announced our commitment to supporting sonic across both our prestera and teralynx products. moving on to our expectations for revenue from our data center end market in our fourth fiscal quarter.
similar to the third quarter, we are expecting another strong performance led by cloud customers across a broad range of products. we expect data center revenue to more than double from a year ago, and we project sequential growth in the double-digits on a percentage basis in the fourth quarter. we are pleased with the strength we are seeing from the cloud end market, which we expect will remain a strong driver of sustained growth for marvell. looking out further in time, we are also excited by the immense potential for another phase of growth as large-scale virtual environments, such as facebook is doing with their metaverse, start to gain traction.
for simplicity, while i will use the metaverse as a general descriptor for this discussion, we expect many different implementations of virtual environments enabled by a broad set of companies and ecosystems. regardless of the form these environments take, the data sets will be exponentially larger compared to the current internet, which is largely two-dimensional, and latency will need to be extremely low to realistically simulate a real-world environment. as a result, we expect the metaverse will significantly accelerate a number of key trends, which are already occurring in the cloud today, including the need to store huge amounts of data in a secure environment, connected by high-speed electro-optic links to custom compute engines. this next level of massive scaling makes the metaverse an even stronger candidate for cloud-optimized silicon solutions that marvell is currently enabling.
this meshes perfectly with the core competencies we have already developed across compute, storage, security, networking, high-speed electro-optics, and customization, which are driving our current success. and these are equally applicable to the variety of virtual environments, which we'll develop over time. the metaverse also has the potential to be a killer app for 5g, another area of strength for marvell. multiple cloud customers have already engaged with us, as they start designing the architecture of their next generation of data infrastructure to enable a significantly richer set of virtual applications and experiences.
turning now to our carrier infrastructure end market. revenue for the third quarter was $215 million, growing 9 percent sequentially and 28 percent year over year, exceeding our guidance. growth was driven by our 5g products ramping at multiple customers. we are also able to improve supply for our wired business to enable sequential growth.
looking at the fourth quarter, we expect a strong ramp in our 5g business of approximately 30 percent sequentially. and as a result, we project our combined carrier infrastructure revenue across our wireless and wired end markets to grow sequentially in the low-teens on a percentage basis, while year-on-year growth is expected to accelerate to over 40 percent. it's exciting to see the step-up in our 5g business, and we expect significant additional growth over the next several years as 5g adoption continues to grow around the globe, combined with marvell content gains from designs we have won, but not yet begin -- begun to ramp. moving on to our enterprise networking end market.
revenue for the third quarter was $247 million, growing 11 percent sequentially and 56 percent year over year with the majority of the growth coming from stand-alone marvell products. this performance was significantly better than our expectations as our operations team did an excellent job securing additional supply to better address the increase in demand for our products. from a product perspective, in the third quarter, the continuation of strong year-on-year growth was driven primarily by marvell's ethernet networking portfolio. we have been gaining share and benefiting from the very deliberate investments we have made in our enterprise ethernet switch platform, as well as the combined marvell and aquantia phy portfolio.
in addition, our content has been growing, driven by increase in multi-gig ethernet adoption. looking ahead to the fourth quarter for our enterprise networking end market, we project revenue sequentially to be up in the low- to mid-single digits on a percentage basis, and year-over-year growth is expected to remain very strong at approximately 60 percent. we expect the strong growth to be driven by continued share gains from marvell products, combined with ongoing recovery in the enterprise networking end market. turning to our automotive and industrial end market, which is served primarily by stand-alone marvell businesses, revenue for the third quarter was $67 million, growing 16 percent sequentially and 114 percent year over year, driven by ongoing ramps in our auto business.
i'm pleased to report that our team has now driven our auto business to over $140 million annualized revenue run rate in the third quarter, ahead of our prior expectations. we are benefiting from a faster pace of adoption of our ethernet solutions by auto oems, who are prioritizing the production of their latest models, which tend to have higher semiconductor content. we are confident that we are well on our way to driving a multi-hundred-million-dollar revenue stream from our ethernet -- auto ethernet business over the next few years. looking beyond connectivity, our next multibillion-dollar market opportunity for marvell is in automotive compute.
our future of technology in cars is all about electrification and intelligence, with embedded security and onboard storage in a fully networked environment. similar to the rise of optimized silicon and cloud, automotive oems are realizing that to differentiate their products and deliver the most value to their customers, they need unique technology and ip to be embedded in compute silicon optimized to their specific platforms. you don't need to look too far to see evidence for this sea change. recent industry commentary, including from ford and volkswagen, talks about their focus on developing internal silicon design expertise, desire to customize off-the-shelf compute, and their intentions to design and develop their own shifts for autonomous vehicles.
similar to our successful strategy of partnering with hyperscale customers for cloud-optimized silicon, we are confident that our co-development business model and rich ip portfolio is equally attractive to automotive oems. in this model, the design is done in true partnership with the customer focusing on the portions proprietary to their platform and marvell bringing our own unique compute, security, ethernet networking, and storage silicon ip to the table. the end solution is a semi-custom design, which represents the best of both worlds, allowing our customers to achieve their ambitions and retain control of their road map. in doing so, they could not only preserve their differentiation with a faster time to market, but will also enable a lower level of investment, thanks to marvell.
we see compute becoming an increasingly important part of our growing automotive business, adding to our very successful ethernet connectivity solutions. reflecting this broadening of our portfolio, i'm very pleased to introduce marvell's new brand for automotive solutions, brightlane, which includes our gigabit and multi-gigabit ethernet switches and phys for connectivity and our octeon processors for compute. at our investor day, we have discussed our first major auto compute win based on our octeon-brightlane platform. the semi-custom design is now in development.
we are seeing a significant increase in compute-related activity with additional auto oems, both traditional and new market entrants. and i look forward to updating you on our progress in this exciting new long-term growth pillar for marvell. turning to the outlook for the fourth fiscal quarter for our auto and industrial end market. we expect strong revenue growth to continue.
we project sequential growth in the double digits on a percentage basis and year-over-year growth to remain above 100 percent. moving on to our consumer end market. revenue for the third quarter was $183 million, growing 10 percent sequentially and 20 percent year over year. looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to grow sequentially in the low-single digits on a percentage basis and year-on-year growth in the double digits on a percentage basis.
we are benefiting from a strong -- from strong growth driven by our ssd controllers that have targeted at differentiated, sticky, long-lived, and high-roi applications such as game consoles. in closing, we delivered very strong results for our third quarter, and we expect this momentum to continue in our fourth quarter and next year. both the acquired inphi business and the stand-alone marvell business are firing on all cylinders. in the third quarter, the stand-alone marvell business delivered strong year-over-year revenue growth close to 30 percent.
the inphi business performed even better. the midpoint of our guidance for revenue in the fourth quarter implies a similar approximately 30 percent year-over-year growth rate for each of these businesses. we are proud of these results and our outlook for growth in the fourth quarter, which is well above the high end of our long-term revenue growth target of a 15 percent to 20 percent cagr. securing capacity for growth remains the highest priority for our operations team even as the supply expansion comes with an increase in input costs.
as we have done throughout the supply crunch, we are working with our customers to adjust prices to offset the impact of these cost increases, which let us jointly benefit from sustained growth. as we look at next fiscal year, we will continue to drive supply improvements, and we expect demand to remain above the high-end of our long-term target model. as a result, we anticipate a sustained period of strong revenue growth for marvell. from a base of approximately $4.4 billion in fiscal 2022, we expect the combined marvell and inphi business to continue growing in fiscal 2023 at the 30 percent year-on-year rate we are currently achieving.
on top of this, we expect an additional $150 million of revenue in fiscal 2023, resulting from the innovium acquisition. we're also excited about the setup for growth beyond fiscal 2023. at our investor day, you heard us describe our participation in end markets collectively expected to grow at a 13 percent cagr. in addition, we have a number of growth drivers, which we expect will result in our revenue growing faster than our end markets.
we discussed our expectations for a step-up in incremental revenue from the start of new design win ramps. we updated our expectations for revenue from cloud-optimized silicon design wins to ramp to $400 million in fiscal 2024, a year earlier than prior projections. these wins are further projected to double to $800 million in revenue in fiscal 2025. in 5g, starting in fiscal 2024, we expect to benefit from an increase in content at nokia when we start ramping our 5-nanometer octeon-embedded processors into their 5g base station.
over the same timeframe, our auto ethernet connectivity business is expected to make significant progress toward driving revenue over $500 million annually, and our electro-optics pam, coherent, and zr portfolio is also projected to remain on a high-growth trajectory. in summary, while we have been delivering strong results for multiple quarters, we are confident that we are still in the early stages of a sustained high-growth period for marvell, and we are looking forward to reaping the benefits of the investments we have made in our business over the last few years. with that, i'll turn the call over to jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.
jean hu -- chief financial officer
thanks, matt, and good afternoon, everyone. i'll start with a review of our financial results for the third quarter and then provide our current outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. revenue in the third quarter was $1.211 billion, exceeding the high end of our guidance range, growing 13 percent sequentially and 61 percent year over year. please note, the acquisition of innovium added approximately $5 million in revenue, which was not contemplated in our original guidance for the third quarter.
revenue growth was robust from all five of our end markets. data center remained our largest end market, driving 41 percent of consolidated revenue. enterprise networking was the next largest with 20 percent of total revenue, followed by carrier infrastructure at 18 percent, consumer at 15 percent, and auto/industrial at six percent. gaap gross margin was 48.5 percent, which included the remaining amortization of inphi inventory step-up costs.
non-gaap gross margin was 65.1 percent of revenue, exceeding the high end of our guidance range primarily due to better-than-expected end market revenue mix. in particular, revenue from our enterprise networking end market was significantly better than our guidance. gaap operating expenses were $621 million. non-gaap operating expenses were $371 million, which included 25 days of innovium operating expenses of approximately $5 million.
our gaap operating loss was $33 million. non-gaap operating profit was $480 million or 34.5 percent of revenue, an all-time record demonstrating the strong leverage in our operating model while we continue to invest for long-term revenue growth. for the third quarter, gaap loss per diluted share was $0.08. non-gaap income per diluted share was $0.43, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance.
earnings per share grew 26 percent sequentially and 72 percent year over year, driven by strong top-line revenue momentum and the execution on both gross and operating margins. now, turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. during the quarter, cash flow from operations was $265 million. we returned $50 million to shareholders through cash dividends.
we paid down $151 million of our long-term debt during the third quarter. as of the end of the third fiscal quarter, our long-term debt was $4.5 billion. our gross debt-to-ebitda ratio was three times and net debt-to-ebitda ratio was 2.7 times. inventory at the end of the third quarter was $629 million.
$71 million of this inventory balance is from innovium, including $42 million in step-up cost due to purchase price accounting. we anticipate amortizing this step-up cost over the next two quarters. we have also increased our work in process inventory to support the revenue growth in revenue we are forecasting. in summary, the marvell team executed exceptionally well, delivering accelerated top-line growth and earnings expansion much faster than revenue growth.
now, turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. please note, this guidance include expected results from the innovium business for the full quarter. we are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.32 billion, plus or minus three percent. we expect our gaap gross margin in the range of 47.9 percent to 49.8 percent.
we project our non-gaap gross margin will be approximately 65 percent. we project our gaap operating expenses to be in the range of $630 million to $640 million. we anticipate our non-gaap operating expenses to be in the range of $390 million to $395 million, which include approximately $15 million of opex for the acquired innovium business for the full quarter. this outlook also reflects the increase in investment to support the accelerated revenue growth we are driving across the business, including the launch of multiple new projects tied to the design wins we have discussed in prior quarters.
in addition, we're including a higher amount of bonus accrual, given our strong operating performance well above our plan. as a reminder, looking ahead to the first fiscal quarter of 2023, due to the typical seasonality in payroll taxes, our opex tends to increase from q4 of fiscal year by high-single digits sequentially on a percentage basis. we expect non-gaap tax rate of five percent. we expect our basic weighted average share outstanding will be 844 million and our diluted weighted average share outstanding will be 861 million.
as a result, we anticipate gaap earnings per share in the range of a loss of $0.03 per share on the lower end to an income of $0.04 per diluted share on the high end. we expect non-gaap income per diluted share in the range of $0.48, plus or minus $0.03. now, let me now close with some directional comments on our investment plan for the next fiscal year. as matt mentioned earlier, we see continued strong demand across our end markets and improvement in supply to drive our top-line revenue growth above 30 percent in fiscal 2023.
to support both near-term and long-term revenue growth, we are planning to increase our investment levels appropriately, annualize the midpoint of our opex guidance for q4 for fiscal 2022, which include both inphi and innovium for the full period, implies a $1.57 billion baseline opex run rate. from this baseline, we are planning for opex to grow in the high-single digits on a percentage basis in fiscal 2023, substantially lower than our top-line revenue growth. we are increasing our spending to execute on significant design wins and continue to drive process technology leadership, as well as aggressive -- pursue a growing funnel of new design win opportunities within the large $30 billion sam we discussed at our investor day. we are confident we'll continue to drive strong and sustainable long-term revenue growth and deliver earnings expansion much faster than revenue growth in fiscal 2023 and beyond.

blayne curtis -- barclays -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, and great results. maybe just a question. i know you're going to get a bunch on supply, but obviously, it seems like the biggest swing factor into the upside. so, can you talk about that and maybe also just address the enterprise segment? because i think that was your biggest beat, and you were thinking it would be down.
so, just refresh my memory in terms of why you thought it would be down and maybe just a perspective on, you know, just supply in general. you said that you're signing long-term agreements. you know, at what point do you think you'll kind of get out from under these supply constraints?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, blayne. and what i would lead off by saying is i think the two questions you asked are interrelated, meaning the enterprise strength we saw was really as a result of a pretty big catch-up in the supply. so, on the topic of supply, you know, we're really pleased with the progress.
we, like a lot of other companies, have, you know, been challenged to meet the -- this unprecedented demand. and i'm very proud to say that our team has responded really well. and so, a couple of factors. one is we've driven pretty big transformation in our operations group.
part of that was signing long-term supply agreements. i'd say equally meaningful, though, was the strategic nature in which we've really engaged over the last nine months with our supply chain base. our partners understand our opportunity as well as anybody now, and they're really betting on us and they're betting on marvell. that's helped a lot.
and it's just been strong execution by the team. and so, when you add it all up, really what's happened, blayne, is the demand has continued to be very, very strong and that's continued even until now. it's really been a story of supply catching up. and what i would note is supply has caught up, you know, a lot, obviously.
but to be honest, we still aren't really making a dent yet in the unfulfilled backlog that's out there. so, it's a two-edged sword. on the one hand, it's great. we're getting more supply.
on the other hand, demand continues to be very strong, and we see that going into next year. but certainly, we'll take the win in q3 and also the q4 guide relative to the great job our team has done. and enterprise, as we noted the last time, was really -- we had a very nice q2 on enterprise. and we were able to actually do -- just again do -- the team has done a great job to get the supply wind up to meet the strong demand.
and then if you actually look into q4, you've got enterprise up again. and really, the year-over-year story is what -- what's, i think, most impressive. i mean, we're talking about 60 percent year-over-year growth projected in our enterprise segment. almost all of that is organic, blayne, and -- well, that will continue to grow next year.
thanks.
blayne curtis -- barclays -- analyst

the next question will come from ross seymore with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
ross seymore -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks for letting me ask you a question. matt, i wanted to dive a little bit into the guidance you gave for fiscal '23. that was a little more detailed than i had expected. and it seems like you're exceedingly confident about the revenue growth side of it.
so, can you just talk a little bit more detail on -- it looks like about $5.6 billion in revenue, given the math that you said. if we took the innovium side out because we all have a decent idea of what's happening there, can you just talk about what the biggest drivers of that growth is going to be year over year? and if something happened that's increased your confidence in your ability to deliver that, whether it be the supply side coming or if you're just willing to talk more about design wins that you have kind of dropped breadcrumbs to us about over the last few calls?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i think there's a few factors, ross. the first is, you know, we did lay out our strategic narrative at the investor day. so, that was one setup we tried to give investors relative to where the business was heading.
second is when we look into next year, we're -- we certainly see the demand strength continuing really across all segments. so, that gives us a lot of confidence. that's data center, that's 5g, that's automotive. it's also enterprise and consumer.
those are backed up with purchase orders that are in place today. so, the backlog we have is very strong. and i think the other point is we really want -- and i really wanted to contextualize the growth that we're seeing in q3 and q4 on an organic basis, with marvell growing 30 percent, you know, inphi growing 30-ish percent, and that effectively continuing, so that the investment community understood that this wasn't a short-term bump, but rather part of a longer period of sustained growth, which we believe actually had legs even beyond next year. and then the simple math, and i'll let jean chime in.
but basically, what we said is, you know, just take the pro forma $4.4 billion-ish we'll do this year, if you take our q4 guide. you know, we believe we'll, you know, we'll grow that 30 percent next year. and then on top of that, you would add innovium. so, i think your number would be actually a little bit higher when we look out to next year.
ross seymore -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thank you.

the next question will come from vivek arya with bank of america. please go ahead.
vivek arya -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on the very strong growth and the execution. i actually wanted to talk about the opex side. you know, if i look in the last year, you have basically, you know, added almost $500 million in sales, and opex has just grown about $100 million. and then i look at the guidance you are providing for next year also, that also suggests very strong leverage in the model and ebit margins that can get into the high-30s.
so, i'm curious, matt or jean, what's helping drive that leverage? how are you adding, you know, almost $1.5 billion-plus in sales while keeping opex at these levels? how sustainable is this trajectory of expanding margins?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure. maybe i'll start, jean, or do you want to -- 
jean hu -- chief financial officer
yeah, i'll start.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
actually, why don't you start, jean? go ahead.
jean hu -- chief financial officer
yeah, i'll start it. so, if you look at our investment level as we discussed during the investor day, we have a strong leverage because not only our central engineering team really leverage across the -- all the different end markets, we also focus on the cloud-optimized silicon solutions and work with customers. so, we do partner with customers to get customer funding, too. overall, if you look at r&d investment we have been doing, plus the nre we get from customer actually is significantly larger.
so, i would say, our team significantly leverage the investment across all different advanced process nodes and also across different end market. that helps us tremendously. and if you look at the opex increase, of course, we acquired both inphi and innovium. year over year, it actually, you know, is going to get to almost $1.7 billion.
that's very much within the target model we are focusing on as our long-term business model. so, it's the leverage that helps us tremendously.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think that was well said by jean.
vivek arya -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst

the next question will come from timothy arcuri with ubs. please go ahead.
timothy arcuri -- ubs -- analyst
thanks. jean, inventory was up about $100 million, if i exclude innovium. and, you know, you did talk a lot about this being wip and the fact that you're taking wip up given how much you think you can grow. but i guess the question is really on, you know, your visibility on revenue.
and, you know, i guess i'm surprised that you were able to build that much inventory. and, you know, maybe you can talk about whether delinquencies got any better. thank you.
jean hu -- chief financial officer
yeah. actually, you know, we have improved the supply significantly. however, demand continue to outpace the supply, so we have not made a dent on the delinquency we have as a company. as matt discussed earlier, if you look at fiscal '23, we see strong demand, a significant revenue ramp across all our end market with our unique product cycles.
so, 30 percent -- over 30 percent year-over-year growth literally, you know? as a matter of fact, if we look into q1 sequentially, seasonally it will be down quarter. but just for the coming q1 fiscal '23, we actually see sequential revenue increase, approaching mid-single digits on the basis of a very strong guide for q4. so, the inventory build, primarily they are all work in process inventory to support not only q1 revenue growth and beyond the q1 for the sequential quarter-over-quarter increase in the next year to support the over 30 percent top-line revenue growth.
timothy arcuri -- ubs -- analyst
thank you, jean.

the next question will come from john pitzer with credit suisse. please go ahead.
john pitzer -- credit suisse -- analyst
yeah. good afternoon, guys. congratulations, and thanks for letting me ask a question. matt, one of the key strengths of your businesses is that the design cycles for a lot of your products are fairly long and fairly visible.
and i would argue that the revenue growth that you have confidence in next year, notwithstanding some of the supply constraints, was based upon design wins that you've had for a while. i'm just kind of curious, can you talk about the design pipeline and the momentum in the design pipeline today, and then how you expect it to progress through next year? and my guess is it's going to continue to be strong, if not accelerate. and if that's the case, not wanting to get too far out in front of you, the long-term growth rate you put out in the analyst day, why wouldn't that just move up structurally higher? i know it's less than a quarter since you did that. but if you could give us some sense of how you're feeling around the design pipeline.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. john, it's a great question. i think the way i would answer it is, you are correct in that the design cycles for our products are quite long actually and -- but they also come with very long visibility as well. so, the revenue that we've got for next year, those designs are done.
i mean, they've been done for, in some cases, for a year, as an example, like in automotive. so, then you got to go back a couple of years and say, well, what did the design win funnel and pipeline and closure rate look like, say, two years ago or three years ago? and then what is that translating to? what i would comment on is our design win funnel and close rate in the last three years has gone up dramatically each year. and this current-year run track for our sales team is on track for a beyond-record, you know, design win capture. so, the design wins are growing each year.
that is a great leading indicator for us, for sure. and i think to your other question about the long term, look, we did our analyst day, we put out a long-term model. there will be ups and downs if you take a long-term view. but i think what we're saying is at least in the short term, i.e., q3, q4, also fy '23 and we believe even beyond, we can run, you know, above that model.
and we're very bullish on our business.
john pitzer -- credit suisse -- analyst
perfect. thanks, guys. congratulations.

the next question will come from tore svanberg with stifel. please go ahead.
tore svanberg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yes, thank you. and let me echo your congratulations. i had a question on 5g. you're expecting 30 percent sequential growth in the january quarter.
could you just elaborate a little bit on, you know, what's driving that? i do know you have some new customer design wins that are ramping and content growth. but especially as we think of it from a sort of, you know, regional deployment perspective, you know, any more color you could share with us would be great. thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure, tore. to your point, yeah, we had, last quarter, said and signaled that we anticipated a step-up from q3 to q4 in our 5g business. now, we've quantified it, which we see it growing 30 percent sequential. so, great step-up, great validation of the thesis in that business.
and what's exciting, i guess, is it's primarily driven by new product ramps at some of the key customers, particularly in the baseband area. and then also geographies, x china, you know, deploying 5g. so -- and we see that growing, you know, pretty strongly throughout fy '23, our 5g business, as we're highly diversified, both by customer, by geographies that those customer service, and then by the content which we have, most of which is still in front of us. if you think about one of our biggest opportunities, is really the transport processor area where we've won an additional customer we outlined a few years ago.
that's going to ramp in 2023 calendar. so, there's a nice layering effect, tore, but i would say it's certainly nice to see a one quarter step-up. but we certainly see growth, you know, from here.
tore svanberg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
and then you've got -- you got u.s., you've got europe, and, you know, there's a lot of optimism around india as well next year. so, the -- i think the geographic mix is in our favor as well.
tore svanberg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst

the next question will come from harlan sur with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
harlan sur -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good afternoon, and congratulations on the strong results and execution. i would assume that 16-nanometer is sort of the workhorse volume technology now. the team's 7-nanometer products are ramping strongly, where you've got 200-gig and 400-gig polaris and porrima pam4 products. you've got your canopus 7-nanometer dsp for data center interconnect ramping.
and then on top of that, your 5-nanometer pipeline is quite strong. what i think you guys said at the analyst day, you have 20 tape-ups over the next 18 months. and i think the team has already been sampling a number of different 5-nanometer products. so, when does the team expect 5-nanometer revenues to become a material part of the revenue mix? is it calendar year '22? is it more likely '23? and are the first meaningful 5-nanometer revenues going to be more cloud-focused or carrier-focused?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure, harlan. yeah, i think what i'd frame your question around, you know, the process technology road map, where is marvell today. and you're right, some of those examples are spot-on relative to some of the optical components, etc. but we've got a diversity of process technologies that we use.
some of those came from different acquisitions. but you're in the ballpark. i think where it leads to is really 5-nanometer, wherein the case of the kind of classic marvell business, we effectively skipped 7-nanometer, right? so, there was a big investment -- 
harlan sur -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
in 5-nanometer. that is going to be led by a carrier in 5g. that's where the initial ramps will occur. those products, you know, are getting ready to go to production.
so, we'll see, you know, revenue in calendar '22 on 5-nanometer for our octeon products. but that's the initial ramp phase. it will really kick in more in '23 and '24. and then you'll see some of the dpu products and then a whole host of other 5-nanometer products really hit the market kind of in that '22, '23 timeframe.
the -- effectively, the entire company road map has converged on this 5-nanometer platform from storage to networking to, you know, even the inphi business is going to move there and take advantage. and so, a little bit pursuant to vivek's question earlier, we just -- we get tremendous leverage out of this process and technology platform that we put together, that we actually articulated even a couple of years ago at our 2020 investor day. and that's really paying dividends relative to managing the opex efficiently and being able to take out a significant number of designs in 5-nanometer that are going to last for a very, very long time. but certainly, it will be 5g first, then carrier, and then you're going to see all the other markets, enterprise, automotive, optical, you name it.
so, this has got a lot of legs behind it.
harlan sur -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thanks for the insights.

the next question will come from c.j. muse with evercore. please go ahead.
c.j. muse -- evercore isi -- analyst
yeah. good afternoon. thank you for taking the question. i guess i wanted to clarify on the supply side and then ask a question on auto.
so, on the supply side, you know, as you indicated in terms of, you know, roughly $5.9-plus billion for fiscal '23, are you saying that you secured that and then some? or can you give us, you know, some clarity there? and then your commentary on the auto compute side, very intriguing. i would love to hear more, matt, in terms of how we should be thinking about the timing of sort of initial design wins and when that should start to materially hit the model. thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure. yeah. on the first question on supply, yeah, we feel good about that range we gave for next year. certainly, there's still a lot of moving pieces, and we've got a lot of execution in front of us.
this is not a lay-up. things have not eased up. it's not like all of a sudden, supply has loosened. and what i would say is that the growth next year really just comprehends kind of keeping up with demand.
there's still going to be some unsupported backlog probably that we can't quite get to. so, we're working on that as a potential as well. but we certainly feel good about the 30 percent growth and that growth rate continuing, which is really where we were in q3, that's where we're going to be in q4. and what we're saying is we anticipate we can keep growing our revenues at that rate when you look out to next year.
but obviously, we're going to try to do even better. on the automotive compute side, yeah, it's pretty new. it's a little bit like some of our other markets, where we gave some initial indications as we were gaining traction, and then the story evolves from there. but, yeah, we're -- i'd say we're well underway on our first design, and the level of activity going on with the automotive oems around this topic is kind of off the charts at this point.
the -- i think there's such -- it's almost like a -- there's a renaissance, c.j., i think, in what i would call the infotainment age in -- when automotive oems really embrace these consumer technologies. and all of a sudden, you got things like usb chargers in your car, you got, you know, state-of-the-art audio, you got touchscreens, you know, as consumer tech went in. that had a big benefit to semiconductor companies. what we've been saying for a while, and it's coming true now, is that the data-centric, you know, semiconductor products and ips will be the next wave of growth.
we're seeing that in our networking products now, but it's very much moving to a compute-centric discussion. and there's a whole bunch of ways to skin that cat, but our model will be unique in that we're approaching it very similarly, c.j., to what we do in the cloud market, which is coming in with a broad ip portfolio, partnership-oriented model, build what somebody wants, let them put their stamp on it if they want to, and really customize and optimize for their particular system and use case, and bring all the goodness of all the marvell ips with it. so, it's pretty interesting discussions. there'll be more to come there, but we think this is going to be a very large long-term opportunity for the company.

the next question will come from mark lipacis with jefferies. please go ahead.
mark lipacis -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. matt, if i think about the kind of portfolio of assets that you've kind of pulled together here, i think about, you know, you have interconnect capabilities with inphi, processing capabilities with cavium, networking capabilities from innovium, and native marvell. and i'm wondering, to what extent, as your customers are coming to you for semi-custom solutions.
are they asking you to deliver solutions to them that are, you know, a mix of two or more of those kind of different capabilities? and so, you know, that would be the question for your customers, as well as like how you're thinking about delivering, you know, a complete, you know, optimized, you know, computing solution on the merchant side. and maybe as part of that, could you just, you know, as you have, you know, embraced the semi-custom model, can you share with us your view? like what does marvell look like, pick the time, three, five, 10 years down the line? what is a merchant model versus a semi-custom model? what, you know, how do your revenues split along those dimensions? thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure. yeah, mark, i think you highlighted it well. there's a pretty incredible set of assets inside the company now that i would argue is very unique in terms of all of these being under one roof. i would actually add, there's even more.
i think you gave three great examples. i would say our security ip, storage, and i/o. and you're absolutely right, when we engage in our various business models, whether it's a full custom design or a, call it, a semi-custom partnership design with a mix of ip from the customer and ours, every one of those ips gets put -- puts on the -- gets put on the table. and, you know, we gave an example actually in the prepared remarks about the storage accelerator opportunity, where it's not just a storage product, but it's got cpus, it's got security, and it's got some pretty advanced network interfaces, especially when you talk about things like going from nvme to ethernet, as an example.
so, very unique, and it's part of our value prop and the fact also that we can do this under one roof. and despite the fact that a lot of these ips we have or these people we have came from other companies, it's a one marvell culture in our company. and so, when we go and engage, this doesn't look like 12 business units, or, oh, there's the cavium team. i don't know if somebody has to go work with them, and there's the innovium team.
there's one integrated go-to-market strategy and technology platform, and it's very powerful. and i think it's going to become even more and more relevant. and i would say, we don't really think about our business, mark, at this point between pure merchant, pure semi-custom, pure custom. i mean, there's all these different business models in between.
and even our merchant products, what we're finding, like -- let me give you an example in storage, we end up doing a fair degree, for example, on our high-end data center-class ssd controllers now. we're doing a fair amount of customization, particularly on the firmware and the software, as an example, for each individual customer that makes it very, very sticky. and occasionally, we'll spin a metal option off, and we'll give them a certain feature that they want or need. but yeah, in a way, a lot of our business already today is effectively customized in the standpoint that we've really optimized it for the application.
and that could be in the hardware or it could be in the software and the firmware. so, i think that those lines are fairly blurred now is what i would say, mark, and i think it's good. i think it enables us to stay flexible, and it's enabling us to win, you know, new accounts.

the next question will come from srini pajjuri with smbc nikko securities. please go ahead.
srini pajjuri -- smbc nikko securities -- analyst
thank you, matt. a couple of clarifications actually. first, on the, you know, pricing. i think you mentioned that you've implemented some pricing actions to offset the higher input costs.
i'm just curious where we are in that process and how broadly you're implementing those, and to what extent, you know, that might be helping the top line as we go into next year. and then the second part of the question is, you know, obviously very strong outlook for next year. i'm just curious, given your breadth of products and, you know, end markets that you participate in, i'm guessing there's probably not going to be much seasonality, but i'd love to hear your thoughts on first half versus second half in terms of how you view, you know, the top line playing out next year. thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure. how about this? i'll take the first one, and then i'll let jean talk about the second one. yeah. so, on the first one -- so, let me take you back on pricing.
it was about this time a year ago when i got a call from our ops team that said, we have some serious issues because we're getting a number of price cost increases from a whole bunch of our different suppliers overseas, and what are we going to do? and this was like, what, and i spent the month of december negotiating, you know, higher cost increases by my supply chain, you know, a year ago. and we then worked and managed to pass those through earlier than the year. each time we've secured additional capacities, srini, we end up, in a lot of cases, having to bear a higher input cost. that's been part of the drill as supply has come available.
and so, i would say that this has been a gradual process. it's gone on throughout the year. it continues to go on. i think there's -- there continues to be inflation in the supply chain.
and, you know, our philosophy has been to be real fair about that, be very partner-oriented, not take advantage of it. and so, while it has flowed, you know, through in -- through the top line throughout the year, the biggest benefit of the growth we're seeing is just the raw demand, the design wins, the value that we're capturing. and certainly, there's a slight tailwind on the top line, but it's almost all from demand. and we certainly see that trend continuing through next year.
jean, do you want to cover the view of '23?
jean hu -- chief financial officer
yeah. yeah. to just follow what matt just said, right, next year, we see strong demand across all our end market. frankly, it's supply constrained, you know, when we talk about over 30 percent of revenue growth.
that's a supply constrained outlook of what we're looking at. so, the normal seasonality definitely does not apply here. we see q1, sequentially, on a very strong q4 base to increase, you know, approaching mid-single digit. and after q1, we will see continuous sequential increase.
supply dynamics is certainly something our team will continue to drive. but absolutely, if we have more supply, we definitely have more demand. we can ship more products to customers. so, you should expect we see sequential increase each quarter for the rest of the next year.

chris rolland -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
hey, guys. thank you for the question, fantastic update, and quarter. i was going to dig in on the hyperscale custom silicon side as well. maybe if you guys could talk about in terms of your outlook -- your big outlook there.
how many of, let's say, the top 7 big hyperscalers are you guys engaging? and it was kind of touched on, but, you know, storage versus networking and optics, where are you guys getting the most interest? i think you kind of covered that. but -- and then finally, this is probably too much to ask for, but in the past, we've had some nres associated with the -- these hyperscalers. are those nres still coming in, or are you guys on your own?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i think on the first question, i would say we're engaged broadly. the opportunity and the activity, though, is primarily centered around the big four in the u.s. that's where the technology leadership is.
that's where the thought leadership is. but we are -- and i think that's where the biggest drivers of our growth are going to come from. i think a lot of the others will follow. and so, i think there's leverage we're going to be able to get from that, but we're very well-engaged across the board.
and, you know, when we say custom, you're right, it's certainly, you know, custom-compute silicon for different types of workloads and applications, but also storage, networking, optics. it's a quite -- quite a broad range of technologies that we engage with, and security as well. on the nre front, that continues to be healthy. and that's not just a hyperscale story, that's really broad-based across all of our businesses.
and we get actually really good visibility, because when we start developing these products, custom, semi-custom, whatever the model is, there's a development agreement that comes with that. they're milestone-based. customer wants to have, you know, wants to have teeth. they want to have skin in the game, so do we.
so, that's typically where the nre then gets mapped out over a fairly long period in some cases. so, we have a nice road map and a view. and jean's team actually does a great job of being able to forecast the nre and manage it, and it continues to grow. that's part of the leverage that we're getting, you know, into next year is the opex is going to grow, but also the nre is going to grow.
so, that's enabling us to -- we get kind of a double whammy, right? because while we're growing our opex and we're hiring people and we're staffing up, we're growing the nre as well. and so, think of that as this incremental spend we've got that's not completely visible, but yet contains very important engineering resource and r&d resource that gets deployed toward high-roi projects that spit out, you know, several years later. and so, it's a really -- i think it's a virtuous cycle. and our team's done a really good job of managing that as part of the business model.
i would, you know, hit on the final kind of example, on the automotive compute design win we talked about. it was -- it's heavily funded by r&d -- by nre, excuse me. and again, that's a multi-year project. and it's so critical.
i mean, you basically can't build a car without it. so, you got to imagine, it's going to be really important to have a, you know, have a real, you know, significant contract around that and for us to have a significant co-funding to make it happen. so, it's a pretty important part of the business model, chris, and it continues to be healthy. thanks.

thanks for squeezing me in. hey, matt, you gave us a great outlook through fiscal '23. but as you looked out beyond fiscal '23, i think you mentioned, you see another big step-up in the 5g business at nokia as the 5-nanometer platform starts to ramp. but i'm just wondering, can you give us a sense, is that step-up really marvell capturing even greater content on your current share of base station to that customer? or do you think your 5-nanometer platform is allowing you to grab greater share at that customer as the 5-nanometer platforms ramp? thank you.

ok. let me give you a broader answer, and then i'll dive into the 5g. so, just as you think about the growth from fiscal '23, next year, to fiscal '24, the biggest overall growth actually and step-up is in the cloud. and you remember, quinn, at the investor day, we outlined this sort of very strong design win activity we had, which was going to result in the $400 million incremental revenue in fiscal '24 from cloud and then going to doubling again the year after.
so, that -- when you think of a step-up, that's where that's coming from. 5g is also kind of right behind, and that's going to be very strong as well. and to your point, one of our key partners and customers there is nokia, as you mentioned. that in 5-nanometer is where we not only support them on their ambitions around baseband, but also on the cpu side and transport processing side.
and so, that's going to be -- that is content gain. that is new for us that starts at that time. that's all been planned. that's been -- that's all kind of going well and tracking to what we thought.
but i thought it was important to note the timing around that and highlight that we have more legs even in 5g, you know, beyond next year. because that will just really be the first full year of production there. so, actually, we won't even peak for years after. so, really strong outlook on cloud and 5g in fiscal '24 and beyond.
and then, of course, you got the automotive story layering in, and all that drives a lot of goodness in the model.
quinn bolton -- needham and company -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
the next question will come from toshiya hari with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
toshi hari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you for squeezing me in, and congratulations on the very strong results. matt, i wanted to ask about the enterprise networking business. you talked a little bit about your share growth in ethernet, i believe. i was hoping you could elaborate on that a little bit, what's driving the success and if you can speak to sustainability there.
and then as my second part, again, sticking to enterprise networking, i think all of us appreciate the secular nature of your business in data center and 5g and auto and industrial. i guess, enterprise networking is perhaps, at least on a relative basis, a little bit more cyclical in nature. with the business growing, you know, kind of in the 50 percent to 60 percent range year over year, how should we think about sustainability of growth as we transition into 2022? thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure. yeah. so, maybe i'll answer it in two pieces. the first is -- you're probably asking is, well, what happened? why? how did you guys do this? and i think if you look back, we've made -- we've had a commitment to enterprise, ok, from day one, when i became ceo.
we never milked the cow, we never took this market for granted, we -- and most of this growth, as you noted, is organic marvell, right? so, this comes from our ethernet switch team, which really focused on leadership products, latest process node, very strong software capability from our switch business unit, and a real focus on the enterprise market in new products and new product development, product definition. so, that had a huge benefit that started three or four years ago, and now those designs are ramping. the second is in our ethernet phy transceiver business, we've also moved that from being a technology laggard to a technology leader in ethernet phys. and we also did an acquisition of aquantia, which was a relatively small company when we bought it.
but when we put the two teams together, the combined share that we've been able to drive has been very significant, and the road map we were able to accelerate dramatically. that's one of our product areas as an example that we're driving to 5-nanometer, ok? and then that has all kinds of integration opportunities. so, customers like the road map. they like the team.
they like the story. and that's now showing up. and certainly, the enterprise market is not growing at 50 percent a year, so you have to draw your conclusion. there's been certainly a share shift as customers have adopted our solutions.
and we do believe that this business is going to continue to grow. it will grow next year. it may not grow on the annualized basis at 50 percent, because you're going to start lapping at some point, and we're coming off of a relatively low point from last year. but also remember, our content has gone up on each of these generations, as multi-gig ethernet becomes much more prevalent, and especially as enterprises are spending again and implementing wi-fi 6, which requires high-speed wired internet connect -- ethernet connections at multi-gigabit.
we're seeing switch ports go up on multi-gig, which has our phys attached to it plus our switches. so, there's also a content story here, toshi. so, i wouldn't exactly say, well, enterprise is like a low-single-digit grower and eventually will trend back there. i think between product leadership, share gain, and then content increase, enterprise can continue to be a winning business for marvell.
toshi hari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
very helpful.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
and i think that's the last question. yeah.
toshi hari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah.
toshi hari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
congrats again.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer

operator
good afternoon, and welcome to marvell's technologies fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to mr. ashish saran, vice president of investor relations.
please go ahead.
ashish saran -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. welcome to marvell's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 earnings call. joining me today are matt murphy, marvell's president and ceo; and jean hu, our cfo. i would like to remind everyone that certain comments made today may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations.
please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the sec today and posted on our website, as well as our most recent 10-k and 10-q filings. we do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. during our call today, we will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures. a reconciliation between our gaap and non-gaap financial measures is available in the investor relations section of our website.
with that, i'll turn the call over to matt for his comments on our performance. matt? 
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. let me start with a recap of the exceptional results marvell delivered in fiscal 2022, an absolutely pivotal year for the company. we saw a substantial increase in design wins, the completion of two significant acquisitions and strong revenue growth with great momentum in all our businesses. our 5-nanometer technology platform, along with the rest of our data-centric ip portfolio, proved to be a key enabler for winning new opportunities in all of our focus markets.
our sales and product teams did a tremendous job securing new sockets and drove a record level of design wins in fiscal 2022, a big step up from the prior year. fiscal 2022 was also a breakout year for our cloud optimized silicon platform, winning a sizable number of important sockets, which we expect will drive significant revenue for the company going forward. we remain focused on extending our leadership in process technology and advanced packaging. our engineering teams are driving the architecture and design of our complex analog and mixed-signal ip to three nanometers.
they are also advancing chiplet and 3d packaging technologies to support the integration of multiple advanced process nodes inside a single package. during the year, we completed the integration of inphi, a transformational acquisition that substantially increased our participation in the fast-growing cloud data center market. the marvell and inphi team share very similar values founded on engineering excellence, innovation and a passion for our customers' success. the teams have integrated exceptionally well across the company and are jointly taking our capabilities to new heights.
inphi's position at the core of cloud data centers has given the team unique insights into next-generation network architectures. the inphi team has developed deep relationships with tier 1 cloud customers, which has been instrumental in unlocking additional opportunities for the combined company, including the success of our cloud optimized silicon platform. the transaction, which was accretive to non-gaap earnings within the first full quarter after close has been a resounding success, delivering revenue in fiscal 2022 above our deal model. we further complemented our cloud business with the innovium acquisition, adding their leading cloud optimized switches to marvell's feature-rich enterprise and carrier switch portfolio.
the innovium team is fully integrated and are leveraging marvell's 5-nanometer technology platform and extensive serdes ip to accelerate the road map for our next-generation 51.2t switches. this development is closely aligned with our electrooptics dsp road map to provide customers with a complete solution optimized for power and performance. the combined marvell and innovium ethernet switch portfolios are proving very attractive to data center customers, among them, a new design win at a tier 1 cloud customer in asia. we are also engaged with multiple additional customers and are looking forward to further expanding our footprint in this fast-growing market.
moving on to revenue. in fiscal 2022, revenue grew 50% year on year to $4.46 billion driven by robust demand for our products. the organic marvell business and the acquired inphi business were both strong contributors to growth. our results reflect our success in the cloud, 5g and automotive end markets, which collectively doubled in revenue from the prior year.
our enterprise networking end market also had a phenomenal year with revenue growing 43% year over year. later in the call today, you will hear more details about the start of an extended period of infrastructure refreshes in the enterprise market. we expect that these, combined with share and content gains from our merchant products, will produce enduring growth in our enterprise business. and not only that, you will also hear me talk about a new driver of revenue growth in the enterprise networking market.
shifting gears to our fourth quarter. we delivered a record $1.34 billion in revenue, growing 11% sequentially and 68% year over year. revenue exceeded the midpoint of guidance with all end markets growing sequentially and year over year. a particular note, cloud and enterprise networking delivered stronger than projected contributions.
cloud, 5g and auto collectively increased to 40% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. we exited fiscal 2022 with record bookings momentum and opportunities for accelerated growth across our business going forward. we continue to win in the market as our customers look to expand the scope of their engagements with marvell. our operations team continues to secure capacity, and we are tightly engaged with our strategic suppliers.
growth in demand continues to outstrip increases in supply. and as a result, our delinquency has continued to grow. we are working closely with our suppliers to secure additional capacity wherever possible. let me now move on to discussing our five end markets, starting with data center.
in our data center end market, revenue for the fourth quarter was $574 million, growing 15% sequentially and 113% year over year, exceeding our guidance. the majority of the growth was from cloud driven by robust demand from hyperscale customers. let me note that our on-premise data center business also grew sequentially and year over year. in the fourth quarter, sequential and year-over-year revenue growth was broad-based with multiple product lines contributing to the excellent results.
we expect the demand outlook from cloud customers to remain strong, and we are also looking forward to the ramp of new design wins. at our investor day, we discussed our expectations for $400 million in incremental revenue contributions in fiscal 2024 from new cloud optimized wins, doubling to $800 million in fiscal 2025. development of these programs is well on track with several products slated to enter production later this year and start contributing meaningful revenue. since that update, we have won multiple additional cloud optimized designs.
similar to the wins in prior quarters, these chips are for a variety of networking and compute offload or acceleration functions in cloud data centers. we are expecting revenue contributions from these new wins to start as early as fiscal 2024 and then ramp more substantially over time. both of these wins are incremental to what we had discussed at our investor day. in aggregate, in fiscal 2022, we have won over a dozen cloud optimized programs across multiple tier 1 cloud customers.
a significant number of these designs are for custom dpu implementations, reflecting the increase in the attach rate of dpus inside cloud data centers. we expect this trend to accelerate in next-generation architectures. we are confident that we are uniquely positioned to win these opportunities with our leading portfolio of compute, networking, security, storage and high-speed electro-optics ip, all of them delivered on our cloud optimized 5-nanometer platform. in our electro-optics business, we are continuing to innovate.
we are aggressively driving the road map to improve power performance in leading-edge technology nodes with our next-generation products. we have begun volume shipments of our 800-gig pam4 dsps, enabling customers to start deployment of 800-gig optical modules in cloud data center and ai network applications. we are confident that we are the industry's first pam4 dsp supplier to achieve this production milestone. let me now discuss a new product line we just announced for the emerging active electrical cable market.
this opens up another avenue of growth for us in the data center, leveraging our core dsp expertise. today, our pam4 products are primarily deployed in optical modules used in cloud data centers for long-reach switch-to-switch connections. in the same data centers, short-reach connections between switches, between server to top of rack switches and in ai interconnects have traditionally used passive electrical cables for speeds of up to 50 gig per lane. none of these requires advanced signal processing today.
however, in next-generation cloud data centers, ai, ml and other data-intensive workloads are pushing these short-reach connections to higher 100 gig per lane throughput. at these speeds, passive electrical cables have significant reach and performance limitations. to overcome these challenges, the industry is turning to active electrical cables, referred to as adcs, which require advanced dsps. to meet that demand, marvell has introduced the industry's first 400-gig and 800-gig dsps for the adc market based on our leading pam4 service technology.
our unique business model allows us to work with both cloud customers, as well as all leading cable manufacturers to drive an open ecosystem. our industry-leading dsps have enabled major cable vendors to complete development of their first adc solutions. we are also working with multiple cloud operators to take advantage of this new growth opportunity. on the storage side, our leading process technology platform and pcie road map execution continues to drive new design wins for our data center ssd controllers.
during the quarter, we secured designs with our pcie gen 5 controllers at two additional nand oems, making a total of three who are adopting the marvell solution. looking ahead, our team is also pushing forward with our pcie gen 6 development, and our customers are very excited about our road map. moving on to our expectations for the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2023 from our data center end market. we project revenue to grow sequentially in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis and more than double year over year.
we are expecting another strong performance led by cloud customers across a broad range of products. we are also projecting the start of a strong ramp of our 400-gig zr data center interconnect products. in fact, we are expecting this ramp to drive our dci revenue to a new record in the first quarter, eclipsing the peak we had achieved in the 100 gig cycle. even at this very early stage of industry adoption, we are excited to see the rapid growth of 400 zr, and we expect to see a lot more growth over time.
looking forward, we see ongoing growth in the data center, including revenue contribution starting from the new cloud-optimized product ramps to drive another step-up in our data center revenue in the second half of this fiscal year and beyond. turning to our carrier infrastructure end market. revenue for the fourth quarter was $241 million, growing 12% sequentially and 45% year over year. these results were driven by our 5g business, which delivered substantial revenue growth of over 30% sequentially, exceeding our guidance.
we benefited from the broader rollout of 5g technology and product ramps at multiple base station customers. marvell recently announced a collaboration with dell on their new suite of telecom solutions to help service providers enable their transformation to open cloud-native networks. this offering includes a codeveloped open ran accelerator card using our proven octeon fusion baseband silicon to deliver in-line 5g layer 1 processing. we continue to see strong traction on our 5g technology platform, resulting in another key 5-nanometer design win for a radio asic at a tier 1 base station customer.
following the strong step-up in the fourth quarter, we expect revenue from the carrier end market to continue to grow in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. we are projecting revenue to grow in the low single digits sequentially, while year-over-year growth is expected to remain strong at over 40%. moving on to our enterprise networking and end market. revenue for the fourth quarter was $263 million, growing 6% sequentially and 64% year over year, another strong performance from this large and growing marvell business.
as you heard in the opening remarks, this end market is going through an inflection. hybrid work is here to stay, but the current networking infrastructure was never designed to support this flexible, seamless connect from anywhere, immersive and high video usage environment. companies are now embarking upon an extended period of refreshing their infrastructure, becoming borderless, enabling new digital capabilities, massively increasing bandwidth, building redundancy and beefing up security. you will also remember from our prior discussions that we have been winning designs with our refreshed products over several years in this end market.
these wins have typically come with higher marvell content driven by new features such as multi-gig ethernet and macsec. as the upgrade cycle in the enterprise networking market gains momentum, we are beginning to see our customers starting to ship their new platforms where we have higher share and increased content. looking forward, we expect enterprises will continue to modernize their networks. and as a result, we project ongoing growth to continue from this end market.
let me now discuss a new source of growth for marvell in this end market, custom silicon. we have a very successful custom business in the carrier end market and are also building a large revenue stream from hyperscalers with our cloud optimized products. we are now enabling the enterprise networking market to take advantage of our advanced technology platform. i would like to point out that these designs frequently pull through additional marvell content across a number of our product lines.
our pipeline of opportunities is growing, and we see custom silicon becoming another leg to the enterprise networking stool, adding to the ongoing growth from our merchant products. we expect revenue from custom products and enterprise networking to grow sharply to well over $100 million in fiscal 2023. in aggregate, we expect a very durable period of high growth from enterprise networking to strongly complement our cloud, 5g and auto pillars. looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect growth to accelerate in our enterprise networking end market.
we are projecting revenue to be up sequentially in the mid-teens on a percentage basis and year over year to grow over 70%. this growth outlook reflects our expectations of higher supply to support our product ramps and the ongoing enterprise infrastructure refresh cycle. turning to our automotive and industrial end market, revenue for the fourth quarter was $79 million, growing 19% sequentially and 134% year over year. strong revenue growth in this end market is being driven by higher adoption of our brightlane ethernet solutions in a growing number of vehicles from multiple oems.
looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we are expecting strong sequential growth to continue from auto and a flattish outlook for our industrial business. as a result, for the auto and industrial end market, we are projecting sequential revenue growth in the high single digits on a percentage basis, while year-over-year growth is expected above 80%. moving on to our consumer end market. revenue for the fourth quarter was $185 million, growing 2% sequentially and 11% year over year.
growth in this end market is being driven by our ssd controllers, shipping into consumer-oriented platforms such as game consoles. looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect revenue to be flattish on a sequential basis and continue to grow year over year, approximately in the double digits on a percentage basis. in closing, we delivered record results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022, growing revenue well above our long-term target model. we expect this momentum to continue.
marvell is uniquely positioned to benefit from the three most important growth opportunities in semiconductors: cloud, 5g and automotive. the transformation in the enterprise end market is also becoming another continuing growth driver for marvell. we expect secular growth to continue from all our end markets, further supported by our large and growing pipeline of secured design wins, which will drive incremental revenue. we are also working to make sure that we grow in a responsible and sustainable manner.
over the past year, marvell has taken meaningful action on evolving our environmental, social and governance strategy, setting new goals and increasing transparency. we've committed to achieving net zero emissions as a company and are setting a science-based target to put us on track to reach this goal. building a more inclusive and diverse workforce is another important area of focus, and we have increased our outreach to traditionally underrepresented talent. i would encourage investors to visit our new esg website to review the goals we've outlined and our progress to date.
on behalf of marvell's board and leadership team, i thank our valued employees for the outstanding results they've helped deliver in the fourth quarter and throughout fiscal year 2022. ours is a highly resilient team that has stayed focused and outperformed through an extended period of challenges and uncertainty. this is an exciting time for our company as we've hit an inflection point in our growth cycle and are seeing strong momentum in our businesses across the board. i look forward to continuing to work alongside our exceptional marvell team to address the numerous opportunities in front of us.
with that, i'll turn the call over to jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.
jean hu -- chief financial officer
thanks, matt, and good afternoon, everyone. i'll start with a summary of our fiscal year 2022 results. we are very pleased with our performance in fiscal 2022, delivering record revenue and profitability while continuing to aggressively invest to drive strong long-term growth from the data infrastructure market. revenue grew significantly by 50% year on year to $4.46 billion.
gaap gross margin was 46.3% and the gaap loss per diluted share was $0.53. our non-gaap gross margin was 64.9%, expanding by 160 basis points, reflecting the increase in value and differentiation we provide to our customers. revenue growth and gross margin expansion, combined with strong operating leverage from our business model, drove robust growth in earnings for the year. non-gaap operating margin expanded by 860 basis points from 24.2% to 32.8%.
and non-gaap earnings per share grew 71% year on year to $1.57. moving on to our financial results for the first quarter. revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.343 billion, exceeding the middle point of our guidance, growing 11% sequentially and 68% year over year. data center was our largest end market, driving 43% of consolidated revenue.
enterprise networking was next largest with 19% of total revenue, followed by carrier infrastructure at 18%, consumer at 14% and auto industrial at 6%. gaap gross margin was 51.1%. non-gaap gross profit was $877 million or 65.3% of revenue, another record driven by rich product mix, reflecting our strong ip position and leading product portfolio. gaap operating expenses were $652 million and they include the cost of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, legal settlements and acquisition and divestiture-related costs.
non-gaap operating expenses were $390 million, at the low end of our guidance range. gaap operating income was $35 million. non-gaap operating profit was $487 million, up 115% from a year ago, growing significantly faster than revenue. we achieved a record of 36.3% non-gaap operating margin, an improvement of 790 basis points from the prior year, reflect the strong operating leverage in our business model.
for the fourth quarter, gaap income per diluted share was $0.01. non-gaap income per diluted share was $0.50, up 72% year over year, exceeding the middle point of our guidance. now turning to our balance sheet and the cash flow. during the quarter, cash flow from operations was $346 million.
i'm pleased with our strong cash flow generation while investing significantly in working capital to support strong revenue growth. we returned $51 million to shareholders through cash dividends. as of the end of the fourth fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalents were $614 million, and our long-term debt was $4.5 billion. our gross debt-to-ebitda ratio was 2.6 times and net debt-to-ebitda ratio was 2.3 times.
we are confident that we are on track to achieve our targeted gross debt-to-ebitda ratio of two times by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023, at which time we expect to restart share repurchase. inventory at the end of the fourth quarter was $720 million. $39 million of this inventory balance is from innovium due to purchase price accounting. we anticipate amortizing this step-up over the next two quarters.
we have also increased our working process inventory to support the rapid growth in revenue we are forecasting. in summary, the marvell team executed exceptionally well, delivering accelerated top line growth and strong earnings expansion significantly faster than revenue growth. turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. we are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.425 billion, plus or minus 3%.
we expect our gaap gross margin will be in the range of 49.6% to 50.6%. we project our non-gaap gross margin will be in the range of 65% to 66%. we project our gaap operating expenses to be approximately $672 million. we anticipate our non-gaap operating expenses to be in the range of $430 million to $435 million.
for the first quarter, we expect non-gaap tax rate of 6%. we expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be 848 million. and our diluted weighted average share outstanding will be 863 million. as a result, we anticipate gaap earnings per share in the range of a loss of $0.03 per share on the low end to an income of $0.05 per diluted share on the high end.
we expect non-gaap income per diluted share in the range of $0.48 to $0.54. operator, please open the line and announce q&a instructions. thank you.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from timothy arcuri with ubs. you may now go ahead.
timothy arcuri -- ubs -- analyst
thanks a lot. matt, it seems like you're ahead of plan, and i'm wondering if you could update us on your fiscal '23 growth forecast. and then also, as you look to fiscal '24, i know you said you're going to grow more than 30% this year. but it seems like you can do better than that, now it seems like you're getting a little more supply.
and then also, i think you had hinted that, well, maybe you can grow somewhere in that range also for fiscal '24 because the fiscal '23 guidance didn't include any work on -- in delinquencies. so i'm just kind of wondering if you can update us on those. it sounds like you'd be incrementally more confident that you can grow quite a bit higher possibly than 30% this year and maybe even 30% in fiscal '24?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. great, tim. thanks for the question. and yeah, just to answer, very happy that we're ahead of plan right now based on our strong outlook for q1.
second, we do continue to get more supply. you saw that in our fourth quarter, as well as in our first quarter outlook, which is very positive. i think as well, the order momentum continues to be strong. we had very, very strong bookings in our fourth quarter, which give us a lot of confidence in our '23 outlook and beyond.
and then, of course, new design wins, when you look out to '24, also have us feeling very good. so i think we're tracking really well across the board. and we're very pleased with the results we've got plus our outlook plus the long-term view.
timothy arcuri -- ubs -- analyst
matt, can i sneak in a quick second one? i was wondering if you can maybe -- 
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
timothy arcuri -- ubs -- analyst
yeah. thanks. can you sort of size the custom asic business? i know it's reported across different segments, but can you maybe add up all of the custom asic revenue and just give us a sense for sort of how big it is in aggregate today. thanks.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. hey, tim, this is an interesting question. we've actually gotten this on and off over the years. and just to kind of refresh the investors on the line, it's really hard to define this precisely because when you think about customization, you have a range of products and business models that we offer.
for example, we have a full custom business in the traditional sense of the world. that would be an asic business that we picked up from avera. but we also do a lot of semi-custom work or cloud optimized work as an example, where we work either with large hyperscalers or in the case of telecom with 5g to take the customer's ip and our ip and put it together. and then even in our merchant offerings, candidly, we end up doing skus and derivatives that have something special for what our customers want.
so i'd say that generally, it's not something we can even exactly quantify internally. what i would say is it's an absolute trend. it's the way the market is moving. you have to be able to have a rich set of intellectual property and flexibility in your business model in how you engage with your customers.
and that's not just for the hyperscale cloud, tim, it's also for 5g. it's for enterprise as well. and then in the future, i think this is going to be a key differentiator for us in automotive as well is what we call our flexible business model. but anyway, i think that's as much as i can say.
it's a hot trend. it's the way the market is moving. and we're probably the best positioned company to take advantage of it.
timothy arcuri -- ubs -- analyst
ok, matt. thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, tim.
operator
our next question comes from vivek arya with bank of america securities. you may now go ahead.
vivek arya -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. matt, given that conditions are so supply constrained, how are you ensuring the quality of demand and the backlog and making sure customers are not just stocking up in product? and related to that is the strength in the enterprise market, which seems to be well above what conventional wisdom and history would suggest, but you seem to be incrementally even more positive. so just thoughts on just demand quality overall and sustainability of the strength in enterprise.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure, vivek. yeah, this is something we've been paying extremely close attention to, not just even in the fourth quarter but really at the onset of this supply and demand imbalance as we were going through the pandemic. we have a very rigorous internal review process. we have very good end market data in terms of everything from how many base stations ship to the number of -- to which carriers are deploying, that would be a 5g example.
and then what is our content as it relates to that, we gave very good data on the cloud deployments. we know how many servers are shipping. we can then calculate all kinds of things about which products that we have attaching to those. same with enterprise, etc.
so we have an end market focus that we look at. we also -- because we're actually a very focused company, vivek, we have a handful of major accounts that we go very deep with. and given the system-level nature of what we do, we have very good insight into what they're doing and what the needs are. on top of that, we've also put in place a very rigorous, i guess, engagement model with our customers, where the backlog is firm.
we do have noncancelable conditions on those orders. reschedules are limited. and so we've gone through a process to make sure that as we schedule the backlog and we get bookings, it's actually what people want. and then we prioritize around that.
and then finally, i would say that this crisis has brought, i'd say, the leaders of the chip industry and the leaders of the oems even closer. and so my interactions all the way to the ceo level of our major customers is another way that we triangulate. as it relates to enterprise, most of the growth here, vivek, candidly is a combination of significant content gain as the electronics inside these various pieces of enterprise infrastructure have migrated to things like multi-gigabit ethernet. they've added things like security and macsec.
we've also -- and there's just more asp per port as an example there. we've also been focused on this area. so if you look at traditional marvell business in enterprise switch and phy, we've gained market share through our offerings by refreshing the portfolio and staying competitive from a technical standpoint and staying focused on that market. and then we also have new product areas ramping, like custom silicon in enterprise, which basically, if you look at where we were a year ago in that custom area, i mean, that business is up dramatically year over year, and it's ramping very sharply in our fiscal '23.
so there's a lot layering in. and the trends are real, too. i mean if you just look at what we even go through at marvell and other major companies, as you bring people back to work, things have changed over the last two years. and so there's an enterprise upgrade cycle that's also kicking in as companies spend to modernize their infrastructure.
so we think it's a combination of those things. the numbers are dramatic in terms of the growth. we're excited by that, and we see this business continuing to grow in fiscal '23 and beyond off of this already higher base of revenue that we're achieving.

our next question comes from john pitzer with credit suisse. you may now go ahead.
john pitzer -- credit suisse -- analyst
yeah, good afternoon, guys. thanks for letting me ask a question. matt, congratulations on the solid results. a lot of things to highlight.
i was wondering if you could spend a few minutes just talking about gross margins, both cyclically and secularly, clearly, you're seeing some input cost increases in your supply chain. i'm assuming given how strong gross margins are, your ability to pass that on is pretty high. but the real crux of my question is, when you guys talked about sort of restructuring the arm server business as more of a custom silicon business, you kind of talked about how margins on that customer -- gross margins on that custom silicon side could be a little bit lower op margins kind of neutral to the overall model. but ever since you kind of reset that bar, you've done a better job on the gross margin line.
so i guess my question really is as you're getting into these custom engagements, are you finding out that the profitability is perhaps better than you originally thought?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, john, for the questions. and certainly, the solid results, in a large part, were driven by the very durable gross margin performance of the company. we're pleased to have set a record gross margin of 65.3% this past quarter.
we also guided gross margins to be in the 65% to 66% range, which is, call it, at the mid. then we went all the way up to the high-end range of our long-term model. so despite input cost increases and all kinds of challenges the teams faced, i think the quality of our engineering and the quality of the products is ultimately what's enabling us to maintain our gross margin in a range that allows us to invest back in the business. on your question about what happens with some of these custom products and when they start ramping and -- well, first of all, they've already started ramping, right? we're deep into high volume in cloud optimized silicon.
if you look at our data center revenue, it's obviously our biggest segment within data center. the majority of that is cloud. cloud on its own would be larger than any of our other segments. so there's already that contribution.
and if you remember from our investor day, jean had a great chart of our gross margins by end market. and if you recall, data center and automotive actually were the two highest ones, and those are also -- happen to be two of our highest growth businesses. so look, i think an individual product here or there that's lower gross margin, if you will, but higher op margin. to be honest, this business is already so large and it's growing so fast.
we're able to deal with anything that might be slightly less gross margin than the average because we also have products like from inphi, as an example, that are growing even -- that are higher gross margin and are growing even faster. so i think that's the beauty of our model, john. we can actually grow this business. we can be aggressive to take large, high-volume sockets, especially in compute.
and we could do that and still maintain the company's long-term target model on margins, which i think is a testament to the business model we've put together and the rich mix of products we have.
john pitzer -- credit suisse -- analyst
helpful. thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer

our next question comes from c.j. muse with evercore. you may now go ahead.
c.j. muse -- evercore isi -- analyst
yeah, good afternoon. thanks for taking the question. matt, on the call, you talked about a number of new products that are ramping this year and beyond, as well as new design wins. so curious, two-part question.
first, are you including both of those -- or did you include both of those when you originally guided the $5.9 billion for fiscal '23? and then as you think about these design wins coming into the model, is there a way to kind of rank order or highlight kind of the 1, 2 or 3 that you think are most relevant to the model into fiscal '24 and beyond?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure. yeah, cj, i think as it relates to the design win side and new products, i think a couple of things to think about. first of all, as i've said in my remarks -- and i just want to give a shout-out. our sales field applications team and our business units absolutely knocked it out of the park this year on design wins.
it was a significant step-up in achievement. we just went through our process to review kind of the final numbers. they did a great job. our funnel is as large as ever with respect to the opportunities in front of us.
the incremental wins that we've got, some of them do -- as we mentioned, they will layer in, in fiscal '24 and '25. some of them may start a little bit earlier. but typically, when you get a new design win on a new product, it's typically not in the existing fiscal year. but remember, we've also got the revenue that's going to feed the $400 million, going to $800 million.
that's looking really good, and that's also planned to start ramping in the second half of this year. so i think just the way to think about it is the incremental wins we keep getting in the cloud area specifically really sort of are additive to the fiscal '24 and '25. there's not -- that you see just wouldn't from a timing perspective, capture a lot of it this year. but i would say, at the same time, the ones that we already won are tracking very well.
c.j. muse -- evercore isi -- analyst

our next question comes from blayne curtis with barclays. you may now go ahead.
blayne curtis -- barclays -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thanks for taking my question. i just want to follow up on john's question on margins. and one thing we saw, last month your earnings was -- that pricing kind of superseded future wafer costs.
a lot of people saw a benefit in the first quarter and margins come down. so i'm just kind of curious if you can talk about the kind of the strength in gross margin. and then just i wanted to make sure that this is a level that you kind of build off of and it wasn't that same dynamic a lot of other companies saw through earnings.
jean hu -- chief financial officer
hi, blayne, thanks for the question. i think we have been in a very tight supply chain environment. so we have been dealing with the past increase, the price increase on the supply chain side for a long time now. for us, our team will work with the suppliers and customers closely and really try to just offset the cost for increase during the whole thing.
we have a very long product cycle. so we can plan ahead. our gross margin is primarily driven by the end market mix that matt talked about earlier. if you look at this q4 and q1, the guidance, we are very pleased with the gross margin but largely because the data center is growing really fast.
automotive, they are growing really fast enterprise market and market gross margin is also very strong, continue to trend up. so overall, if you look at our mix, that really drive our gross margin. for the rest of the year, it will be the similar situation in any given quarter. it largely depends on the mix.

our next question comes from joe moore with morgan stanley. you may now go ahead.
joe moore -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, thank you. i wonder if you could touch on the supply demand situation a little bit more. you said delinquencies are still kind of rising, but you are getting more supply. any progress on getting lead times down? and can you tell -- in a lot of these cases, are you still kind of the bottleneck, is your product constrained? or is there any possibility of your product kind of waiting for other chips to arrive?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. hey, joe, great question. and you've been doing this a long time like me. it's shocking to say, i never thought we would be at this point in this cycle.
but yeah, the gap between supply and demand has actually grown. and we look at our -- some companies call it unfulfilled backlog. we -- i was raised in the old school, which is calling it delinquency. but that number continues to rise each quarter.
it rose in the fourth quarter and it will also rise in the first quarter. so demand is very strong. now i think we're -- so -- but yes, we're getting more supply. and you see we're actually exceeding our guidance from last quarter and our q1 guide is very strong, both sequentially and year over year.
but we're still having to grind hard with our suppliers to get more of what we need. we've moved -- although i'd say, dramatically, we've -- our position within the supply chain, i think, relative to the key suppliers we engage with, understanding our opportunity, i mean that has been a big transformation over the last year. and hats off to our team in operations, led by chris koopmans and also our business units and even myself personally engaging up and down the supply chain. so they understand our opportunity, which is, i think, helping us.
and we just continue to prioritize, joe. it's -- i'm very close. i'm personally involved with all the major accounts. we've managed to not be the long pole in the tent or if we were, it wasn't for very long.
so we've been able to sort of stay barely ahead but -- and we're satisfying customers. we don't have anybody lying down that i know of right now, but it gets tight as we continue to ramp and customers have designed us in. but i think we're managing it very well, and we'll continue to just be very tactical in the short term to get the supply we need to match it to the right demand, make sure we're not building inventory and do our best to manage through this unprecedented cycle we're in. and i think the final thing i would say is it's a cycle that we haven't seen at least in terms of the strength and the duration.
and i think on top of that, with marvell, given our increased market share, the end market exposure we have with the secular growth drivers we have, that's making it even -- creating even more pressure on us given those dynamics. but we're up for the challenge. and i think our team is doing a great job, and we'll continue to work closely with our customers to make it happen.
joe moore -- morgan stanley -- analyst

our next question comes from tore svanberg with stifel. you may now go ahead.
tore svanberg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yes. thank you, and congratulations on the record results. matt, i think the big highlight at least for me this quarter is what you said about kind of custom enterprise business. and if you look at your carrier and your cloud business, i think it's pretty obvious, right? i mean there's like a handful of companies.
but enterprise is probably a much bigger group of companies. could you just elaborate a little bit on that? i mean, on the custom enterprise side, are you actually going to be working with more than perhaps a half dozen companies?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
well, like everything, tore, ultimately, even though there's certainly a broader set of oems and diversity of applications in, let's call it, the enterprise market than maybe people that make base stations. the reality is the folks that can afford or want to do a full custom design is a narrower subset. that being said, i think our ability to do this kind of optimization, if you will, without maybe having to do a full custom design, that's one advantage we bring to the table. that's a little bit of a different business model.
and then -- but yeah, it's multiple customers that we're engaged with. and they want a lot of the same things, including all of our high-performance ip. they want 5-nanometer going to 3-nanometer. actually, our capability in compute is very attractive, especially as a lot of the trends in the hyperscale now, tore, are starting to manifest themselves in the enterprise.
and people are looking to do acceleration in an offload fashion. in our dpu octeon dpu capability, whether we sell it as a card or we customize a chip and then somebody else puts the solution together, there's a lot of really interesting things going on in the enterprise. and then finally, even on the core processing opportunity as well. our latest octeon 10 product is very competitive in the market.
it's the most competitive one we've had in 5-nanometer. so anyway, much broader, obviously, set of opportunities than we had before, tore. but going back to your comment, yes, on custom enterprise, we're really pleased with the uplift in revenue. and we're also pleased with the pipeline we have there because these products last a long time.
and the overall profitability and gross margin profile of the enterprise business in marvell is, and jean showed this at the investor day, but it's about where the corporate average is. so very healthy gross margins, broad set of customers, broad set of applications and very long product life cycles that are very sticky once you get designed in. and we're able to pull through other sockets. i mean there are -- in ethernet-based designs as an example, you can pull through the fight.
so there's a lot of great things going on in enterprise.

our next question comes from srini pajjuri with smbc nikko securities. you may now go ahead.
srini pajjuri -- nikko securities -- analyst
thank you. hi, matt. question on the 400 zr cycle. you said it's going to grow in q1, but you also said something even more interesting, that it's going to be high -- i guess you said the revenue is going to be higher than the previous peak.
i know we are in very, very early days in this cycle. so if you could just talk about what's driving that strength? and also, if you could put into some perspective how big you think the sam is going to be versus the previous, i guess, 100zr, i think that would be very helpful.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure. and just to clarify, when we talk about the peak, i'm including the original 100-gig products, which is colorz, right, which was developed by inphi, and now we have colorz 2, which is 400 gig. so colorz, when it was sort of at its peak, was about $100 million run rate for inphi and then as -- into marvell. and so what we're saying now is that colorz, colorz 2 total contribution, it's at a peak revenue.
the dci contribution, the dci revenue of that -- the dci product line, if you will, is going to be at peak revenues in q1 and then grow from there. in the past, on 100 gig, it was really driven by one customer, and that was almost a semi-custom like engagement. in 400zr, there are multiple hyperscale customers that we're working with. we'll have multiple customers.
and it's the start of a very exciting ramp on our products. and this is a transition that we've all been waiting for, but it's here, and it's contributing to revenue now in q1.

our next question comes from harlan sur with j.p. morgan. you may now go ahead.
harlan sur -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good afternoon, and congratulations on the strong results and execution. on your cloud optimized asic and some of your diy design win pipeline, $400 million target in fiscal '24. i think, matt, you said that you're on track for doubling that in fiscal '25, fiscal '26. so now that you guys are deep in the design phase for many of these products at five nanometers, can you guys just give us a sense of the types of chips you're developing for your cloud customers? is it primarily ai and machine learning acceleration? is it video transcode? is it custom dpus, surplus cpus, etc.? and then any color on this point would be great.
and then just as important, is the team already starting to engage on early 3-nanometer programs with your cloud customers on their next-generation asic programs?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. well, it's a great question. and i think you understand quite well the sensitivities we have with respect to these types of engagement with the hyperscalers. i would say, it's between what we've won and the pipeline that we're pursuing, it's pretty much all of those applications that you're discussing.
it's acceleration primarily. and it could be for things like video. it could be for things like security or storage. there are networking asics that we're doing that are very customized.
there's compute. there's custom dpus, if you will. think of it as -- and then by the way, we said some of this. i mean the -- as you look at sort of the smartnic opportunity -- and we've been saying this for a while.
there is a lot of customization going on in that segment as well. so it's a wide range, harlan. there's no sort of one trick pony in here -- and in aggregate, they're all tracking extremely well. and we gave a very judged view, by the way, when we gave those numbers.
so obviously -- maybe not obviously, but our customers' forecasts are actually higher than what we gave you, but that's sort of our baseline. but we've now won incremental designs, which would layer on top of that. so i think it's all positive, but our ability to get super precise at this point without a customer announcement would be a little bit tough.
harlan sur -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
and you guys -- are you guys already engaged on early 3-nanometer?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. sorry, yeah. so we're very engaged on 3-nanometer, harlan. i mean that's actually a key part of -- to be honest, why we've been winning in 5-nanometer is having that very committed, very rich 3-nanometer ip portfolio underway.
and we're in deep architecture discussion now on multiple products and in multiple end markets, by the way, from cloud to 5g to enterprise about using our 3-nanometer platform. so we're on the nanometer train, and we're fully committed and we're executing quite well on our road map and customers are excited.
harlan sur -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. strong momentum. thanks, matt.

christopher rolland -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
thanks for the question, and i also want to echo my congrats. you mentioned a new opportunity here, matt. aec -- or dsp for aec. basically, i guess my questions are, what's the timing on this product when it comes to market? how big do you think this market could be here? and ultimately, are you guys in a position to take majority share? thanks.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we're pretty excited about this transition in the market, chris, as you -- and i said some of this in my prepared remarks. but traditionally, this type of active cable hasn't been needed or at least the last generation that -- where it was needed was based on nrz technology. so a little bit like we did -- and i say we, meaning us and inphi, we intercepted the market as it's about to take off in growth at 400 and 800 with pam4-based technology in 6-nanometer.
so this is -- think of this as just right in our wheelhouse in terms of leveraging what we've already got but then optimizing the products for the specific application. our partners -- and we've done some announcements. we've done a whole flurry of them. you've probably seen them around ofc coming up.
but we're engaged with all the major cable manufacturers that supply to the hyperscalers. are -- those cables are available. they're sampling to customers now. we're working directly with the cloud customers on additional enhancements to the road map.
but we are going to be a force to be reckoned with in this market. and it's a perfect fit for us because when you think about sort of having all the pieces, if you will, having the switch, having the optics, having now the aec products, having the dpus and that insight into the -- and then also asics that sort of hang around all these things in interface. we have a unique opportunity to really work with our customers to optimize the full solution. and that's something that maybe companies that only have one piece of the puzzle.
don't quite see what's exactly happening. so very excited about this. this is an incremental opportunity for us. market size, depending on who you talk to, some are saying it's $1 billion-plus.
i think -- but we'll see. we're optimistic that it's a big opportunity for us. we're still sizing what we think it means for marvell, but we're in the market today.

hey, everyone. thanks for sneaking in my question. i know you haven't filed your 10-k yet. but as it relates to that, is there anything notable with respect to purchase commitments on your behalf with your foundry partners, specifically, that's quantifiable and then as well, purchase commitments and cnrs, they're called, with respect to your customers?
jean hu -- chief financial officer
hi, gary, this is jean. yeah, we have not filed 10-k yet. but as far as the purchase agreement, as you know, last quarter end, we have about $3 billion commitment we are engaging with our suppliers to ensure we have the capacity not only for this year, next year and for longer term. so as you probably noticed, a year ago, this is just $200 million.
so we have increased our commitment significantly. you're going to see going forward, the same trend because that's really the driving focus of the company to make sure we have the capacity to support our customers.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
and gary, i would add, as jean indicated, you can kind of follow the trend line. the engagements now, as we talked about -- you can actually directly relate them to some of the prior questions we had about our cloud optimized ramps in fiscal '24 and '25. we're planning our business out even beyond that with respect to some of the key capacity we need on the critical technologies that are required, substrates and various other pieces of the supply chain. so you'll see that trend continue as we plan our business actually multiple years in the future, both with our end oems and then our key supply chain partners to make sure we're all in lockstep to meet these very, very steep product ramps that are going to be required over the next few years.

our next question comes from matt ramsay with cowen. you may now go ahead.
matt ramsay -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you very much, guys for letting me on. matt, i wanted to ask a quick question about the -- given that cloud is such an important part of your business. my own observation is that a lot of things are coming in the data center space in the next 12 months with sapphire from intel, with genoa from amd, with pam4 400-gig optics and a bunch of other things that are really, to me, that's -- have a pretty big upgrade cycle in the data center spending space. and i wonder as you engage with your customers, how you're -- do you agree with that? do you see an inflection in sort of pent-up spending given maybe intel's road map has held back some things on lack of clarity? i just wonder how you would characterize over the next year or two the hyperscale spending environment as you guys see it today.
thanks.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, matt, and welcome to the call. so i think you're absolutely right on the trends that we're talking about here. i think as we have new processor refreshes, new server refreshes and then there's all kinds of chips, by the way, that are going to flow into the equation as well, not just the sort of the server itself, but then the acceleration that's going to be required, the new workloads, different ai, gpu clusters.
i mean you just start going through all of the trends. and that is underpinning the ultimately, the silicon sort of architectures are underpinning fundamentally, the cloud capex and what's needed. so we -- as these new cycles come in and there's an inflection, it's really good for marvell. and the pam4 400-gig opportunity is one just great example.
but our design win position on the new systems, right, in the new architectures that are coming, the content is just much higher, whether it's per data center, per server, you name it. and so i think that's exciting to us. and yeah, there's been some delays from certain suppliers here and there. but as those as that road map gets executed and that transition happens, there's a lot of uplift for marvell.
and that is kind of another way to back into some of the growth that we're seeing in projecting that.

good afternoon, and welcome to marvell technology's fiscal first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]. after today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. please note, this event is being recorded.
i would now like to turn the conference over to mr. ashish saran, senior vice president of investor relations. please go ahead.
ashish saran -- vice president, investor relations
thank you. and good afternoon, everyone. welcome to marvell's first quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings call. joining me today are matt murphy, marvell's president and ceo; and jean hu, our cfo.
let me remind everyone that certain comments made today may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the sec today and posted on our website as well as our most recent 10-k and 10-q filings. we do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. during our call today, we will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures.
a reconciliation between our gaap and non-gaap financial measures is available in the investor relations section of our website. with that, i'll turn the call over to matt for his comments on our performance. matt? 
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ashish. and good afternoon, everyone. in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the marvell team drove another record level of revenue at $1.45 billion, exceeding the midpoint of guidance, growing 8% sequentially and 74% year over year. we saw continued strength in bookings in all our data infrastructure end markets.
higher revenue achievement was primarily driven by our datacenter market with additional strength from carrier infrastructure and automotive results both of which were also above forecast. due to supply chain-related impacts, results from our enterprise networking market were below our guidance. however, growth was still very strong with revenue growing a robust 64% year over year and 9% sequentially. the marvell operations team did a great job in navigating a tight supply environment that was further compounded by covid-related manufacturing challenges at our suppliers in certain geographies.
our team's efforts were a key enabler of our first quarter revenue, exceeding the midpoint of our forecast. we continue to make progress in securing additional capacity with our strategic partners to enable sustained revenue growth. let me now move on to discussing our five end markets, starting with datacenter. in our datacenter end market, revenue for the first quarter was $640.5 million.
leading our guidance, having grown 12% sequentially and 131% year over year. strong performance was broad-based with multiple product lines contributing to excellent results. cloud continues to be a source of marvell's strength in the datacenter. we are enabling our hyperscale customers to add new use cases, bringing the benefits of ai and machine learning to businesses, increased process automation and productivity and drive deeper relationships with their customers.
let me now discuss a number of marvell product cycles driving strong growth in cloud, starting with electro optics. we are seeing strong demand for our pam solutions inside datacenters and zr pluggables between data centers. inside cloud datacenters, lead tier 1 customers are currently driving volume deployment of our pam-based 200-gig and 400-gig solutions. the rest of the market has plans for starting deployments later this year and next year.
as bandwidth requirements continue to grow, we expect the role of pam-based electro optics to expand, replacing legacy solutions and as a result, to grow our opportunity. we believe that the next generation of more powerful server cpus will accelerate the need for pam technology. in addition to this expansion, we are also increasing our content per module with our next generation of higher-speed solutions that we are now starting to ship. driven by the growth in ai deployments, our first quarter results benefited from a ramp in volume shipments of our 800-gig pam solutions at two large customers.
the bandwidth expansion inside datacenters is also driving a significant increase in connectivity between datacenters, creating a growing opportunity for our 400 zr pluggable optics. team is achieving great success by driving the adoption of these solutions at multiple customers, and we are projecting strong revenue growth from these products. moving on to compute. our cloud optimized design win momentum continued in the first quarter, and we won a custom smartnic at a hyperscale customer.
we are seeing more adoption of vpu-based architectures inside data centers, a trend that we are ideally positioned to address with our octeon platform, which is now in its tenth generation. this design win is one more example of the growing demand for cloud-optimized silicon, which we see as the largest incremental growth opportunity for marvell inside datacenters. we are confident that we are uniquely positioned to win these opportunities with our leading portfolio of compute, networking, security, storage and high-speed electro-optics it delivered on our five-nanometer platform. moving on to storage within the cloud.
in the first quarter, cloud demand for high-capacity storage continued to increase, driving solid growth for our nearline hdd controllers and preamplifiers. our ssd controllers also contributed to strong year-over-year revenue growth. we are now reaping the benefits from our datacenter ssd business, which we built from the ground up starting in 2016. we increased investment in critical ip development, accelerated our process technology cadence, and quadrupled our firmware team.
working closely with the leading cloud companies, we optimized our ssd controllers to address their quality of service and security requirements. we developed state-of-the-art error correction for the most advanced nand flash technologies coupled them with our in-house low-power fives, and accelerated our pcie roadmap. all the leading ssd devices today are shipping pcie gen 4 solutions, marvell has already won gen 5 data center sockets at three key nand oems. additionally, we started investing in pcie gen 6 in 2019.
this development, coupled with our five-nanometer technology platform has enabled us to win a key nand oem for their gen 6 ssds. our datacenter storage business has been built on a long and sustained period of technology investment, deep system knowledge, extensive customer relationships, and very sticky custom firmware delivered on our advanced process technology platform. we expect our position to continue to strengthen based on our proven technology platform and multiple secured design wins in the next generation of datacenter ssds. we anticipate that the next big evolution in cloud datacenters will be the adoption of cxl or compute xpresslink, an industry standard for connecting processors, accelerators in memory, and we are planning to enable that trend.
last week, we held a tech talk in which we explained the fundamentals of cxl technology in its role in bringing new levels of performance to next-generation cloud datacenters. if you're unable to attend, i would encourage you to watch the recording posted in the investor relations section of our website. we described how silicon components based on cxl will facilitate new cloud architectures by addressing the multiple memory scaling challenges in current data centers. put simply, cxl will finally allow dram memory to escape the constraints of being tied down to a single compute device such as a cpu and become a shared and pulled resource, utilizing the well-established pcie fabric as the interconnect.
marvell is uniquely positioned to address the cxl opportunity, given our deep relationships with memory oems, our growing position within hyperscale customers and our advanced pcie roadmap. we recently bolstered our efforts in this area with the acquisition of tanzanite, a leading developer of advanced cxl technologies. their complementary ip and world-class team adds more resources to marvell, accelerating our cxl road map to address opportunities in closed design wins, which are right in front of us at multiple customers. we see opportunities for a host of new products, including cxl expanders, cooling devices, switches and accelerators.
in addition, we see the potential to embed cxl ip in a broad range of our datacenter products, including asics, custom compute engines, dpus, electro optics, retimers, smartnics, and ssd controllers. we see a multibillion-dollar pam expansion opportunity driven by cxl overtime, and i look forward to updating you on our progress. moving on to our expectations for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 from our datacenter end market, we are projecting continued growth to layer on top of the strong first quarter results. we project our data center revenue in the second quarter to grow sequentially in the low-single digits on a percentage basis and year over year grew approximately 50%.
we expect revenue from cloud to grow significantly faster than the on-premise market, both sequentially and year over year in the second quarter. as we progress into the second half of this fiscal year and beyond, we are looking forward to additional incremental contributions from our cloud ethernet switches and to ramping our large set of cloud optimized custom design wins. marvell's unique ability to offer all the critical datacenter ip under one roof, designed to work seamlessly together in a custom solution is proving very attractive to customers. as a result, our engagements with hyperscalers have moved well beyond pure asic programs to include various combinations of marvell ip delivered in solutions tailored to each cloud's unique requirements.
turning to our carrier infrastructure end market. revenue for the first quarter was $252 million, above our forecast, growing 5% sequentially and 50% year over year. we previously reported a substantial -- sequential step-up of over 30% in our 5g business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. from this strong base, it was great to see both sequential and year-over-year revenue growth for carrier continue in the first quarter.
the growth in 5g deployment, combined with marvell product ramps, at multiple base station customers continue to fuel strong growth in this end market. in wired, we are seeing strong demand for our 400-gig coherent electro-optics portfolio driven by rapid adoption in the metro and long-haul carrier markets. coherent technology is critical to enabling high-speed data transmission across long distances to meet the ever-increasing demand for bandwidth from operators. earlier this week, we announced that we have shipped over 100,000 400-gig coherent dsps, positioning us as the leading merchant provider of these products.
we are also aggressively focused on developing and launching our next generation of coherent products. this is a very key piece from the inphi acquisition as the same technology powers the 400 zr dci cloud market you heard about earlier. looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect revenue from the overall carrier end market to grow in the high-single digits sequentially on a percentage basis, while year-over-year growth is expected to remain strong at approximately 40%. moving on to our enterprise networking end market.
revenue for the first quarter was $286.6 million, growing 9% sequentially and 64% year over year as demand remains strong in this end market. while this end market represents our highest delinquency relative to the size of the business, we remain strongly focused on improving our ability to supply more products to our enterprise networking customers to help them meet their growing demand. our growth has been driven by share gains and our increase in content starting to materialize as our customers began shipping their new platforms to address enterprise network modernization. we have seen a large increase in the adoption of our multi-gigabit fives, which have a significantly higher selling price compared to our gigabit products.
we expect the penetration of multi-gigabit ports will continue to increase a tailwind to our business. our strong growth in enterprise networking is primarily the result of our own unique product cycles. looking beyond this quarter, we expect growth to continue leveraging our refresh switch and phy portfolio and incremental revenue from the ramp of custom silicon and our octeon arm-based dpus displacing alternative architectures. the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect a continuation of strong demand for our products from the enterprise networking end market and further improvements in supply.
as a result, we are projecting revenue to be up sequentially in the mid-teens on a percentage basis and year-over-year growth of approximately 45%. turning to our automotive and industrial end market. revenue for the first quarter was $89.3 million, growing 12% sequentially and 94% year over year. all of the sequential growth came from our automotive business, which drove over 50% of the total revenue from this end market.
although we are still unable to fully satisfy the growing demand for our brightlane auto ethernet solutions, the results supported by incrementally better supply solutions exceeded our guidance. our auto revenue growth is being driven primarily by our new product cycles. the adoption of marvell ethernet technology in cars is continuing to increase, as oems design in higher-speed solutions to address the increase in bandwidth, our dollar content per car is continuing to grow. we are also winning new customers and growing our content at existing customers.
we now have ethernet design wins at eight of the 10 largest auto oems worldwide and 36 oems in total. looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2023 for the combined auto and industrial end market, we are projecting sequential revenue growth in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis, while year-over-year growth is expected to be over 60%. we expect strong growth to continue from our automotive business with revenue projected to more than double year over year. moving on to our consumer end market.
revenue for the first quarter was $178.5 million, growing 7% year over year. the growth in this end market is being driven by our ssd controllers, partially offset by declines in our pc hdd business. on a sequential basis, revenue declined by 4% in our consumer end market, below our forecast for a flattish outlook due to a reduction in demand from the pc hdd market. while we are not the bellwether of global pc demand as it represents a relatively small amount of our revenue, we did see a rapid change in tone from the pc market, and we expect the weakness to continue.
from our perspective, the shift from hdds to ssds in the notebook pc market is almost complete, and our revenue from notebook hdds in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was less than 1% of consolidated marvell revenue. looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and our consumer end market, we expect revenue to sequentially decline in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis and be flattish year over year. in closing, we delivered record results for the first quarter and are guiding for continued strong growth in the second quarter. we are seeing robust demand for our products, and our design win momentum remains strong.
with 88% of our revenue coming from beta infrastructure, we are confident that marvell's favorable end market exposure makes us one of the best positioned semiconductor companies to benefit from strong secular growth trends. in the second quarter, at the midpoint of the range, we are guiding our revenue to grow by 41% year over year, which is almost entirely an organic comparison. we expect a strong operating leverage in our business model to drive non-gaap eps at the midpoint of guidance to grow by 65% year over year, significantly faster than our projected growth in revenue. as you heard throughout this call, our unique product cycles have been a big part of our above-market revenue growth.
as we look into the second half of this year and beyond, we are confident that our unique growth drivers in our cloud, 5g, auto and enterprise networking end markets, and our strong track record of execution through economic cycles will continue to be a source of strength. you'll remember from our prior calls and our investor day presentation that we have already won a significant number of design wins, which we are projecting will add a substantial amount of incremental revenue to marvell going forward. while the external environment is challenging, marvell's business continues to be strong, including strong bookings in our core data infrastructure end markets. as we move forward, we intend to continue to act as we always have, be diligent about changes, react promptly and manage our business and costs aggressively.
on behalf of marvell's leadership team, i thank our employees for their dedication in driving stellar results. our employees are the backbone of the company, and we are excited that marvell recently ranked third overall on the list of best places to work in the bay area by the san francisco business times and silicon valley business journal. even this award is so special because it is the employees who decide the winners. we have an outstanding team, and this award reflects our culture, values and dedication to creating a collaborative workplace which fosters creativity and innovation.
with that, i'll turn the call over to jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.
jean hu -- chief financial officer
thanks, matt, and good afternoon, everyone. i'll start with a review of our financial results for the first quarter and then provide our current outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.447 billion, exceeding the middle point of our guidance, growing 8% sequentially and 74% year over year. datacenter was our largest end market driving 44% of consolidated revenue.
enterprise networking was next largest to be 20% of total revenue, followed by carrier infrastructure at 18%. consumer added 12% and the auto industrial at 6%. gaap gross margin was 51.9%. non-gaap gross profit was $947 million or 65.5% of revenue, another record driven by rich product mix.
gaap operating expenses were $681 million and include the cost of share-based compensation expenses. amortization of acquired intangible assets, legal segment and acquisition, and divestiture-related costs. non-gaap operating expenses were $435 million reflecting the increase in r&d headcount and project expenses to execute design wins across all our data infrastructure end market. as we outlined at our investor day last year, we plan to continue to invest in r&d, given the tremendous opportunities we have in front of us, while keeping opex growth well below top line revenue growth to drive to our long-term target model.
gaap operating income was $70 million, we achieved record non-gaap operating profit of $512 million, up 123% from a year ago, and our non-gaap operating margin was 35.4%. during the first quarter, our gaap income tax expense was $205 million. this included the impact from a onetime non-cash tax charge of $240 million offset by other tax benefits in the quarter. the $240 million non-cash tax charge was due to the measurement of our net deferred tax asset as a result for obtaining and expansion of a lower foreign restriction tax incentives.
for the first quarter, gaap loss per diluted share was $0.20. non-gaap income per diluted share was $0.52, up 79% year over year, exceeding the middle point of our guidance. now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. during the quarter, cash flow from operations was $195 million as we increased our working capital investment to support the top line revenue growth in a very tight supply chain environment.
the increase in working capital was primarily driven by increase in inventory, especially raw materials and work in progress help us manage it through ongoing supply chain disruption. we also made $86 million in payments during the quarter to secure long-term capacity with our suppliers. as of the end of the first fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalents were $465 million, and our long-term debt was $4.5 billion. our gross debt-to-ebitda ratio was 2.3 times, and net debt-to-ebitda ratio was two times.
we returned $66 million to million in cash dividends and $15 million to share repurchase during the first quarter. subsequent to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023 over the first three weeks of the second quarter, we repurchased additional $50 million of our shares through our 10b-5 program. we are pleased that we have restarted the share repurchase program as we believe it's in the best interest of the company and our long-term shareholders. in summary, the marvell team executed exceptionally well delivering accelerated top-line revenue growth and strong earnings expansion significantly faster than revenue growth.
turning to our guidance. for the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect the following results: revenue in the range of $1.515 billion plus or minus 3%. gaap gross margin in the range of 49.6% to 51.9%. non-gaap gross margin in the range of 65% to 65.5%.
gaap operating expenses to be approximately $669 million. non-gaap operating expenses to be approximately $435 million, which assumes that we will complete the acquisition of in the second quarter. for the second quarter, we expect non-gaap tax rate of 6%. we expect our basic weighted average share outstanding will be 853 million, and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be 862 million.
as a result, we expect gaap earnings per share in the range of $0.02 to $0.10. we expect non-gaap income per diluted share in the range of $0.53 to $0.59. operator, please open the line and announce q&a instructions. thank you.

we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions]. our first question is from toshiya hari with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
toshiya hari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good afternoon. thank you so much for taking the question. and congrats on the strong execution. matt, i was hoping you could speak to your expectations for the second half, both from a demand perspective and a supply perspective.
i think last quarter, there was a little bit of confusion as it pertains to the full year outlook. so if you can kind of confirm how you're thinking about your overall business, but particularly datacenter into the second half, that would be super helpful. and then again, if you have the supply to support the strong outlook. thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, toshiya. great to hear from you. yes, so we're pleased with the results and execution in q2.
and -- i'm sorry, in q1. and as you saw, we had a very strong quarter in datacenter, which i'll come back to in a minute. but just to kind of reframe from the demand side in all of our end markets, except consumer, we see very strong demand trends, toshiya. bookings have been very strong in the last two quarters.
demand -- our demand outlook for the year continues to be strong. and with respect to datacenter specifically, we did have a strong q1 better than expected. we still have pent-up demand and lack of supply there for the second quarter, but we expect actually a reacceleration in the datacenter in terms of our growth in q3 and q4, i.e., the second half. and on top of that, we have incremental new design wins that we've secured over the last 12 to 18 months, which we've sized roughly at, call it, $400 million incremental next year and $800 million the year after.
that's actually going to start layering in as well in the second half. so from our perspective, ex-consumer demand continues to be very strong. datacenter in particular is going to have a great first half and a great second half. and then relative to supply, we really, first of all, credit to our operations team doing a great job in the first quarter, navigating all of the different impacts going on, in particular, in china and delivering a strong quarter.
looking forward, we're starting to see the benefit of all the investment we put in over the last year into our supply chain. whether that be the improvement in systems and tools, the relationships and the capacity that we've secured. and so we believe that, that's going to continue. and we do see a much improved supply outlook not only in the short term, as you can see from our results, both beating in our q1 and then guiding strongly for q2, but also in the second half, toshiya.
and again, i think that's the result of a lot of hard work and transformation in our supply chain to meet our growth plans. so in summary, we have very strong demand driven by datacenter but also in 5g and automotive and the other things we've talked about and we've seen real improvements in our visibility into the supply we're going to get to go meet that customer demand.
toshiya hari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thanks for all the details.

the next question is from chris caso with raymond james. please go ahead.
chris caso -- raymond james -- analyst
yes. thank you. i wonder if you could talk a little bit about the enterprise networking business. and i guess it came in a little below your expectations, but yet you're still speaking about supply constraints in that area.
is that a situation where your customers are supply constrained elsewhere and you're waiting for them? maybe just give some explanation of the dynamics in that part of the business.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, chris. yes, this was definitely a quarter where the mix wasn't exactly where we thought it was going to be from when we guided. as you could see, we overachieved in datacenter, and we underachieved on enterprise.
but as i pointed out in my comments, the delinquency and kind of the unfulfilled backlog relative to the size of the business is actually still the highest in enterprise. so this was really a case of just us being unable to execute our supply plan for the quarter nothing to do with demand. in fact, the demand from our enterprise customers continues to be very robust looking into the second quarter and throughout the year. so it was nothing to do with them.
they want more of our product. and you can see somewhat of a catch-up in q2 with a very strong guide sequentially into the second quarter. but we see that continuing, chris. so i know there's been a lot of noise out there around enterprise.
but from our perspective and talking to our customers, demand remains very strong. and in fact, we're behind in terms of our supply to catch up. but i think consistent with what toshi was asking, we are looking to improve that in the second quarter and also through the second half.
chris caso -- raymond james -- analyst

the next question is from gary mobley with wells fargo securities. please go ahead.
gary mobley -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking my question. congratulations on the good results. wanted to ask about the supply situation and you just articulated improving supply coming online for the balance of the year. to what extent is that being driven by you perhaps giving your foundry partners a better forecast? how much of it is being driven by maybe you growing some more money their way in prepayments? and to what extent is it being influenced by some shifting of fungible capacity as the semiconductor market is no longer universally strong.
so maybe you're benefiting for redistribution of supply?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yes. excellent question. and i think there's probably a piece of all of that. i think when i look back over what we've accomplished, one is we had to do a fairly significant education process across the supply chain of marvell's prospects, how all the different pieces have come together from the different m&a we've done, our end market focus, etc.
and so i think we did a good job of that of getting the broader supply chain ecosystem to understand the marvell opportunity. and so, to a large extent, they're betting on us and they're supporting our growth. and you can see that, right, just in terms of the year-over-year growth we're achieving, which by the way, is off of a pretty strong year we had last year. so that's clearly a factor.
we have also signed agreements relative to securing capacity. and you can see some of those that have shown up in our q or 8-ks we've issued partnerships we've entered into. so some of that has been down payments and supply agreements to ensure that we have the right capacity. i think that's some part of it.
and then it's hard to say, but on the last part of it, the sort of fungibility that may be coming into play a little bit, but it's too early to say. and quite frankly, the supply we're seeing today is we can really mostly attribute that to sort of our own effort. i will say, and just to be very clear for everybody on the call, we're not out of the woods here. our unfulfilled backlog has continued to grow each quarter.
we're definitely working that down. we're focused very much on the end demand and shipping to the right people. and we feel like we've done a good job of that in terms of keeping our customers' lines moving and not causing impacts and being very agile. but i think to the extent that on that third point, the fungibility side, if there were to be a true reduction or capitulation, let's call it, the pc and consumer end market and not needing all the supply they've consumed, that certainly could be an incremental thing we could look at in the second half.
but that -- that's not quite there yet, but maybe some of it is. we do see pockets of things opening up, but it's really hard when you sort of drill into it where it exactly came from. hope that's helpful. kind of a combination that you sort of nailed it comes of the mid.
gary mobley -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thanks, matt.
operator
the next question is from timothy arcuri with ubs. please go ahead.
timothy arcuri -- ubs -- analyst
hi. thanks. matt, i have just a broad question kind of on demand signals. to some degree, because supply has been so tight, it does create the potential that some of the orders, and i'm not saying for you, but i'm just saying broadly, are being placed just to secure their spot in line and not really backed by underlying sell-through at the customer or even the customer's customer level.
and it sort of creates the risk that the chip companies are going to see more of a delay in sort of the demand signals at this time. i think it's less of a risk for you. but i guess my question is, how do you assess that as a risk? and really, the question, i guess, is on the tenor of your discussions with your customers? do you get the sense that there are some examples of customers placing bookings just to get in the queue because you have such long lead times? i asked because some of the big large cloud customers are beginning to slow some of their hiring, things like that. so i'm just wondering what the tenor is of your talks with them.
thanks.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure, tim. yes. no, it's not unlike other cycles, where certainly the phenomena you point out, and this is the investor concern, right, more broadly in semis is have customers over-indexed on their order placements. and what happens when demand stops or slows down.
so we've taken this very seriously. i mean i just did a pretty much half a day review in the last few weeks with my entire team going through each of our product lines, going through to the customers and really kind of working through at an individual level where we still see the demand? do we see any inventory building up? if so, what does it look like in that type of an exercise? and what i can tell you is there's no real examples i could point to, tim, or anything thematic. i guess in some ways, we may have the benefit that we've been somewhat behind although i think we've done a good job of keeping everybody's lines moving. but certainly, we haven't been the company that's been swimming in capacity.
so i think as we look out now, especially where the kind of global economy is beginning to moderate. we're able to kind of take a look now and do a refresh, especially with our improved supply situation and really make sure we're allocating it to the right people. so it's a very active process, tim, but i can't give you any nuggets of specific examples where i think thematically inventory may be building. but i guess i would conclude by saying we did -- we were pretty transparent in the prepared remarks about what we saw in the consumer segment, which albeit it's 12% of the business.
and of that, a smaller portion of it is really exposed to what i would call kind of true consumer like pcs and things like that, but that did very much slow down. there definitely was a change in demand. and as a result, some supply that had there some inventory that had built up but we've got other moving pieces even with consumer that's sort of offsetting it. so a long way of answering it.
i don't have any great examples, but we're on it. we're watching it. but i'd say the bulk of the meeting, to be honest, when i had it was the demand signals being very strong, right, across the cloud companies across our 5g business, enterprise wired. there's a lot of great opportunities for us.
and a lot of this, tim, is driven on marvell's product cycles. it's not necessarily an end market phenomena we're dealing with here. it's really the new product ramps that you're very aware of across these different segments, and those seem very much intact in aggregate.
timothy arcuri -- ubs -- analyst
thanks, matt. yes, i mean, i think in the continuum of companies that have risk, you're at the kind of bottom of the list. but thanks for the questions or the answers. thanks.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer

the next question is from vivek arya with bank of america securities. please go ahead.
vivek arya -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes. thank you for taking my question. just wanted to clarify, matt, if you have seen already or are baking in any supply or demand effects of the china lockdown or europe turmoil. but my bigger question is, how do we conceptually align this notion of rising delinquency or unmet demand with rising inventory at both on semiconductor company balance sheet and even at some of the large networking oems, at what point does this rising inventory across the supply chain start to become a concern?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
great. thanks, vivek. yes. on the first question, again, we're -- as you know, based on the timing of our reporting, we're like everybody else who's going right now.
we had the month of april to comprehend in there relative to the china lockdown. and we navigated it really well. i think one of the reasons for us is that when covid first happened, when the pandemic first began and there was major lockdowns everywhere china, including and also southeast asia, our operations team did a really good job of building up supply chain redundancy and resiliency over the last two years. so effectively dual sourced almost everything we can coming in and out of china and even some of the other regions over there.
so there was some impact. there was a little bit of product revenue where could we have gotten supply out of china, we could have fulfilled it, but it was very small, vivek, to be honest with you. so we're able to be fairly agile in terms of moving things around. so that was a positive.
on the war in ukraine and the impact on kind of in the again, i think you're hearing the data points, right? we don't see it directly, but certainly on the slowdown in the consumer segment, people's budgets being pinched, things like that. i think that's part of the issue with some of the consumer end market commentary. again, we're not really in there. and we don't have operations in ukraine or russia.
so we didn't really have any impact on that. so i think we're ok there. on the commentary on rising inventory, look, i'm very aware of this. you can pull everybody's qs out and look at -- and one simple thing we do is look and oem companies' inventory growth.
and you can see across a wide range of companies and industries, growth in inventory far exceeding revenue growth. so that is something we're paying attention to. we're using that to dive in deep with our customers. but i would say that our view tends to be like a lot of our customers, which is the end demand, especially in enterprise, in cloud and in our product cycle in 5g, the demand looks pretty strong.
but there is -- there are missing pieces. there is the golden screw issue for sure that some of our customers have. we're just trying not to be the golden screw and also be very kind of clear eyed about where the inventory is and what does that mean for marvell. and so i can tell you is we're digging into it at a part level detail and making sure that we're being prudent about where we allocate the supply.
but it is something we got to keep watching for sure.
jean hu -- chief financial officer
yes. and to add to what matt said is we actually chose to increase our inventory to support the revenue growth in the second half. we have a very broad set of product lines, and we see strong demand. so the flexibility we need to have raw materials and the way to support the revenue growth is really critical.
so we did choose that to make sure we can support the customers and the future revenue growth.
vivek arya -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
do you have a target, jean, on days of inventory?
jean hu -- chief financial officer
the current level is what we are comfortable. we think we can help and manage the supplies for the second half. i think if the environment is normalized, we definitely will have a lower inventory like 120 days. that's what we think we should keep.
but right now, we definitely chose to increase it to provide more flexibility.
vivek arya -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks very much.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yes. vivek, just to chime in on jean's comments, i fully agree. if you look at just the steepness of the revenue ramp we're dealing with. clearly, the wip has to go up, right, just to sort of support the growth.
so that part we're comfortable with. and given the given the lockdowns and all the volatility, i think having that extra inventory carry for us is very prudent. and we watch it, and we'll certainly work it down. but i don't think you're going to see many companies go back to the good old days of 80 days or something like that, unless they truly get into trouble.
i just think for a while, we're all going to have to be mindful that there's a lot of volatility in the world. but we're sort of in the range now, and we're very conscious in terms of what we're doing here.

matt ramsay -- cowen and company -- analyst
yes. thank you very much. good afternoon. matt, in part of your script, you had talked about the upcoming server launches that include a couple of new technologies, right, and then some cxl support for shared memory.
and i think you guys have done a great job of articulating what that might mean for your accelerator business and given us some outlook there. i was curious if you might explain a little bit about what pcie 5 might drive for support of that technology into the storage and network peripherals. is that material to the growth in the back half? and how much visibility do you have there? just -- and then just a quick follow-up, question i get all the time is visibility on cloud capex. if you guys look out in your cloud business, is it quarters, years? like how long are we talking that you feel like you have visibility because there's definitely some concerns there.
i appreciate it. thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
hey, matt. good to hear from you, and good questions. yes, i think you did nail it on one of the more important aspects of the upcoming cpu cycles is the io, right, and the release of pcie gen 5 and we've certainly been preparing for that. that is a key part of the equation for us, particularly, as you can imagine, in our storage business and our datacenter storage business, which one of the key things we have to align to on our product roadmap is obviously nailing the pcie io road map, and it's not a trivial thing, not only the controller, but obviously the phy and getting everything qualified and working.
and so our team has done a great job there. we're very well positioned in storage on pcie gen 5 actually said in my remarks, we've already got wins lined up on gen 6. that's still a ways out, but that's going to be another leg of growth. and you're right, the pcie standard is really going to be the fabric and the interconnect that cxl runs on top of.
and so a lot of the effort we put in on both gen 5 and in the future, gen 6 is going to give us tremendous leverage as we think about disaggregation, particularly of memory and these different solutions that are going to emerge around cxl. so it's very strategic. we do -- we always make make-or-buy decisions on things in terms of make versus buy, sorry, on technologies, but this is one, particularly on the phy layer for pcie that we've -- we do ourselves, and we have -- we're best-in-class in what we do here, and then we leverage that into our larger socs. so -- but i think the biggest impact from marvell will be just driving broader adoption of our data center flash controllers, which again, are well positioned across a number of nand oems.
and products defined directly with the cloud oems going back several years, right, to get all this lined up. so it's going to be a good cycle for us. and then sorry, on cloud capex, i don't have any insight. i -- we certainly look at all the publicly available data.
the most recent update certainly looked promising. but i would say for marvell, matt, and for the rest of the investors on the call, we're -- of course, the overall capex environment in cloud can certainly be a tailwind and that could be a headwind for anybody that supplies into there. but -- you got to remember, most of our revenue coming from the cloud is really in new product cycles that are very marvell-specific in some cases. i mean, let's take let's take pam, for example.
if you went back a year ago, you really had a couple of companies deploying it versus older nrz-based solutions. you head into this year, there are now additional companies as well that are going to be driving that cycle on 200 and 400-gig. we have new applications like even 800-gig as an example, for ai clusters and things like that where we started ramping our 800-gig product. so whether the capex goes up or down, there's new applications and new replacement cycles that are going on.
and then there's just other things like, for example, in our cloud ethernet switch area, right? there was new wins we got through the innovium team that joined us last year. we expect continued strong growth from that product area. we have new cloud optimized silicon in asics and dpus that were designed in over the last couple of years. those are going to be ramping up.
so we are very -- we're paying attention to it, matt, but i would say that that it's a little bit like our 5g business. you can see things go up and down and lumpiness in the market. but when you have a strong product cycle with either content or share gain and new customers coming on, you can power through and that's our full expectation in the cloud. we have very strong conviction on our business there today, particularly in the second half and next year relative to the cloud hyperscale and we'll watch the capex trend, but most of our products are independent of that trend.

the next question is from ross seymore with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
ross seymore -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for letting us ask a question. jean, i wanted to ask you one on the margin side of the equation. you guys always run a very tight ship in this, but there's lots of moving parts.
matt's talked a lot about more supply coming on in the back half of this year. sometimes that can come at a higher price these days. and then even the opex side of things, wage inflation, etc., and some acquisition integration that you talked about. so generally speaking, can you walk us through the puts and takes on the gross margin and the opex side of things for the rest of the year?
jean hu -- chief financial officer
yes. ross, thanks for the question. i think our team has been very disciplined to manage opex to make sure we follow our overall business model right, grow revenue significantly faster than opex growth and keep the gross margin right in the middle or even above the middle of our long-term target model, so we can drive the earnings expansion much faster than top line revenue growth. when you look at the opex in q1, as i said earlier, we increased headcount and project expense to really execute on all the design wins we have won.
q2, it's we keep it flat. in the second half, it's going to go a little bit higher, slightly higher, but it's largely because we are going to grow revenue in second half to support the revenue growth, you have certain variable expenses that will increase slightly in second half. in the longer term, you should continue to expect us to drive top-line revenue growth and opex around 50% slower than top line revenue growth. so we can continue to get the earnings expansion.
so in q2, if you look at the midpoint of our guide, our operating margin is already above 36%. we are very, very driven to get our operating model to the 38% to 40% range.
ross seymore -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you.

next question is from tore svanberg with stifel. please go ahead.
tore svanberg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yes. thank you, and congratulations on the strong results. just had a follow-up on the storage question, but this time on gen 6, not on gen 5. so just, matt, can you maybe frame a little bit marvell's positioning here? i mean i think about the pam4 ip you have, obviously, you talked about cxl.
i know it's still early days, but if you could just frame a little bit sort of layman's terms, you're positioned for pci gen 6, that would be great. thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure, tore. yes, gen 6, as it relates to storage, you're absolutely right. given the increase in io throughput and data rate, you had to move to a pam-based architecture. so that's played right into our strengths.
we've coupled that with our -- and we were early to do this, by the way, with our five-nanometer technology platform. and so there's just a whole lot of goodness and reuse there, as you can imagine. and it really put us in a strong position to get there early, and i give our storage business unit, a lot of credit for really having thought leadership here. i mean they probably jumped like two nodes on everybody, not that it's a whole node game, but in terms of just the power and the performance that we're getting out of these solutions.
and then, of course, the benefit we get to take the io down to five-nanometer and leveraging pam is actually a huge help, right, just given the given the complexity. and you saw that in our optical business, right, and kind of how inphi drove performance over time as they've driven pam on new process node, same thing over here. so i think that's going to be very strategic. and yes, i think that that platform now -- again, we're early, right? we're just talking about launch today, but we do like to give color on our future leaning roadmap.
but it definitely plays to our strengths. and i think as you think about also what's going to be required in cxl. i think even things like closing the link and the need for retimers and redrivers, accelerators, pooling applications, they're all going to require robust gen 6 ip and then be able to integrate those into various different socs. and i would just say even today, the cxl activity we're seeing in terms of our design opportunities is pretty broad, and it's almost all -- it really is all in our five-nanometer platform.
so it all kind of hangs together, tore, and maybe i think you sort of see this, but i think others are as well. the combination of all the ips that we brought together through the different acquisitions plus the marvell technology platform has really created an opportunity for us to go-to-market with these semi-custom solutions and be very successful in this next wave of cloud optimized silicon.
tore svanberg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
excellent. thank you.

next question is from harlan sur with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
harlan sur -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good afternoon. great job on the quarterly execution. i saw the announcement on -- and you mentioned this map on shipping 100,000 400-gig coherent dsp chipsets. you're pretty early days in this transition, but you guys have already shipped like according to my calculation, almost $200 million plus worth of products.
and the great thing about this family of products is that they've got the same underlying architecture and you've taken that and you're going after different markets, right? datacenter interconnect with for 400 zr, long-haul metro with your 400-gig canopus solution. the adoption seems to be actually on a faster curve. is this a driver of the upside in your datacenter and carrier franchises? and then i believe that your deployment is being driven by just one cloud titan, are you guys anticipating other cloud titans starting to fire as the year unfolds?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, harlan, for the question. and maybe just to start at the top on coherent dsp. i'm not sure everybody quite understood.
even the inphi people that followed inphi closely, how strategic this technology is. a little bit of background. they had had their own effort in coherent inphi, and they ended up acquiring a company called clariphy a few years before we acquired inphi. and ultimately, they chose to clariphy coherent dsp road map.
this is very, very difficult stuff to do, harlan. and once you get it right and get it designed in, these are very, very long product life cycles, particularly in the metro long-haul type of markets, the telco type markets. and that's really what's driving -- that's really where the revenue is showing up today for this. the added benefit is obviously the same technology and chips are used in the zr 400 the zr market as well for dci.
so there's a double benefit here. and so on the merchant side, we're a strong leader. we have a road map, obviously, beyond this to 800-gig. that's going to play in well to our next-generation dci products as well.
and then even longer term, there's discussions longer term about the modulation technology eventually inside datacenter moving to coherent. so it's a very strategic technology for marvell. and to answer your question on the zr dci side, we -- and i said it in my prepared remarks that it might have begun lost, but we do have multiple customers for this, not just one. and those will be ramping up over the next year or so, the additional customers.
we're already shipping and putting out record results on the dci products as it is. we're really driven by one customer, but there's more coming. so we're pretty excited about this. and we have a whole ecosystem lined up, right? we have a number of module partners for different applications.
and so -- anyway, yes, it's something we'll be talking about more. maybe we'll do a tech talk on that one, too, harlan, but it's actually a really important technology that we got from inphi. and it's obviously an outstanding team that really feeds a lot of the other things that we do inside the company.
harlan sur -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yes. great insights. thank you, matt.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and just one final thing, i would say, remember, too, this is a chip set as well. so it's not just the dsp, it's the driver, it's the tia and there's even other components we're looking at to really optimize the solution. so when you hang all that together and you can deliver it as a platform.
it's very powerful.
harlan sur -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
perfect. thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
welcome.

the final question today will be from c.j. muse with evercore. please go ahead.
c.j. muse -- evercore isi -- analyst
yes, good afternoon. thank you for taking the questions and squeezing me in. i guess a question on gross margins. you guided down 25 bps sequentially.
obviously, a very small amount. but just curious if there's anything mix-wise and/or higher input costs that we should be thinking about there? and then just as a quick follow-up to jean, are we at the net leverage level now where you plan to return free cash flow via buybacks? or is that still in more of the opportunistic phase? thank you.
jean hu -- chief financial officer
yes. so c.j., thanks for the question. first, on the net leverage, if you look at our q2 guidance at the middle point of our guidance our net leverage ratio will be below two, gross debt-to-ebitda ratio will be around two, but the net leverage will be below two. as i said earlier, we have restarted share repurchase program even after end of q1, subsequently, we did purchase additional $50 million through our 10b-5 program.
so our capital allocation principle is still the same, right? we want to invest, but we are also committed to return more than 50% free cash flow to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase. on the gross margin, our gross margin, we are very pleased with the q1 gross margin, which is a record in the q2 guide it's all both above middle point for our long-term target. so the q2 is really just a mix. we have so many different product lines quarter over quarter, you will see the mix change up and down of our middle point i would not predict that closely.
but in general, it should be around 65% sometimes higher.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
i'll just add, c.j. i totally agree with jean, obviously. and just to remind everybody, we set a range of -- on gross margins as our target model of 64% to 66%. we had a record 65.3% in q4.
then we had another record of 65.5% in q1, and then we're guiding 65.25% if you look at the midpoint in q2. so it's kind of in in the range, if you know what i mean, i think run the company around that 65-ish is a really good place to be. if we can continue to grow the company the way we're growing it and drive leverage and drive design wins and stay competitive. so i think it's -- i think we're in pretty good shape.
i think obviously reasonable to ask the question, but i think, as jean said, we're going to have little movements here and there on mix. and we're ultimately just focused on keeping it in the right range in the right strike zone and then just driving really strong top-line growth and driving operating leverage through the cycle we're in here.
c.j. muse -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer

good afternoon, and welcome to marvell technology's fiscal second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. all participants will be in listen-only mode. [operator instructions] please note this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to mr.
ashish saran, senior vice president of investor relations. please go ahead.
ashish saran -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. welcome to marvell's second quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings call. joining me today are matt murphy, marvell's president and ceo; and jean hu, our cfo. let me remind everyone that certain comments made today may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations.
please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the sec today and posted on our website, as well as our most recent 10-k and 10-q filings. we do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. during our call today, we will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures. a reconciliation between our gaap and non-gaap financial measures is available in the investor relations section of our website.
with that, i'll turn the call over to matt for his comments on our performance. matt? 
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the marvell team drove another record level of revenue at $1.52 billion, growing 41% year over year and 5% sequentially. revenue on an annualized run rate exceeded $6 billion, a significant achievement for marvell. revenue collectively from our four data infrastructure-focused end markets grew 49% year over year and 7% sequentially, reaching a new high of 89% of our total revenue.
moving on to the rest of the income statement. our gaap gross margin was 51.8%, gaap operating margin was 2.6%, and gaap eps was $0.01. our non-gaap gross margin was 65%, and our non-gaap operating margin hit a new record at 36.5% of revenue. disciplined opex management helped drive our non-gaap earnings per share to $0.57, above the midpoint of guidance.
earnings per share grew 68% year over year, much faster than our revenue growth as we continue to drive operating leverage. now let me provide a brief update on the outlook for demand and supply. we continue to see healthy demand for our products with the exception of consumer hdd, and our overall demand is outpacing supply. the very successful adoption of our new products and strong end market demand has enabled marvell to grow revenue significantly above our long-term target model.
as a reminder, at our last investor day in october 2021, we had updated our long-term model for revenue growth to a target range of 15% to 20% from an annualized revenue run rate at that time of $4.3 billion. at the midpoint of the target, it would have taken us two years to achieve $6 billion in annualized revenue run rate. we are very pleased that we were able to cross this milestone this quarter, a full year ahead of our target. as we look forward, we are confident that our long-term growth opportunity is consistent with our target model even off this higher base of revenue.
let me now turn to supply. despite a choppy supply environment, the strength of our business model and diversity in end markets enabled us to achieve our overall revenue guidance in the second quarter. we expect our revenue mix by end market will continue to be influenced more by supply than demand in the near term. as we continue to secure capacity to support our long-term growth, we are encouraged to see some pockets of additional supply starting to open up on certain nodes and simple package technologies.
in contrast, for our high complexity products with long manufacturing cycle times, such as in our data center end market, the supply chain for leading-edge technology and advanced packaging remains very tight. our operations team continues to execute our strategy to deeply engage with partners to support our long-term growth. let me now move on to discussing our five end markets, starting with data center. in our data center end market, revenue for the second quarter was $643 million.
on a year-on-year basis, our data center revenue grew 48%, with our cloud business growing significantly faster. the year-over-year growth was very broad-based with multiple product lines contributing to strong results. on a sequential basis, the continued growth from our cloud business was offset by a decline in our on-premise business flattening our data center revenue. in the on-premise business, the sequential decline was driven primarily from our fiber channel and ethernet adapters.
we believe the overall demand picture in cloud data centers remains healthy, and that this market represents the single biggest long-term growth driver for marvell. we expect growth to continue from a number of exciting areas, including electrooptics, cloud-optimized custom solutions, cloud switching, and our broad data center storage portfolio. at the flash memory summit earlier this month, marvell showcased many state-of-the-art data center storage solutions, including our brevera pcie gen 5 ssd controller, and ethernet bunch of flash solution for ai and ml, and cxl. as you recall from our discussion last quarter, we see cxl as the next big evolution in cloud data centers that will enable us to increase our reach into the memory ecosystem and presents a multibillion-dollar sam expansion opportunity for marvell.
this includes a host of new products such as cxl expanders, cooling devices, switches, and accelerators and the potential to embed cxl ip and a broad range of our data center products. events and presentations at fms strongly validated our excitement around cxl. this is the hottest topic at fms with standing room-only presentations by many leading industry participants. the marvell booth, we demonstrated the industry's first cxl memory pooling solution, addressing the challenges related to memory scaling and cloud data centers.
while the industry is still in the early stages of cxl adoption, we are working on closing significant opportunities right in front of us at key customers and envision a strong design win pipeline. turning now to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. in data center, year over year, we are expecting revenue growth of over 20%, driven by our cloud end market. due to the complex nature of products for this end market, we expect supply challenges in the third quarter to impact our ability to fully meet the demand on a sequential basis.
as a result, we expect revenue from cloud customers to be flat sequentially and revenue in the on-premise market to decline. therefore, for our overall data center end market, we project revenue in the third quarter to decline sequentially in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis. however, we expect our data center revenue in the fourth quarter to increase on a sequential basis, anticipating an improvement in supply and new product ramps in cloud. turning to our carrier infrastructure end market.
revenue for the second quarter was well above our forecast at $285 million and growing 45% year over year and 13% sequentially. we benefited from a strong performance from both our wireless and wired end markets. our wireless business continued to advance in the second quarter, benefiting from the growth in 5g adoption. with an annualized revenue run rate crossing $600 million, we are thrilled to have achieved an important milestone.
we expect to see an extended period of growth for our 5g business with multiple regions such as europe and india yet to launch 5g in a meaningful fashion. we expect to see further growth in other large geographies such as the u.s., which are only in their first year of mainstream deployment. in addition, we have significant content growth in the next generation of base stations still in front of us. in wired, we saw stronger-than-expected shipments of our coherent dsps and accompanying tias and drivers to wired customers.
we are seeing strong demand in the metro and long-haul carrier markets driven by a rapid adoption of our 400-gig coherent electro-optics portfolio. we are pleased with the strong launch of these products.looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 for our carrier end market. we are expecting year-over-year revenue growth in the mid-20% range, driven primarily by our wireless end market. on a sequential basis, we expect wireless revenue to continue to grow, driven by 5g deployments.
however, after a very strong second quarter, we expect a sequential decline in revenue from wire to more than offset the growth from wireless. as a result, we project revenue from the overall carrier end market to decline in the mid-single digits sequentially on a percentage basis. moving on to our enterprise networking end market. revenue for the second quarter was $340 million, growing 53% year over year and 19% sequentially, better than our guidance driven by improvements in supply.
our strong growth in enterprise networking is primarily a result of our own unique product cycles. our revenue growth has accelerated as our customers have started shipping their new platforms where we have the dual benefits of share gains and an increase in content, driven by the adoption of higher-value products such as our multigigabit fis. in the second quarter, we see ongoing growth from our refreshed ethernet switch and fi portfolio. we also benefited from a ramp in our custom silicon products for enterprise networking, which is a new growth vector in this end market for marvell.
in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect a continuation of strong demand for our products from the enterprise networking end market. as you heard earlier, we are seeing pockets of supply opening up, which should enable us to begin to catch up to demand. as a result, we are projecting revenue from enterprise networking to grow approximately 70% year over year and over 20% sequentially. turning to our automotive and industrial end market.
revenue for the second quarter was $84 million, growing 46% year over year. our auto business continued to grow sequentially, but this was more than offset by a supply impacted industrial business. as a result, overall revenue from the combined end market declined 6% quarter over quarter. year over year, our auto business, driven by higher adoption of marvell's ethernet technology continued its strong growth trajectory with revenue doubling.
last quarter, i discussed our growing list of ethernet design wins in our auto business, which expanded to eight of the 10 largest oems worldwide and 36 oems in total. i would highlight that the lifetime revenue from these new design wins is substantially larger than prior wins. at large auto oems, we are winning in their highest volume internal combustion engine segments, along with their higher content in their evs and hybrids. these wins tend to be multi-platform in nature, covering many models simultaneously.
overall, content is continuing to grow, driven by an increase in the number of ethernet-connected endpoints, coupled with the need for more bandwidth. looking to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. we are projecting revenue growth to remain over 40% year over year and grow in the mid-teens sequentially on a percentage basis for the combined auto and industrial end market. we project all of the sequential growth to be driven by our automotive products where we are experiencing strong demand and continuing improvements in supply.
moving on to our consumer end market. revenue for the second quarter was $164 million, declining 1% year over year and 8% sequentially. results were below guidance as demand from the hdd market weakened. in contrast to consumer hdd products, revenue in the second quarter from our consumer ssd controllers continue to grow both sequentially and year over year.
looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 for our consumer end market, we are forecasting revenue to be flattish sequentially. on a year-over-year basis, we expect revenue from the consumer end market to decline by approximately 10% due to softness in consumer hdd demand, partially offset by continued growth in our ssd business. in closing, we delivered record results for the second quarter and are guiding for continued growth in the third quarter. our strategy to focus on a diversified portfolio and data infrastructure is playing out very well as we continue to deliver strong results.
we have limited exposure to the headwinds that consumer-exposed companies are now facing. in the third quarter, at the midpoint of the range, we are guiding our revenue to grow by 29% year over year, and we expect operating leverage in our business model to drive non-gaap eps at the midpoint of guidance to grow by 37% year over year. looking forward, we are projecting our revenue growth to accelerate on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter on the back of more supply and new product ramps. as we wrap up the first half of fiscal 2023, i'm very pleased with the trajectory for full year revenue, which is well above the target we established last december.
at that time, we had discussed our target for fiscal 2023 annual revenue growth in the low 30% range. i'm very pleased to note that we are running well ahead of that target with full year revenue growth now tracking toward the high 30% range. over the last six years, through organic investments and strategic m&a, we have significantly transformed the company pivoting to data infrastructure, accelerating our technology road map, and driving a tremendous increase in design wins. we are now seeing the benefits of these efforts in our revenue growth, operating margin expansion, and increased exposure to the critical cloud, 5g, and auto end markets.
as we look at next fiscal year, despite economic and semiconductor cycle concerns, we are optimistic about our prospects. we expect to benefit from our favorable end market exposure and significant revenue contributions from a number of marvell-specific product cycles, which we have discussed in detail over the last several quarters. before i hand off to jean, let me provide an update on our board and esg. earlier this week, we announced the addition of rebecca house to the marvell board of directors.
she currently serves as senior vice president, chief people, and legal officer and corporate secretary at rockwell automation, a global leader in industrial automation with 25,000 employees worldwide. she was selected for her extensive background in the areas of talent management, legal, ethics and compliance, public affairs, security and sustainability. i'm excited to have becky join our already strong group of directors and i am looking forward to working with her. finally, i'm pleased to announce the publication of marvell's inaugural sustainability report.
i encourage you to review the report on our website to learn more about our esg performance and future goals. and with that, i'll turn the call over to jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.
jean hu -- chief financial officer
thanks, matt, and good afternoon, everyone. i'll start with a review of our financial results for the second quarter and then provide our current outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. revenue in the second quarter was $1.517 billion, growing 5% sequentially and 41% year over year. data center was our largest end market, accounting for 42% of consolidated revenue.
enterprise networking was next largest with 22% of total revenue, followed by carrier infrastructure at 19%. consumer at 11%, and auto industrial at 6%. gaap gross margin was 51.8%. non-gaap gross profit was $986 million, increasing 41% year over year.
non-gaap gross margin was 65% of revenue, slightly below the middle point due to product mix. gaap operating expenses were $747 million, and included the cost of share-based compensation expenses of $135 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets of $88 million, and $85 million charge of contractual legal disputes segment, and $7 million in other acquisition and divestiture-related costs. non-gaap operating expenses were $432 million, below the midpoint of our guidance. opex increased by 18% year over year as we added headcount to deliver the marketable new design we have won with key customers.
we continue to drive strong operating leverage to grow opex to significantly less than top-line revenue growth. gaap operating income was $39 million. our non-gaap operating profit was $554 million, increasing by 67% from a year ago and non-gaap operating margin was 36.5%, a record for marvell. for the second quarter, gaap income per diluted share was $0.01.
non-gaap income per diluted share was $0.57, increasing by 68% year over year. now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. during the quarter, we generated $332 million in cash from operations, reflecting our strong earnings offset by continued working capital investments to support our top-line revenue growth. we have increased our inventory by $78 million to better address demand from our customers in a very tight supply chain environment and to help ensure a smooth ramp for a number of new design wins that we expect to start shipping in the next few quarters.
the majority of this increase was in raw materials and with -- looking longer term, as the supply chain start to show improvement, we expect our doi will start to decline. consistent with our strategy to secure longer-term supply, we have increased our long-term purchase commitment for capacity to support the number of high-volume source of the design wins. purchase commitments increased by $447 million in the second quarter to a total of approximately $3.4 billion. please note, this commitment are over a multiyear time period.
at the end of the second fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalents was $617 million. we intend to maintain a higher cash balance compared to the last few years as our business has significantly increased in scale. our total debt was $4.6 billion. our gross debt-to-ebitda ratio was two times and net debt-to-ebitda ratio was 1.8 times.
we returned $101 million to shareholders through $51 million in cash dividends and $50 million of share repurchase. now turning to our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. we expect the following: revenue will be in the range of $1.56 billion, plus or minus 3%. gaap to gross margin will be in the range of 51.1%, plus or minus 1.1%.
non-gaap gross margin will be in the range of 65%, plus or minus 0.25%. gaap operating expenses will be in the range of $667 million to $677 million. non-gaap operating expenses will be in the range of $435 million to $440 million. at the middle point of our guidance, we expect to deliver 37% non-gaap operating margin.
we continue to make significant progress toward our long-term target of 38% to 40% non-gaap operating margin. other income and expense, including interest expense, will be approximately $38 million. for the third quarter, we expect a non-gaap tax rate of 6%. we expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be 854 million.
and our diluted weighted shares outstanding will be 862 million. as a result, we expect gaap earnings per share in the range of $0.05 to $0.13. we expect non-gaap income per diluted share in the range of $0.56 to $0.62. operator, please open the line and announce q&a instructions.

thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question comes from toshiya hari of goldman sachs. please go ahead.
toshiya hari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. thanks so much for taking the question. matt, i wanted to ask a question on calendar '23 or fiscal '24. you gave some brief comments as it pertains to some of the big growth drivers that you've talked about in the past.
i was hoping you could remind us perhaps the top three drivers that are idiosyncratic to marvell as you look out into fiscal '24. and how you're thinking about the supply side of the equation. do you think by fiscal '24, you'll be shipping to demand or you'll still be constrained, whether it be wafers or substrates? and the third part of my question, i think consensus has you growing top line by about 17%. is that a fair number to start off with? or is that too high, too low? any comments on where street consensus is today would be helpful.
thanks so much.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, toshi. we'll go ahead and do the trifecta of questions here. no problem.
so on the first one, for next year, as you point out, there are a number of marvell-specific growth drivers, which we're very excited about. i'll cover three of them. and then, of course, there's other things going on as well. so, the three biggest buckets and then the no.
1 of all three is our cloud-optimized silicon ramp. what we've talked about in the last few quarters and even year is a number of new design wins that we achieved over the last couple of years in this cloud-optimized silicon area. and we sized it, for those of you on the call that haven't been following it, at about $400 million of incremental revenue for next year and then $800 million the year after. and that's still tracking extremely well.
we have good line of sight on those programs. they're quite diverse in nature, by the way. so there's a number of them that are going to have to ramp, and that's all tracking well. the second is, and you saw even in the most current quarter, again, another strong performance out of our 5g business in wireless, and the adoption of 5g will absolutely continue next year.
and really, on top of that, which is more specific to marvell is we have incremental content gains and sam expansion coming as well. so that's also in front of us. and then on the third, our automotive business, which in general, has been about doubling on a year-on-year basis, if you go back over the last few quarters. this is automotive ethernet.
that also has a very strong outlook as well for next year. and again, this is really based on the breadth of design wins, toshiya, we have across almost all the major top oems, as well as virtually all the emerging next-generation car companies. and by the way, it's proliferating both in the ice vehicles, as well as electric vehicles. so those three, i think, are good buckets to think about.
on the follow-up on the constraint side, we are seeing some loosening of supply, as i said in my prepared remarks, which we believe will begin to benefit us, some of which will be in q4. when you -- as you think about next year, when you look at the broader supply chain and you actually focus in on the bleeding edge technology types of components that are required, whether that's advanced packaging and substrates, some of the advanced node process technology and just some of the complex nature of the products we're dealing with, those we have to manage very carefully. they have long manufacturing cycle times, and we need to plan appropriately. but currently, we feel very good about our line of sight to be able to ramp up these programs in line with what our customers need, and we're having those discussions as we speak.
and then the final part is with respect to the outlook next year, i think the biggest thing to take away really is at the highest level, we're ahead of plan on where we thought we were. if i went back to our analyst day back at the end of 2021, we're on the $6 billion annualized revenue run rate. now our current year looks like it's going to be above where we thought it would be back at the end of last year. so that's all positive.
and as we look forward, we do see the long-term target model being achievable even off this higher revenue run rate. so that's more of a long-term comment. but certainly, if you add up our growth drivers and you look at where we are today, we feel very good about fiscal '24 or calendar '23 next year. thanks.

the next question comes from c.j. muse from evercore. please go ahead.
c.j. muse -- evercore isi -- analyst
yes, good afternoon. thank you for taking the question. i guess a question around data center, particularly as it relates to the october quarter guide. i'm surprised that cloud is tracking only flat.
and i guess, is that kind of a supply constraint that caught you by surprise? or otherwise, less than 3% sequential growth seems a little bit light. i would love to hear your thoughts around that.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, no problem, c.j. yeah, a couple of things. one is, i said some of this in the prepared remarks. as we've battled through on the supply side, like a lot of other companies this year, it's been quite lumpy in terms of when the supply comes in and by what end market.
and so on an average quarter, we're not exactly even over the last few quarters, able to perfectly forecast how much we can deliver. now that said, in data center just for perspective, we had a huge step up starting in our q1 of this year. we were constrained last year. we made a lot of great progress.
our q1, i believe, was up something like 12% sequentially from our q4 with -- and then we've sort of held at that level, maybe slightly increased a little bit through that time frame. and on a year-over-year basis, cloud has been absolutely on fire. and the final point would be in the fourth quarter, we see a step up again both on a sequential basis. so, i wouldn't say it necessarily surprised us.
i think we've known these programs, and we're doing our best. but at this -- and we're going to try to do better for this quarter, by the way. but at this point, this is how we see it. the cloud business for us has been extremely strong and overall for marvell remains healthy.
i would say it's more of a supply timing issue, and our operations team is all over it to try to obviously make sure we meet what our customers need and ramp when they want to ramp.
c.j. muse -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah.

the next question is from ross seymore from deutsche bank. please go ahead.
ross seymore -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi. thanks for letting me ask a question. matt, i want to talk about the cloud optimized side. i know you answered to a previous question that, that should be an idiosyncratic driver for you next year.
but how do i blend together, frankly, the answers to the first and the second question that was already asked where the cloud side is lumpy, have ups and downs, but the good part is it's idiosyncratic, and you expect it to grow? so, i guess the net of it all is, do you see risk to that $400 million over the next year and then another $400 million the year after there if macro and/or supply stays lumpy? or do you think the customer-specific very customized aspect of those businesses will allow that to grow and deliver those numbers even in a more choppy environment?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. sure, ross. great question. maybe just before i answer it, i'll just give a higher-level view.
and your question is cloud-specific, but if i just frame the overall marvell strategy that we've put together and the business model we've put together, it's been one where diversification and breadth of product offering and technology and obviously, the financial model to go with it has been our north star, right, since i joined the company and since this management team has driven this transformation. so you can even see it in the short term where like, for example, we've got constraints in cloud this quarter, but enterprise and automotive, when you look out to next quarter are doing extremely well, and that's because of our diversification of our model, all focused around data infrastructure, by the way. so, while there may be lumpy ""parts"" of our business from time to time, that is by design, how we've architected the business model of marvell. and it's taken a long time to get here.
and i think it's actually proving to be very resilient when you look at our q3 being up and then our q4 actually accelerating. so that's the bigger picture around how we think about it and managing lumpiness. now with respect to the cloud, i might want to put a little asterisk by the 400, 800, and that we've actually talked about it being 400-plus and 800-plus in prior calls, which means the 400, 800 was identified last year. and then subsequently, in our communications with investors, including earnings calls, we've said we've actually won more business since then with incremental revenue both in fiscal '24 and fiscal '25.
so next year and the year after. so think of it as kind of 400-plus, 800-plus diversified across a number of programs. so the bottom line is we feel very good about that ramp. some of them, i'm sure, will require a lot more than we're planning for at this point.
and i'm sure a few of them will require less than we're planning. but in aggregate, when we judge the outlook, and we just did a refresh of this just very recently, not only internally, but even with my key customers in terms of planning for next year, that ramp looks very solid in both of those years.
ross seymore -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you.

the next question is from timothy arcuri with ubs. please go ahead.
timothy arcuri -- ubs -- analyst
thanks a lot, matt. i also wanted to ask about data center. and last quarter, i think the expectation was that you were going to see some reacceleration as the supply was going to improve into the back half of the fiscal year. so, i know that the enterprise portion of that business is weak.
but maybe can you help us understand sort of what's going on there? maybe tell us how much cloud is as a portion of the total data center business? and then also into fiscal q4, it sounds like total revenue is going to be close to $1.7 billion for you to be up high 30s, and that's up nearly 10% q on q. but i'm wondering how much data center will be up. i mean you said it's going to be up q on q, but i would think it should easily be up double digits with more supply, you have the five-nanometer products ramping. so, i wonder if you can help with that.
thanks.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure. yeah, a couple of things. so, on the first part on the data center, what we've said is that our -- the larger portion of the total is in cloud. so, the exact number, we haven't quite disclosed it, but call it closer to 60%, 60-plus percent versus 40%.
so that's been -- and that's why we said even in this prior quarter on the year on year, cloud grew much faster than the total just because of the enterprise of the mix. now reminder, a little bit on the enterprise side. it's not a great proxy of what i would call enterprise data center from the standpoint that those products we sell into that market are fiber channel and ethernet adapters, which are somewhat of a legacy type of business for marvell. so that one we feel we've been pretty upfront about this.
that doesn't have a lot of growth per se ahead. and so really, it's been all about the cloud. the -- in q4, as we said, the overall company revenue, we expect to accelerate off of q3. we haven't pegged the number.
i think the range you're discussing looks a little on the high side. but if you just back into the high 30s comment we made and you take the two quarters we've already produced, we take our q3 guide, and look at q4, you'll get to a range that seems to make sense. so, yeah, i guess bottom line is we do -- and i think the acceleration we thought we would get in the second half on cloud is more a q4 type of story than q3, and that's how it's playing out primarily on the basis of supply.
timothy arcuri -- ubs -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
the next question is from blayne curtis with barclays. please go ahead.
blayne curtis -- barclays -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. i just wanted to go back to the demand part of the equation. i thought you said in the beginning, consumer hdds were the only thing weak, but you have two segments that are down. so just maybe just revisit that even in the areas like enterprise that are up a bit, it sounds like supply.
so, i just wondered if you could revisit the demand outlook and i think you said data center is kind of lumpy, but i mean is it all lumping in timing and supply even for the businesses that are down? or have you seen any broader downticks on that demand side?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, blayne, i think when i look at your question there, the enterprise side and particularly the on-prem, i do think that that has been more lumpy in terms of the supply we've gotten and how we've delivered it. we haven't really seen a lot of demand changes there per se. but we certainly, in our first quarter and a little bit of our second quarter, we're able to produce more supply than we had hoped. so when we talk to customers, the demand signals there don't look anything out of the ordinary versus what we have seen historically.
this is because it kind of feels like we're going back to a little bit of where we were before this huge upcycle. but it's all within the normal range. i think the comment on consumer hdd was really -- it's down, it's pronounced. we can quantify it.
but the other part you mentioned is it's more around the lumpiness of our supply delivery rather than demand being down.
blayne curtis -- barclays -- analyst

the next question is from matt ramsay with cowen. please go ahead.
matt ramsay -- cowen and company -- analyst
yeah. thank you very much. good afternoon. i don't know, just for a change of pace, maybe something not in data center.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
you can go there, matt, no problem.
matt ramsay -- cowen and company -- analyst
i wanted to ask about the enterprise networking segment. the big upside there and guiding for almost 25% growth or 70% year over year. is that -- maybe you could talk about the specific product cycles that are going on there? or is it, in fact, that's where you're able to upside in supply and just sort of disaggregate what's driving that to be the fastest-growing segment right now? thanks.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks. yeah. actually, it's a combination of both where we have very strong demand for our products.
i'll cover that in a second on why that's a little bit unique to us. but then also, i would say, we're -- we have been -- we called this out a couple of quarters ago. this had been one of our more pronounced areas of delinquency, and we're starting to finally catch up. so it's a combination of both, matt, which i think is producing a very strong result, obviously, as we guide out not only in the q3 guide but also the quarter we just finished.
so on the demand side, i mean, we've -- i think a couple of things, right? in our sort of classic marvell portfolio, we've had very consistent share gains and new product introductions with a lot of success in the enterprise-class ethernet switch and fi area. in some of those cases, we sell the two products together as part of a total solution. and one trend that i think we had talked about for quite a while, and it's actually here, and it's right in front of us, and it's showing up in our numbers is the adoption of multi-gig phy technology. the large enterprise oems, and you can listen to their commentary, they're seeing a big uptick.
a lot of that is driven by wi-fi 6, which at some point, the wireless rate, line rate was going faster than the wired rate. so that's driven a pretty big adoption. and the content and the per port has gone up dramatically as you switch to multi-gig. and it's not like 10%, 20%, 30%.
it's sort of multiples on a per port basis of where it was before. and that's hitting, ok? so, you've got increased phy content, new products ramping. we've won new customers over the last few years and we've gained share. so that's been a good story, and it's been pretty consistent, by the way, although it's accelerated in the last few quarters.
and then on top of that, a lot of the constraints we had, had in this area, we finally started seeing the supply improvements based on our own partnerships that we've struck with our various suppliers. and so that's starting to benefit as well. and we're finally sort of getting more caught up here. so all in all, i think a great performance, obviously, out of enterprise.
it's at a much higher run rate than i think certainly, people were planning or we were even thinking back at our investor day a year ago, but we're pleased that i think the designs we won actually have ramped up, and we still have a bright outlook from here. the final one i would say, matt, is that we also had some new incremental business on custom-silicon and asic in the enterprise, which was not an area where we historically played. and those are also going to production as well, both starting this year, but even reaching full volume or not -- let's call it, run rate volume next year. so i think a lot of new product stuff and good supply improvements.

the next question is from gary mobley from wells fargo. please go ahead.
gary mobley -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
good afternoon, everybody. thanks for taking my question. i had a couple of questions on the -- some of your foundry relationships. jean, i believe you mentioned that your purchase obligations with your foundry partners ticked up about 15% sequentially.
it sits in about a half year's worth of revenue. i'm wondering if given that capacity seems to be freeing up a bit, might we see that those purchase obligations level off? and what are the risks thereof maybe not being able to take all that commitment in the future? and then as well, have you -- or do you anticipate any additional price increases from your foundry partners that you may eventually have to pass on to customers?
jean hu -- chief financial officer
yeah. hey, gary, thanks for the question. first, on the long-term purchase commitment. as matt mentioned, right, we focus on data infrastructure.
our products tend to have a very long product cycle and most of our products were so soft. so based on the design wins we have and the product ramp and the business planning, we struck strategic relationships with our suppliers to ensure we can secure the capacity in the longer term. so when you look at the purchase commitment, those are very long-term commitments like two, three, five to seven, or even beyond the year. our team has done a great job to really analyze what we need and what we should strike as a long-term purchase agreement.
typically, it's only a very small portion of our overall supply needs. so we actually feel very comfortable by analyzing the need, the product ramp or the customer relationship, and what we are committing. if you look at it each year, it's actually very small month, right, it's spread into seven years and beyond. so, we feel pretty good about that.
on your second question about supply chain input cost. it's still very tight supply chain environment. we continue to believe in the next year we are going to continue to face challenges in complex substrate and some of the component and even older generation wafer side. so for us, we definitely -- if there's input cost increase because of supply/demand imbalance, our strategy and our approach has been really working with our suppliers and the customers to make sure we share the cost to increase overall.
so that's our current expectation.

the next question comes from harlan sur with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
harlan sur -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for taking my question. on the cloud optical connectivity business, this is both inside and between data centers, the upgrade cycles have been this really great multiyear tailwind for the team. and if i look into next year, i believe that there's still at least one of the top four u.s.
hyperscale titans that's going to start the 400-gig pam4 transition. you still have china csps that need to fire. you've got multiple customers on dr that's going to fire as well. historically, like these transitions, i don't think have been impacted by a slowing macro demand environment.
they're viewed as, i think, very strategic. but is that how your cloud customers are thinking about these upgrades and your views on continued upgrade momentum in this segment for next year? and just relatedly, is the innovium team on track to drive $150 million in revenues this year?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
hey, thanks, harlan. yeah, i think the first part of it, you got pretty well in terms of the transition on 200 and 400 gig pam4 inside the data center. and then the new ramps we're seeing in 400 gig zr for dci between data centers. what i'd add on top of that is -- which has been extremely strong and also, in some ways, a little bit of a constraint we've seen in terms of being able to keep up is the demand on 800 gig, which is happening right now really around, obviously, very advanced ai workloads.
that is an area where if we could obviously produce more material, we would be shipping it in q3. so that's also a positive trend. so you've got sort of the transition going on all the way up to 800 gig, and that continues to look pretty good. on the data center switching side, we are on track for the $150 million of data center switching this year.
and we see very good traction in the market to -- in the solutions we're talking about now at 51 2 with our pam4 dsps as kind of a total solution. so that's also going well. the team has been integrated very well into the company. the road map looks very strong.
it's pretty exciting. so that was another growth vector that i did not mention upfront, but i guess you could lump -- it's not part of our 400, 800 cloud, the $1 million ramp. but that's also incremental opportunity for us in cloud switching.
harlan sur -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst

the next question comes from tore svanberg with stifel. please go ahead.
tore svanberg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yes. congrats on another record quarter. just kind of staying a little bit on what's to come, especially in the next few years. you talked quite a bit about cxl.
i was just wondering when will that business start to ramp. i mean we're talking about more than $1 billion sam here. and when could that business sort of become bigger than the consumer hdd business? just to kind of put into perspective, unique growth drivers versus market drivers? thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. well, tore, that would be a great day. we can crack the champagne if we can get cxl up to where the consumer -- or the hdd business used to be. but in all seriousness, this is new.
this is a new technology transition that's happening. it's actually very exciting for the team to look at now really enabling these solutions to -- in the memory ecosystem. the -- we have a full road map that's well underway in terms of product development but it's still early. so we're still a couple of years out.
and by the way, just to be clear on the opportunity, that's the sam we said was over time. the $1 billion-plus or multibillion. so it's still a ways out. we're not ready to sort of talk about when the timing exactly of that, but we're very encouraged.
it's an absolute real trend. we intend to be a leader here. we're investing ahead of the curve. tremendous traction on our road map and the breadth of what we can do in cxl.
so it's an exciting one, and we just thought it was appropriate to flag that for investors is yet another opportunity to leverage a lot of the great technology we have into the same set of accounts. and in the case of cxl actually helped enable them, right, to architect these solutions for the future. so i think it's going to be a pretty exciting one, but it's a little ways out. and none of that is sort of in the -- like the $400 million next year, as an example.
that's not part of it. that would all be incremental a few years out.

the next question is from srini pajjuri from smbc nikko. please go ahead.
srini pajjuri -- smbc nikko securities -- analyst
thank you. hi, matt. my question is on 5g, in particular. now that india 5g auctions are behind us, i'm just curious as to how we should think about that opportunity, matt.
i think you have a pretty strong position there, but could you put that into perspective versus a u.s. opportunity or europe opportunity? and then the second half strength, is that what's driving it? i think you're guiding 5g to be up even in the third quarter. so i'm just curious if you're seeing any action from india as yet. thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and jean, you can chime in, but i think india for us is still -- i think that's still a next year type of event, although the -- as you mentioned, the tenders have gone through. we're well positioned for that. i think we've historically through our partners, had a strong position there.
but i would say it's -- the way to think about our 5g business now is more broader, diversified, and kind of a consistent performer. so i don't think you're going to see it take some enormous leap in a given quarter as an example. i mean it's been performing extremely well. if you go all the way back to kind of the initial ramps two-plus years ago, we basically had sequential growth, i think about every quarter, except one, maybe, i don't know, seven quarters ago where we were flat or something, right? so it's -- i think, again, it's a good example maybe at a smaller scale of the diversification strategy we've tried to drive whereas we go into these markets, we do try to find a number of key partners to line up with such that we're -- we try to reduce volatility and perform well in any environment.
so i think india is just another example. but i think there's also other geographies that are going to be laying in as well. and i think maybe even the bigger tailwind is just sort of increased content as new systems roll out with more and more marvell silicon per base station. i think that's really where we'll be a bigger impact than a particular geography ramping up in a given quarter.
but jean, any thoughts on that to add?
jean hu -- chief financial officer
yeah. matt, to just add to what you just said is this year, we have seen significant growth, and the run rate is already over $600 million now. and that's actually largely benefited by north america, right? and the north american adoption of 5g has been really strong this year. going forward, india definitely maybe next year or beyond.
but matt is right, is our 5g business will continue to be a very significant growth driver next year for us. it has a really long product cycle and the visibility actually is pretty good in this market.

the next question comes from harsh kumar with piper sandler. please go ahead.
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
yeah. hey, matt, i had a question for you. so if i layer in your thoughts on the $400 million odd of custom cloud silicon, that's about 15% growth by itself to your cloud business. and then i assume your business will grow at least that much, if not more, organically.
so is it fair for us to think for january 2024 for that data center business to be somewhere in the 30-something odd percent range or even better than that? yeah.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think i'd have to probably get out a spreadsheet to go figure that one out, harsh. but i think directionally, i think you're right in that. you have an estimate of what our cloud revenues are and certainly layering in the $400 million would get you to a certain number. and then you're absolutely right, what i didn't bring up is that the base business, right, which doesn't include the new wins is also ramping up.
so we haven't sized that piece of it exactly, but clearly, that's going to grow as well next year, the kind of existing run rate portfolio because some of those programs whether it's in cloud switching, whether it's in electro-optics, some of the things we've already talked about today that are already in the run rate are certainly going to grow. so yeah, i think that's -- i think from there, you'll have to kind of -- i think when you say 2024, i got a -- i don't know that exact number off the top of my head, so.
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
no, very helpful. thank you, matt. appreciate it.

the next question comes from quinn bolton with needham. please go ahead.
quinn bolton -- needham and company -- analyst
hey, matt. i wanted to follow up on matt ramsay's question on enterprise networking. if i look at the business in the october quarter, it looks like you'll be over $400 million, and that's up probably two and a half times over two years. so phenomenal growth, but clearly well ahead of the market.
i know some of that is content gains, some of its market share. but if you look at inventory in the networking space, oem inventory levels are probably up 2x over that two-year period. and so, do you guys have any way of knowing whether there's any inventory that's accumulated in that channel? do you think you can sort of sustain this $400 million quarterly run rate into next year? or do you think you may see some ebb and flows especially after a very strong october levels looking beyond october?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. ok, quinn, it's a great question. and certainly, we're very aware of kind of the broader inventory growth that's gone on in a number of the end markets that we serve. and this one, in particular, i think a couple of things give us a lot of comfort.
the first is we've still been ramping into some of these new designs. so they're not -- it's not business we had two years ago and it was at x run rate, and now it's at x times two run rate. i mean almost all of this is effectively new programs that have ramped up. i guess the silver lining is on the supply constraint so far is that we haven't been able to get over our skis on over shipping.
and so -- and we continue to have escalations by the way, even within enterprise networking today, in terms of trying to meet the demand. and again, as i said, because we're in the new systems and the new programs, those are the ones typically our oems are the most short on, and they're trying to sell. so i think it's a very fair question. and certainly, for somebody that's got a lot of market share in a given end market that had a run rate business, that had been going on for a while and it got inflated because of inventory growth over the last few years, one would get concerned.
but that's not as much of a concern for us overall in enterprise networking today. and so, i think we feel pretty good about the run rate we're on and the fact that we're running a lot farther ahead than we thought, and we still have some growth ahead of us, but we're watching it closely for sure, quinn. no question.
quinn bolton -- needham and company -- analyst
great. and just as a quick follow-up, can you comment about how much of your cloud business or hyperscale business may be driven by the chinese hyperscalers? i know some of the -- your peers in the industry have commented that they've seen a recent weakening demand out of the china hyperscalers. thanks.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we're -- go ahead, jean.
jean hu -- chief financial officer
hi, quinn. this is jean. i'll answer. matt can add.
our cloud business are primarily u.s. hyperscale data centers. so, we actually have a very limited revenue exposure with the chinese hyperscale data centers today.
quinn bolton -- needham and company -- analyst
great. thank you.

the next question comes from joe moore from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
joe moore -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you. i wonder if you could talk about the supply constraints. i think a quarter or so ago, probably your biggest problem was analog parts. i know substrates have also been an issue, trailing-edge wafers.
are those priorities shifting? you talked about a little bit at the sort of more complicated parts that are giving you trouble. can you just talk a little bit about where is supply getting better? what supply chain is getting better and what's getting worse? thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. great. thanks, joe. no, i think you're right.
i think certainly, i mean, there's -- independent of us, right, there's been broader constraints within the analog peer group that have caused sort of golden screw issues and things like that with -- and remains to be seen when all those sort themselves out. for our purposes -- and again, some of those constraints overlap because we do -- in some of our mixed signal technology, we do have a pretty broad usage of some of the older nodes relative to cmos or by cmos technology, which would be 28-nanometer, 40-nanometer, 55/65. those have been historically over the last two years, very constrained. they continue to be constrained.
we've -- but it's gotten better for sure. it's gotten better. and some of that -- some of those older nodes have been where the lumpiness of our supply has come in. you can see actually even when you look at our guide for the automotive business, those -- the five portions of that business uses some of this older technology.
and you can see we're very strong sequential guide there. so that is starting to work itself out. there's still constraints. where we're having a little bit more trouble, and i think some of the peers are, too, is just when you get into these larger, more complex packages, joe, that use flip-chip bgas and large complex substrates, that's still in very rough shape.
and you have to plan way in advance even now for the capacity that's going to be required there. that trend on abf especially is only going to go up. and so, i think the more complex products is where it continues to be a pain point. and i do think over time, as the cycle plays itself out, probably some of the legacy nodes and the analog stuff probably lighten up.
but i think for high complexity, there's just such a move in the industry, companies like marvell and a lot of our large peers who more and more are just producing tremendous amounts of compute power and high-performance computing broadly, whether it's in networking or custom-silicon or cpus or gpus, you name it, it's all going to this complex technology, and that's where we have to just continue to be tactical and keep our heads down and match supply and demand and get what we need.

operator
good afternoon, and welcome to marvell technology's fiscal third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. all participants will be in listen-only mode. [operator instructions] after today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. please note this event is being recorded.
i would now like to turn the conference over to mr. ashish saran, senior vice president of investor relations. please go ahead.
ashish saran -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. welcome to marvell's third-quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings call. joining me today are matt murphy, marvell's president and ceo; and jean hu, our cfo. let me remind everyone that certain comments made today may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations.
please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the sec today and posted on our website, as well as our most recent 10-k and 10-q filings. we do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. during our call today, we will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures. a reconciliation between our gaap and non-gaap financial measures is available in the investor relations section of our website.
with that, i'll turn the call over to matt for his comments on our performance. matt? 
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the marvell team drove revenue to $1.54 billion, a record for the company, growing 27% year over year and 1% sequentially. this year-over-year growth was driven by our cloud, 5g, and auto business, as well as share and content gains in our enterprise networking end market. our third-quarter revenue came in toward the lower end of our guidance range, and we are forecasting a sequential decline in our fourth quarter.
early in the third quarter, we were still dealing with supply escalations. late in the quarter, customers started requesting to push out shipments and reschedule orders to manage their inventory in a changing demand environment. in the third quarter, these inventory reductions started to manifest, and we are expecting an even greater impact in the fourth quarter. the largest impact is from our storage customers and has been widely communicated by that set of oems.
in addition, as our chinese customers deal with a changing macroeconomic situation, their demand for our products has come down significantly. just to give you a sense of the magnitude of that change, we estimate that our revenue in the fourth quarter from our oem customers based in china will decrease by over one-third compared to the second quarter. we expect revenue from china oems will account for less than 10% of our total company revenue in the fourth quarter. i would note that to date, the restrictions of the u.s.
department of commerce announced in october on shipments of u.s. chip technology to china has not meaningfully impacted our revenue. while the inventory correction at our customers is challenging in the near term, we believe it's prudent to work closely with them to manage the change in an orderly fashion and clear the path to a resumption of growth. let me now move on to discussing our end markets, starting with data center.
in our data center end market, revenue for the third quarter was $627 million, exceeding guidance with better-than-expected results from our cloud business. on a year-on-year basis, our data center revenue grew 26% with our cloud business driving all the growth with multiple product lines contributing to strong results. on a sequential basis, our data center revenue declined by 3% due to softness in our on-premise business. our storage products, including fiber channel, hdd, and ssd, all saw demand decline during the quarter.
however, our cloud business continued to grow sequentially, driven by strength in our electro-optics and switch products. we are seeing the growth rate of the data center end market decelerate and customers have started adjusting their inventory to address the changing demand picture. as a result, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we are expecting our data center revenue to decline year over year approximately in the mid- to high teens on a percentage basis and sequentially decline in the mid-20% range. the biggest change in demand is in product lines where we are one step removed from the end customer.
so, when demand changes quickly, we are more exposed to the supply chain bullwhip effect. as a result, we expect the impact to be the most pronounced in our storage business, which we project will be responsible for the bulk of the overall sequential decline in our data center revenue. in particular, we are projecting a very large reduction in shipments of our hdd controllers and preamps, as hdd oems deal with a broad-based inventory correction. the rest of our data center business is also expected to deal with inventory adjustments by our customers but to a much lesser extent compared to our storage business.
while we work through the near-term situation in the data center end market, we remain confident in our multiple long-term growth drivers. in the third quarter, we started ramping our cloud-optimized silicon design wins into production and are planning to launch multiple additional products in fiscal year 2024 and 2025. our successful execution on the first group of projects, coupled with our ongoing investments in data infrastructure, silicon ip, and advanced process and packaging technologies is opening up an even larger set of opportunities with cloud customers. in the third quarter, we launched our next-generation cloud security solution, marvell's liquidsecurity 2 hsm adapter, the industry's most advanced solution for enabling encryption, key management, and authentication in the cloud.
powered by marvell's cloud-optimized octeon dpu, ls 2 is a converged security platform for payment, privacy compliance, and general-purpose applications. we are also making progress on two of our longer-term growth initiatives in the cloud, cxl, and adcs. in the third quarter, we announced availability of our cxl development platform for cloud data center operators and server oems, enabling two key use cases: memory expansion and memory pooling. the platform pairs marvell's advanced cxl technology with the latest cxl capable cpus, including the new fourth-gen amd epyc processors demonstrating multi-host memory pooling.
with this platform, cloud operators can begin to advance their infrastructure and enable their applications to take advantage of this cutting-edge technology. i'm very excited to announce that we have recently won a significant design at a tier 1 hyperscaler projected to drive a substantial amount of revenue in aggregate over the program's lifetime. product development activities are in full swing, and our team is driving a large and growing pipeline of cxl opportunities. in the ac market, multiple cable manufacturers have started sampling 100-gig per lane active electrical cables powered by marvell pam4 dsps to cloud data center operators, which we expect to pave the way to broader adoption and expand our addressable market.
turning to our carrier infrastructure end market. revenue was $271 million, growing 26% year over year and declining 5% sequentially. on a year-on-year basis, the vast majority of our growth was driven by our wireless business, which continued to benefit from the growth in 5g adoption. as you recall, the annualized revenue run rate for our wireless business crossed $600 million in the second quarter of this fiscal year.
we are excited to see growth continue from that milestone. our wired business also grew year on year in the third quarter, driven by solid demand from metro and long-haul carrier for our market-leading coherent dsps and accompanying tias and drivers. on a sequential basis, our wired business came down as expected from a very strong second quarter and more than offset growth from our wireless business. we are excited to see our 5g business continuing to flourish and are looking forward to broader deployment of 5g in multiple geographies, including the u.s., europe, and india.
in addition, we anticipate significant share in content growth ahead and new opportunities in oran and dram architectures. as you will recall, in march 2020, nokia and marvell announced that our companies have started working together to develop a leading 5g silicon including multiple generations of custom silicon and infrastructure processors to further expand the range of nokia's reefshark chipsets. earlier this week, we announced an extension of our collaboration with nokia to further advance their 5g chipset portfolio. nokia will be using our new octeon 10 dpu, the industry's leading 5g transport processor built on marvell's cutting-edge five-nanometer platform and hardware acceleration technology.
these high-performance and highly efficient processors will allow operators to scale rapidly and manage the dramatic increase in data traffic and performance demanded by 5g's innovative service-based architecture while reducing cost and energy consumption. we continue to expand our collaboration with nokia and look forward to enabling their next-generation 5g platforms. there are also two key announcements from the open ran ecosystem. vodafone and nokia announced that they have agreed to work on a fully compliant open ran solution with marvell.
developing cooperation with us, nokia's reefshark soc boosts layer-1 processing capability to enable open ran systems to reach full functionality and performance parity with traditional mobile radio networks. in another development, vodafone and samsung recently announced that they are jointly cooperating with marvell to accelerate the performance and adoption of 5g open ran across europe. they plan on incorporating marvell's advanced octeon fusion processor specifically designed for open ran into the latest off-the-shelf servers. the specialized accelerator chip also enables massive mimo technology developed to serve many subscribers in dense urban areas.
moving on to our outlook for next quarter. for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we are expecting revenue from our carrier end market to grow slightly on a sequential basis and grow year over year approximately in the mid-teens on a percentage basis. moving on to our enterprise networking end market. revenue for the third quarter was $376 million, growing 52% year over year and 10% sequentially.
as the quarter progressed, our chinese customers started to turn cautious due to an evolving macroeconomic environment. in response, we work with customers realigning shipments to reflect their reduced demand. as a result, despite the strong sequential and year-over-year growth, revenue was lower than our guidance. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we are expecting revenue from the enterprise networking end market to decline sequentially in the low single digits on a percentage basis.
however, we expect growth to continue year over year at close to 40%, reflecting our higher content and growing share. turning to our automotive and industrial end market. revenue for the third quarter was $84 million, growing 26% year over year and 1% sequentially. revenue was lower than our forecast in industrial, as well as automotive where we continue to experience supply challenges in certain legacy notes.
we expect these supply challenges to start to improve in our fourth quarter. on a sequential basis, our auto business continued to grow, partially offset by a decline in our industrial business. on a year-over-year basis in this end market, marvell's growth was primarily from our auto business, driven by continuing adoption of our ethernet technology. our auto business achieved another milestone in the third quarter with annualized revenues exceeding $200 million.
as you recall, we have been accumulating platform design wins across a broad spectrum of auto oems. and we have generated a substantial pipeline of lifetime revenue that will benefit us over many years. looking to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we are projecting strong growth for our overall auto and industrial end market, expecting revenue to grow approximately 30% year over year and in the mid-20% range sequentially. moving to our consumer end market.
revenue for the third quarter was $178 million, declining 2% year over year and growing 9% sequentially. looking ahead to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we are forecasting revenue to be flat sequentially and decline in the low to mid-single digits year over year on a percentage basis. in summary, marvell delivered record results in the third quarter despite the macroeconomic uncertainty in the world and inventory corrections in some of our end markets. taking stock of our progress this fiscal year, at the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance, we are projecting full fiscal year revenue growth in the low 30% range.
while we are not immune to the global slowdown impacting the semiconductor sector, we expect to finish this year growing revenue well above the industry and our long-term model, reflecting our continued focus on data infrastructure. looking forward to the next fiscal year, we remain confident in our key growth drivers of cloud, 5g, and auto. we expect that our cloud-optimized silicon programs will build from the initial ramp that started in the second half of this fiscal year and continue to grow approximately $400 million in aggregate revenue in fiscal 2024 and $800 million in fiscal 2025. our cloud customers are relying on these chips to build incredibly efficient and optimized custom hardware to enable their key growth drivers.
in addition to our cloud-optimized programs, we expect that our 5g products in our automotive business will drive strong year-over-year revenue growth in fiscal 2024. offsetting this growth to an extent, we expect a few quarters of inventory adjustments in some of our businesses as customers realign their demand. we continue to be disciplined on operating expenses. we have tightened spending and slowed our pace of hiring, focusing on critical hires for future success.
at the same time, we continue to invest in our long-term growth initiatives including our three-nanometer silicon platform, which is now available for new product designs. in addition, we are committed to executing on a number of new products, which our customers have designed into their mission-critical applications. over the last few years, we have significantly transformed the company, creating a diversified business with growing exposure to multiple infrastructure end markets with strong secular growth drivers. our businesses at scale, we have a growing design win funnel, leadership products, and strong customer engagement.
we've built an extraordinary team at marvell with a track record of execution excellence, and we believe we are well-positioned to navigate the current environment to continue to deliver strong top- and bottom-line results over the long term. with that, i'll turn the call over to jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.
jean hu -- chief financial officer
thanks, matt, and good afternoon, everyone. i'll start with a review of our financial results for the third quarter and then provide our current outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. revenue in the third quarter was $1.537 billion, within our guidance range, growing 1% sequentially and 27% year over year, driven by growth from our data infrastructure end market. data center accounted for 41% of revenue, enterprise networking was 24% of revenue, carrier infrastructure at 18%, consumer at 12%, and auto industrial at 5%.
gaap gross margin was 50.6%. non-gaap gross margin was 64% of revenue, below our guidance range primarily due to product mix. our enterprise and auto industrial end market revenue was lower than expected, and the consumer revenue was higher than our forecast. gaap operating expenses were $672 million.
non-gaap operating expenses were $420 million, declining by 3% sequentially. year over year, opex increased by 13%, growing at less than half the rate of the top-line revenue growth. opex was lower than guidance due to lower bonus accrual and better-than-expected nre. our gaap operating income was $106 million.
non-gaap operating profit was $564 million or 36.7% of revenue, another all-time record, demonstrating the strong leverage in our operating model. other income expense, including interest on our debt, was $41 million, higher than guidance primarily due to higher interest rate on our outstanding debt. for the third quarter, gaap income per diluted share was $0.02. non-gaap income per diluted share was $0.57 within our guidance range.
earnings per share grew 33% year over year, faster than top-line revenue growth. now, turning to our balance sheet and the cash flow. during the quarter, we generated $411 million in cash from operations, reflecting our strong earnings, offset by continued working capital investments to support our top-line revenue growth, including $94 million in payments for long-term back-end and substrate capacity agreements. these agreements are critical to ramping our complex products in data infrastructure market, including the call to optimize the silicon solutions matt discussed earlier.
in the third quarter, we increased our inventory by $44 million or 5% sequentially. looking at the change in demand we are forecasting in the fourth quarter, we expect our inventory level to continue to be elevated. we are focused on prioritizing new product ramps to support our customers. these -- most of our products have long product cycles of three to five years or even longer.
we are comfortable carrying higher inventory in a dynamic supply chain environment and we plan on reducing inventory starting next fiscal year. as of the end of the third fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalent was $723 million, increasing by $106 million from the prior quarter. our total debt was $4.5 billion. our gross debt-to-ebitda ratio was 1.9 times, and net debt-to-ebitda ratio was 1.6 times.
during the third quarter, we returned $101 million to shareholders through $51 million in cash dividends and $50 million of share repurchases. in summary, in an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the marvell team executed very well, delivering top-line revenue growth and earnings expansion much faster than revenue growth. now, turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. we are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.4 billion, plus or minus 5%.
we expect our gaap gross margin in the range of 48.2% to 50.2%. we project our non-gaap gross margin will be approximately 64%. we project our gaap operating expenses to be approximately $646 million. we anticipate our non-gaap operating expenses to be approximately $430 million.
as matt mentioned earlier, we have proactively slowed down our pace of hiring and tightened the discretionary spending to manage our operating expenses. we have a proven track record of executing through economic and the market cycles to maintain strong profitability while we continue to invest in long-term growth initiatives. as a reminder, looking ahead to the first fiscal quarter of 2024, due to the typical seasonality in payroll taxes and employee merit increase, our opex tends to increase from the fourth fiscal quarter in the high single digits sequentially on a percentage basis. following the step-up in the first fiscal quarter, we are currently planning on holding our opex approximately flat at that level for the next few quarters.
other income and expense, including interest on our debt, is expected to be approximately $44 million. we expect a non-gaap tax rate of 6% for the fourth quarter and currently expect this to increase slightly to 7% next fiscal year. we expect our basic weighted share outstanding will be 855 million. and our diluted weighted average share outstanding will be 861 million.
as a result, we anticipate gaap earnings per share in the range of breakeven to $0.05 per diluted share. we expect non-gaap income per diluted share in the range of $0.46, plus or minus $0.05. operator, please open the line and announce q&a instructions. thank you.

operator
thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question comes from blayne curtis with barclays. please go ahead.
blayne curtis -- barclays -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking my question. matt, maybe just on the data center, i want to understand the moving pieces a little bit better. i think storage has been weak for a bit. i think nearline, i think you've been pretty open that that was weak.
i guess it's implied a big move in storage. and i guess what i'm struggling with is trying to figure out how to put the comment on the chinese weakness as well because that's a big number. and i guess maybe that overlaps. so, can you just parse those two pieces a little bit more for me? what -- when you say china is weak, what kind of products are we talking about? is there a way you kind of give any better color on that within the data center for january?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. gotcha, blayne. yeah. so, on the first one on nearline, as you mentioned, there's been a lot of reports out there about the weakness there.
we really hadn't seen that when we guided the quarter. in q3, we started to see some weakness, but the impact is very pronounced in the fourth quarter, and that nearline weakness obviously flows into the data center end market into that bucket. when you go to china and the weakness we've seen there, that's really in the enterprise area. so, while overall enterprise is hanging in there, it was slightly below in q3.
we've had some offsets to that from strength elsewhere. but the main impact of the chinese customers has really been an enterprise for the most part.
blayne curtis -- barclays -- analyst
thanks. and then if i could just follow up, you mentioned in terms of the cloud, you said it was actually strong in october, both optical, as well as switching. i'm kind of -- but you also made a comment that i think data center is decelerating. so, can you just put those two together? are you still seeing strength in u.s.
cloud and weakness elsewhere? does the comment on data center weakening just on-prem? what did you mean by that?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yep. great question. so, let me take it from the top. so, first point would be that if you look over the last few years, cloud capex has been on fire.
it's been growing 30% kind of plus for the last few years. this year, if you look at reports and kind of what we see is probably something in the 15% range for '22 and then it depends on who you talk to, but probably down in the low to mid-single digits or maybe mid-single digits for next year. so, that's the deceleration that we're talking about. and as the macro has started to catch up even with these large cloud companies, you see them very publicly tightening their capex, tightening their opex.
and they've had this supply chain built in the data center, which was geared up for a lot of growth. and so, as they reset those expectations, it's not a real smooth process. storage is the most pronounced, as i mentioned earlier. that's the majority reason code for the sequential decline.
but we are seeing inventory adjustment as well to a much lesser extent, and i'd say the broader set of product lines outside of storage that we sell into data center. and so, that is not a china-specific thing. that is a global comment, including u.s. cloud, seeing inventory adjustment a bit more broadly.
and that's a change, certainly from where we were, say, a quarter ago when we were mired in supply escalations and expedites to an environment where it's now how do we work together to manage the inventory and manage the new reality. and so, that's what you see in the guide for q4. hopefully, that was helpful to give you the perspective you were looking for.
blayne curtis -- barclays -- analyst
thanks for the color.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yep.
operator
our next question comes from vivek arya with bank of america. please go ahead.
vivek arya -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. matt, i'm trying to see what is the range of kind of scenarios for fiscal '24 sales growth. i understand you're not giving a specific number. it would be helpful if you give us at least kind of a range.
can marvell grow next year? because when i look at the three areas, cloud and 5g, and autos, i believe it's about 35%, 40% of business. can those three areas collectively grow fast enough to offset the inventory correction in other areas? like, so should we be thinking about flat or mid-single digit? what's the kind of range of scenarios of growth that we should be thinking about for fiscal '24?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. great question, vivek. and certainly, i'd frame all this by saying it's still a very dynamic environment. so, we'll give you the best view we can.
i'd say the first point is we feel very good about the new products that are ramping up and the growth drivers that we've articulated, whether it's cloud-optimized silicon, switching, electro-optics, things like that in the data center, 5g, obviously, continued momentum there with additional regions like india ramping next year plus content gain rolling through and then automotive continuing to grow. so, those are all the positives. what we don't know completely, but i'll give you the best color i can is on the base business and how much of the inventory correction we're going to be dealing with and the magnitude of that. we anticipate, first of all, that that's like typical cycles.
it's probably a couple of quarters to work its way through. and the three areas i would call out that probably are some offsets next year are, one, would be in consumer. that's an area where we just haven't put a lot of investment. we've been typically running that business for cash.
you'll probably see some decline there. i think on-premise data center is another area. the on-prem stuff probably has work to do next year. and then maybe a little bit in our wired infrastructure business.
if you look, actually, it's kind of interesting, if you go back to our fiscal '22 and you look at those three areas, they all grew pretty dramatically in fiscal '23, the current year we're in. and so, at a high level, i think some of those are probably going to trend back to where they were before this big upcycle. and again, from a sort of a timing perspective, think of it as a lot of that headwind or weakness more in the first half, inventory works itself through, and then you have growth back off of that, plus you have the growth drivers kicking in. so, i think it's a very different story, most likely first half versus second half.
but those are some of the moving pieces in terms of how you think about the growth drivers versus some of the offsets. but we do see -- we still believe we can drive positive year-over-year growth. it just certainly isn't going to be as high as we had been hoping for if you went back even three months ago, just given the magnitude of some of the inventory adjustments.
operator
our next question comes from timothy arcuri with ubs. please go ahead.
timothy arcuri -- ubs -- analyst
thanks a lot. matt, just along the same lines of that question. i'm just kind of wondering if you can help us figure out what a reasonable baseline is in the data center business headed into next year. if you look at storage, i mean, it must be down about 50% sequentially in january, and you were obviously over-shipping the past few quarters and you're really under-shipping now.
but it seems like if you net all that out, maybe it's kind of the $600 million per quarter baseline in data center, and then you can add the $400 million for the cloud-optimized silicon next year. can you sort of help us handicap what a normalized run rate might be in that business? thanks.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. first, i think you're in the ballpark on storage. and just for a little context, the magnitude of that decline, we can't find a data point that shows it declining that quickly. even when we look back to the reset in 2019, this is down a lot more than that in the same time frame.
so, you're right, a lot has come out, and so that needs to normalize. i think you've probably got the math about right if you think about sort of where is the base business at. but just to be clear, we're still in a little bit of a dynamic environment figuring out where this is going to bottom out. but if you look at how fast it's coming down, and that's kind of what we're doing, by the way, we're effectively working with our customers to make sure we deal with this quickly and efficiently and minimize any risk of building excess inventory.
and that's the path we're on. so, sometime in the q4, q1 timeframe, we think that works itself through, and then you start to kind of grow from there. but that's probably reasonable. probably is an annualized type of run rate, maybe a little bit lower in the first half and certainly higher in the second half as the new designs really ramp up.
timothy arcuri -- ubs -- analyst
yeah, got it. i guess just maybe trying to -- i was just trying to get -- to hold people's hands a little bit on the nonstorage stuff because people will say, well, the issue is not just storage. the issue is the other stuff, too, but it sounds like it's not.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
it's -- there is some. i mean, just to be very, very clear, right? the major reason code for the sequential decline from q3 to q4 in the data center line is storage, but there is inventory adjustment going on in digestion given that slope of the capex curve has just come down. there is some realignment. but that is not as pronounced, and it's very manageable.
but i just -- i want to be very clear, it's not 100% storage issue. there's just a broader digestion.
timothy arcuri -- ubs -- analyst
of course. yeah. thank you.

our next question comes from toshiya hari with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
toshiya hari -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. thanks so much for taking the question. matt, if we take your guidance for the carrier infrastructure business in q4, i think you'll be doing about $1.1 billion in revenue in the full year, maybe a little bit below that.
to level set us, how much of that is wireless? how much of that is wired? and as you look forward into fiscal year '24, how are you thinking about the 5g business? i think the market, overall, you're seeing some spots of softness potentially, but obviously, you've got idiosyncratic design wins. so, how are you thinking about your business there? and then on the wired side, just given the cyclical dynamics, what sort of decline should we be expecting into fiscal '24? thank you.
jean hu -- chief financial officer
toshiya, this is jean. i'll start to answer this question, and then matt can add. so, first, on the carrier infrastructure, wireless is already more than half. we talk about the wireless revenues already running, had more than $600 million annualized run rate.
so, wireless is definitely small than half. going into next year, as matt mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong 5g adoption and our customers continue to do very well in the marketplace. so, we do expect the wireless part of the business will continue to have a very strong growth into next year. of course, the wireline side is what matt discussed.
we are going to see some headwinds on wireline side. but overall, we do expect the carrier infrastructure to continue to grow. matt, anything you want to add?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
no, i think that was perfect. i mean, i just put a pin on it that the wireless opportunity continues to be very exciting, and i think it's going to be a very good year for wireless next year.
toshiya hari -- goldman sachs -- analyst

our next question comes from karl ackerman with bnp paribas. please go ahead.
karl ackerman -- exane bnp paribas -- analyst
yes. thank you. two questions if i may. matt or jean, i wanted to first discuss enterprise networking.
you spoke about how china impacts that a little bit. but ex-china, are you still seeing growth? and i know some of your networking oems have spoken about some moderating orders. but i think last quarter, you said that this segment was an area that was most constrained. and so, i want to get -- clarify if that's still true.
and if you could kind of tie in the amount of inventory that some of those customers have to get a better sense of the demand dynamic of enterprise networking going into fiscal '24? thanks.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i'll make a few comments. and then, jean, why don't you add as well? yes, a couple of things are going on. one is the supply environment has definitely improved.
now some of that is because of the weakness in the china market that's opened up supply, we can give to other customers. because generally, outside of a few select cases, our enterprise business is mostly merchant products. these would be ethernet switches, gigabit, multi-gigabit phys, embedded processors, karl, things like that. so, when you would have a demand softness in one region, you know, that helps things.
so, the supply situation has improved, which is a good thing. we do have some of our own growth drivers as well. we've highlighted this over the last few quarters. we have some new custom silicon wins that are ramping up.
that's offsetting some of that weakness as well. but in general, the non-china piece has done ok. it probably -- we're being cautious about how we think about it for next year. so, i think the run rate that we've guided to in q4 is probably a safe run rate to think about for next year.
even if there's a little bit of weakness or there is some inventory digestion that goes on. we do have content gains still rolling through. and so, those are some of the moving pieces. you basically have china going down, u.s.
customers where we've got either new design wins or share gain or content gain. and so, it sort of all aligns to the numbers where we've guided for q4. jean, anything you want to add?
jean hu -- chief financial officer
no.
karl ackerman -- exane bnp paribas -- analyst
got it. no, that's helpful, matt. maybe just as a quick follow-up. i was wondering as you think about some of the inventory digestion that needs to occur across some end markets, as you contemplate that and plan with your foundry suppliers for next year, is there -- could you just maybe just talk about some of the discussions you're having in terms of the ability to perhaps limit some of the cost inflation from the foundry side and whether that -- if they can share that cost with you going forward such that perhaps less of an onerous task for you to pass it along to your end customers.
thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i would say if you -- without getting into the specifics of each of the input costs that we deal with, i would say that in general, with supply loosening up, that's going to be a positive. i'd say that being said, we have -- there are areas that are still constrained. there's still inflationary aspects inside our supply chain that sort of are coming toward us.
we're doing what we can to mitigate those. and to the extent we can't mitigate those, we're going to continue to do what we've been doing for the last few years, which is basically pass it on in a generally margin-neutral type of manner. and we found a way to do that, and we'll continue to do that. but certainly, the marvell team and the operations team has worked aggressively over the last few years, particularly on the packaging back end, etc., to enable more sources to set up more strategic agreements.
and so, we're kind of working on both sides. one is to just do our job as a good supplier and manage the cost base. but to the extent we can't, there will be probably a little bit of inflation still in the system. that's sort of how we're looking at it.
we formed really strategic partnerships with these companies. we have a very transparent communication with them on the demand environment. and, you know, i'd say that we're counting on them to work with us as partners as we manage through what looks like an overall, you know, semiconductor down cycle.
karl ackerman -- exane bnp paribas -- analyst

our next question comes from gary mobley with wells fargo. please go ahead.
gary mobley -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my question. i had a question that kind of picks up on the last topic, and that is your purchase obligations. i know you haven't filed your 10-q yet, but as i looked at the last your purchase obligations are expected to be about 25% of your cost of goods sold next year.
and so, given the current market softness, do you anticipate being able to utilize all that? do you anticipate the possibility of any sort of inventory write-down? thank you.
jean hu -- chief financial officer
gary, this is jean. thank you for the question. so, yeah, the purchasing obligation we have this quarter will not change much from the last 10-q we filed. it's about $3.2 billion.
but just remember, those purchase agreement, it's really for long term. on average, it's between four to 10 years. and also, our products are very complex and a lot of them have a very long manufacturing cycle. so, we actually need a dedicated capacity for those complex products to support our customers, single cells, the customer, large volume, last long time.
regardless of the economic environment, we need those dedicated capacity. and frankly, our team has been very thoughtful. we only secure the capacity largely in back end and the substrate for portion of what we need. so, we feel quite comfortable.
we don't have the issues on the purchase agreement obligations or have to write off any capacity. that's not something we anticipate at all.
gary mobley -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thank you.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
and, gary, i would just add. i'd say that if you look at the bundle of the different obligations we have, some of them are in the shorter term, which are in the form of things like prepays and others, where, as we take the capacity, we actually get it back. the lta take-or-pay portion is actually not very large relative to the total. and as jean said, the most strategic aspect of this is really in the most advanced technologies, especially in complex substrates and high-end packaging, which we absolutely need to secure because of the volume that we're going to be ramping in the next few years.
i mean, just take the -- as one example, the $800 million of incremental cloud-optimized silicon wins. that all is five-nanometer technology using advanced abs substrates, very customized packaging. those agreements to get that capacity from really the best vendors, you need to put that in place literally years in advance. and so, we've done those types of things, and we feel good about that because they're tied directly to committed programs.
so, as jean said, overall, while we have obligations, we think they're actually a benefit to us, and it certainly helps us underwrite our future success. and we're able to send a strong message to our customers about how we're able to provide the necessary capacity and supply chain for them -- for their future.
gary mobley -- wells fargo securities -- analyst

our next question comes from ross seymore with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
ross seymore -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks for letting me ask a question. i guess kind of a two-parter going back to the data center side, matt. could you just level set us, what percentage of the third quarter data center business was storage? and then looking forward on the more kind of constructive side of things, what's your confidence level on that $400 million in incremental cloud-optimized revenue growth next year? given the fact that you talked about a deceleration in what's happening at the cloud customers themselves, are you at all worried about that $400 million being something less than that or being pushed out? is that at all a level of conservatism that we should consider?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
sure. yeah. let me answer the second one first. the answer is we feel very good about that revenue stream.
part of it is, if you remember, ross, we went from talking about the $400 million and $800 million to actually talking about, call it, $400-plus million $800-plus million because we had gotten additional design wins that created a little bit of a buffer as well because i think even if we hedge it for next year and the volumes don't quite achieve what we would have thought, we actually had one additional business that gives us some comfort around that. but i would say all the programs are on track. we are fortunate that despite the changing environment, i would say we are absolutely head down in trying to take out multiple new products right now that need to ramp up in very significant volume next year. and i'm personally involved in these with our customers to ensure we're meeting their schedule, and we're doing everything possible to get there.
so, that's the good news that the programs are still on track. and i think that's a good thing. the percentage -- i think your other question was, what was the percentage of data center revenue that's in storage?
ross seymore -- deutsche bank -- analyst
well, other way around, if storage falling is the headwind for data center, just to level set people, you had 30% roughly of your business in storage or in data center?
jean hu -- chief financial officer
yeah. ross, maybe i can help you. yeah, i can help you with that. in general, the way to think about this, our storage business, it's probably about one-third of the data center -- total data center business; average, right, not a particular quarter.
but of course, when we go through the inventory correction, as matt mentioned earlier, that's going to be the largest drop piece for the inventory correction.
ross seymore -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from harlan sur with jpmorgan. please go ahead.
harlan sur -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for taking my question. matt, you talked about the impact on a more muted cloud capex spend on your overall data center business. most pronounced in storage, but you do have compute, you've got networking, you've got optical products as well.
and looking specifically at your cloud optical connectivity segment, which obviously is pam4 dsp, your color solution. if i look back at the last cloud spending slowdown, which was in 2019, both of these segments combined grew about 35%, 40%, right? granted, this was still in the early innings of the 200, 400 gig upgrade cycle. but part of it is also very strategic in nature because your customers are still trying to enable better performance through higher networking speeds. so, i guess kind of two questions.
near term, is the team dealing with inventory issues in these particular optical products? and then looking into next year and the team see continued growth in cloud optical?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. great. thanks, harlan, for the question. and you're right, it is a little bit of a different situation than a few years ago where that was fairly nascent technology, really ramping up hard in an inflection curve.
that being said, we still see strong adoption of 800 gig. we've seen strong momentum in 400zr in the new platform. and we expect that, you know, overall optics is going to grow, you know, next year. that being said, i would say, you know, in the fourth quarter, part of the adjustment would be in that area.
but i think that's a shorter-term thing. and again, because to your point, it's so strategic, we anticipate that optics is going to continue to grow. and by the way, we're heads down on new product development there as well because, for the next generation of high-end 51.2t switches, you're going to need the associated optics with that, which then moves from 800 gigabits per second to 1.6 terabits per second. and so, that's an ongoing new product development activity we have.
so, lots of activity in that area. super exciting, but it's a little bit of a different environment than 2019 just because there has been more broad adoption, but we do feel good about it.
harlan sur -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
thanks, matt.

our next question comes from c.j. muse with evercore. please go ahead.
c.j. muse -- evercore isi -- analyst
yeah. good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. i guess, matt, i was hoping to spend a little bit of time on the enterprise networking side of the house, roughly $1.4 billion business for the fiscal year. and you talked about a china slowdown.
is there a way to kind of parse between china and non-china and how you're thinking about the trajectory into january and all of calendar '23?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. that's a good question. the -- as we indicated, china is down a lot, right, in q4 from where it was just two quarters ago. that may end up being a little bit a little bit of an overcorrection.
it's hard to tell, quite frankly, on what's going on there and how long that's going to last and how that ripples through. the non-china has been holding up very well. again, i'd say based on the content gains we have, as well as the -- just the new products that are ramping up with higher asps. and so, that's sort of offsetting it to some extent.
what we are guiding for q4, enterprise networking overall, it's still down just because of the china factor. but i'd say if i had to handicap it for next year, non-china will be a bigger percentage of the total in fiscal '24 than china. but i don't have the exact numbers at the tip of my fingers here. a lot of this goes through the channel and other -- it's -- yeah, i just don't have those numbers in front of me.
c.j. muse -- evercore isi -- analyst

our next question comes from christopher rolland with susquehanna. please go ahead.
christopher rolland -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for the question. i wanted to follow up on carrier infrastructure as well. so, a couple of things.
i guess, first of all, your agreement with nokia and the extension there. i was wondering if there's any economics associated with that. and then secondly, looking out into next year, there's a lot more talk about india, 5g, nokia winning, samsung winning there as well. what does the opportunity look like there for growth? is this going to be sizable overall? thanks.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, chris. on the nokia front, again, it was great to see us being able to announce with them our layer-2 transport processor. recall the initial engagement with them, which was very successful, and it's great to see how well they did was on the layer-1 baseband processor.
and that -- i think that partnership has led to now a broader engagement. and so, as you probably know, you followed the space, the layer-2 transport or cpu is a critical component, right, with fairly meaningful content as you sort of roll forward. so, i think that's all very positive. and on india, that -- they seem to be gearing up for a very aggressive rollout next year.
and i think, to your point, a few of our key customers are well-positioned to take advantage of that ramp. and so, that's why we said earlier, we feel really good about wireless next year, i think both on sort of our content gains, as well as our -- but probably, even more, the regional deployments. and i think india probably will be sizable would be my guess.
christopher rolland -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
thanks, matt.

our next question comes from tore svanberg with stifel. please go ahead.
tore svanberg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yes. thank you. and if you don't mind, i'm going to ask a question that's not related to the next two quarters. and it does have two parts.
so, first of all, the uci-express standard is that something that could potentially accelerate the adoption of cxl. the reason i'm asking is because, last time on the call, you talked about maybe cxl not contributing to revenues probably for the few years, but there does seem to be a lot of activity here that could potentially pull that timeline in a little bit.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think the cxl timing, a lot of that is going to be gated tory by the server cpu cycle. and i think companies are gearing up for that. it may have gotten lost in the noise, but we did call out and i called out in my prepared remarks that we had received a pretty significant design win in this area, which we're now well underway in terms of product development.
and then i'd say there's a very large pipeline of semi-custom products behind that, as well as a merchant product. so, i think that activity is still -- level of activity is very high with our customers. but i wouldn't -- i don't have visibility to any sort of change in terms of when those products would ramp necessarily. but it's a very strategic new area for us.
and i'd say we continue to be focused on building a leadership position there. a lot of these products, especially as you get into the larger pooling devices, accelerators, these are, in some cases, have multicore cpu. they're in five-nanometer. they have security features.
there's quite a few things that we're adding. and so, these are looking more and more like very customized socs, which then enable these customers to really take advantage of completely new architectures relative to how they interface their cpu, gpu, xpu, whatever you want to call it, asic with memory. and so, i think that's going to continue to be a very strategic area of focus. and getting a large win committed and underway is a really good thing.
tore svanberg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. and the second part of the question was related to your new product, and you did mention this earlier. so, aec, when should we expect marvell to get some revenue contribution from aec? is that also sort of a few years out? or could you already start to see some revenues next year?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
i think we need to let that one play out a little bit, tore. we're taking that one step at a time. i think the milestone really was lining over the last year, really getting our solution designed in across a broad array of high-volume proven cable suppliers to the largest hyperscale companies, and we've done a great job there. and we've now started sampling those, and we have a very high level of interest.
but at this juncture, we haven't really sized exactly our opportunity and the timing. but we'll do that in due course as we get better visibility to the take up of our customers that are competing in this market. but that trend is very real. the aec trend is anyway.
and we hope to be an important part of it.
tore svanberg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
very good. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from ambrish srivastava with bmo. please go ahead.
ambrish srivastava -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you. i just wanted to come back to the clarification for jean. looking at the data center business and the storage component in the last quarter that you reported that segment before changing the reporting, i see $300 million without inphi and then you had given a number of $340 million with inphi. and the number you just cited, a third of the recent quarter, it seems really low.
that would mean $190 million, $200 million number rounding up. is there something i'm missing there or a large chunk of that is now in some other business?
jean hu -- chief financial officer
yeah. yeah. maybe. let me just recap and clarify.
i think before we change the reporting, our storage business annualized run rate is about $1.4 billion. so, that's what you are mentioning before we change the reporting by end market. that's what our overall storage business. just as a reminder, it includes flash controller preamp and also fiber channel.
so, it's all the different storage product lines included there. and over time, the storage has come down. the number i mentioned, one-third, is not a particular last quarter. you know, generally, when you look at several quarters, on average, it's one-third.
the first half definitely is much higher and now it's much lower, right? when you think about $1.4 billion storage revenue i'm talking about, about 60% is in data center. that's what we told investors during our investor day. so, hope that's how you clarify different pieces.
ambrish srivastava -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yeah. no, it does. so, that means it's come down from $1.4 billion annual run rate to $800 million, right?
jean hu -- chief financial officer
i don't think the way you can think about that. it's $1.4 billion. the first half of this year, it probably was much higher than $1.4 billion annualized run rate. and now it's dropping much lower, right? the second half of the run rate probably is very low.
yeah.
ambrish srivastava -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
got it. ok. ok. that is very helpful.
then i had a follow-up for you, matt. looking at storage, and i don't follow the disk drive guys, but seagate consensus has been down three quarters in a row wd, two quarters for the mass storage business. and then you throw in the bullwhip effect. so, you're seeing a much bigger impact than consensus has those guys modeled.
is that the right way in terms of timing a couple of quarters before this business comes back? and then the other businesses within data center that -- thanks for the clarification earlier, and that it's not just storage. when do those businesses -- because that magnitude is less, right, in terms of no real bullwhip effect yet. so, if you combine all that, should we be modeling past december, a couple of quarters of sequential declines?
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, let me break that into two pieces. i think you absolutely nailed it when you talked about the end customer kind of dynamics and their trajectory versus ours, that is exactly the bullwhip effect. i mean, you could actually just draw the bullwhip, and you can kind of slap where we would be on that.
and that's why -- and we've seen this historically in any business where you're kind of one additional step removed, you tend to have more volatility, right? it's just the way it works. so, that, i think, you can expect. and again, we don't know exactly, but we anticipate just on past experience, it's probably a couple of quarters to work through that. and then on the other piece, which was the nonstorage piece, yes, it's inventory digestion.
i mean, we've kind of taken a view, ambrish, which is -- and i've been through different scenarios in my career here on how you manage when volume -- when demand drops, and you can kind of work with people and manage a soft landing or you can keep shipping and then you pay the price later in a very hard way. and so, our view has been, let's get through this and get it behind us. and also get to a point where, as you can -- as you get your visibility up and inventory goes down and lead times turn to normal, your forecast accuracy improves. i mean, i think, you know, that old adage is, well, you know, the worst forecast you're going to get is if somebody gives you 52 weeks of orders, you're actually better off having a more normalized environment.
so, that's really what we're striving to do there. and so, while there is some inventory adjustment, it's fairly normal given the shift in slope in the capex trajectory. and we have new products ramping. and so, that probably works its way through fairly quickly as well.
but we'll have to see the exact timeframe. like i said, it's still a little bit of a dynamic environment.
ambrish srivastava -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yeah. thank you for being super transparent about it.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
no problem. ashish, do we have time for one more? should i just wrap it up with some closing comments?
ashish saran -- vice president, investor relations
yeah. go ahead. wrap it up, matt. thanks.
matt murphy -- president and chief executive officer
perfect. yeah. well, thanks, everybody, for all the questions. just a little bit of a few comments as we close here.
look, first, i think q3 was a great quarter for us. i mean, we're in the middle of a pretty severe macroeconomic environment. a lot of other companies have obviously seen some of this inventory digestion and impact earlier. but in q3, we delivered record revenue, very strong operating margins.
even if you look at the fourth quarter guide and you kind of compare our second half of this year to a year ago, we're up about 15%. and when you look at sort of the rest of the market, take sort of large digital peers, that peer group is down about 5%. so, we still think even with a softer q4 guide, we continue to perform very well from a top-line perspective. i'd say also we've been disciplined on managing expenses.
the pro forma fy '23 will grow about 28%. and if you look at our opex increase, it's about 14%. so, we've been basically growing operating expenses at about half the rate of revenue growth. and we've been able to put together a world-class team, as a result, to execute on these massive design wins we've gotten over the last few years.
and so, while we're going to be disciplined in our spending, and jean sort of gave you the model on opex. we feel very good about the size of the team, the resources we have, and the ability to execute, which our customers are counting on. and i believe if we do that, there's even more to come. so, in conclusion, we continue to have the right strategy with really strong partnerships with key customers.
we think we're in the right markets. and the growth drivers of cloud, 5g wireless communications, and automotive continue to be three of the largest growth opportunities in the semiconductor industry, and marvell is extremely well positioned there. so, thanks for all the questions. i'm sure we can be more helpful in the callbacks as well.
there's a lot of moving pieces. but thank you so much for your time today.
