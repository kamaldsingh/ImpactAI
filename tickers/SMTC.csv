(operator instructions) and your first question comes from the line of karl ackerman with cowen.
karl ackerman -- cowen & company -- analyst
hi, good afternoon everyone. thanks for taking my question. emeka or mohan, perhaps to start off with -- i'd like to focus on your lora business. what percent of your lora business today is from your own chip sales versus licensing or royalty revenue from third-party chip sales by your analog and mixed signal partners? and i guess as we contemplate your revenue funnel ramping from here, what's the right way to think about the mix of royalty revenue versus your own chip sales? i mean, we of course commensurate rate impact on your margin goals. thank you.
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so, karl, pretty much most of the revenue is going to come from our chip sales for the next couple of years, and chips for both end nodes and for gateways. and then i think as the -- from a licensing standpoint, the licensing royalties from partners will start to pick up over the next few years, i would say still we'll take another couple of years. and then microservices revenues will start to -- start to increase next year, and as i said, i think, i think a few years for that to really become material, but initially, at least for the next couple of years, i think it's still predominately chip sales both end nodes and gateway sales.
karl ackerman -- cowen & company -- analyst
i appreciate that, if i could ask one more question. clearly the revenue headwind from huawei and the inventory overhang -- ensure your customers is impacting your margins near-term. however, you've spoken on this call about a recovery in the second half, so how should we think about the progression toward your long-term 34% operating margin target? i guess, is there a certain revenue level we need to achieve that, or are there certain efficiency programs and product mix that should help us attain that goal? thank you.
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so karl, thank you. i think we've stated before that a lot of the path to the midpoint of the device operating margin range is going to be driven by top line growth. we've done really a very good job of managing our operating expenses and our gross margin, so really very stable. we've also indicated in the past, that we would expect to see about $750 million to $800 million of annual revenue for us to get to that mid-point of that range. so that's, that is how we -- we look at it at this point, better clearly the top line growth is going to be the key driver in that leverage expansion.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
and karl if you look back at q3 of fy '19, we had essentially 30% operating margins, so that's kind of the range of revenue that we need to get to.

and your next question comes from the line of harsh kumar with piper jaffray.
harsh kumar -- piper jaffray -- analyst
yeah, hey guys. first of all very good execution, and very good commentary in light of all this macro weakness. mohan, i'm going to put you on the spot, the last earnings call, i think you mentioned you're looking for a pretty kind of a steep hockey stick like, you might not have used that term but a pretty steep ramp in the second half. i'm curious with another quarter under your belt and given what all you're seeing in china on macro level. what would be a best guess if you want to just give some color around how you expect the second half to go?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, harsh. i think, if absent the huawei ban, i would still be suggesting that bookings are strong. we have seen china weak for a couple of quarters now, but demand is picking up. our lora business is going great. we see data center demand starting to inventory levels as i mentioned on the call, starting to become more in line and we start seeing a pickup in orders on the data center side. so if i look across the different end markets and product lines, i think the second half is still looking quite strong. for us obviously the huawei ban puts a little bit of a spanner in that works and we have to work through that, both the direct impact and also the indirect impact. but absent that, i would suggest that the second half is still looking to be quite strong relative to the first half, sure anyway.
harsh kumar -- piper jaffray -- analyst
very good. and then mohan, if i can ask you, this huawei which is one animal that you don't have control over. but i'm still curious, i mean you're booking sound really good. i was curious if you could differentiate or comment on bookings out of china ex-huawei or outside of huawei and provide us any color. are you still seeing -- having or slackness there? or are you seeing a flat out ramp ex-huawei in china?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
well excluding huawei, which is obviously it's a big part of it, china demand. but excluding huawei, i would say that china demand has been soft for the last couple of quarters and we're starting to see some improvements in that area. so that's kind of promising, of course with all of the uncertainty associated with the tariffs and now huawei, how long that can be sustained? i don't know, but at least from that perspective that's what we've been seeing, a little bit of a pickup in the rest of the china demand, like in china industrial -- in some of those other use cases.
harsh kumar -- piper jaffray -- analyst
hey, just one last quick one, the $450 million funnel for lora, is that including the $100 million you expect from services or excluding that?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
we don't have any services at the moment in there, harsh. the way we look at opportunities and the way we have measured our pipeline, these are real proof-of-concepts and real opportunities that our customers are working on. now with the geo location, we've just announced that service. so we now have customers who are starting to look at that. i would say that is in addition to the $450 million, plus $200 million pipeline.
harsh kumar -- piper jaffray -- analyst
thanks guys.
sandy harrison -- director of business, finance and investor relations
thank you.

and your next question comes from quinn bolton with needham & company.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
hey guys, wanted to just first ask on the huawei exposure. can you give us some sense sort of where you're exposed across signal integrity, protection, wireless and sensing, and specifically is there any exposure to huawei on the lora business? and then i've got a follow up on the data center side of the business.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
so, first of all on the lora business, there is no exposure to huawei, huawei is actually one of the key proponents of nb-iot, so it's really a competitor to the lora solution. most of our exposure, quinn, is on the signal integrity product side, i would say on the pon base station side, those two areas. and then, there is some exposure on the protection side for smartphones for huawei, that's predominantly where the exposure is. we don't see much exposure anywhere else.
and there is both a direct and an indirect exposure. so the direct exposure is what we ship directly to huawei and through hisilicon, and then the indirect is really through other module companies. and also when huawei can't get components to build its system which we learned from the zte ban, a year ago, that could have a negative impact on us. so that we've tried to quantify that as best we can, obviously they're all estimates and approximations until we really see what happens through the quarter, but it gives you an idea.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
and then, i know you're not guiding beyond the july quarter, but if i just look at the ban that went into effect may 21st, you might have been able to ship approximately three weeks before huawei went to a ban. so, if we're trying to think about what the huawei impact for future quarters might be, if there is no resolution, would a full quarter effect be more likely in the say $8 million to $9 million range, is that a good ballpark for a full quarter basis?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we think between $6 million and $10 million is a good range. that's what we see today, obviously we'll learn a lot over the next quarter, but that's kind of what we're projecting.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
great. and then on the data center business, in the script you mentioned receiving the largest order in the company's history for the clearedge 25 gig cdrs from a north american data center customer. just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on that application, i assume that's probably for a cwdm for 100 gig module type application. but just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on that design wins or that order?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
well other than the 100-gig cwdm4, and that it is a north american data center customer, that pretty much nails it right. quinn, i think, i can't really give you a lot more color other than this is a customer that has been looking at pam4 solutions and other solutions and decided some of the optics weren't ready and concluded that it's going to stick with nrz module for now.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
great. okay. thank you.
operator
and your next question is from gary mobley with wells fargo securities.
gary mobley -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for taking my question. great to be on the call for the first time. a question about huawei. i appreciate the fact that, certainly shock to the supply chain, a shock to semtech and certainly it takes what $7 million of revenue away from the second quarter. but presumably at some point someone is going to pick up the slack of huawei can't ship and somebody on the android smartphone front will pick up the slack, somebody on the 5g base station infrastructure might pick up the slack. and then (inaudible) perhaps on the pon side you might pick up some share. so how are you positioned with the alternatives to huawei and how do you see sort of the shock huawei going away in transition to other customers?
sandy harrison -- director of business, finance and investor relations
yeah, that's a good question gary. i think first of all we are well positioned with most of the other players in these segments. but until we see the orders, until we see the demand it's very difficult to anticipate what will happen. in zte's case, you use example where they initially thought that they were going to be able to build a system, then they realized they couldn't build a system and then it wasn't until they started to realize -- short of some components or some part of the system that their customers started to look at alternative solution providers. and then we started to see orders being picked up from other places. so i think we're in good shape but we just don't know and until we see that material orders coming in, we just can't make that assumption right.
gary mobley -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
okay. so your opex guidance for the second quarter appears to be flat-to-down slightly and flat for the overall year. and it appears as though you're managing opex by just simply having less bonus accruals perhaps and maybe some other items. but is there any consideration to maybe being a little more streamlined on some r&d activities maybe making some deeper cuts to opex to get back to the target operating margin level or is this just going to be top line recovery story?
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so gary, i think, i think it's just going to be a top line recovery story, so you haven't been hearing the past, when we had much higher levels of operating expenses. we've already done a lot of things that you've talked about. we've pruned a lot of our expenses, we've already forecast our strategy in some areas and making sure that we're focusing on product areas that are very high levels of return on investment. so having said that, we know about 20% of product expenses is still variable, but like you did say, a lot of that is tied on new supplemental compensation. so we do have some room in terms of what we can do. but clearly the runaway that we used to having it in past is no longer as much as what we used to have. so the other point i'd add to that is that, most of our investments are platform type of investments so we're investing for the next generation of lora platform, the next generation 400-gig optical platforms for next generation of protection platforms, so they -- not investments that -- are short term in nature. most of our investments are much more strategic.
gary mobley -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
okay. thank you, guys.

your next question comes from mitch steves with rbc capital markets.
mitch steves -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for taking my questions, i had two. so first on the kind of focus on the gross margin lines, since huawei doesn't really have the high end lora product, does that assume that or should we assume that gross margins improve sequentially starting in july to october to january?
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well we doesn't have any lora revenues at all. so i'm trying to understand the connection between huawei and lora gross margin.
mitch steves -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
so if you have no huawei...
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
mitch -- no mitch, most of that huawei business is pon, base station and smartphone related.
mitch steves -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yeah. that's my point right. so basically we know that there is no high end -- high margin business there, so does that mean the gross margins go up october to january?
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, i think we just have to see how everything comes into mix. what we've said in the past is that we expect our gross margins to be stable. we will expect it to have a little bit of an upward bias but we'll have to see how everything comes in before we know exactly what happens with gross margin. but the expectation here is that our gross margins will be stable forward.
mitch steves -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. yeah. and the second question is just kind of on the china exposure. so we kind of get the hallway number kind of 6%, right? but if i look at the china exposure to asia to show -- you're showing like 70% but that to shift two number. is there any way to at least give us qualitatively what the actual -- official sale to china is, versus just 78% (ph) asia pacific number you guys gave out?
sandy harrison -- director of business, finance and investor relations
yeah, so all we said mitch is that, our shipments to china overall about the 50%, 55% flat range. and we've said on prior calls that if you look at that as to what's actually probably consumed in china, it's probably closer to the mid-30% or upper-30% range.
mitch steves -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. perfect. thank you.
operator
and your next question comes from craig ellis with b. riley fbr.
craig ellis -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
yeah. thanks for taking the question. mohan, i wanted to ask you a longer-term question, and i know it's an environment where we've got limited visibility, but the question's intent is really understanding better some of the company's specific drivers that exist in the portfolio. so harsh ask you about the second half, my question really ties back to some of your comments on signal integrity data center business and the business more broadly sounds alike. there is a pam4 and a pmd product ramp coming as we head into calendar '20, fiscal '21. the question beyond that is, what do you see in the rest of the business that you're excited about -- that's driving semtech's grow as we look beyond what is clearly a cyclical and trade dispute characterized year, this year.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think craig, first of all just on the sip business, on the signal integrity products business, obviously we have the 100 gig to 400 gig growth. we also have the aptovision, pro av, video-over-ip technology that we have -- believe that's got good future growth. and then, outside signal integrity product group -- growth engines, of course we have lora which is really doing quite well, continues to grow. and i think we'll largely continue to grow regardless of the type of geographical issues we're seeing because it's really tied to iot which is really tied to efficiency improvements, and just brought up cost reductions and things like that, just the whole growth of iot is driving that.
so we think that, that's going to continue for many years, obviously that's very exciting for us. the proximity sensing is tied to regulatory -- global regulatory requirements for managing radio power and devices. so we think that will continue to grow. and as i mentioned in protection, our business of industrial kind of driven strategy now versus the -- just pure consumer and consumer driven strategy. i think is really quite exciting because we see more advanced lithography devices going into -- more systems outside just smartphones and handhelds and consumer devices and so into automotive, into communications equipment, into iot. and those require kind of high end protection that we deliver.
so, we have a number of different growth drivers that are really independent of whatever is going on in china, independent of the huawei ban, that i think are going to continue to allow us to drive good growth in the future.
craig ellis -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
that's helpful, and then the follow up question is just on lora. if my tally was correct, as you walk through the different milestones it seems like the business is performing to all five milestones that you talked about on the last call. one of the things you pointed to was an increase in lora's business mix outside of china this year. one is that, still the expectation. and two, any further color on just milestones and how you're thinking about the company's progress?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so first of all, it is the expectation that we will start to get a little bit more balanced geographically. but i will tell you, our china lora business is going very, very well. so it's a question of, can the other regions continue to outgrow what's happening in china. and so i think that we have good momentum. we look at all these metrics not just for the purpose of -- do we -- is the business going in the right direction. but what things we need to do in the business to accelerate in certain areas, certain bottlenecks and that's one of the reasons i pointed out that we've made a conscious decision to invest in and enhance the ability for our customers to accelerate their time to market from going -- from a proof-of-concept to actually having deployment, that means more software, more designed tools, more reference designs, having a better availability of partners, developer platforms and things like that. and so we put a lot of emphasis on that. i think we'll continue to see that this year. and i think that the momentum, as i said is the opportunity pipeline has increased still further which is great news for us. and i think if we can start to move some of that pipeline to revenue over the next year and a half year, i think we'll be in very good shape.
craig ellis -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
thanks, mohan.
operator
and your next question comes from tore sandberg (ph) with stifel.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
yes. thank you. first of all a question back to huawei. so it sounds like $6 million to $10 million, if i look at your 10 -- your last queue, it says, it's about $21 million. so should we just assume that half of that was kind of just inventory build and it's more the run rate that's going to be $6 million to $10 million going forward?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, that's correct tore. it was clear that and i mentioned it on my script that huawei built inventory mostly for the smartphone business in q1 which definitely inflated that q1 number. they may even have built up some inventory from q3 or q4 of last year, more tied to the pon and base station business. but yeah, i definitely think that the run rate number you should look at it, is a run rate number, the $10 million.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
yeah, thanks for clarifying that. as a follow up, you guided the wireless and sensing business to be flat sequentially. so i assume that means maybe some of the smartphone business is going to be down, so lora will actually grow sequentially?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
that's correct, yeah. yeah. the proximity sensing was one of the areas that we believe we always built inventories in q1 and so that will be down in q2 and lora is expected to have very good growth in q2.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
great. just one last question. you said data center bookings are improving and you talked about that one win, but is this broad based enough now where maybe data center could actually grow sequentially in the july quarter?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
data centers probably i think it's possible, i think it's probably more likely to be flat and then maybe start to increase in the second half. but we are seeing some good data points and some good bookings in this area.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
okay. that feels like that business has indeed bottomed here the last two quarters?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, it starting to feel that way.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
great. thank you very much, mohan.
operator
and your next question comes from rick schafer with oppenheimer.
rick schafer -- rick oppenheimer -- analyst
yeah, thanks. i just had a couple of questions. i guess the first one maybe a follow up on lora. mohan i think you've talked in the past, i think about lora potentially being a billion dollar type revenue stream looking forward three to five years, i guess. is that still a realistic target in your mind and then as part of that answer, curious when you see (inaudible) revenue crossover? you talked earlier about licensing versus a chip sales but sort of when do we see that kind of seesaw kind of crossover?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think let's take that one first. rick, i think next couple of years still it will be mostly chip revenues, i think. i would expect probably three years from now the royalties both from chip licensing and from services to start to kick in nicely. and then they will -- i expect those to accelerate quite quickly especially on the services side. and then coming back to the volume, the size of this business and how can you scale? one of the reasons i talk about these metrics and i point out for example the end of this fiscal year we expect to have 500,000 gateways out there, is because each one of those gateway supports certain number of sensors, and therefore the capacity to support 2 billion end nodes, and that 2 billion end nodes, if you translate to even at $0.50 an end node is a billion dollars, right? so to me i think it's a question of once the infrastructure is deployed, once the use cases are in place and once there is enough of a smooth runway from proof of concept to deployment, which is one of the things we're working on now. i just think it's a matter of time. and then a question of how many use cases and can some of them be very high volume, which i believe they can. i think we're starting to see a lot more use cases now, that are potentially very high volume, before it was more industrial in nature. and so now we're seeing more smart home, more smart enterprise and smart consumer, kind of things emerge as iot potential lora targets.
rick schafer -- rick oppenheimer -- analyst
got it. thanks. and then just another follow up on a data center. can you remind us what cdr attach or just what overall attach, whether we're talking about cdr, pmd attach looks like, at single lambda to 100g versus 25g? and maybe part of that answer just give us a sense of what semtech content can do?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
for cdrs, i mean for 100 gig, i think and above pretty much all of the modules we'll require some type of cdr functionality. and that's also true a base station, as we see base stations now starting to deploy faster optical links, we think most of those will also require cdr functions. so that's been our thesis for a while, and we are definitely seeing that happen.
rick schafer -- rick oppenheimer -- analyst
okay. can you talk about dollar content and maybe (inaudible)
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, it varies $5 to $10 i think on average, rick, depending on the type of module, pam4 versus nrz versus different regions. so it really varies but i think typically $5 to $10 of jsb (ph).
rick schafer -- rick oppenheimer -- analyst
great. thanks a lot.
operator
and your next question comes from christopher rolland with susquehanna.
christopher rolland -- susquehanna financial group -- analyst
hey guys, on inventories, if huawei doesn't come back, will these be fairly easy to shift to other customers? i mean you mentioned proximity sensing is a good demand there from other customers, and when my inventories normalize? thanks.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so most of our products are standard products, some of them are application specific, but they're not customer specific in general. there may be a couple of million dollars of inventory that might be targeted specifically for huawei, but in general i would say that they're -- for broader set of customers.
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. and chris i mean in terms of when inventory normalizes -- our expectation is that, beginning with q2, we expect to see the days of inventory coming down. and then in the next, like q3, especially if we see the uptick in revenue, in the top line that we're expecting, we should expect to see inventories come back down to our normal levels.
christopher rolland -- susquehanna financial group -- analyst
great. and then on the signal integrity side for base station in particular, can you guys talk about your exposure to the various oems outside of huawei, is it all huawei? what percentage of shipments here are not huawei, and how do you expect that to ramp through the year? thanks.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
we have good exposure to the customers, but the majority of the volume for us anyway so far has been driven by out of china. and so obviously huawei is the big guy there for us. we have exposure to other chinese base station manufacturers, and of course some of the european, but i would say the volume is driven mostly -- is for us, mostly out of huawei.
christopher rolland -- susquehanna financial group -- analyst
thanks guys.
operator
and your next question is from tristan gerra with baird.
tristan gerra -- robert w. baird -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. a question on lora, so obviously you guys have very good traction in industrial applications, that's including smart metering. what does it take for lora to gain momentum in the iot u.s. market. i mean we still see a lot of wifi and (inaudible) technologies in iot. is there kind of a catalyst that will create an inflection point for us to see more lora based iot devices in the u.s. mass market?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
it's a good question, tristan. i would say that a lot of the opportunities we have are in north america and some of them are high volume. so it is starting to emerge. i think the home is a important battleground for lora in the smart home, and i think that's one that we've just started to really spend some calories on understanding what it's going to take there. but some of our partners are helping us in that area.
and i think the other thing in the u.s. is, the u.s. has the large enterprise space in terms of smart buildings and smart asset tracking and logistics type of systems. and we are starting to learn more about how some of those systems and those verticals are going to use lora and how lora can really transform the way that those industries work and operate. and that's kind of part of what i said about, how it's important for us to understand the -- how these opportunities translate to your full proof of concepts and then how the proof of concepts move through to design wins and then through to revenue and understanding where the friction and where the bottlenecks are, and removing those. and some of those are software. for example, and some of those are applications, so we're learning more about that and i think that's part of the reason why you're seeing a lot of emphasis from us on the tools we're bringing to market to allow our customers to move faster through that process. and i think you're going to see north america over the next couple of years really become a very nice revenue driver for lora.
tristan gerra -- robert w. baird -- analyst
okay. and then as a quick follow up, so you've talked about lora revenue increasing sequentially in your guidance. and you've also talked about in general for your whole business about your initial expectation for the second half. so is it regarding lora specifically, would you say that for now, revenue striking about in line with normal seasonality? or is the restoration of your full year guidance embedding an expectation that your second half is going to need to be seasonally stronger than it's been in the past?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
definitely, the latter tristan. but i think, if you recall it's partly what i've been saying about china -- lora has been doing extremely well in china and we started to see that softness in q4. it's nothing related to iot or lora, it's really just a china demand softness issue for us. but we are starting to see signs of that's now picking up and then i think the second half we do expect it to be strong based on the metrics, i mean based on opportunities and design wins and real momentum we see now, how strong it's going to be, whether it's strong as we're expecting or whether it's going to push out to the following fiscal year. to me it really doesn't matter that much. i think it's more a question of the fact that once we have this momentum, there is going to be a catalyst at some point that takes this from being a $20 million, $30 million, $40 million a quarter run rate to $100 million a quarter run rate.
tristan gerra -- robert w. baird -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
and your next question comes from scott searle with roth capital.
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
hey, good afternoon thanks for taking my question. just a -- mohan to follow up on the lora front. i just wanted to clarify, i'm not sure if i heard it, were lora revenues up sequentially? and then the mix it sounds like china was a little seasonally weaker. is china less than 50% of the mix? and as part of that, looking out to the year, you're maintaining the guidance for the year of $100 million to $140 million. the metrics all seem like they're in line in terms of what you articulated a couple of months ago. so things seem like they're tracking. it's still pretty wide variance, so considering that we've got eight months to go in the fiscal year. so i'm kind of wondering what the potential big swing factors are -- that get you to the higher end of the range versus lower end of the range because it basically implies that revenues are doubling probably from where you were in the current april quarter. thanks.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so i think that's a correct assessment. with regards to me, the way to look at it is that these opportunities we have in the pipeline, it's really a question of calling when they going to translate into revenues and how fast. and we don't have exact data right, we just look at it and say, ok, these design wins are ramping now and they're going to full deployments and so we can see that they're going to materialize in the second half. and we're expecting stronger revenue from that. and it's a very broad range of use cases and it's a very more balanced regional flavor as well.
coming back to your question on china, yeah i mean china has been, i think over 50%, i can't remember exactly the number of lora business. but clearly it's been a significant contributor to our lora revenue. and so with the china's softness that has impacted our lora enabled revenue. but as i mentioned we have enough pipeline as long as those opportunities convert, then we'll still be able to achieve our goal this year which was a reduced goal $100 million to $140 million. it's still early on in the fiscal year, so we'll see how that plays out. and we're starting to see some good momentum now both on the revenue front and also on the conversion rate from opportunities to revenue.
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
hey just lastly if i could follow up, mohan, that -- that doesn't include any tags. there is no expectation for tags kicking in this year, right? that's more fiscal '21 and beyond, correct?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
that's correct. yeah.

well, i think hamed, we don't look at it as, there is so many different use cases and the way this works typically is, we're selling into module manufacturers. the module manufacturers have to reach a certain cost per gigabit that they're trying to achieve for the end customers. and so one of the advantages of course we have with the clearedge family is the nrz modules and the components and the optics related to those are much cheaper. so we are probably being as aggressive as we need to be there. on the pam4 stuff, we probably don't need to be as aggressive and so it's really a -- it's dependent on each situation.
hamed khorsand -- bsw financial -- analyst
okay. and my other question was on the automotive side, with new models coming out, do you have any design wins on deck as -- to the second half of the year when new models start shipping from the auto manufacturers?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
i know we have a lot of design wins on the protection side, we have some on the lora side. i don't know exactly the timing of those to be honest with you. i think, they typically take a lot longer than 12 months for qualification but we have good momentum with that protection business in the automotive space.
hamed khorsand -- bsw financial -- analyst
so is it the (inaudible) you reported from automotive is that all just trial based on our commercials?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
no, the revenue on protection, on the revenues that we are talking about is, it's revenue i mean although numbers we talk about, when we talk about automotive numbers it's real revenue. i'm talking about the ramp of other additional automotive opportunities.
hamed khorsand -- bsw financial -- analyst
okay. got you. alright. thank you.
operator
and your last question comes from the line of craig ellis with b.riley fbr.
craig ellis -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
thanks for sneaking me back in for one more question. mohan, i just wanted to follow up, the company has got a real nice $100 million net cash balance at (technical difficulty) you certainly got the flexibility to repurchase shares. does the -- does the uncertain macro cause you to think any differently strategically about how you deploy that cash? i do detect tuck-ins or other deals like any more appealing in this environment?
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, craig, i know we're not thinking differently about that at all. and the reason we don't think differently because we still have very high expectations for the future. we still believe very much in the secular nature of the growth drivers that we have a lot of platform. we believe that -- due that of hyperscale data centers is going to continue. we believe that the pon deployments transition into the 10-gig, is going to continue and these are all markets where we're very nicely positioned. so despite the current macro headwinds that everybody is seeing right now we're still pretty much believe in our future, and what we have to deliver. so we're not thinking about it any differently. having said that, we always remain to look to be really opportunistic with our buyback. we have $181 million authorized. so if the opportunity is there we would continue to buy back our stock but also continue to make the strategic investments that will continue to ensure our future.
craig ellis -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
got it. thanks, emeka.
operator
and there are no further questions at this time, your closing remarks, please.
sandy harrison -- director of business, finance and investor relations
in closing, despite the near-term uncertainty driven by the macro and geopolitical environment, we remain confident in the underlying strength of the secular drivers behind that growth engines which we believe are clearly intact. we see early indications from our customers that suggest a stronger second half fiscal year '20, despite the slow start to the year. that we appreciate your continued support of semtech and look forward to updating you all next quarter. thank you.

good afternoon. my name is erica, and i'll be your conference operator today. at this time, i'd like to welcome everyone to the q1 fy '20 semtech corporation earnings release conference call. all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. after the speakers remarks, there will be question-and-answer session. (operator instructions).
thank you. mr. sandy harrison, director of business, finance and investor relations. you may begin your conference.
sandy harrison -- director of business, finance and investor relations
thank you, erica. and welcome to semtech's conference call today to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year '20. speakers for today's call will be mohan maheswaran, semtech's president and chief executive officer; and emeka chukwu, our chief financial officer.
a press release announcing our unaudited results was issued after the market close today and is available on our website at semtech.com. today's call will include forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in these statements. for a more detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please review the safe harbor statement included in today's press release and in the other risk factors section of our most recent periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission.
as a reminder, comments made on today's call are current as of today only, and semtech undertakes no obligation to update the information from this call should facts or circumstances change.
during the call, we will refer to non-gaap financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. discussion of why the management team considers such non-gaap financial measures useful, along with the detailed reconciliations of such non-gaap measures to the most comparable gaap financial measures, are included in today's press release. all references to the financial results on mohan's and emeka's formal presentation on this call refer to non-gaap measures unless otherwise noted.
with that, i will turn the call over to semtech's chief financial officer, emeka chukwu. emeka?
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, sandy. good afternoon everyone. for q1 fiscal 2020, net sales as expected decreased 18% sequentially to $131.4 million. in q1, shipments into asia represented 78% of net sales, north america represented 12%, and europe represented 10%. total direct sales represented approximately 38%, and sales to distribution represented approximately 62%. our distribution business remains balanced, with 54% of the total pos coming from high-end consumer and enterprise computing end markets, and 46% of total pos coming from the industrial and communications end markets.
q1 bookings improved nicely q-over-q resulted in a book-to-bill above one. accounts bookings accounted for approximately 47% of shipments during the quarter. as expected, q1 fiscal 2020, gaap gross margin increased 10 basis points sequentially to 61.9%, while q1 gaap operating expense declined 5% sequentially due to the onetime benefit from the reduction in the fair value of contingent earn-out obligations, a lower intangible amortization expense.
in q1, gaap interest and other expense was $1.4 million, an increase from the $548,000 in q4, that had benefited from a $1.3 million gain on the sale of an investment. q1 gaap tax benefit of approximately 20.3% was driven by the discrete tax benefit from comcast exercising its remaining warrants. we expect that our gaap tax rate for the rest of fiscal year 2020 to be in the range of 15% to 19%. our gaap tax rate forecast excludes consideration of any impact from discrete items including excess tax benefits or deficiency from exercise of stock options.
moving on the non-gaap results which exclude the impact of share based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition related and other nonrecurring charges. in q1, non-gaap gross margin increased 10 basis points sequentially to 62.2% as expected, and we expect q2 non-gaap gross margin to remain flat. in fiscal year 2020, we expect our gross margin to remain stable driven mostly by end market mix.
q1 non-gaap operating expense was $53.1 million flat with q4, as higher payroll expense was offset by low and new product spending due to timing. in q2, we expect non-gaap operating expense to be flat or decline 4% sequentially because of lower variable compensation expenses driven by lower revenue expectations. while maintaining our investments in our key growth drivers, we expect our non-gaap operating expenses for fiscal year 2020 to be approximately flat or only modestly higher with the prior year. we expect our fiscal 2020 non-gaap tax rate to remain in the 15% to 17% range. in q1, cash flow from operations decreased sequentially due to lower net revenue and annual disbursements for supplemental compensation.
our stock repurchase authorization has started up approximately $181 million. we expect to continue to use our cash to opportunistically repurchase our shares, make strategic investments, and pay down the debt. in q1, accounts receivable decreased 16% (ph) sequentially due to lower net sales and represented 50 days of sales, which is above our target range of 40 to 45 days. in q2, we expect the cash receivables to increase, but for days of sales to refund within our target range.
the net inventory in absolute dollar terms increased 15% sequentially and days of inventory increased to a 125 days which is above our target range of 90 to 100 days. in q2, we expect our net inventory to be up in absolute dollars and days to be flat due to the export restrictions on a key customer and expectations for higher sales in the second half of the year. in summary, we were able to achieve our q1 expectations in a difficult macro-environment. bookings grew strongly, sequentially, as we are seeing any signs of inventory levels in several markets beginning to normalize. while the recent geopolitical challenges from the export restrictions are contributing to near-term customer uncertainty and impacting our revenue, we will continue to focus on execution and believe the long-term secular nature of our growth engines position us for a stronger second half of fiscal 2020.
i'll now hand the call over to mohan.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, emeka. good afternoon, everyone. i will discuss our q1 fy '20 performance by end market and by product group, and then provide our outlook for q2 of fiscal year '20. in q1 of fiscal year '20, net revenue decreased 18% over the prior quarter, $231.4 million. a weaker overall global demand environment in all our end markets contributed to the decline. we posted non-gaap gross margin of 62.2% and non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $0.34.
in q1 of fiscal year '20, net revenues from the industrial market declined and represented 30% of net revenues. net revenues from the enterprise computing end market declined and represented 27% of revenues. net revenues from the communications end market declined over the prior quarter and represented 10% of total net revenues. finally, net revenues from the high end consumer market increased 13% over the prior quarter and represented 33% of total net revenues. approximately 25% of high end consumer net revenue was attributable to mobile devices and approximately 8% was attributable to other consumer systems. our q1 high end consumer revenues were impacted positively as expected by huawei's increase in demand, which we believe was a result of them increasing their chip inventories in anticipation of a potential ban.
i will now discuss the performance of each of our product groups. in q1 of fiscal year '20, net revenues from our signal integrity product group decreased 30% over the prior quarters record results, and represented 38% of total net revenues. as expected, demand decreased across all of our target market segments including the data center, pon and wireless base station markets. in q1 of fiscal year '20, data center demand declined as cloud and hyperscale data center providers further reduced inventory levels.
our clearedge cdrs continued to do very well in new 25 gig, 200 gig, nrz based optical modules and active optical cables. we believe customer inventory levels are returning to more normalized levels and demand forecasts from our data center customers and bookings have started to improve. in fact, our signal integrity products group recently received the largest ever single order for our clearedge cdrs for a north american mega data center customer.
during q1, our initial tri-edge pam4 cdrs samples experienced strong customer interest, as its low cost, low power, and low latency characteristics are ideal for 50 gigabit per second, 100 gigabit per second, 200 gigabit per second, and 400 gigabit per second pam4 applications. we recently announced our participation in the formation of the open eye multi source agreement. the open eye msa launched with 19 initial member companies, targets low cost, low power, and low latency pam4 optical modules, using analog pam4 cdrs such as semtech's tri-edge platform.
we expect to see our first tri-edge pam4 revenues starting in q4 this year. our fiberedge pmd platform, which complements our tri-edge and clearedge cdr platforms, continue to be qualified at key module customers, where we have collaborated with leading dsp providers for use in next generation 100 gig, 200 gig, and 400 gig pam4 optical module solutions. our fiberedge platforms have garnered strong design win traction and we are seeing initial modest revenues from 100 gig pam4 modules and from 400 gig pam4 modules. we expect these modules to begin to ramp to volume beginning in fy '21.
in q1 of fy '20, pon demand declined sequentially as expected. our pon demand is largely driven by china, where demand has softened over the last two quarters. semtech continues to be the pon pmd market leader, providing highly integrated solutions for 1 gig, 2.5 gig, and 10 gig pon onu and olt platforms. we currently expect stronger second half pon demand as pon tenders for this year in china indicate unit volumes similar to calendar year '18 volumes. however the medium term impact of the huawei ban on our pon demand will not be clear for another quarter.
our wireless base station demand was also weak in q1, and we expect this business to also be negatively impacted in q2, due to the huawei ban. for fy '20, we expect to see further spending on 4g deployments as well as the ongoing ramp of 5g platforms throughout the year, with stronger growth expected in fy '21. we remain excited about our market opportunity for 5g base stations, which we believe could more than double from 4g and due to the larger volumes and additional content as we expect most optical links to require cdrs.
despite the current challenges faced by our signal integrity products group in this fiscal year, we remain very confident in our strategy. and expect our sip product group to grow nicely over the next few years, driven by the ongoing expansion of cloud and hyperscale data centers, the global transition to 5g base stations, and the acceleration of 10 gig pon deployments.
for q2 of fiscal year '20, we expect net revenues from our signal integrity product group to be approximately flat.
moving on to our protection product group. in q1 of fiscal year '20, net revenues from our protection product group declined 8% over the prior quarter, and represented 30% of total net revenues. demand from all end markets remained relatively weak in q1. our automotive protection business gained momentum in q1, and reflects the need for high performance protection used in advanced driver assistance systems. semtech's superior protection performance including that of our recently announced our rclamp3552tq enables our customers to offer enhanced robustness for infotainment systems, incorporating adas functions.
additionally newer high speed interfaces such as usb 3.1 type c, 10-gig ethernet and hdmi 2.1 are rapidly proliferating across all end markets and applications. as a result, we see growing demand for our high performance protection platforms that address these interfaces.
our protection products group remains focused on diversifying from the high end consumer market to the broader industrial markets, where there is an increasing usage of more advanced lithography devices. we believe our investments in these broader markets will enable us to diversify our business over the next few years.
in q2 of fiscal year '20, we expect our protection business to increase as demand from the broad-based industrial end market is expected to recover.
turning to our wireless and sensing products group. in q1 of fiscal year '20, net revenues from our wireless and sensing products group decreased 9% sequentially and represented 32% of total net revenues. weaker demand from the industrial end markets contributed to the decline. despite the recent softness in our wireless and sensing business, due to a weak china demand environment, we do expect to see improving demand throughout the rest of the year.
our lora momentum continues to build and we are seeing very exciting momentum across the globe underlined by some of the key lower metrics we track. these include the number of public or private lora network operators increased in q1 to approximately 113 from 100 at the end of fiscal year '19. we now expect a 130 lora network operators by the end of fiscal year '20. the number of countries with lora networks grew to more than 74 countries. by the end of fiscal year '20, we expect over 90 countries to have lora networks.
the estimated number of lora gateways deploy increased to more than 300,000. these gateways will support approximately 1.5 billion connected end nodes. we expect the number of lora gateways deployed to exceed 500,000 by the end of fiscal year '20 supporting a lora end mode capacity of over 2 billion end nodes. the estimated cumulative number of lora end nodes deployed -- increased to approximately 97 million. we expect this number to exceed 140 million by the end of fiscal year '20.
the lora opportunity pipeline increased to over $450 million of lora enabled opportunities in that pipeline, with an additional $200 million of leads feeding the opportunity pipeline. we anticipate that on average 40% to 50% of this pipeline will eventually convert to full deployment over a 24 months timeline. in addition to the strong performance on our lora metrics, we also began to see a number of new exciting use cases and new ecosystem partners. some examples of this are: target announced its use of lora to improve retail operations and retail guest experience at the iot fuse conference in minneapolis.
sip recently announced the integration of lora into its leonardo (ph) iot platform to support lpwan industrial iot use cases globally. machine max a revolutionary wireless telematics company announced its lora based machine sensing system for construction and mining systems, enabling significant fleet management and efficiency improvements; an emerging leader in wireless industrial sensing applications announced its lora based sensing system to monitor and track manufacturing assets, in facilities exceeding 100,000 square feet. and sonova a leader in advanced hearing aid technology and solutions announced it's latest iot connected hearing aid which uses lora to deliver best in class wireless performance.
our pipeline of opportunities includes many new use cases which include very high volume and very disruptive use cases for numerous industry segments. we will discuss these use cases in future earnings calls, as they move from opportunities to proof of concepts and design wins. we recently announced the release of our first cloud-based lora microservice. our first microservice is a lora based geo location service, that is available to our partners and customers to track and locate their lorawan devices using the cloud.
the interest in the service has been very high and we are starting to demonstrate the unique value of a lorawan based asset tracking system to our global ecosystem. we believe that we will start to help customers transition from testing the service to full qualification and commercialisation of their services by q4 of this fiscal year. we expect our lora microservices to grow to between $80 million and $100 million in revenues within the next five years.
our wireless and sensing product group continues to focus on developing ways to enable the faster proliferation of lora. specifically in q1, we started to offer a full suite of hardware reference designs, software building blocks and a suite of development tools and services, that will enable solutions providers and system integrators to move from concept phase to end deployment more rapidly. in addition to these new platform development tools, we have also accelerated our lora design partner program and our lorawan academy program. both of these programs have been specifically designed to simplify the development and deployment of lora based solutions and accelerate the time to market of total iot solutions based on lora. both programs already have large global interest from the developer and academic communities.
in fy' 20, despite the broader macro concerns and soft demand from china, we still expect our lora enabled revenues to be between $100 million and $140 million and we continue to expect lora to become the de facto standard for lc-1 use cases, over the next few years, in what we expect to be a multi-billion unit industry. in q1 of fiscal year '20, demand for our proximity sensing platforms increased and delivered record quarterly revenues due to strong demand from huawei and increasingly stringent global sar regulations.
we believe our proximity sensing business should continue to expand as we see solid design win progress in new customers and regions, as global regulations drive an increase in the need for radio energy management on smartphones and other mobile devices. in addition, as 5g smartphones start to enter the market during the year, we expect to see an increased number of high performance radios which drives higher proximity sensing content in these devices. for q2 of fiscal year '20, we expect net revenues from our wireless and sensing product group to be approximately flat.
moving on to new products and design wins. in q1 of fiscal year '20, we released 11 new products and achieved a record 2,884 design wins. now let me discuss our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal year '20. despite the strong improvement in our recent bookings, based on the near-term geopolitical uncertainty and the recent ban on shipments to huawei, we are currently estimating q2 net revenues to be between $128 million and $142 million.
to attain the midpoint of that guidance range or approximately $135 million, we needed net terms orders of approximately 34% at the beginning of q2. this q2 guidance reflects a reduction of approximately $7 million due to anticipated reduced shipments and associated reduced demand related to the huawei ban. we expect our q2 non-gaap earnings to be between $0.32 and $0.40 per diluted share.
i will now hand the call back to the operator, and sandy and emeka and i will be happy to answer any questions. operator?

operator
thank you. at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] cody, your line is live.
cody acree -- loop capital -- analyst
thank you very much for taking the question. just a clarification on that last point. you're not shipping to huawei this quarter, any further this quarter. are you wearing out your huawei expectations going forward? and are you shipping as many other companies are, any portion of your prior revenue?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. cody, we are shipping as huawei requests us to ship. and of course, if we're allowed to ship. the comment is that we don't plan in our guidance to ship anything more, even though we have backlog to huawei and that's really related to them. you know, there's an indirect impact, as they've mentioned on previous calls, where we may be able to ship a product, but if they can't get the component from another -- key component from another manufacturer, then they can't ship their system anyway. and so part of that is, our kind of approach is assuming that they're going to have difficulty in assembling all the components they need to build their systems.
cody acree -- loop capital -- analyst
and then just the chinese versus the huawei implications. how have you seen the ban or the trade conflicts impact your broader chinese activity, particularly in the smartphone market? not necessarily pon, but just broadly, are you seeing any hesitation or are you seeing any share shifts that might give you encouragement that you could see china grow even if huawei is not?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i don't think the tariff situation is so much an impact for us. i think the china demand softness is obviously an issue for everybody and that is more, you know, has been -- it was going on before the tariff situation. the tariff situation has compounded i think the uncertainty and there's some elements of that. but i don't think those really are the major impact for us. i think the huawei ban is clearly a direct impact, and that's really the major impact. outside that, i think we still have pretty high expectations of growth in china.
cody acree -- loop capital -- analyst
great. thank you, guys.
operator
our next question comes from the line of tore sandberg with stifel. please proceed with your question.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
yes, thank you. first of all, so just to close the loop on huawei. so it's about 5% of your revenues last quarter, right? so roughly $7 million and that's going to go away in the october quarter, is that the math?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
we've estimated about $10 million impact this quarter, tore, from a direct standpoint. there may be additional indirect impact again, and we're not aware of but the direct impact for us is about $10 million.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
very good. that's helpful. and then as we sort of look at outside of china and huawei, i know last quarter you talked about backlog kind of firming. you know, inventories were pretty low, as you mentioned in the data center market. as we now are here 90 days later, would you say that, outside of china, the environment is still relatively healthy?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think that's fair. i mean, i think the smartphone market is a little bit skewed because of huawei and huawei's inability to ship. so we don't really know if someone else is going to pick that up or they're picking that up when we see a pick up there. so outside that, though, i do think that that rest of the market, data center for sure, iot for sure are doing reasonably ok. so it's very segment specific and yeah i don't see any other regional issues.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
very good. just last question on lora, as cloud services start contributing to revenues perhaps early next year, is this going to be a separate line item? or are you kind of going to talk a lot about, you know, perhaps, you know, where you're seeing the geographic implementation there?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we'll start to get more color as we start to get the revenues from the geolocation services and as it becomes a material number, of course, we'll break it out.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from the line of rich schafer with oppenheimer. please proceed with your question.
rich schafer -- oppenheimer -- analyst
yes. thanks. i believe my first question, mohan, is on lora, just kind of going back to that. you know, obviously that business continues to show really solid growth, but i think probably slower than maybe you expected or we expected sort of starting last year. so i don't know if you can spend a second, just kind of what's been the biggest surprise there versus your expectation even two or three years ago? and maybe it's as simple as just like you said, maybe it's just china slowing down kind of surprisingly here.
and then the second part of that question is, i'm just curious what we should watch for? you know, what kind of milestones on lora revs as we track toward, i know you guys have talked about $500 million to $1 billion in the next three to five years, that certainly implies a pretty good hockey stick at some point in the future to hit that kind of run rate. so, sort of any color there, maybe next year -- will that be hockey stick year, or just if you could frame some of that be helpful? thank you.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so i think some key points is -- we've been growing at 60% a year now from a revenue standpoint and this year, our expectation was no different. obviously, we started the year very soft with china. china is still 60% of our revenue for all of lora's generated out of china. but one of the key things to really look at is the opportunity pipeline. the opportunity pipeline is more balanced. i think it's going to be more geographically balanced. there's a lot more different types of used cases. so i think that's one thing to look out for. as i said in my remarks, that we're still anticipating 40% cagr going forward for the next five years. you layer on top of that cloud services would probably generate something like a 50% cagr. and so i think the key things to look out for still the opportunity pipeline, the conversion rate, the number of [indecipherable] deployed, which indicates, really what type of end node capacity we can support.
the end node deployments themselves. and then just general momentum, you know. and as you said, we are expecting in this pipeline of opportunity, we have some very, very good, very potentially high, more consumer-ish, more smart building, smart home kind of used cases that we think could be a real catalyst. and once we see that momentum go, i think it's going to be clearly obvious to everybody that lora will become the de facto standard for lpwan. obviously, we're still working hard at those used cases and still a ways to go. but, we're fairly optimistic about them.
rich schafer -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thanks. and then just a quick follow up on the -- shifting gears to base station. i think it's around sort of a mid single digit kind of contributor to revenues. i know you talked about that business growing modestly in the back half. and i assume that's without huawei. so is that really -- is it just a function of the higher content, as you mentioned in your prepared remarks? is that -- is that share gain for you guys at sort of the non-chinese wireless oems, you know, like the nokia's, ericsson's, samsung's? any color there would be great. you guys obviously have a great relationship with samsung, for instance, on the handset side. so i don't know if that was a better opportunity for you guys.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, it's a bit of everything you mentioned, rick. i think we are generally seeing a pickup in demand because of 5g deployments. i wouldn't say it's huge. i would say it's very modest, but it is a pickup. obviously, huawei is a, you know, a bit of a headwind for us on that. but i think as with smartphones, we do expect over time someone else to pick up the demand that huawei can't ship. so, we'll see how that plays out but that's our expectation.
rich schafer -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thanks.
operator
our next question comes from the line of craig ellis with b. riley fbr. proceed with your question.
craig ellis -- b riley -- analyst
yeah, thanks for taking the question. and just to make sure i'm clear on the huawei effect, are you saying that there was $10 million of huawei revenue in the fiscal second quarter, but you don't expect there to be any so that's the $10 million sequential headwind?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes, we've shipped some already, craig, but we're not expecting to ship any more. and so the total impact is about $10 million for us.
craig ellis -- b riley -- analyst
got it. and then following up on some of the lora questions to mohan. so it seems as i look at the performance of the business versus target, you're actually tracking in network operators and countries potentially to exceed the targets that you had set at the beginning of the year. and yet we did reduce that end node target from $140 million to $130 million, i believe. and then you updated the revenue target. but if i look at that data, it would seem to suggest that the business is getting good traction outside of china, but maybe not getting the end node deployments as fast as we had thought perhaps three and six months ago. is that a fair depiction or is there really something else going on?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
no, i think that's a fair depiction. craig. i think the only thing to remember is that, predicting end node deployments is really predicting how fast the opportunities turn into -- and the proof of concepts turn into revenue, i mean, the actual deployments. and so it really is a estimate right now. as we look at it, at the moment, lora is still a small business and it's still a sub-$100 million business. and so, a small change like china, softness in smart metering, for example, can impact that. but i think as the business starts to scale and gets larger and as i mentioned, and the opportunity pipeline being more balanced then those small changes, i think won't have such a significant impact. and that's when we look at the opportunity pipeline being so large, if we can convert those, we're going to see the 40% or more cagr that we're projecting.
craig ellis -- b riley -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then switching over to signal integrity. so it seems like the company is pleased with the momentum it has with the clearedge parts and the tri-edge pam4 parts, i think were specific that we'd start to see revenues for some of these pam4 parts in the fourth quarter. but then really more again in the second half of calendar '20, is the point there that seasonally we would expect the business to be stopped there in the first half of the year, just given enterprise and data center spending or is there something else going on? and should we expect a similar revenue and demand profile for your clearedge parts?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think it's more related to when the market is ready for pam4. i think we see customers interested. we see design and activity, but revenue, i think is still toward the back end of next year. and, we are working very closely with them, obviously, as we bring out our products and we see momentum that may change maybe a first half phenomenon. but i think at this point in time, we project more second half next year revenue.
craig ellis -- b riley -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. last one is for emeka. emeka, i haven't forgotten about you. the guidance on gross margin was helpful as it relates to the fiscal '21 color, racing back toward more normal levels. the question is, what is 'normal' would that be the 61% to 62% range or is that 62% plus? and i take it that's driven by valuation, but would there be any micro services revenue included in that guidance? thank you.
emeka chukwu -- chief financial officer
i think the normal levels that i'm responding to, if you look at for the last several quarters, we've been about 62% and above. so that's what i sort of consider as normal for us. now, i would expect that as we go into the next fiscal year, and as we look at where we expect to get our growth from, getting growth from lora, getting growth from hyperscale data center, getting growth from pro av products, from the industrial protection products. these are all end markets that we know come with much higher gross margin expectations. so that is why i do have to believe that as we get into the next fiscal year and especially also as demand overall strength and size faster come back to normal levels, we can get back to the same levels of manufacturing activity. so those are the reasons why i do believe that we should get back to the normalized levels of 62% and above.
craig ellis -- b riley -- analyst
thank you for the color.

our next question comes from the line of tristan gerra with baird. proceed with your question.
tristan gerra -- baird -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. when you mentioned 5g content opportunity to triple, could you give us some color on how does that translate in dollars in terms of 5g content per base station and also the pace of increase that you expect for next year?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes, tristan. i think it's difficult to say, everybody's -- it depends on the architecture. how many front or back or middle links are in each system deployment. what we are seeing, obviously, is that there's more demand for cdr and so that increase in content is obviously beneficial to us. also, 5g architecture in general requires more base stations and so we are just seeing, you know, at least that customers are telling us that's likely to be the case. so there'll be more base stations, different types of base stations and more cdrs and so that drives the content. we're already starting to see a modest pickup, as i mentioned. i think next year, again, we'll see if it plays out in the first half. i think it's more like in the second half, but there is definitely a pull from the market. so i think the need is there. and it's just now a question of whether the technology is ready and whether the customers are ready to -- service providers are ready to put the money in. so i think it's going to happen starting next year.
tristan gerra -- baird -- analyst
okay. and then moving on to the impact of 5g, but this time on the consumer side. does your protection business potentially benefit from the ways of 5g phones? are there any changes that you expect in the regulatory environment for 5g modem power in phone that would have an impact on on your content per cellphone?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, the main shift would be on, what we expect our proximity sensing, as i mentioned in the call, that 5g radios are pretty powerful. and as you have more 5g radios -- because of the range, you need to have a increase in power to get to more distance as you have a higher bandwidth there. typically, those radios are going to be more powerful and therefore i think potentially more dangerous. and i think one of the things we expect is most phones, whereas the attach rate today of proximity sensing for sar functionality is fairly, you know, not so high. i think for 5g phones, it's going to be much higher. and so that's really a good opportunity for us.
in addition, for protection. so that's for proximity sensing and from a protection standpoint, we see the same type of improvements required, high speed interfaces, more advanced processes, different displays requiring protection. and it's just a more challenging environment as everything is faster and more -- has more advanced lithography, so more advanced displays. so, again, protection and proximity sensing, we expect to do quite well going forward due to 5g also.
tristan gerra -- baird -- analyst
great. and then last one, in terms of the growth for lora that you see for this year. how should we model china? i thought china would have decline as a percentage of total lora revenue. do you actually expect china to be flat to up year-over-year this year? or is the new target embedding china to be down year-over-year?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
i would think that china would be maybe slightly up year-over-year, tristan but i think we did anticipate it would be a much higher growth this year to be fair, as we planned over the year, a lot of the growth we did expect from china. but i make the comment on the opportunities being more balanced just for that reason. we just don't know where this whole tariff thing is going to lead to and those type of things. and, you know, one of the things we pride ourselves on is having geographical balance and end market balance. and this is one of the reasons, it's that we can't predict what's going to happen regionally. all we know is we have very good momentum also in north america. we have very good momentum in europe. but yeah, for this year, the projection was that china would be growing faster and i think it's going to be fairly muted growth.
tristan gerra -- baird -- analyst
okay, great. very useful. thank you.

our next question comes from line of karl ackerman with cowen and company. proceed with your question.
karl ackerman -- cowen and company -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. emeka or mohan, your comments on china pon demand largely echo peers who have reported already. but i think you sound a little bit more optimistic on 100 gig optical components than peers. so what are you seeing here in terms of bookings for 100 gigs for the second half of the year? and, how should we think about the opportunity for your pon business as 5g ramps later this year?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
karl, i think the -- so separate pon from data center. so there's really two markets we're playing. pon is the one that's majority china, mostly china driven, mostly today 2.5 gig and 1 gig pon. we are seeing growth in 10 gig deployments. the challenge for us with pon is that, huawei has really been one of the key drivers of that business in china and obviously with the huawei ban that puts some challenges around that business. in addition to that, china has been the main region for pon deployments. there are other regions deploying, but china has been the -- by far the highest volume. and so you combine the slightly modest investments in -- reduction in investments by the china government in pon and then combine that with huawei ban that puts really a headwind on pon business.
now, separate that from the data center business. the data center business we've talked about inventory builds in q4 and q1. we started to see that free up now in q2, started to get more balanced and we expect the rest of this year to be a little bit better for data center and most of those 100 gig, 4x25 gig and ic optical module deployments. and so that's where we see the benefit there on our cdrs.
karl ackerman -- cowen and company -- analyst
understood. my last question, if i may. could you elaborate on what you expect from the proximity sensing business for the back half of the calendar 2019? i understand that huawei is an overhang, but i guess i was under the impression that business outside of smartphone should grow at kind of a high teens or, plus or minus clip. so could you may elaborate a bit more on what you're seeing in that market outside of huawei/smartphone? that would be helpful. thank you.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, the proximity sensing business is doing quite well outside china. it's also obviously korea, so it's mostly today, it's mostly smartphones, even though we're getting design wins in wearables and other areas where the radio is touching the human body. but i think today the most, majority of the volume is still smartphones. and obviously, as you know, the big smartphone manufacturers that the major volume drivers are in korea and handful in north america and then china. and we've done a really actually a phenomenal job of diversifying this business. it used to be all korea driven. but china this year, obviously, because of huawei who were the main drivers of our proximity sensor business in china have had challenges.
and so now in the back half, we're expecting samsung to pick up a little bit. they haven't had a strong year-to-date. i think there's indications that they may do better. and as i mentioned, that i think it's likely that if huawei can't ship phones outside china, that someone will pick up that demand. not clear who it will be, but we do expect that demand to benefit us in some shape or form and in the proximity sensing world.
karl ackerman -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from line of harsh kumar with piper jaffray. proceed with your question.
harsh kumar -- piper jaffray -- analyst
yeah. hey, guys. couple of questions. you guys called out mohan and emeka, you called out lora and data center for growth. lora historically has been highly china dependent. but you saw some pretty strong growth in this july quarter you reported. i'm curious if this growth that just came in, in the july quarter. did it come from china or did it come from other places? and then on data center, i was curious, similar sort of geographic based question. are you seeing growth from data centers in us and europe and not from china? and further, maybe you could clarify between cloud enterprise or hyperscale?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so let's start with that first question and the last question first, harsh. so data center is clearly being driven today, mostly out of north america. you know, the shipments might be -- we might be shipping into china because the supply chain is there. but the end demand is to service north america. so that's without question is the answer to that and it's mostly hyperscale data centers today, i'd say a mix of cloud as well, but for mostly hyperscale data centers. and then on the lora side, yes it's china, i'd say a large chunk of that growth is china, but it's also rest of the world. you know, as you know, q1, we had a pretty weak lora business and that was driven mostly by china's softness. and i think we saw a little bit of a pickup from that in q2. but i would say it's more balanced, but still yet a lot of the growth is driven by china.
harsh kumar -- piper jaffray -- analyst
got it. and then would you say that some of the other companies, mohan that have reported -- actually a lot of them already reported the june numbers and even july. most of them have said that china had bottomed out, ex-huawei of course. would you say that you would share that sentiment for your business?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i would say that's probably true, harsh, although huawei is a fairly significant influencer in the region. and so i think if you exclude them, then you have to look at the whole ecosystem around them. but i think outside that, yeah i do think that china seems to be doing better now. you know, as i mentioned, you know, there are indications that the china demand as a total is now starting to do better outside the tariff uncertainty, which doesn't really impact our demand so much. i think it's just the uncertainty of it kind of creeps up over shadowing nervousness. but i think outside that i think china demand seems to be doing better.
harsh kumar -- piper jaffray -- analyst
great. thanks. that's all i had.
operator
our next question comes from line of gary mobley with wells fargo. please proceed with your question.
gary mobley -- wells fargo securities, llc. -- analyst
hey, guys. to start with a quick question for emeka on the opex. so your q3 opex guide implies a $2 million year-over-year decrease. and just to get to the question of sustainability for that lower level, is there anything more than just lower bonus accruals or putting the cap on any sort of travel expenses, what not?
emeka chukwu -- chief financial officer
no, there's not that much more to it, i think as you can imagine coming into the year, we actually had much better expectations for the current year. so our bonus programs were very much aligned to those, but unfortunately we're not seeing those and so we don't expect the programs to pay out as much as we had anticipated. and overall, you know, managing operating expenses is something that we do very well. we probably still have about 20% to 25% of operating expense as a variable, you know. so those are opportunities for us to keep things in control. so there isn't anything, you know, that it's a [indecipherable] that we are doing you know to manage our operating expenses.
gary mobley -- wells fargo securities, llc. -- analyst
kind of a add question. so one things this huawei should be banned in the us-china trade issues has taught china companies is try to accelerate their, and reduce their dependence on western chip companies. so as you sit here today driving 35% of revenue from china. have you seen any sort of anti-us sentiment as it relates to design win activity or maybe even adoption of what lora which may be viewed as the us based technology?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, actually, it's a really good question. i think we have seen that, but i think that's nothing unusual. i mean, that was going on before tariff situation. the chinese have been driving a whole kind of vision of having more component suppliers in the region. fortunately for us, most of the stuff we do is really high end stuff. and i think, they are challenged, i mean, the companies that were challenged to do, kind of achieve their levels of performance we achieve.
now, that said, you know, because of some of the situations we have, like the huawei ban, we may drive the customers -- the end customers to actually change their specifications to accommodate a poor performing devices. and so, we have to be faced with that. i think that's just one of the side challenges we have to deal with in addition to being faced with chinese competition as customers may be changing their specs to accommodate lower performing devices.
that said, i think that for us, we have enough opportunity across both china and the rest of asia and other regions of the world to still expand our sam and our opportunity.
gary mobley -- wells fargo securities, llc. -- analyst
okay, i appreciate that. thanks, guys.
operator
our next question comes the line of quinn bolton with needham and company. proceed with your question.
quinn bolton -- needham and company -- analyst
hi, guys. wanted to ask first on the data center business. with a nice uptick that you saw in the second quarter and the guidance for continued growth into the second half of the calendar year. do you think you're now sort of through all of the inventory correction or do you think even in the second half you may still be shipping under end consumption of optical modules in the data centers?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
quinn, we think most of the inventory has now gone through. i mean, i think it's been two quarters now where we've seen softness in data centers, difficult to call it. it's not a huge increase we're seeing, but we are seeing modest increase. and so our feeling is, yeah, in the second half there's going to be a little bit stronger. so i think the assumption from that is that inventory mostly is reduced.
quinn bolton -- needham and company -- analyst
okay, great. and then just a question on the smartphone business. i know historically the company set very high share in the oled display protection market. i think certainly that was the case with the korean manufacturers. but if you see chinese manufacturers ramping oled displays. you have the same market share with some of the newer chinese oled manufacturers on the protection side that you did with the korean oled manufacturers?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think so. first of all, you know, lot of the korean -- lot of the china phones are still using, i think, korean displays and we will do so for quite some time. i think. and so, but yeah, we have a reasonable position. i wouldn't say it's as good as the korean smartphone area, but you know, obviously our relationship with samsung has always been very strong and our relationship in china is emerging i would say on the display side, but we still believe that we have a pretty good share across the globe.
quinn bolton -- needham and company -- analyst
got it. and my last question is just on the lora business. you've sort of discussed that it was a little bit of a slower start this year and the new revenue target for fiscal '20. it sure implies a low single digit to maybe a mid 20% year-on-year increase, below that 40% kind of cagr that you expect for the next five years. should we think that, to an extent we we get into a better economic environment in 2020 that you could rebound above that 40% level for a year? or would you sort of encourage us to think that the best way to think about that lora business is that the growth rate is going to be much closer to that 40% kind of off the fiscal '20 base that you've just given us?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
the way i would think about it, quinn, so, we have been growing at 60%, right. so that was our expectation coming into this year. and so we've kind of reset that to a 40% cagr. but as i mentioned, one of the things i've mentioned is that -- we are expecting a major catalyst or two over the next 12, 18 months here that i think will drive much faster growth. and obviously, when that happens, then we can talk about what that does for the numbers. but it's still a ways off we still have to execute on it. we still need our customers, you know, to go through the poc process and demonstrate the value and then indicate to us that that's something that they're going to do and that's going to drive a lot of volume. so for now, i think the 40% is a good number to model in.
quinn bolton -- needham and company -- analyst
great. thank you mohan.
operator
our next question comes from the line of scott searle with roth capital. proceed with your question.
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. quick clarification on the guidance. i just want to make sure i was clear. proximity sensors, you're expecting to be down sequentially, but overall, the wireless and sensing group is expected to increase into the third quarter. is that correct?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
that's correct.
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
okay. so just to follow up, samsung has historically been a slightly larger customer for you i think in the last several quarters have been running, $10 million to $14 million, was it little bit softer this quarter. it sounds like proximity sensing was part of the issue there, but is there something else going on? is there a share loss or something else? we're just clearing some inventory here before you expect that demand to come back to a more normalized level?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
you're talking about. you're referring to samsung cellphone business?
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
yes.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah samsung just hasn't been as strong for us in the first half. i think, you know, i think we're anticipating a little bit stronger q3 from them. but in the first half, you know, as they told us their demand hasn't been as strong as they had anticipated. and i think that's part of the thing we're looking at, is whether they're going to be able to pick up some of the china smartphone demand from huawei. but, yeah, i think maybe it's been because, you know, they have business in china and asia and huawei set to become more aggressive in those regions. but i don't know really the china smartphone, korea, sorry, korea smartphone has been weak for us in the first half. we are expecting that to come back a little bit in q3.
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
got you. and to follow up on a couple of earlier questions around data center. nice snapback in the second quarter. sounds like you're continuing to look for a sequential increase into the third quarter. china had been expected to be a component of internal or domestic demand in consumption for new data centers being built out in the chinese mainland. is that still part of your outlook going forward to see that kind of growth in that coming back? or is this recovery and sustained recovery still all being built from north america hyperscale cloud environments?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
no, china is included in that and just not huawei. so i think we include other china customers. yeah.
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
okay. and lastly, just to wrap up on lora, as you exit the fourth quarter, more than $100 million type run rate on china has been a big component of that. what is your expectation of what china as a component of that $25 million in the fourth quarter? and then just to follow up on your earlier comment, you're expecting a big catalyst on the lower front to drive growth. i wonder if you could expand upon that a little bit. give us a little bit of color. is that tags or is it something else? thank you.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, you know, as we end the -- exit the year, scott, you know, i still think china will be about 60% of their revenue. and, you know, it's really the pipeline is a lot more balanced. but i think we have to see evidence of that. you know, the other regions and lora in those other locations turning into revenue before we can change, move the shift, change the shift in revenue profile geographically. and it doesn't usually change that quickly. so, you know, china may go from 60% to 58% or 55% or something like that until we see a big catalyst.
the catalysts are many. i mean, i think there is not one. i think there are a lot of consumer-ish type used cases, tags and things related to devices and also on smart home. but they just have a higher volume than the industrial smart metering, smart city, smart building kind of used cases. and so that's what we're referring to. and what that will do really for lora is move it from being kind of a industrial iot sensor to being a true iot for many different segments, including consumer and industrial and enterprise. and that's what we're looking for, that type of catalyst.
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of hamed khorsand with bws financial. proceed with your question.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
hi, just a couple of questions here on lora. outside of china, are you seeing any pricing pressure that's creating this issue with revenue not growing this fast to offset the weakness in china?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
no, hamed. we don't see any pricing pressure really. i think it's more just a conversion of pocs. we are seeing momentum in other regions. it's just faster revenue in china. china, one of the reasons why china has been more rapid adopter of lora and generating revenue faster is they typically have access to more system integrator, software engineers, hardware engineers, sensor developers in the region. and they tend to be very, very fast, solving bottlenecks and providing solution to issues. that takes us -- it's a little bit more challenging in europe and north america and other regions. but it's starting to -- starting to get there.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
and how much of a factor is the slowdown in the automotive industry playing a role in your production business?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
not really impacting our protection business at all, hamed. i think our protection business is mostly today driven by smartphones, and then the automotive is growing quite nicely for us. it's relatively new segment for our protection business, as i mentioned in my script. we're seeing a lot of infotainment and aid apps, and new applications emerge in the vehicle that all need very high end protection because they have advanced lithographies in them. and so our protection business is growing nicely now in that space. so, yeah, but it's small, it's small for us today.
hamed khorsand -- bws financial -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
our final question comes from the line of craig ellis with b. riley fbr. proceed with your question.
craig ellis -- b riley fbr -- analyst
thanks for taking the follow up question. team, i just wanted to follow up and see if i could ask a question about how you would look at the fiscal fourth quarter seasonality in this environment? given all of the macro crosscurrents, it's hard to think of any quarter seasonality but to the extent that you have a view there, can you at least share some of the positives and negatives that you would see from this early juncture. i'd appreciate the color. thank you.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, it's tough to call, craig mostly because of huawei, i would say. i think, we would expect samsung to be down obviously in q4. but they haven't had a great year. so normally when they've had a fairly modest year, sometimes their q4 is not as extreme downward. so that maybe weak, i think data center will continue to be quite strong. obviously, we expect lora and iot to be quite strong. so it's going to be tough to call it. i think we'll just have to wait and see how china plays out. the huawei ban is the one thing that obviously does impact us. we'd expect a similar type of impact in q4, unfortunately. so we'd have to look at that. but my sense is, you know, q4 could be better than we normally would see it.
craig ellis -- b riley -- analyst
you mean just at the margin there's a headwind or you mean there could be an incremental $10 million headwind in the fiscal fourth quarter, mohan?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
i think the $10 million we have is -- would be included in the numbers. so if you take q3 run rate, i would anticipate normal seasonality from that standpoint. and then you look at my comment on korea. so, q4 could be stronger than we have seen in the past in terms of the -- typically it's down for us at least 5%. i would say probably it's not going to be down as much, but we'll see.
craig ellis -- b riley -- analyst
got it. thank you for that.
operator
we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. and i would like to turn the call back over to mohan maheswaran for any closing remarks.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
in closing, despite the ongoing uncertainty and geopolitical headwinds that contributed to a slower first half. and despite the ongoing huawei ban, we are seeing modest signs of recovery in several of our targeted markets. we remain confident in the underlying strength of the secular drivers behind our growth engines, in the iot, data center, and mobile markets. and we remain confident that our overall end market, geographical and product balance will enable us to outperform the industry.
with that, we appreciate your continued support of semtech and look forward to updating you all next quarter. thank you.

greetings. welcome to semtech corporation fiscal year 2020 second quarter conference call. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. a question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [operator instructions] please note this conference is being recorded.
i would now like to turn the conference over to your host, sandy harrison, director of investor relations. thank you. you may begin.
sandy harrison -- director of investor relations
thank you, devon. and welcome to semtech's conference call to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year '20. speakers for today's call will be mohan maheswaran, semtech's president and chief executive officer; and emeka chukwu, our chief financial officer. a press release announcing our unaudited results was issued after the market closed today and is available on our website at semtech.com.
today's call will include forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in these statements. for a more detailed discussion of these risk and uncertainties, please review the safe harbor statement included in today's press release and in the other risk factor section of our most recent periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission.
as a reminder, comments made on today's call are current as of today only, and semtech undertakes no obligation to update the information from this call should facts or circumstances change. during the call, we will refer to non-gaap financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a discussion of why the management team considers such non-gaap financial measures useful, along with detailed reconciliations of such non-gaap measures to the most comparable gaap financial measures are included in today's press release.
all references to financial results in mohan's and emeka's formal presentations on this call refer to non-gaap measures, unless otherwise noted.
with that, i would turn the call over to semtech's chief financial officer, emeka chukwu. emeka?
emeka chukwu -- chief financial officer
thank you, sandy. good afternoon, everyone. for q2 fiscal 2020, net sales increased 4% sequentially to $137.1 million, [indecipherable] above the midpoint of our guidance. in q2, shipments into asia represented 74% of net sales. north america represented 16% and europe represented 10%. total direct sales represented approximately 28% and sales to distribution represented approximately 72%. our distribution business remains balanced, with 52% of the total pos coming up from the high-end consumer and enterprise computing end markets, and 48% of total pos coming from the industrial and communications end markets.
bookings grew sequentially and resulted in a book-to-bill above 1. turns bookings accounted for approximately 41% of shipments during the quarter. as expected q2 gaap gross margin was flat sequentially at 61.9%. q2 fiscal '20 gaap tax rate was 63.4%, and reflects a discrete $6.5 million tax provision impact resulting from finalized treasury regulations, related to the 2017 us transition tax. we expect our gaap tax rate for the rest of fiscal year 2020 to be in the range of 13% to 17%.
moving on to the non-gaap results, which exclude the impact of share-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition related and other non-recurring charges. q2 non- gaap gross margin was flat, sequentially at 62.2% as expected. and we expect our q3 non-gaap gross margin to decline 20 basis points to 80 basis points due to lower absorption of manufacturing overhead as we want to bring inventory down to target levels. in fiscal year 2021, we expect the non-gaap gross margin to return to normal levels as overall demand strength is driven by our higher margin growth engines. q2 non-gaap operating expense was $53.8 million, slightly higher than q1 and in line with expectations.
in q3, we expect the non-gaap operating expense to be flat to down 3% sequentially. our higher new product expense is offset by lower supplemental compensation expense. while maintaining our investment in our key growth drivers, we expect our non-gaap operating expense for fiscal year 2020 to be approximately flat or only modestly higher compared to the prior year. we expect our fiscal 2020 non-gaap tax rates to remain in the 14% to 18% range. in q2, cash flow from operations increased and returned to more normalized levels, at 24% of net sales, compared to 5% of net sales in q1.
as a reminder, q1 includes our annual disbursements for supplemental compensation. we repurchased approximately 446,000 shares or approximately $20 million during the quarter. and our stock repurchase authorization now stands at approximately $161 million. we expect to continue to use our cash to opportunistically repurchase our shares, make strategic investments and pay down our debt.
in q2, accounts receivable decreased to 12% sequentially, due to improved shipments linearity and represented 42 days of sales, which is within our target range of 40 to 45 days. net inventory in absolute dollars increased 2% sequentially and days of inventory increased to 129 days, which is above our target range of 90 to 100 days.
in q3, we expect net inventory to decline in both absolute dollars and days, as we work to get inventories back in line with the target range. in summary, we were very pleased with our execution, in q2 despite this difficult macro environment. our growth model was stable, operating expenses were under control and cash flow generation was strong. while the recent geopolitical challenges, continues to contribute to near-term customer uncertainty, we believe our diversified customer base and end markets, along with the secular nature of our growth engine has positioned us well for the future growth.
i'll now hand the call over to mohan.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, emeka. good afternoon, everyone. i will discuss our q2 fiscal year '20 performance by end market and by product group, and then provide our outlook for q3 of fiscal year '20. in q2 of fiscal year '20, net revenues increased 4% over the prior quarter to $137.1 million. we posted non-gaap gross margin of 62.2% and non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $0.38.
in q2 of fiscal year '20, net revenues from the industrial end market increased 24% sequentially, led by very strong growth from our lora business and represented 36% of revenues. net revenues from the enterprise computing end market increased 4%, and represented 27% of revenues. net revenues from the communications end market increased 10% over the prior quarter and represented 10% of total net revenues. net revenues from the high end consumer market decreased 15% sequentially, driven by lower smartphone demand, and represented 27% of total net revenues. approximately, 16% of high end consumer net revenue was attributable to mobile devices and approximately 11% was attributable to other consumer systems.
i will now discuss the performance of each of our product groups. in q2 of fiscal year '20, net revenues from our signal integrity product group increased 10% over the prior quarter, and represented 40% of total net revenues. as expected, demand increased sequentially across the data center and the wireless space station markets, while the pon market remained soft.
in q2 of fiscal year '20, data center demand rebounded as customer inventory levels have reduced over the last two quarters, and demand from cloud and hyperscale data center providers appears to have stabilized. in q2, we saw strong bookings for our clearedge cdrs, used in 100 gigabit per second nrz optical modules. we expect demand for our clearedge cdrs to continue to increase, driven by global cloud and mega data center deployments. in q2, we are pleased with the progress of our tri-edge pam4 cdr platforms, that we are now sampling to data center customers. we expect our first tri-edge revenues in q4 of this fiscal year, with growth accelerating in the second half of next year. as tri-edge platform delivers low cost, no power and low latency performance ideal for pam4 based optical modules.
in september, semtech will be part of the open eye msa interop demonstration for 10 km 50 gigabit per second pam4 links. the open eye msa, which consists of 19 companies, builds on key performance advancements of pam4 cdrs and optics to enable lower cost and lower power pam4 optical modules. our fiberedge pmd platform, which complements our tri-edge and clearedge cdr platforms, also continues to gain momentum with key data center pam4 module customers, where we have collaborated with dsp partners, targeting pam4 optical modules. we expect to see our fiberedge pam4 revenues also ramp in fy '21.
in q2 of fiscal year '20, demand from the wireless space station market increased. semtech's market opportunity from 5g deployments is expected to triple compared to 4g due to the higher 5g volumes and additional cdr content. for the rest of fy '20, we expect 4g and 5g deployments to increase modestly with much stronger growth from 5g platforms expected in fy '21.
in q2 of fy '20, our pon business, which is largely driven by china, remained soft due to lower china government investment in pon, and the impact of the huawei ban. we expect this weakness to continue through the second half due mostly to the huawei ban. over the next few years, we do expect the pon market demand to increase driven by 10 gig pon deployments. semtech remains the pon market leader providing highly integrated solutions for 1 gig, 2.5 gig and 10 gig pon platforms. the greater demand for higher optical data rates at the lowest power and cost is driving greater demand for semtech's clearedge, tri-edge and fiberedge platforms.
we expect this trend to continue, driven by the global expansion of cloud and hyperscale data centers, the global transition to 5g base stations and the acceleration of 10 gig pon. and we expect our sip product group to benefit from these global trends over the next few years. our broadcast video business has been very stable for the last few years. and with the acquisition of aptovision, we are finally starting to see an opportunity to drive significant growth in this business.
as a reminder, we are focused on transitioning the pro audio/video industry from expensive proprietary equipment to standard ip based solutions through the adoption of software defined video over ethernet. the primary market focus has been healthcare, enterprise, industrial and entertainment. recently, we received first silicon of our sdvoe platform, which appears to be functional and we now expect to have production of silicon by the end of this year. we believe this will be a significant catalyst in the adoption of sdvoe for all pro av applications, as customers realize the benefits of delivering uncompressed ultra high definition 4k tv content over a standard 10 gig ethernet network. we will update you on the progress of our aptovision platform on future earnings calls.
for q3 of fy '20, we expect net revenues from our signal integrity product group to be flat to up modestly. as global demand increases, we'll be offset by the huawei ban. moving on to our protection product group. in q2 of fiscal year '20, net revenues from our protection product group grew 4% over the prior quarter, and represented 29% of total net revenues. our protection business growth was driven by increases in broad based demand from the industrial, automotive and consumer markets. in particular, we saw nice increases from our north american smartphone business and from our automotive business. these were somewhat offset by lower korean and chinese smartphone demand. several of our newly released parts, such as the rclamp 3324p deliver higher performance protection for the most advanced hdmi, ethernet and usb interfaces. the increasing proliferation of these high speed interfaces across multiple market sectors is driving our growth in demand.
in particular, the rapid adoption of these high speed interfaces in automotive systems such as infotainment in vehicle communication and advanced driver assistance systems is contributing to the growing demand for semtech's high performance protection products. in q3 of fiscal year '20, we expect our protection business to increase due to continued strength from the automotive and industrial segments and stronger smartphone demand from north america and from korea.
turning to our wireless and sensing product groups. in q2 of fiscal year '20, net revenues from our wireless and sensing product groups were approximately flat from the prior quarter and represented 30% of total net revenues. very strong sequential growth from our lora business was offset by very weak demand for our proximity sensing products due to the huawei ban. in q2, our lora enabled business grew nicely. the momentum and interest in lora is very strong, and we are seeing more and more iot used cases emerge every day. lora is rapidly becoming acknowledged as a critical technology, low power iot sensor networks, and we expect to see lora emerge as the de facto standard for low power wide area networks over the next few years.
some of the more recent noteworthy used cases include comcast announced its -- it has partnered with universal parks & resorts to deploy lorawan networks in its parks to increase operational efficiency in the park. lora sensors will be used to monitor temperature, monitor energy consumption and track assets across the parks. seluxit, a leading european iot provider has developed a lora smart meter and cloud platform to enable their customers to closely monitor energy usage real time. customers using seluxit get insight into their energy usage and consumption patterns, enabling a reduction in energy waste and reduction in energy cost that enables a more sustainable energy grid worldwide.
axino, an european it solutions integrator added lora into its smart refrigeration solutions used to track food temperature, helping customers reduce food wastage and ensuring food safety. skysens, turkish provider of iot solutions, is deploying 10,000 lora based sensors in its smart asset tracking solutions at istanbul airport. conserv, a leading iot solutions provider for art and museum applications has developed a smart conservation solution based on lora that utilizes low power sensors to provide museums with accurate, efficient and simple art health metrics in real time. oizom, an iot solution provider for environmental applications is leveraging lora using tata communications lorawan infrastructure in india to deploy its smart agriculture solutions, enabling farmers to optimize their water usage and create smarter and more efficient farms.
and lacuna space in europe announced that it has completed its first phase of testing in its mission to provide complete satellite iot global coverage for lora sensors anywhere in the world, however remote. lacuna's demonstration of lora constellation will be completed by the end of this year. lacuna also demonstrated a connectivity range of over 300 miles. these are just a handful of examples of new used cases emerging in the lora ecosystem.
interest in our recently announced cloud based lora services, which includes our lora based geolocation services has been very high, as we start to demonstrate the unique value of a lorawan based geolocation service offerings. we believe that customers will begin transitioning from testing our geolocation services to qualification and commercialization early next year. based on our anticipated growth in lora sensors and the assured attach rates of sensor geolocation, asset tracking and other services, we expect our lora cloud services to grow to $100 million in recurring revenues within the next five years.
our lora momentum continues to build nicely and we are seeing very exciting momentum across the globe underscored by the key lora metrics we track. our key metrics update includes the number of public or private lora network operators increased in q2 to approximately 120 from 100 at the end of fy '19. we expect 130 lora network operators by the end of fiscal year '20.
the number of countries with lora networks grew to more than 82 countries. by the end of fy '20, we expect over 90 countries to have lora networks. the estimated number of lora gateways deployed increased to more than 350,000. these gateways will support approximately 1.5 billion connected end nodes. we expect the number of lora gateways deployed to exceed 500,000 by the end of fy '20, supporting lora end node capacity of over 2 billion end nodes.
the cumulative number of lora end nodes deployed increased to $105 million. we now expect this number to reach $130 million by the end of fy '20. the lora opportunity pipeline is now over $475 million, with an additional $200 million of leads feeding the opportunity pipeline.
we anticipate that on average, 40% to 50% of this pipeline will convert to full deployment over a 24 month timeline. our pipeline of opportunities is geographically well balanced and also includes a growing number of consumer used cases where the volumes could be significantly higher. we will continue to provide lora metric updates on future earnings calls. in fy '20, given the slower than expected start to the year, driven by extremely soft demand from china, we are now expecting our lora enabled revenues to come in between $18 million and $100 million. we expect to exit the year at a quarterly run rate closer to the high end of this updated range.
we still anticipate a 40% cagr over the next five years and we continue to expect lora to become the de facto standard for lpwan used cases over the next few years, in what we expect to be a multi-billion unit industry. in q2 of fiscal year '20, demand for our proximity sensing platforms decreased as expected, driven by lower china smartphone demand, due to the huawei ban. while our huawei smartphone business will continue to be a challenge, we believe our proximity sensing business will benefit from increasingly stringent global sar regulations as governments recognize the health risks associated with increasingly powerful 5g radios.
over the next few years, we expect the majority of smartphones and wearable devices to have soft sensors included in their system designs. for q3 of fiscal year '20, we expect net revenues from our wireless and sensing product group to increase due to stronger lora enabled demand. moving onto new products and design wins. in q2 of fiscal year '20, we released 12 new products and achieved a record 2,460 new design wins.
now, let me discuss our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal year '20. we are currently estimating q3 net revenues to be between $135 million and $145 million. to attain the midpoint of our guidance range, or approximately $140 million, we needed net term orders of approximately 36% at the beginning of q3. we expect our q3 non-gaap earnings to be between $0.38 and $0.42 per diluted share. our q3 guidance assumes no further direct shipments to huawei in this fiscal quarter.
i will now hand the call back to the operator. and sandy and emeka and i will be happy to answer any questions. operator?

at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question is from tore svanberg, stifel. please proceed with your question.
tore svanberg -- stifel, nicolaus & co. -- analyst
yes, thank you. first question, mohan, you talked about the funnel or pipeline opportunity of lora being about $500 million plus. so, it sounds like that's growing and it also sounds like consumer is potentially adding to, at least that $100 million. could you elaborate a little bit more on that? can you maybe give us some examples in consumer where you're starting to see more lora adoption?
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. tore, yes the -- it is of the pipeline -- significant part of the pipeline are types of smart home use cases. and i would say mostly in americas, but also in europe. and, yes, the smart home is really replacement of zigbee, replacement of z-wave getting longer range beyond just the interior of the house, outside the house. so, that's number of use cases, including lighting, smart lighting and security, but also smart irrigation, things like that. so, we're seeing a lot of those across the globe, i would say, but the vast majority i think are in north america and europe.
tore svanberg -- stifel, nicolaus & co. -- analyst
sounds good. and as my follow-up, you mentioned that signal integrity and, i mean, pon, obviously, was pretty strong this quarter, but i think you mentioned most segments are going to be down next quarter. is that just seasonal? or is there anything else going on because we thought that especially data center pon was starting to turn a corner, but it seems like that's not sustainable just yet?
sandy harrison -- director of business finance and investor relations
yes. i would say that they're all doing ok, tore. data centers' is pretty reasonably healthy, i wouldn't say it's -- any significant issues there. i would say, pon has been soft all year, it's starting to come back and i think next year we are viewing that as being potentially very good growth the year for pon. base station, as i mentioned, i think is starting to pick up. it's just general market kind of softness, i would say, tied to just kind of more legacy equipments and things like that. so, the kind of bringing the number down a little bit, but i don't know -- i think it's a one quarter event. i think next year we should see all the segments -- the main segments that i talked about pick back up.
tore svanberg -- stifel, nicolaus & co. -- analyst
sounds good. i'll go back in line. thank you.

our next question is from mitch steves, rbc capital markets. please proceed with your question.
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
mitch?
operator
mitch steves, your line is now live.
mitch steves -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hello? can you hear me?
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes, go ahead, mitch. yes.
mitch steves -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yes, sorry. yes. i just wanted to circle back kind of like the 5g ramp and kind of the smartphone sales you guys are seeing. you guys are seeing a little bit of a lighter guide for q1 or q4, however, you want to phrase it, right? but, i guess, the end of the year and earlier next year. but can you maybe comment on what you're seeing in the smartphone handset side if you expect that to improve throughout 2020 or what type of trajectory you guys expect in calendar 2020?
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. so, first of all, i think the smartphone market in general is doing ok. we see pockets of strength, but i would say that all of the regions are doing reasonably well. we do expect that's normal in q4 that the korea -- particularly korea hand smartphone manufacturers tend to bring their inventory down. so, we're anticipating some of that in our q4 guidance, obviously we have some unique issues going on with china with huawei as well. so, there is -- those two impacts i think in general, but other than that, i would say it's fairly -- it seems like a fairly healthy smartphone business and certainly looking into next year, it looks like it's going to be a better year next year.
operator
our next question is...
mitch steves -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
our next question is from karl ackerman, cowen. please proceed with your question.
karl ackerman -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi, thanks. two questions, if i may? first question, i was hoping one of you may discuss what sort of adoption or design wins you have garnered for your analog-based pam4 modules now that open eye has released a 53-gigabit single-mode spec? and i think one of the misperceptions by investors is that, if dsps do become the predominant approach to pam4, you are out of luck, i think you have -- but i think you have partnerships with at least the leading dsp providers. so, if you could just address perhaps that investor concern and kind of where you are with regard to the open eye msa that would be appreciative? and i have a follow-up.
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. so, let's start with the dsp approach, obviously, we have fiberedge, which is our pmd platform with tias, laser drivers and those types of products that are partnered with dsp partners and we are seeing some momentum there. the tri-edge pam4 products, as i mentioned, we're just sampling now. we're very confident that once we have full production release parts, which will be in q1 of this year -- q1 of next year that those are going to get good momentum, we are sampling tier 1 data center customers as i mentioned, and we just think the value proposition is significant over current dsp solution.
so -- but we have to produce the products and get them out into production and get them designed in. so, that's going to be the goal in the first half of fiscal year 2021 and then we'll see how that plays out. it's our belief also that most of the customers have moved out their timeline until toward the end of next year, most of the -- within the data center pam4 deployments. and so, i think our timing is quite good. we'll see how it plays out, but i think that's the view we have.
karl ackerman -- cowen and company -- analyst
i appreciate that. as my follow-up, one of your lora members -- recently lora members introducing new lpwan sidewalk. do you view that as complementary or cannibalistic to your lora offerings? and if that is additive, is -- would that be additive to this $70 million to $90 million of lora revenue opportunity you have for calendar 2019? thank you.
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
so, let me first of all say, we can't talk about specific customers or specific partners in the ecosystem alliance. we can't do that, but what i can say is that, every lora business that's out there, benefit semtech in some shape or form, either through direct chips, either through licensing ip, royalties or cloud services or something like that, so that's the first thing to remember.
second thing is, i think that part of our belief in why this is going to be a $0.5 billion business in next four to five years and go beyond that to become $1 billion business is because of the value proposition that lora brings to things like the smart home. smart home, as an example, is an extremely competitive space. it's very difficult to penetrate, but the value proposition of lora in terms of the range and the power and the cost and the network flexibility and the types of things that can do just is -- it's just a question of time versus if. and so, yes, we do believe the pipeline, i talk about the pipeline a lot because it is rather large, but we're confident in the fact that we can turn that pipeline into revenue. and that's what drives our confidence level.
so -- and as i mentioned, today, most of the revenue is still -- i mean, 60% of the revenue is from china. the pipeline is nicely balanced and if you consider the 65% of that pipeline is now outside of china. that's -- that really quite -- bodes quite well for our future revenue growth. so, there lies the 40% cagr growth vector that we plan on executing on for the next four years.
karl ackerman -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
our next question is from craig ellis, b. riley. please proceed with your question.
craig ellis -- b.riley fbr -- analyst
yes. thanks for taking the question, guys. mohan, i wanted to go back to the point you made about the expectation for revenue this year. so, it looks like the thought is that, the lora revenue could go from a kind of a $90 million midpoint down to $75 million and i think you signaled that that was some consumer related push outs. could you provide some further color on what those were and the extent to which there might have been any common denominators in the things that were going on out in the deployment base for what you saw?
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. i would say, craig, it's largely to do -- when we have gateways installed and as you know, you can see the number of gateways increased dramatically, there is an expectation that end points will follow. we know this that many pocs going on and the opportunities are there, but the timing of exactly when and how they deployed, it's just difficult to call. we try to make a stab at it every year and project how the year is going to play out.
to be honest with you, this year, was largely impacted by the first half, which was very weak, particularly the first quarter, which is very weak mostly driven out of china. so, it's just been difficult to kind of recover that, but that combined with some push outs into next year of some higher volume use cases, i think has made this year a challenging year, but i do think that we'll see that benefit next year. so, yes.
craig ellis -- b.riley fbr -- analyst
and just a follow-up related to that, mohan, is we think about that 40% compound growth over a four to five-year period of time. so, clearly, there's still a huge opportunity here, there's some big blue chips that are joining the lora alliance. the question for next year is, as we have some business that moves from 2019 to 2020, does that give you a discontinuity with a typically large growth next year? or is the global macro such that we should have expectations that would be closer to 40% where the incremental $15 million doesn't overlay, what would be an underlying expectation for 40% growth in the rest of the business? thank you.
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. i think -- what's difficult to call is china, to be honest with you. i think how that demand is going to look next year, this year has been a challenging year for many reasons and calling out what it's going to look like next year. but we're pretty confident about our [speech overlap]
craig ellis -- b.riley fbr -- analyst
[speech overlap] domestic. thank you.
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
what's confident about our 40% growth based on our current opportunity pipeline and the momentum we have both within china and outside china. so, that's the way i would look at it. we think that, obviously, this still needs some broader macro iot kind of industrial use cases that we're relying on, but i think in general, our confidence is quite high still that we can drive the 40% growth next year based on current market outlook.
craig ellis -- b.riley fbr -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question is from scott searle, roth. please proceed with your question.
scott searle -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. just a quick clarification. first off, was there any huawei in the quarter? and i thought i heard there is no huawei in terms of the outlook and expectations for the fourth quarter. and an additional clarification, did you mention in terms of your china exposure on the smartphone front protection or proximity sensors? and then i had a follow-up.
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. so, scott, what we have said is that, we don't need any more huawei tons bookings to make our quarter number guidance and the reason why we do that, and i said it last quarter as well, is that, there's just too much uncertainty around the huawei business from a day to day standpoint to build it into our guidance. obviously, that provides upside if the huawei ban was to go away, but if it doesn't, then i think we've already built it into our guidance -- the risk into the guidance.
and then the -- what was the second part?
emeka n. chukwu -- chief financial officer
[indecipherable] in q3 and what could q4 look like?
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
so, the q4 guidance builds in about $3 million -- we shipped about $3 million or about $1.5 million into that. so, that's what we have on backlog and that's currently the position.
scott searle -- roth capital partners -- analyst
got you. and -- thank you. and then looking out to fiscal 2021. i don't think you gave us an aggregate number that you're looking for in terms of growth, but certainly, they are starting to see some improvements in certain areas. and i was wondering if you could kind of put some benchmarks around some of the key product growth areas, specifically data center, it looks like we're starting to more normalize. do we get back to 20% plus growth when you start to figure in consumer, or excuse me, commercial revenues on the pam4 product lines and some of the other new product portfolios? what does lora look like? it sounds like we're starting to see that recovery is fiscal 2021, then a 40% growth year. and smartphones, are we flat, we up we down, how are you feeling particularly given as you should be having more content sort of going into a 5g cycle? thanks.
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. fy'21, obviously, it's a bit early to guide to what's going to happen in fy'21, but currently if we kind of layer out in the different markets and opportunities, clearly data center as you say is -- has been -- inventory has been kind of normalized now and i think that's coming back and should have a good year, especially the hyperscale segment and we are confident in both our clearedge and tri-edge and pam4 and fiberedge platforms there.
pon, it's had a difficult year this year. we expect that to come back next year, as i mentioned, more fiber-to-the-home, more fiber-to-the-enterprise deployments, particularly in china, but also the 10 gig -- as 10 gig pon starting to accelerate. we feel good about our position there and the growth prospects there.
base stations, i'm sure you've heard it from others as well that we think next year is going to be a little bit better than this year and both for 4g and for 5g, but mostly obviously 5g growth.
and then pro av products and sip business should start to really accelerate. that's a small business for us today, but we're expecting very strong growth in that business for fy'21. lora, as i mentioned, we're expecting that to grow nicely next year.
and then on the protection side, yes, a little bit more challenging to really call out what's going to happen on the smartphone side. but as i mentioned that, there are good design wins across the globe and we feel pretty good about the tier 1 smartphone manufacturers shipping more volume and with the 5g -- growth in the 5g side, we should see a good mobile year next year as well. so, again, lot depends on china, a lot depends on the macro, but we feel good about where we are today.
scott searle -- roth capital partners -- analyst
thank you.

our next question is from quinn bolton, needham & company. please proceed with your question.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
hi, guys. so, quick clarification. perhaps i missed it, did you say what types of applications had pushed from cy'19 to cy'20 in the lora business or is that more some of the traditional china or smart metering? or is that some of the newer consumer applications? and then i've got a couple of follow-ups.
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. i would say, it's more the consumer applications, quinn. the china lora business was really weak in the first half, came back i think to more normal levels in the second half and it's more industrial, it's more metering and environment. and those markets tend to take longer time anyway, but they -- once they're there, they just will go on for quite some time. i think the more consumer-ish smart homes, smart asset tracking, a little bit more difficult to predict the timing of those, but when they come, i think it will be significant.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
great. and then the second question is, you mentioned growing demand in the 5g front-haul for your clearedge product family, just wondering, are those typically going into a cwdm4-type modules? are they single lanes at 25? how big is that opportunity as we deploy the 5g networks in much greater scale next year?
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. i think it's -- actually all the links of the front-haul and mid-haul links will probably require cdrs, and so it's more content for us, that's the -- probably the main driver versus 4g base stations. and then, i think just the number of base stations drives more of a volume increase as well. it's early days, but we feel good about the fact that these are -- these 25-gig links follow -- are going to use clearedge platform, which is a proven platform for us in the data center market. and so, we feel really good about our cdr position in the base stations and most of these have integrated drivers and things like that. so, really the differentiation is quite clear for us in the market. so, yes, i think we're in good shape.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
and then, do you see any applications for the fiberedge or the pam4-based modules in that front-haul mid-haul or do you think that's mostly nrz signaling for the foreseeable future?
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
now, we see fiberedge as well. i think again front-haul, mostly. i think at the moment, we are seeing clearedge and fiberedge as being the opportunity in base station. eventually, we think also tri-edge and the pam4 cdrs will play a role in the base station, as well.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst

our next question is from christopher rolland, susquehanna. please proceed with your question.
christopher rolland -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for the question. so, on lora and, i guess, china, in particular, i know you said, it was a bunch of maybe non-china consumer. but just looking over the past year, would you say that trade tensions, and this chinese domestic semiconductor policy, do you think that that played into adoption for lora for this year? and then also, if you could give us an update on where you think comcast is in the us and the network build out here as well that would be great? thanks.
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. the china issues, obviously, a concern and continue to be a headwind for us in all of our business, to be honest with you. i don't think it's just lora. lora is not immune to that. i think, even though we have good momentum in china, there are nb-iot and competitive pushes on more local kind of chinese technologies that give us some headaches, but i think the lora value proposition is very clear. the chinese end customers clearly supporting the design-ins and continued design-ins of lora. so, i don't see any long-term issues. but for this year for sure, there was some impact in the first half that seems to have gone away now. i think we've come through that, and we should see continued growth in china, but that's one of the reasons i point out that the opportunity pipeline, which is very large, is quite -- it's a little bit better balanced and i think 60% of opportunity, 65% of opportunities being in americas and europe enables that to kind of create a better revenue profile for us going forward on lora.
and then comcast is really focused on the enterprise space now, and i think is focused on building out partnerships with enterprise -- larger enterprise customers in those markets, not only in the markets where they have a network, but in other segments of the market. i think it's still early days. i think the used cases are still playing out for them, but they do have pockets of very nice success where they have some value that they bring to the market, such as in the theme parks and enterprise play where they already have partnerships in those locations. so, still early days, but moving well on the enterprise front, i think.
christopher rolland -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
great. and then also, if i heard you correctly, i think disty at 76%, that seemed a little bit high. i guess, what's behind that? were there some direct customers that typically weren't there in the quarter or was disty particularly heavy for a reason -- for some reason or another? just what's behind that?
emeka n. chukwu -- chief financial officer
yes, chris. i think that was just a function of the slow business that we have with huawei. huawei has for the most part, been a direct account for us. and so, with them not -- with the business with them not been strong has been in the past because of the ban situation, the distant mix of our revenue is somewhat elevated as a result of that.
christopher rolland -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
yeah. that's fair. thanks so much, guys.

our next question is from harsh kumar, piper jaffray. please proceed with your question.
harsh kumar -- piper jaffray -- analyst
yes. hi, thanks. so, a quick question, mohan, on the lora side, you mentioned a couple of the wins had been pushed out from, call it, this year into the next, i'll call it to the next year. curious if you expect kind of a quick ramp, i.e., a ramp in the first fiscal half or would you expect most of these consumer type us and european wins to ramp in the second half of fiscal 2021?
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
that's a difficult one to call, harsh. i would say, we'll start to see the momentum in q2 probably. and then probably the real volume ramp will be in the second half, yes.
harsh kumar -- piper jaffray -- analyst
great. thank you. and then, i had another one. so, we are hearing from the guys that do rf that the chinese tier 2 oems are sort of gearing up for export quality phones for european market with the 5g applications. i'm curious, they are not deploying your products for protection and even proximity sensing. would you say that that -- do you think that's a function, because you -- there are some local chinese competition in those products for you or is there something else going on or it's just an opportunity that hasn't happened for you yet?
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
i think it's an opportunity that's happening, harsh, but a lot of these guys, they don't understand the value of protection. they don't understand the value of sar yet. i think it's -- they're starting to get educated on it. and especially for outside china region, a lot of them haven't been successful in north america or europe. and so, when they start to deploy phones in these regions, i think they'll realize that they need a better quality phone, a phone that doesn't -- that hadn't met the sar regulations, for example, and in some cases phones that can last longer and are protected well. and so, there's a little bit of a learning process. if you recall, if you go back in history, there are times when customers have taken out protection -- semtech protection have taken out the protection to save cost and then realize that they're getting a lot of returns back and then they have to go back and put this protection in and things like that. so, it's not a surprise to us that not all the manufacturers will put the protection in or put the proximity sensing in for sar but they will eventually get there we think.
harsh kumar -- piper jaffray -- analyst
thank you, mohan.
operator
our next question is from hamed khorsand, bws financial. please proceed with your question.
hamed khorsan -- bws financial -- analyst
hi. just a couple of questions, one is on tri-edge, is that -- are you seeing customers take longer with the trials or is there just a delay in adopting the technology and deploying it?
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
well, no, we just -- we're just sampling now, hamed. so it's the first products, we did some demonstrations at the recent ecoc show and we are now sampling it. and so, we have -- we don't have production silicon yet. we will have in q1. so, it's really -- the timing is such that i think we have an opportunity because pam4 has been pushed out and within the data center and i think now is the time to get the customers starting to use tri-edge and testing it out in that system test. these are real system trials going on. so, once they're comfortable, i'm sure we'll see some ramp up in the second half of the year.
hamed khorsan -- bws financial -- analyst
okay. in the last quarter you were suggesting that you might see revenue in q4. that's why i was asking.
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes, i think just some kind of engineering sample revenue were very small, but i think the production ramps will be in q2 and beyond.
hamed khorsan -- bws financial -- analyst
and my last question was, regarding lora, the pipeline you're talking about is now 65% outside of china, is that due to acceleration from outside of china, or is that just purely some weakness in china, and then taking in some of the bad pipeline?
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. i would say, it's more acceleration outside china. we have -- if you recall, one of the reasons why china has been so strong for us in lora is just, they were very early adopters of the technology and use that in metering, use that in a number of different use cases in china very early on and that's why we are -- they are the more significant revenue driver for us today.
the other regions, particularly north america has been a little bit late to really understand the value of the technology and adopt the technology, but it's coming and it's -- in our view, it's going to be significantly larger once that occurs and once -- the really larger companies starts to roll out their use cases in america and europe.
hamed khorsan -- bws financial -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
our next question is from tristan gerra, baird. please proceed with your question.
tristan gerra -- robert w. baird -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. so, looking at your january quarter guidance, it's actually a bit better than seasonal. so, it sounds like it's all driven by a continued rebound in lower revenue sequentially, even though your implied revenue guidance for lora is a bit down for -- or a little bit lower than what you provided a quarter ago. is there anything else in terms of puts and takes driving the guidance?
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
no. i think, tristan, that's a fair comment. i think our sip business, the base station is still a little bit weak, although coming back up and i think pon is going to come back up, but still waiting on tenders and things like that. so -- and q4 is kind of a little bit of unknown. and then on the smartphone side, a lot depends on how much inventory samsung brings down, its regional -- usually, q4 is the quarter where it brings down its end of year inventory and just how much is going to happen and what the impacts of that are. so, i would say, those are the kind of main things we're not sure about. we'll wait and see how that plays out. obviously, the huawei ban continues and we've kind of taken that out of that guidance as well. so -- but, yes, we have a few things going positive as well and should be beyond q4. and i think certainly after q1 we expect next year to be pretty good.
tristan gerra -- robert w. baird -- analyst
okay. and then as a follow-up, i know you guide on your quarter at a time, but based on current visibility and backlog, is there any reason to believe that the april quarter will track differently than normal seasonality at this point? or is there any new program ramps that will make that seasonality, or that will make the outlook look different than normal seasonality?
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
not really. i would say, there's a lot of good positive things going on. the uncertainties are still around the kind of macro environment, the trade war stuff and china-related stuff and the huawei ban-related stuff, but outside those, i don't see there's any major reason to be concerned about the business.
tristan gerra -- robert w. baird -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
our next question is from tore svanberg, stifel. please proceed with your question.
tore svanberg -- stifel, nicolaus & co. -- analyst
yes, thank you. just two quick follow-ups. first of all, you talked about the broadband alliance sort of wifi and lora networking working closer to get there. could you maybe elaborate on what that could mean for lora adoption down the road? and maybe you can give some examples of where this is happening?
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. there is a white paper that they -- the joint alliances did and that kind of covers quite a few of the use cases and things like that. but fundamentally, the thinking is that, there are plenty of wifi boxes already established out there and wifi usually is being used for higher bandwidth internet connectivity and video streaming and those types of things. adding lora to those boxes enables a lot of smart functioning around the enterprise spaces or retail outlets and things like that. things like security, things like lighting, things like just occupancy, just smart building kind of things. so, there's a lot of use cases were lora makes a lot of sense than -- rather than using wifi, which has limitations when it comes to range and when it comes to the power consumption in the end node. so, if you think about an area where you may want to have a -- or you already have a wifi installation like an airport or something like that, but you would like to start to do iot connectivity at -- for low power end nodes, adding lora makes a lot of sense versus trying to do that in wifi.
tore svanberg -- stifel, nicolaus & co. -- analyst
very good. and my follow-up, you mentioned you're starting to see some share gains for lora at the expense of z-wave and zigbee, is that primarily in the lighting area or in other devices as well?
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
i would say, it's across the board, tore. the limitations of zigbee are really the range and the power consumption associated with the end devices. and so, where you have those requirements and you need more range or you need more lower power devices and things like that then it just -- it's only a question of time that lora will probably replace the technology, it's going to take time, but i think eventually, that's what will happen.
tore svanberg -- stifel, nicolaus & co. -- analyst
okay. thank you.

in closing, despite macro headwinds and the ongoing uncertainty from the geopolitical headwinds and weakness from the huawei ban, we remain confident in the underlying strength of the secular drivers behind our growth engines in the iot, data center, and mobile markets, and we remain confident that our overall end market, geographical, and product balance should enable us to deliver double-digit growth in fiscal year 2021.
with that, we appreciate your continued support of semtech and look forward to updating you all next quarter. thank you.

greetings and welcome to the semtech corporation fiscal year 2020 third quarter conference call. [operator instructions] please note this conference is being recorded.
i will now turn the conference over to your host, sandy harrison, director of business finance and investor relations. mr. harrison, you may begin.
sandy harrison -- director of business finance and investor relations
thank you and welcome to semtech's conference call to discuss our fiscal results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. speakers for today's call will be mohan maheswaran, semtech's president and chief executive officer; and emeka chukwu, our chief financial officer. a press release announcing our unaudited results was issued after the market close today and is available on our website at semtech.com.
today's call will include forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in these statements. for a more detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please review the safe harbor statement included in today's press release and in the other risk factors section of our most recent periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission. as a reminder, comments made on today's call are current as of only -- as of today only and semtech undertakes no obligation to update the information from this call should facts or circumstances change.
during the call, we will refer to non-gaap financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. discussion of why the management team considers such non-gaap financial measures useful, along with detailed reconciliations of such non-gaap measures to the most comparable gaap financial measures are included in today's press release. all references to financial results in mohan's and emeka's formal presentations on this call refer to non-gaap measures unless otherwise noted.
with that, i will now turn the call over to semtech's chief financial officer, emeka chukwu, emeka?
emeka n. chukwu -- chief financial officer
thank you, sandy. good afternoon, everyone. for q3 fiscal year 2020, net sales increased 3% sequentially to $141 million, which was above the midpoint of our guidance. in q3, shipments into asia represented 75% of net sales, north america represented 16%, and europe represented 9%. total direct sales represented approximately 24%, and sales to distribution represented approximately 76%. our distribution business remains balanced with 55% of the total pos coming from the high-end consumer and enterprise computing end markets, and 45% of total pos coming from the industrial and communications end markets.
bookings declined sequentially that resulted in a book-to-bill above 1. tons bookings accounted for approximately 42% of shipments during the quarter.
q3 gaap gross margin declined 70 basis points sequentially to 61.2%, due to lower absorption associated with our efforts to reduce our inventory levels.
q3 gaap operating expense decreased 8% sequentially, due to lower performance-based compensation expense and the non-recurrence of restructuring charges that occurred in q2. in q4, we expect gaap operating expense to increase between 5% to 8% sequentially, primarily due to higher share-based compensation expenses.
q3 gaap tax rate was 16.4%, down from 63.3% in q2, which reflected additional reserves resulting from the issuance of final tax regulations related to the 2017 us tax law changes. we expect our gaap tax rate for q4 to be in the range of 12% to 16%, and to remain in this range for fiscal year 2021. our gaap tax rate forecast excludes consideration of any impact from discrete items, including excess tax benefit or deficiency from the exercise of stock options.
moving on to the non-gaap results, which exclude the impact of share-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition-related and other non-recurring charges. as expected, q3 non-gaap gross margin declined 60 points sequentially to 61.6%, and we expect our q4 non-gaap gross margin to decline slightly, approximately 10 basis points at the mid-point of guidance, due to a higher mix of consumer revenue. in fiscal year 2021, we expect our non-gaap gross margin to return to more normalized levels as demand from our higher gross margin growth engines recover and overall demand improves.
q3 non-gaap operating expense decreased 2% sequentially to $52.9 million, due to lower performance-based compensation. in q4, we expect our non-gaap operating expense to be flat sequentially. for planning purposes, we are expecting our fiscal year 2021 non-gaap operating expenses to increase at roughly half the rate of revenue growth, which is consistent with our target operating model. we expect our fiscal year 2021 non-gaap tax rate to remain in the 14% to 18% range.
in q3, cash flow from operations remained solid at 24% of net sales. we repurchased approximately 447,000 shares for approximately $22.5 million during the quarter and our stock repurchase authorization now stands at approximately $138 million. we expect to continue to use our cash to opportunistically repurchase our shares, make strategic investments and pay down our debt.
in q3, accounts receivable increased 5% sequentially, due mainly to higher net sales and represented approximately 39 days of sales, which is slightly below our target range of 40 days to 45 days. net inventory in absolute dollar terms decreased 7% sequentially, and days of inventory decreased eight days to 121 days, which remains above our target range of 90 days to 100 days. in q4, we expect net inventory to be flat in dollars and days.
in summary, we were pleased to deliver q3 results above the mid-point of guidance, despite the difficult macro environment. we remain focused on execution and continue to believe the secular strength of our growth engines, position us to return to growth in fiscal year 2021.
i will now hand the call over to mohan.
mohan r. maheswaran -- president, chief executive officer & director
thank you, emeka. good afternoon, everyone. i will discuss our q3 fiscal year 2020 performance by end market and by product group and then provide our outlook for q4 of fiscal year 2020. in q3 of fiscal year 2020, net revenues increased 3% over the prior quarter to $141 million. we posted non-gaap gross margin of 61.6%, and non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $0.41.
in q3 of fiscal year 2020, the enterprise computing market increased 16% sequentially, driven by a strong rebound in pon demand and represented 31% of total net revenues. the industrial market demand decreased 2% sequentially as growth from our lora business was offset by broad industrial weakness and represented 34% of total net revenues.
net revenues from the high-end consumer market decreased 3% sequentially, and represented 25% of total net revenues. approximately 16% of high-end consumer net revenue was attributable to mobile devices, and approximately 9% was attributable to other consumer systems. net revenues from the communications end market decreased 1% over the prior quarter and represented 10% of total net revenues.
i will now discuss the performance of each of our product groups. in q3 of fiscal year 2020, net revenues from our signal integrity product group increased 6% over the prior quarter and represented 42% of total net revenues. stronger demand from the hyperscale data center and pon segments were offset by weakness from the base station and broader industrial markets.
in q3, we made significant progress with our tri-edge pam4 platform. customer interest and activity is strong as our tri-edge platform delivers low-cost, low-power, and low-latency performance ideal for emerging pam4-based optical modules. at the recent european conference on optical communications, the interoperability and power savings of our tri-edge pam4 platform was demonstrated. our first tri-edge silicon is currently sampling and in system trials in 200 gig and 400 gig pam4 applications with tier 1 data center customers. we expect to have tri-edge production silicon in q1 of fiscal year 2021, and our first pam4 production revenues in q2 of fiscal year 2021. we are very excited about the prospects for our analog pam4 solutions.
our fiberedge pmd platform also continued its positive momentum at pam4 optical module customers. we recently announced our fiberedge linear eml driver, targeting 100 gig and 400 gig pam4 optical modules. this product joins our whole platform of linear tias that are currently shipping, which are also [technical issues] targeted at 100 gig and 400 gig pam4 optical modules. our fiberedge products complement our tri-edge and clearedge cdr platforms and we expect to see fiberedge continue to ramp nicely in fiscal year 2021.
in q3 of fiscal year 2020, our pon business, which is largely driven by china, rebounded strongly following a weak first half performance. we recently introduced our 10 gig xgspon olt chipset that is expected to be a key driver for next-generation pon deployments in china. the overall pon market demand is expected to improve next year as fiber-to-the-home and enterprise deployments increase in conjunction with 5g infrastructure deployments. semtech remains the pon pmd market leader providing highly integrated solutions for 1 gig, 2.5 gig, and 10 gig pon systems.
in q3 of fiscal year 2020, demand from the wireless base station market weakened slightly over q2. while base station demand in fy'20 has been weak, we do expect both 4g and 5g deployments to be stronger in fiscal year 2021. we believe that 5g market opportunity could triple versus 4g, due to the higher 5g base station volumes and additional cdr content. our current 5g front-haul solutions are gaining good momentum with several design wins at top tier module suppliers.
our sip product group recently announced its new pro, audio, video chip platform, which is focused on transitioning the pro av industry from expensive proprietary equipment to standard 10 gigabit per second ip-based equipment, using software-defined video over ethernet or sdvoe. we believe this new chip platform will be a key enabler in driving the industry transition due to its lower power and cost. the primary target markets for our pro av business are enterprise, healthcare and e-sports infrastructure and we expect our new chip platform to enable this business to grow significantly in fiscal year 2021.
the ever-increasing demand for higher data rates is driving greater demand for semtech's signal integrity products. we expect this secular trend to continue, driven by the global expansion of hyperscale data centers. the global transition to 5g base stations, the acceleration of 10 gig pon, and the emergence of software defined video over ethernet. we expect our sip product group to benefit from this trend over the next several years, despite significant headwinds this fiscal year. for q4 of fiscal year 2020, we expect net revenues from our signal integrity product group to decline, driven by broad-based weakness across all segments.
moving on to our protection product group. in q3 of fiscal year 2020, net revenues from our protection product group were flat over the prior quarter, and represented 28% of total net revenues. our protection business benefited from strength from our mobile business and increasing penetration of the industrial and automotive markets, while our broader consumer business softened. demand for higher performance protection from the automotive segment continues to grow as an increasing number of high-speed interfaces are deployed in new vehicles. semtech devices targeted at advanced driver assist systems, controller area network and local interconnect network interfaces continue to see strong design win momentum.
in addition, we are seeing strong design win momentum from all the leading smartphone manufacturers across the globe with the exception of china smartphones, where our position continues to be negatively impacted by the huawei ban. in q4 of fiscal year 2020, we expect our protection business to be down slightly, due to the customer end of year inventory reductions at our korean smartphone customers.
turning to our wireless and sensing product group. in q3 of fiscal year 2020, net revenues from our wireless and sensing product group increased 1% sequentially, led by growth in our lora business and represented 30% of total net revenues. the adoption of lora in numerous new iot used cases across the globe demonstrates tremendous value of lora in the fast-emerging lpwan market. in q3, notable additions to the lora alliance included amazon, intel, and dish, who are all respective leaders in their industries. also, in q3, the wireless broadband alliance together with the lora alliance, released a joint white paper articulating numerous use cases that require both wifi and lorawan connectivity. the primary use cases included smart building, smart home, smart city, smart transportation, and smart asset tracking applications.
we are already seeing new opportunities emerge globally driving lorawan and wifi functionality to be integrated into the same gateway, and we will comment on these opportunities and wins on future earnings calls. some examples of recent lora use cases include, alibaba released its beagle gps-free tracker system based on lorawan that provides consistent geolocation data without gps or cellular connectivity, simplifying deployment at very low-cost and power.
radio bridge, an industry-leading supplier of iot sensors, released its new lorawan-based sensor platform. the armed sensor enables the tracking of accurate real-time data for a variety of industrial applications, including oil and gas, air quality, and utility monitoring. digimondo, a leading provider of secure iot software solutions announced a new end-to-end smart utilities starter package based on lorawan, which provides customers the software and hardware necessary to create smarter, more efficient, and lower cost utility networks.
ihm pacific, a developer of iot technologies for the smart utility and building segments together with andrea informatique, developed a new lorawan-based electricity metering solution for utilities and sub-metering use cases targeted at asia and europe. and cahors group, a leading solutions provider for smart energy grids announced its new lorawan-based sentinel system that monitors faults and predicts failures in overhead voltage lines.
in addition to these use cases, numerous other partners announced solutions targeting smart home, smart utility, smart agriculture, and industrial iot applications. along with the increasing number of use cases, lora's momentum is also being underscored by the key lora metrics we track. our key metrics update includes the number of countries with lora networks increased to more than 83 countries. by the end of fiscal year 2020, we expect around 90 countries to have lora networks, which is up from 70 at the end of fiscal year 2019. the number of public or private lora network operators increased in q3 to approximately 123, and we now expect 133 lora network operators by the end of fiscal year 2020, up from 101 at the end of fiscal year 2019.
the estimated number of lora gateways deployed increased to more than 500,000. these gateways will support approximately 2 billion connected end nodes. we expect the number of lora gateways deployed to exceed 550,000 by the end of fiscal year 2020.
the cumulative number of lora end nodes deployed increased to 117 million and is trending to 135 million by the end of fiscal year 2020. and the lora opportunity pipeline is now over $500 million with an additional $200 million of leads feeding the opportunity pipeline. we anticipate that on average 40% to 50% of this pipeline will eventually convert to full deployment over a 24-month timeline.
our pipeline of opportunities remains geographically well-balanced with over 65% of the opportunities coming from the americas and europe and includes a growing number of consumer use cases with the volumes could be significantly higher and could move to deployment more rapidly than those use cases in the industrial markets. several of these volume use cases moved out from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021, and as a result we are expecting our lora-enabled revenues to end fiscal year 2020 between $70 million and $80 million. we expect to exit the year at a quarterly run rate above the high-end of this range.
despite the weaker-than-anticipated fiscal year 2020, based on a record lora pos in q3 and a continued positive global adoption of lora, we still anticipate a 40% cagr over the next five years as lora becomes the de facto standard for lpwan use cases in what we expect to be a multi-billion-unit industry.
in q3 of fiscal year 2020, demand for our proximity sensing platforms was stable. while our huawei smartphone business will continue to be a challenge, our proximity sensing business is benefiting from increasingly stringent global sar regulations as health risks associated with increasingly powerful 5g radios become fully understood. over the next few years, we expect the majority of smartphones and wearable devices shipped to north america and europe to have sar sensors included in their system designs.
for q4 of fiscal year 2020, we expect net revenues from our wireless and sensing product group to be down slightly, a stronger lora-enabled demand will be offset by broad-based market weakness.
moving on to new products and design wins. in q3 of fiscal year 2020, we released 24 new products and achieved 2,381 new design wins. in q3, our disty pos also achieved a new record.
now, let me discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. we are currently estimating q4 net revenues to be between $130 million and $140 million. to attain the midpoint of our guidance range or approximately $135 million, we needed net terms orders of approximately 35% at the beginning of q4. we expect our q4 non-gaap earnings to be between $0.33 and $0.39 per diluted share. our q4 guidance assumes no further direct shipments to huawei in this fiscal quarter.
i will now hand the call back to the operator, and sandy, emeka, and i will be happy to answer any questions. operator?

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of christopher rolland with susquehanna financial group. please proceed with your question.
christopher rolland -- susquehanna financial group -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for the question. yeah, just any more details on lora. what percentage of lora today is china and where did it peak out. i'm just trying to get a sense of how this is diversifying outside of china and what gives you confidence in your outlook looking forward? thanks.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
well, lora you know used to be about 60% of the revenue was from china. i think it's still close to that. it's definitely diversifying now and the opportunity pipeline has, as i mentioned about 65% of the opportunity pipeline is outside china. so that diversification across the different regions is happening. i would say though that china from being a headwind for us last year continues to actually be quite strong as we look at it now. bookings are stronger and i think china in general may be the first region to kind of overcome all the coronavirus issues and as we see capacity coming back online, that seems to be strengthening the demand in china. so it's difficult to call out how the next year will play out, but i think going forward, definitely with the opportunities being more geographically balanced i think, we'll expect to get a little bit more, more of a balanced revenue geographically over the next few years here.
christopher rolland -- susquehanna financial group -- analyst
great and then your guidance, it kind of looks like it's in line with others in terms of the effects from the virus. you also called out that this was probably mostly supply chain and less about demand disruption. maybe you can talk about the supply chain, what you're seeing there, is it upstream, is it downstream and also what gives you confidence that demand comes back and that there is no actual demand disruption in the end. thanks.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i would say first of all, i don't think yet we have really seen any major supply chain issues. i think what's clear is that china as a region struggling with the coronavirus and with the move out shift of chinese new year, that impacted the overall demand for sure and it's slowly coming back online. maybe not somewhere around between 70% and 80% capacity i think. so the demand fully isn't there yet, but all indications prior to the coronavirus was that demand for q1 was going to be strong. it's still remaining relatively strong i would say. bookings have been pretty healthy. our turns required is fairly low compared to what we've done historically. so that all gives us a fairly good feeling and then also when we see the different segments we play in, we see data center strength and we see 5g infrastructure strength and we see generally infrastructural areas doing quite well plus one would anticipate some type of stimulus both in asia and maybe in other countries that will again impacts infrastructure. so yeah, we're anticipating once the the demand environment settles around after the coronavirus kind of stabilizes, we're expecting the demand to pick up again.
christopher rolland -- susquehanna financial group -- analyst
thanks for the color.

your next question comes from the line of quinn bolton with needham & company. please proceed with your question.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
hey guys, i just wanted to follow up on that, it sounds like you haven't seen any major supply chain constraints. bookings are starting to recover especially in china as coronavirus there seems to be getting a little bit more under control. so i guess when we look at your april quarter guidance and the $10 million that you adjusted for coronavirus, where did that come from? is that just sort of lost demand as factories were offline or just the near-term demand destruction within the china market in the month of february or are you anticipating potential cancellations or push outs or something in the march and april order book that you may not have seen yet but you're just being conservative and allowing for some potential push outs or cancellations over the next couple of months and then i've got a couple of follow-ups.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, quinn, it's a little bit of everything you said actually it's -- some data points suggest that some of the pon tenders and proof of concepts and lora being slightly pushed out. so we see a little bit of push outs of those. we haven't seen any cancellations or revenue demand push outs -- revenue push outs. we've seen more indications that things that just kind of being delayed. clearly there is some softness, as i said because of chinese new year was delayed and some delay in just bringing up capacity in china, so that impacted it and clearly there is some nervousness and uncertainty around the coronavirus around the world and so i think all of those kind of gave us food for thought as we were planning our q1 number and we anticipate a kind of approximately $10 million impact, which is reflected in our numbers.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
great. and i just wanted to switch over to the data center market. it sounds like you're expecting a stronger year in fiscal '21. just wanted to confirm that i heard that correctly and a follow-up on the tri-edge, it sounds like you got your first production order. so congratulations on that. just wondering as you look through fiscal '21, does that ramp to any kind of meaningful level. i mean could it be a few million bucks a quarter by the end of the year. could it be larger or is it a kind of a slower ramp? any sort of magnitude of how quickly you think that business takes off could be -- would be helpful. thank you.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, quinn. the -- actually the nrz cdrs as i mentioned, we're still, that's doing extremely well, which suggests to us that the only the pam4 stuff will be a little bit slower, but i think one of the compelling value propositions of tri-edge is the lower power and lower cost. so a lot will depend on how fast the customers want to transition i think, but we had planned on a stronger kind of second half. so maybe $3 million, $4 million in the second half of the year and then really ramping up next year.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
great, thank you.

your next question comes from the line of karl ackerman with cowen and company. please proceed with your question.
karl ackerman -- cowen and company -- analyst
good afternoon, gentlemen. two questions if i may. i know you guys don't want to go out on the limb and talk about a preliminary guide for fiscal '21, but i'm curious to the extent you could comment or willing to comment if it's too early to suggest that you can grow top line this year just given the strong growth opportunity across lora and your data center business and despite your view that opex will grow half the rate [phonetic] of sales. i guess how flexible can opex be in the event growth turns out to be a little bit less than your current expectations and i have a follow-up?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
so let me take the revenue line and then emeka can talk about opex. i mean if we look at across our portfolio data center, i expect to still grow this year. it comes off a relatively light fiscal year '20. we're expecting 10 gig pon to grow this year mostly driven by china, but other regions as well. so that's our anticipation. it may not be as fast because of the coronavirus in the first half, but i expect second half for sure. 5g infrastructure we know is being pushed out there, launched in every region of the world and so we're expecting base station infrastructure to grow versus last year. again, the timing is the key question. and then of course, if we look at our iot business and lora, that's -- we still expecting that to grow. we have the pipeline and lora remember many of the use cases are really energy efficiency, productivity enhancements, cost reduction kind of approaches and even smart health kind of segment. so lora should in many ways still be able to grow i think regardless of what transpires at least from an annual standpoint and then in our protection business, as you know we are slightly diversifying that business, diversifying both in the mobile area geographically and industrial area and so we are expecting that to also do reasonably well if the general macro does well and distributors replenish on their inventory at least again in the second half. and so, pretty much across the board, we are seeing all of our product groups -- we're expecting growth. of course, a lot depends on what transpires over the next quarter here with the coronavirus. the indications are that in china things are improving and certainly we're seeing that from a demand standpoint. how sustainable that is and how over what period of time, we'll just have to wait and see, but at the moment i think we're more positive than negative on it.
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so karl, with regards to the operating expenses. one of the things that we've actually been able to do very well in the history of the company is manage our operating expenses in line with what the top line is doing. one of the key things that i've always tried to call investors attention to is that about 20% of operating expenses is variable and so we do have a few opportunities that we can modulate depending on what's going on with the top line. having said that though, we are really very excited about some of the growth opportunities that we have within the company, the investments we're making in those areas and so we still believe and the expectation is that those growth drivers would start to come to fruition right here and that there wouldn't be any need to take any drastic actions with regards to operating expenses.
karl ackerman -- cowen and company -- analyst
i appreciate that, mohan and emeka, thank you. for my follow-up if i may, double clicking on sort protection for a moment, are there new opportunities you see growing protection and proximity sensing beyond your key south korean oem. you had mentioned on prior calls design wins around wearables. so, i was curious if any updated thoughts there. thank you.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes, we actually, that's been a strategy of ours for a while. we've obviously been strong in korea for some time, but a few years ago, we made the conscious decision that we're going to really go aggressively try to diversify and get smartphone business in china, smartphone business in north america, proximity sensing business as well as protection business in these areas and then look at smart phones and wearables and accessories and i would say we've been successful with all of those strategies. i mean if i look at the business today, we have a fairly balanced geographical spread of protection in mobile devices in korea, in china, in asia and also in north america, u.s. specifically and then also proximity sensing where it used to be just korea is also starting to now spread its wings into asia and into other u.s. manufacturers and not only in smartphones, but also in wearables as well. so that is our strategy. it continues to be a strategy and we are being quite successful with that strategy.
operator
your next question comes from the line of tore svanberg with stifel. please proceed with your question. yes, thank you. let me start with the housekeeping. i think you mentioned 27% turns. where is that number today kind of one -- more than a month since the quarter.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
tore, we can't give you that number, but what i can tell you is that the bookings have been pretty strong and we feel very good about where we are.
operator
okay. so it's not like you've seen strong bookings at the beginning of the quarter and those are now tailing off. you apparently [phonetic] seeing steady linear bookings.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
correct.
operator
okay, thank you. second question on lora. so you gave us all the metrics for the fiscal year. thank you for that by the way. a lot of great information. it just seems like in all the categories, you know, there is growth. obviously, your revenues did not grow. so can you just talk a little bit about that. i mean is this because of certain china customers going to nb [phonetic] iot or and help us understand a little bit why your business was down while all the other metrics were up for the year?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think part of the thing you have to remember, which is why i mentioned it tore, our pos did grow 7% and that's really the measure of deployments of end nodes, right. so our revenues, when we ship and we may calendar revenue when we ship in distribution, but if there's excess channel inventory or something like that, then we may not -- you may not get the full picture. so that's one thing to remember. the second thing to remember is that the reason i give out all these metrics is to indicate momentum and momentum is really the indicator of future revenue. when you look at how many gateways are deployed, use cases. how many end nodes are being deployed or how many countries are being deployed, the assumption is that customers are going to deploy once they've completed their proof of concepts and they go to full implementation, they're going to deploy more end nodes and more devices and that will drive revenue. so the timing of the revenues is quite challenging for us, especially when we had like we did last year one region of the world like china initially really in the first half just really struggled and kind of it was difficult to catch it up in the second half of the year. we don't think that will happen this year. we think that's going to be a little bit more stable and we're projecting reasonable growth this year and beyond.
operator
okay. just one last question, your pipeline revenue increased $200 million year-over-year. i was just hoping you could talk a little bit about the mix of that $200 million again from a geographic perspective. i do appreciate that there is a much higher percentage outside of china, but if you could add a little bit more color on north america versus u.s. versus other countries. that'll be great.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, let's see, so i would say about 30% is americas. that includes north america, south america. about 36% is europe and then the rest 11% about 11%, 12% is rest of asia and japan, korea, and then about 23% -- 25% is china, something like that, those are approximate figures tore, but that will give you an idea of the opportunity pipeline.
operator
that's really helpful. thank you. your next question comes from the line of gary mobley with wells fargo. please proceed with your question. hey, guys. i guess it's probably worth saying congratulations to a strong finish to the year and perhaps a better than feared start to this current fiscal year '21. my question relates to your turns business requirement embedded in your first quarter guidance. if my calculation is correct, you're assuming roughly $10 million to $12 million in lower turns requirement for the -- embedded in the midpoint of the revenue guide and i'm assuming much of that is related to huawei. so my question is did you generate any turns business from huawei in the just reported fourth quarter and what's sort of a best case scenario in terms of what you can actually shift to huawei based on the current restrictions?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
so remember, gary -- so our guidance assumes no more shipments to huawei. so we don't need any more turns to huawei to get -- to achieve our number. having said that, i think we plan on shipping every quarter about $10 million to huawei. i think that's what we did last quarter at -- about $10 million last quarter and it's a mix of all the different products, and obviously it takes into consideration what we can and cannot ship and if the restriction is further squeezed, then we have to relook at it, but that's the reason why as we give out our guidance i made the decision not to communicate that we don't need any more turns from huawei to make our numbers because we just don't know exactly what's going to happen with the restriction. as far as we're concerned, we're just assuming that the restriction will continue as it is.
operator
yeah, sure ok. and did i see a roughly $2 million restructuring in the non-gaap reconciliation and what does that relate to? is that an actual headcount reduction or are you refocusing your investment in perhaps a different area?
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, no, it has mostly to do with an actuarial valuation of our defined benefit obligations and a few other things, but there was no restructuring in terms of letting people go and stuff like that during the quarter.
operator
got you. okay, thank you guys. your next question comes from the line of tristan gerra with baird & company. please proceed with your question. hi, good afternoon. from the $10 million impact in the current quarter guidance from china, is that pretty much allocated across all the businesses you have in china or would you say a majority of that is actually related to lower and in general, how much of a step back you think the situation in china is impacting your revenue growth assumption for lower revenue this fiscal year.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
so tristan, the $10 million is really a coronavirus impact and i think it actually a majority of it is impacting our signal integrity product group, at least probably 60% and then maybe the rest of it is split between our protection and our wireless and sensing business. so it's a broad impact that we've estimated there and then the second part of your question is, we believe that lora enabled business is going to do very well this year and china is going to come back and already we are seeing indications of that. it may take you know, the first quarter, as i mentioned because of chinese new year and because companies are not coming back at full capacity in china and because some of the proof of concepts are definitely going to be delayed because of that and just you know travel and people not being able to move around in china as much is going to push out some of the activity. that's why i mentioned that proof of concepts and some of the new tenders and things like that might be shifted, but i don't think it changes the underlying demand or the need out there and so that's why we feel that any loss of demand in q1 probably will pick up assuming things get back to normal will be picked up in the second half.
operator
okay. that's useful and then as my follow-up question, in your quarter guidance, what changes in distribution inventories are you assuming, if any, are you assuming that inventories stay flat on relative basis at this stage or is your assumption for point of sale different from what's embedded in your guidance for this year [phonetic].
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
no, i think it's the same assumption. pos has been doing quite well. as i mentioned, certainly for lora, it grew last year and so that's a positive sign. the one thing to remember is if the supply chain is impacted by coronavirus and we can't get enough material or lead times extend out, i would expect us to try to actually increase our inventory levels, both internally and in our channel, but at this point in time i don't think there's any reason to do that. i think at the moment, we would expect the same type of pos and channel inventory numbers.
operator
great, thank you. your next question comes from the line of craig ellis with b riley, fbr. please proceed with your question. yeah, thanks for taking the question. and guys, thanks for all the information on the call regarding lora and the other businesses. mohan, i just wanted to start with a question with lora. first, just asking about the midpoint of this year's revenues at $105 million. as you've talked about the business potentially picking up some high volume design wins, do you forecast that any of that type of revenue conversion would be in the $105 million or how do we think about when some of those higher volume wins might hit?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we're anticipating higher volume kind of home consumer wins to be more second half, craig and really they are not yet i think heavily in the numbers. so i would say that there is upside there, but the current numbers this guidance assumes continuation of the good progress in most of the smart metering, smart building, smart agriculture kind of more longer-term kind of use cases and industrial iot and things like that. so, it's still pretty good growth, but obviously smart home and smart consumer starts to play and that could impact it and certainly, we believe that in the second half we'll start to be able to see some of that.
operator
that's helpful and then the second question is really about the endpoints of the range. so at $90 million, sales would be up about $16 million or 22%, at 120 [phonetic] $46 million or 62% year-on-year and as we look at those endpoints, what are some of the bigger swing factors from low-end to high-end. is it macro, is it some of the high volume items before macro, if you can just help us sort that out, that would be quite helpful.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, the macro, i don't think really plays into it other than if there is a really a big shift in something like we saw china first half of last year. i don't think that it is a such a huge impact. i think the bigger impact is in conversions, the pocs, the proof of concepts that the pipeline that we have, which is fairly substantial it's converting those into deployments and real revenue and we've already seen that that can be pushed out sometimes and obviously with the coronavirus and things like that, we are seeing a little bit of a delay in some of the proof of concepts and things like that. so i think that's probably the bigger impact than -- over anything else at the moment. we just have to wait and see how it plays out, but certainly in the second half we're anticipating that most of the kind of macro issues would have gone away, the coronavirus hopefully would be stabilized at least by that point and i think we should be in good shape to see kind of a return to regular -- what we consider normal growth for our iot business and lora business.
operator
thank you. and then a couple of clarifications for emeka. emeka regarding the new product impact to opex in the fiscal fourth quarter. was that in assets or was that something else? can you just clarify what's going on there?
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. it mostly has to do with just the timing last year where we [indecipherable]. so it had to do mostly with the mask sets.
operator
great and then with regards to gross margin, i think you'd indicated from the first quarter, you would expect gross margin to rise through the year. can you provide some further color giving us a sense for the magnitude of increase that's possible and it seems like signal integrity should build quite strongly through the year, is that really the primary variable or would it be the degree to which lora is either at the low-end or the high end of the range or other factors. thank you.
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so when we look at gross margins and i'm actually excited about it, because when i look at the growth drivers that we've talked about, we've talked about lora we've talked about in data center even within protection we've talked about the industrial applications, hoping to see a lot of growth out of that for protection. so all of those things that are things that are supposed to help drive our gross margin expansion. the only thing that we have as a headwind for gross margin expansion, if you will, is the fact that overall demand is at lower levels, right. so we still have some manufacturing equipment and people in our operations with some fixed expenses that we have to absorb. so my expectation would be that a combination of more revenue from our growth drivers and then seeing overall demand coming back, that should be pretty good for our gross margins as to the exact number at this point, i'll probably expect us to head more toward the 62% and hopefully depending on how things proceed we might actually exceed -- go above 62%.
operator
that's helpful guys. thank you. your next question comes from the line of mitch steves with rbc capital markets. please proceed with your question. hey, thanks. i had two questions. the first one, just to clarify just on the guidance for the $10 million. i just want to be clear about what's in there. is that entirely china or you guys making assumption that some demand will erode in the other geographies outside of china?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
that's the total -- that's the global picture. so it's not just china, i would say that because china was the first to be exposed to the coronavirus, the impact is more easily measurable because they delayed new year by a week it's been -- it's taken time for their capacity to come back online whereas other regions haven't really been impacted yet and i think that's still potentially to come, but i think across the board what we've seen is $10 million is about the right number for our q1 demand.
operator
okay and then the second one is just on the overall kind of full year. i realize you guys are not going to guide a full year, but how do you -- how are you guys thinking about the smartphone shipment environment now for calendar year '20?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah that's -- smartphones is a tough one, mitch mostly because we're actually quite optimistic that the changing work landscape as people become more mobile and maybe do less social interaction will drive a need for more devices, particularly phones and tablets and pcs and that type of stuff and currently the demand looks looks fairly healthy from what we see. so, we're getting more positive i think not only the device -- mobile devices, smartphones, but also on kind of other peripheral wearables and accessories and that type of thing.
operator
perfect, thank you. your next question comes from the line of harsh kumar with piper sandler. please proceed with your question. yeah. hey, guys. thank you for squeezing me in. two questions. couple of the companies that have sort of pre-announced have talked about demand in china going back to sort of normal levels or pre-coronavirus levels. i was curious if you have also seen that. then i've got another question on lora.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i would say harsh that it's definitely improving. i'm not sure i would say it's back to pre-virus levels, but i think it's improving. bookings are strong, the indications are strong, indications of potential stimulus is also there for infrastructure and as we know, typically when china invests in infrastructure, it's normally advanced technology kind of stuff, so we'd expect 5g and pon and data center and iot and those types of things to get a heavy influx of monies and so that would be helpful, but yes, i would say that it's improving. remember the coronavirus impact that china is just coming out of that. i mean it is improving and so they're not back at full capacity yet and i think that's important to understand. so i don't think the demand levels are quite what they were. i would say they're at best 70% to 80% at the moment.
operator
okay and then mohan, thank you for all the color you gave on lora by funnel types et cetera. maybe you could talk about what kind of applications you're seeing a pickup in or expect to see a pickup in this year, would it be mostly consumer or will it be mostly industrial and is this the year -- calendar year, call it 2020 that we see the u.s. inflection.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes, so the use cases i think are still more in metering, smart building, smart environment, smart water industrial iot kind of applications harsh at the moment, but the pipeline of opportunities we have suggests that we're going to add to that very quickly in the smart home area and i think that's predominantly a u.s. driven segment, some in europe and then i think supply chain logistics, smart logistics, which is predominantly a european driven region. europe is the major driver for that segment and then smart city which is fairly broadly spread. so encouraging thing about lora really is it really truly is a geographical -- a true global technology. we see use cases across every single region including likes of rest of asia and australia and taiwan and malaysia and singapore and so very, very broad range of applications and a very broad geographical base and that's part of the goodness about the opportunity we have. of course, there are some really big opportunities that will be the catalyst and as i mentioned before, when they happen. i think you'll see the impact of it, but at this point in time, i would just say that they are more u.s. based.
operator
got it. thanks, mohan. your next question comes from the line of hamed khorsand with bws financial. please proceed with your question. hi, this is vahid for hamed. thanks for taking my question. first one, you were mentioning the lora growth out of china, i was wondering if you could provide some color on what the growth looks like outside of china right now.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
lora growth outside of china is looking positive. i think i would say that it's relatively small i mean depending, which region you look at, but china is still the biggest revenue driver for lora and so that's why i focused on it, but yeah, across the board, i would say lora is still doing quite well from a gateways deployed standpoint, from a number of networks deployed, the type of use cases we're seeing, the opportunity pipeline as i just mentioned is very broad geographically spread. in fact, if i take out -- china is about 23% to 25%, if you take out china, the rest of the 75% is spread across the different regions with europe being the second largest region and then americas and then the rest of the rest of asia.
operator
okay, thank you for that and then the next question you've been saying about how there is -- you're seeing the recovery in china. i'm just curious what trends you're seeing outside of china, italy and america and europe in general, the last few days.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
outside china, as i say, i think it's a little bit difficult to call what demand -- what's going to happen with demand. we don't see a slowdown in data center market at the moment, we don't see a slowdown in iot, but i think that in general, the u.s. and europe are just kind of getting to grips with the coronavirus and so we may see some softness there i think and that's kind of why we've guided -- taken out $10 million of our q1 guidance is really to try to ensure we encompass any of that because there will be some, we don't know exactly how much, right.
operator
okay, thank you very much. ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question and answer session and i would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
so in closing, our fiscal year 2020 proved a challenging year for semtech. we believe the strength of the secular drivers behind our key growth engines remain intact. we enter fiscal year '21 with a number of exciting new product platforms targeted at the data center, internet of things, and mobile segments. given our diverse product offering, balanced end-market approach, and strong customer relationships, we expect to see another strong financial performance in fy '21. with that. we appreciate your continued support of semtech and look forward to updating you all next quarter. thank you.

emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, sandy. good afternoon everyone. for q4 fiscal year '20, net sales decreased 2% sequentially to $138 million, which was above the midpoint of our guidance. fiscal year '20 net sales decreased 13% over the prior year driven by the challenging microenvironment the overall industry faced for most of the year fueled by the china tariffs and the huawei ban. in q4, shipments into asia represented 78% of net sales. north america represented 13% and europe represented 9%. total direct sales represented approximately 24% and sales through distribution was approximately 76%. our distribution business remains balanced with 55% of the total pos coming from the high-end consumer and enterprise computing end markets and 45% of total pos coming from the industrial and communications end markets. while bookings declined slightly over the prior quarter, book-to-bill was above 1. those bookings accounted for approximately 37% of shipments during the quarter.
q4 gaap gross margin came in as expected at 61.1% and we expect our q1 gross margin to be relatively flat sequentially. q4 gaap operating expense increased 8% sequentially due to higher pension expense, share-based compensation expense, and new product expense. in q1, we expect gaap operating expense to decrease between 8% to 12% sequentially primarily due to lower amortization of intangibles, lower share-based compensation expense, lower pension expense, and lower new product expenses. q4 gaap interest and other expenses increased to $3.1 million from $1.5 million in q3 driven by the impairment of some of our minority investments and the write-off of previously capitalized debt issuance costs from our refinanced debt. q4 gaap tax rate was approximately 59%, up from 16% in q3 primarily due to the impact of an internal asset transfer between tax jurisdictions. note that there was no significant cash tax impact from this action. we expect our gaap tax rate for q1 of fiscal year '21 to be in the range of 23% to 27%. our gaap tax rate forecast excludes consideration of any impact from discrete items including excess tax benefit or deficiency from the exercise of stock options.
moving on to the non-gaap results, which exclude the impact of share-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition-related and other non-recurring charges. as expected, q4 non-gaap gross margin declined slightly over the prior quarter to 61.5% and we expect our q1 non-gaap gross margin to be generally flat with q4 levels. in fiscal year '21, we expect our non-gaap gross margin to strengthen through the year as demand from our higher margin growth engines recover and overall demand improves. q4 non-gaap operating expense increased 2% sequentially to $53.9 million due to higher new product expenses. in q1, we expect non-gaap operating expense to be flat to down 4% sequentially mostly due to the timing of new product expenses. for fiscal year '21, we expect our non-gaap operating expenses to increase at roughly half the rate of revenue growth, which is consistent with our target operating model. in q4, our non-gaap tax rate decreased to approximately 9% reflecting a favorable mix of regional income. we expect our q1 and fiscal year '21 non-gaap tax rates to remain in the 14% to 16% range.
in q4, cash flow from operations increased to 33% of net sales, up from 24% in q3. we repurchased approximately 546,000 shares or $27.6 million of stock in q4 and approximately 1.5 million shares or $70.2 million of stock in fiscal year '20 and our stock repurchase authorization now stands at approximately $110 million. we expect to continue to use our cash to opportunistically repurchase our shares, make strategic investments, and pay down debt. in q4, our cash and investments balance was $293 million and our debt balance was approximately $197 million resulting in a net cash position of $96 million. in q4, accounts receivable represented 41 days of sales, which is at the lower-end of our target range of 40 days to 45 days. net inventory was sequentially flat at 121 days and remains above our target range of 90 days to 100 days. in q1, we expect net inventory to increase slightly because of the macro-driven uncertainties in demand.
in summary, we were pleased to deliver strong q4 results despite all the macro uncertainties. looking ahead, we believe that our secular growth drivers of hyperscale datacenter, 5g infrastructure and internet of things, our stable gross margin, our well-controlled operating expenses, our strong cash flow generation, and our efficient capital allocation provides us the platform for a strong financial performance in fiscal year '21. i will now hand the call over to mohan.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, emeka. good afternoon everyone. i will discuss our q4 fiscal year '20 performance by end market and by product group, discuss our fiscal year '20 performance, and then provide our outlook for q1 of fiscal year '21. in q4 of fiscal year '20, net revenues decreased 2% over the prior quarter to $138 million. softer demand from the industrial and consumer end markets was offset by stronger demand from the enterprise computing and communications end markets, which contributed to better than seasonal results for q4. we posted non-gaap gross margin of 61.5% and non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $0.40. in q4 of fiscal year '20 net revenues from the enterprise computing end market increased sequentially and represented 32% of total net revenues. net revenues from the communications end market increased sequentially and represented 10% of total net revenues. net revenues from the industrial end market decreased sequentially and also represented 32% of total net revenues. net revenues from the high-end consumer market decreased slightly over the prior quarter and represented 26% of total revenues. approximately 18% of high-end consumer net revenues was attributable to mobile devices and approximately 8% was attributable to other consumer systems.
i will now discuss the performance of each of our product groups. in q4 of fiscal year '20, net revenues from our signal integrity product group increased 1% sequentially and represented 43% of total revenues. stronger demand from the data center and base station segments contributed to the sequential growth. in q4, demand from the data center market increased nicely over the prior quarter led by record revenues from our cdr platforms. strong demand for our clearedge cdrs used in 100 gig nrz modules was driven by our hyperscale and cloud customers. we expect this strength to continue throughout fiscal year '21. interest in our new tri-edge pam4 cdrs remains very high. this week we received our first production order for our tri-edge products and we already have numerous customers going through system tests with our latest tri-edge pam4 silicon. the advantages of analog pam4 implementations are very clear as they are lower power, lower cost, and lower latency provides our data center customers with a compelling advantage over existing solutions. we expect to see our tri-edge revenues ramp throughout the year and hyperscale data center customers deploying 100 gig, 200 gig and 400 gig optical modules that require lower latency and lower power. the open eye msa consortium that was formed to support and promote interoperability of analog cdr platforms has seen its membership more than double to 40 plus companies since its founding and includes key chip companies as well as software and systems vendors of next-generation pam4 optical systems.
our fiberedge pmd devices also continue winning designs in pam4 modules where we have collaborated with dsp providers to deliver optical module vendors a highly optimized solution. we recently announced the production of our newest quad linear 100 gig per channel tia platform for 400 gig optical modules targeted at hyperscale data centers. our fiberedge products complement our clearedge and tri-edge cdr platforms, which we expect to continue to ramp this year. following a relatively weak fiscal year '20 performance, we expect to see much stronger growth from the hyperscale data center market in fiscal year '21.
in q4 of fiscal year '20, our pon business declined sequentially. semtech remains a leading supplier to the pon market providing comprehensive offerings for 1 gig, 2.5 gig and 10 gig pon, olt, and onu systems. recent macro events in china have limited our near-term visibility, but we expect the ongoing rollout of 10 gig pon deployments to accelerate in conjunction with 5g infrastructure build-outs and to drive growth in our pon business in fiscal year '21. we anticipate a 100% increase in 10 gig pon deployments in fiscal year '21 driven by china, europe, and the u.s. in q4 of fiscal year '20, demand from our wireless base station market increased sequentially as 5g infrastructure deployments start to accelerate. our clearedge cdr platforms are gaining solid momentum in the 5g market and we have began early shipments of our clearedge cdrs into 5g base station front-haul and mid-haul optical modules. we expect both our clearedge and tri-edge platforms to gain momentum in 5g base stations as 5g infrastructure deployments increase globally. in fiscal year '21, we expect our base station revenues to increase as we expect to see continued 4g spending and a meaningful increase in spending for 5g where our market opportunity could triple versus 4g. the ever-increasing demand for higher data rates by data centers, passive optical networks, and wireless broadband networks is driving greater demand for semtech's signal integrity product platforms, which is a secular trend we expect to continue for some time and we remain very confident in our strategy and position in our target markets. in q1 of fiscal year '21, we expect net revenues from our signal integrity product group to decline driven by softer demand across all segments driven primarily by the impact of the coronavirus. we do anticipate that this temporary demand softness will turn into stronger demand in the second half of fiscal year '21.
moving on to our protection product group. in q4 of fiscal year '20, net revenues from our protection products group declined 6% sequentially and represented 27% of total revenues. in q4 of fiscal year '20, our high-end consumer protection business experienced typical seasonal inventory reductions. while near-term smartphone demand has been impacted by macro events, the prospects for our protection platforms in mobile devices, displays, and accessories remains positive as 5g smartphones integrate higher performance interfaces and more advanced lithography devices. our protection business continues to benefit from its successful diversification into key industrial markets including automotive, iot, and broad-based industrial applications. in q4, our protection product group announced the latest member of its rclamp platform, a multi-line protection array that delivers outstanding protection for a broad range of high-speed interfaces and ports in industrial, iot, and telecommunications applications. in q1 of fiscal year '21, we are expecting our protection revenues to be approximately flat.
turning to our wireless and sensing product group, in q4 of fiscal year '20, net revenues from our wireless and sensing product group decreased 2% sequentially and represented 30% of total revenues. q4 was another quarter of strong achievements by our lora business. we recently announced several new use cases and partnerships that demonstrate the benefits and efficiencies of lora. a few of these announcements in q4 included wilhelmsen, the largest marine networking operator on the planet announced the use of 2.4 gigahertz lora to deliver iot solutions to the maritime shipping industry on both land and at sea. lora will be deployed in ships for predictive maintenance, temperature monitoring, asset management, and asset tracking. smart seoul network or s-net announced a lorawan network to provide smart parking, smart street lighting solutions, and geolocation use cases in seoul, korea. helium announced a new nationwide lorawan network in the u.s. their current network supports over 745 cities in the u.s. nsoft, an indian solutions provider is using lora to convert order metering solutions to new advanced metering infrastructure reducing waste and cost while increasing efficiency and l-measure [phonetic] a utility metering developer and clogie [phonetic], a maker of long range sensor networks developed a new line of prepaid smart meters based on lora technology that tracks and reports usage data in real-time for precise billing and reduced energy wastage. these are just a few examples of the many new use cases introduced during the quarter that demonstrate the value of lora technology in enabling a smarter and more sustainable planet. in q4 of fiscal year '20, demand for our proximity sensing platforms increased as global rf regulations and awareness of the dangers of rf signals continues to increase. we expect our proximity sensing business to grow in fiscal year '21 as we see solid design win progress in new 5g smartphones where there is an increase in the number of high-performance radios used. for q1 of fiscal year '21, we expect net revenues from our wireless and sensing product group to decrease due to the impact of the coronavirus.
moving on to new products and design wins, in q4 of fiscal year '20, we released 26 new products and achieved 2,184 new design wins. now, let me comment briefly on our fiscal year '20 performance. in fiscal year '20, net revenues declined 13% over the prior year's record performance driven primarily by geopolitical headwinds, which negatively impacted all of our product groups. in fiscal year '20, we have 74 new product releases and achieved another design win record of 9,909 new design wins. in fy '20, our signal integrity product group introduced several new disruptive platforms that should contribute to our long-term growth. these include our tri-edge pam4 cdrs and fiberedge pmd platforms for the data center and 5g wireless markets, our 10 gig pon platforms and our new software defined video over ethernet platform targeted at the pro av market. in fy '20, our protection product group continued its diversification into new broad based industrial verticals including the automotive and iot markets where the increasing use of advanced lithography devices are making systems more susceptible to damage from transient events such as voltage spikes. in addition, our protection business from u.s. based smartphone manufacturers achieved a new annual revenue record further diversifying our mobile revenues geographically. in fy '20, our wireless and sensing product group made significant progress in advancing semtech's lora technology to be the global de facto standard for the lpwan market. our lora enabled revenue declined approximately 5% to $74 million from $78 million in fiscal year '19 due to lower revenues from china.
however, our lora enabled pos grew by 7% from fiscal year '19 and represented a new pos record. in fy '20, our lora business met or exceeded all the metrics we targeted at the beginning of the year. these metrics included one, the number of countries with lora networks grew to more than 91 countries from 70 at the end of fiscal year '19. by the end of fiscal year '21, we expect over 100 countries to have lora networks. two, the number of public or private lora network operators grew to 133 at the end of fiscal year '20 from 101 in fy '19. we expect 150 lora network operators by the end of fiscal year '21. the number of lora gateways deployed grew 164% from 243,000 gateways in fiscal year '19 to 642,000 gateways at the end of fiscal year '20. these gateways are capable of supporting approximately 2.5 billion connected end nodes. we expect the number of lora gateways deployed to increase to over 1 million by the end of fiscal year '21. the cumulative number of lora end nodes increased 55% to 135 million at the end of fiscal year '20 from 87 million at the end of fiscal year '19. we expect this number to continue to grow rapidly and exceed 180 million cumulative end nodes by the end of fiscal year '21. five, the lora opportunity pipeline exceeded $500 million at the end of fiscal year '20 with an additional $200 million of leads feeding the opportunity pipeline. we anticipate that on average 40% to 50% of this pipeline will convert to full deployment over a 24-month timeline. our pipeline remains geographically well-balanced with approximately 65% of the opportunities coming from the americas and europe and includes a growing number of use cases in the smart home and consumer markets where the volumes could be significantly higher and could drive deployments more rapidly than from industrial markets.
at the end of fiscal year '21, we are anticipating our opportunity pipeline will exceed $700 million with an additional $300 million of leads feeding these opportunities. we expect the strong momentum in our lora metrics to continue in fiscal year '21 as the lpwan market starts to grow rapidly and as our new lora technology platforms are adopted. these new lora platforms include our lora smart home platform designed for lpwan-based smart home, community, and consumer applications providing low power, broad coverage for indoor, neighborhood, and campus area iot devices used for safety, environmental, and convenience use cases. our lora global platform that uses a 2.4 gigahertz version of lora to enable global use cases requiring higher bandwidth and our lora edge platform, which is a highly versatile and extremely low power software defined lora platform that enables a broad range of asset management applications targeted at industrial, building, home transportation and logistics segments. our lora edge platform includes wi-fi sniffing and gps location features enabling the most versatile lpwan geolocation platform in the industry. this platform will also drive our future cloud services business with the first service being a geolocation service for asset tracking applications. armed with these new platforms, along with the increasing influence and momentum of the lora alliance, we expect to continue to drive lora to become the de facto standard for the global lpwan market in what we expect to be a multibillion unit industry in the next five years. for fy '21, we are expecting our lora enabled revenues to be between $90 million and $120 million. despite the ongoing headwinds in china and the uncertainties associated with the coronavirus, with the positive momentum from our lora metrics and growth in our opportunity funnel, we continue to anticipate a 40% cagr for our lora enabled business over the next five years.
now let me discuss our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year '21. while the near-term visibility remains challenging and despite the ongoing headwinds associated with china demand, the huawei ban, and the uncertainty associated with the coronavirus, we believe the underlying demand for our products remains very strong. based on our backlog entering the quarter, we are currently estimating q1 net revenues to be between $125 million and $135 million. this guidance assumes a $10 million negative impact due to the coronavirus and assumes no more direct shipments to huawei this quarter. to attain the midpoint of our guidance range or approximately $130 million, we needed net turns [phonetic] orders of approximately 27% at the beginning of q1. we expect that q1 non-gaap earnings to be between $0.30 and $0.36 per diluted share. i will now hand the call back to the operator and sandy, emeka and i will be happy to answer any questions, operator?

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of rick schafer with oppenheimer. please proceed with your question.
rick schafer -- oppenheimer -- analyst
yeah, hi guys, and congrats on a great quarter. well, i've got a question on based on lora. i mean you've gained a lot of momentum there i think after a slow start in 1q obviously, covid-related. i mean, do you see continued linear ramp next year, sort of in line with that 40% cagar that you just mentioned or could we see a step function in revenues there next year as lora sort of starts to hit critical mass or it seems like it's hitting critical mass?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think [indecipherable] we've always looked at it is that there are certain catalyst that can drive faster growth and that's why we voice projected a 40% cagr just based on history. and then some of the new use cases that we now know are starting to get real traction, one of which is of course the smart home initiative with the amazon sidewalk announcement. certainly if the pickup is good of that architecture in the network, one would expect a very fast acceleration in sensors and we could see a definitely a step function increase whether that happens in fy '22 -- probably more fy '23 just because it takes time for the gateways, the network, the architecture to kind of get deployed and then sensors be developed.
but i do expect that business alone just on the amazon sidewalk business to reach $100 million business in five years. so for sure that's going to be one of the catalysts. and then as i mentioned, the industrial iot space has been somewhat slow this year because of covid-related issues, but that's going to pick up. it's just a question of time. a lot of the use cases are about creating smarter planet, about efficiency improvements -- they're about greener initiatives and things like that and so it's just a question of time i think. so, yeah but to answer your question, we do expect some catalyst over the next year or two here with the smart home initiatives.
rick schafer -- oppenheimer -- analyst
i should have asked just a quick follow-up on that question, but i mean, are there any capacity issues that you guys have there? actually in the past you kind of planned to catch-up on the lora business this year. so is there any capacity -- supply constraints that you're seeing in there or anything?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
well, there are supply constraints across the board. i would say it's definitely a tightening of supply chain as you know across all segments, nothing specific to our lora business or anything like that. i just think as emeka mentioned, we are seeing some lead times on the supply side increase and that is challenging. but generally that means the beginning of an up cycle in the industry in my view and i think that's a good thing for us and for everyone.
rick schafer -- oppenheimer -- analyst
if i could sneak in a follow-up, i think most lora revenues today are still coming from hardware. i'm just curious, when do you sort of expect to start monetizing the services? i know we talked about that in the past that [indecipherable] royalty opportunity that you see there. thanks.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so the same two elements. one is the ip licensing royalties from our partners [indecipherable] we do expect next year. we start to see some of that coming in, but also our cloud services. we did announce that this last quarter, our first cloud service using geolocation again, using more edge platform, and this is another area where we're expecting pretty good growth. it will be a slow ramp initially, but the cloud services revenues will be recurring revenues, remember. so again, we're expecting again something between $50 million and $100 million in the next five years on an annual basis and a lot depends on the quality of the geolocation and the other services we bring to the market. but this is our first real initiative and we're very confident and feel very good about the type of customers and the type of use cases and how quickly that could ramp in the future.
operator
our next question comes from the line of quinn bolton with needham & company. please proceed with your question.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
quinn, you there?
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
sorry guys, can you hear me now?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
okay, great. sorry about that. i was on mute. just wanted to follow up on the sidewalk question; with amazon now announcing sidewalk and i believe the fourth generation echo product including that sidewalk network in the gateway, have you seen an increase in the end node activity for sensors compatible with sidewalk and just wondering if you could give us an update on that design activity around sidewalk more on then node side?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, it's really just starting, quinn. amazon had made the announcement. they haven't yet talked about the sensors that are connected to it. they've talked about what they anticipate they will be, but they haven't yet rolled out the development platforms to enable companies to do that. but that's pretty close i think and it's going to happen very soon. and so my expectation is by mid next year we'll definitely start to see real sidewalk networks be deployed and sensors being attached and that type of thing.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
great. and then a follow-up question just on the 5g front-haul side of the business. it sounds like it was a little softer for you in the october quarter on the -- following the record level in july, but it sounds like you're looking for growth in that business into the january quarter. i guess i'm a little surprised by that because we've heard from other customers that are sorry, other companies that the china 5g build out is sort of going through a pause between the first phase and the second phase, yet you seem to be perhaps bucking that trend. so i'm wondering just if you could talk about what you're seeing in china 5g and maybe the timing of the next round of tenders for base station and front-haul build out? thank you.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, well i think largely your comments are correct, quinn. i would say that there is anticipation the next year is going to see some good growth and that starts in q1 and therefore the build for us and the demand for us starts to pick up in q4 which is what we're seeing. and so, yeah, i think it's just a timing thing. we sell into module manufacturers obviously, module guys selling to the base station guys and so the sum of that dynamic is just timing. but, yeah, we're expecting a pretty strong fy '22. the other thing is not just china. i think that's one of the nice things about actually all of our infrastructure segments now is they're fairly global. we're seeing opportunities in europe and north american oems as well, both on the 5g side and on the pon side as well. so that's encouraging.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of tore sandberg with stifel. please proceed with your question.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
yes. congratulations on the results. first question and back to lora. do you have a range update for us for this calendar year, mohan?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
we're still keeping our range, its $85 million to $95 million or it was going to be in that range i think for this year and we're still keeping our 40% cagr going forward. obviously a lot depends on the timing of amazon sidewalk and some of the higher volume, faster time to market opportunities. but in general, i would say with the exception of kind of covid-related impact we're seeing pretty good industrial momentum. a lot of new use cases but as we use cases kind of come out, we're seeing adoption across the globe. so i think again the timing of when proof of concepts move to revenue. it's challenging to really comment exactly how it's going to happen, but once they'll start to materialize. and i think as i mentioned covid, once covid stops that we start to get some return to normality in terms of manufacturing and industrial iot. i think that's going to continue to also drive the revenue.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
that's very helpful. and you talked about 5g coming back next quarter or i mean this quarter. what about datacenter? how are some of the dynamics been there, because that obviously passed a little bit this last quarter, but are you starting to see that grow again as well?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
we are. i wouldn't say it's as positive as the 5g story. i think there's more still inventory there in the channel and then maybe the customers, but we are starting to see that pick up also. and so i expect q1 the short to be up. datacenter is probably going to be flattish for q4 and then i'd say up in the q1 timeframe, but yeah, positive signs. a lot of design-in activity there.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
great. lastly, on the pon business, you expect to start to see 10 gig; is that going to be a fiscal '22 event or is it going to be further out than that?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
actually 10 gig pon is doing well already and i think continues to do well and we expect in q4 to do quite well, this quarter to be quite strong for pon and next year we're also projecting good growth for pon so yeah, infrastructure just continues to make us -- give us good indications that fy '22 is going to be another solid year for our sip business.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
well, thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of craig ellis with b. riley. please proceed with your question.
craig ellis -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
yeah, thanks for taking the question. i'll ask one that ties together a few points. so you mentioned that the inventory would be up quarter-on-quarter, and i can see that all the segments are guided up. but mohan, can you help us with some color on some of the gives and takes across the different segments, which would you expect to be growing more robustly, which are more muted? and then within any of the segments are there any sub segments where you would expect a meaningful deviation to the broader overall segment trend?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so as you know, craig, the first half was extremely weak for consumer. i think we're seeing the second half being quite strong relatively to for consumer and i'd expect that to continue for at least obviously we've seen in q4, which is typically seasonally down for us. we are seeing very much strong consumer business. so, that i think is going to continue. then on the infrastructure side, as i mentioned, some softness there, but mostly driven by very strong first half and all the indications are that that most of the infrastructure segments we participate in are going to come back this quarter and certainly grow in q1. and then on the wireless incentive side for us -- lora continues to great and then in the proximity sensing side, i think again that's tied to consumer. we expect that to do quite well in q4.
on the inventory side, on the supply side, the areas that we're concerned about, obviously, there is a tightening supply chain. some of the end markets tend to have short lead times typically consumer. so we are taking a little bit more risk in building some internal inventory there. demand seems to be extremely strong. we're pretty cautious about how we are participating in the market and making sure that we're not over-inventorying anything. our channel is very light at the moment and my expectation is that -- if we manage it correctly, then i think we should see good consumer growth next year as well. we won't see such a volatile demand coming from there.
craig ellis -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
got it. and then turning to lora, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, both amazon and cisco and i'd like to cisco's product announcement. it was actually very impressive, very impressive array of products that help create a real nice ecosystem. as you look at fiscal '22 what potential does cisco have to really drive incremental sales for lora or is that just much more of an analog-like business where those would be the kind of classic ballpoint design-ins we would see with industrial versus anything high volume like amazon?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think from a revenue standpoint, it's more the latter craig, but the important thing to remember is that, once they have adopted lora and they build the infrastructure based on lora then that's there forever, right? and it's going to be there for at least the next 10 to 20 years and i think drive, especially the industrial sector drive a ton of opportunity both for additional sensors, but also potential cloud services, potentially new use cases. so there is, that's the excitement we have behind lora and lpwan. we're creating a whole new industry here and that's to me is the thing to take away, not only from the standpoint of getting these tier 1 customers like cisco and amazon involved in driving lora and helping us with the ecosystem but what it says about the value that the technology brings to the market and to these customers. so, yes, it's pretty exciting to have both new use cases but also tier 1 companies really driving it for us.
craig ellis -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
indeed, and if i could just two clarifications. i'll throw them out at the same time. one, you talked about rising gross margin in fiscal '22. can you give us a sense for the magnitude of that increase, for example, could we see gross margins up 100 basis points or so over a four-quarter period? and secondly, i thought i heard you mentioned that fourth quarter was a 14-week quarter and if so, what's included in revenue and expense guidance for the extra week? thank you.
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so let me take the first one with regards to gross margin. i think, like i said in my prepared remarks, when you think about where we're expecting our revenue growth to come from into next fiscal year, we're expecting our lora business to continue to grow very nicely. datacenter business, i think remains fairly on growth. pon and the 5g wireless also in addition, our industrial and automotive opportunity within our protection business. so all these business is really very exciting for us because of a higher gross margin that they come with. is there really something that i can quantify right now? probably not, but i would expect that to see something in the range of 50 basis point to 100 basis point expansion throughout the year. so, that will be very good. with regards to the q4 with the 14 weeks -- it's always hard on the revenue side to really to estimate how much of the extra week is contributing to revenues so that i think, of course, it is a country business for us, but it's much easier on the operating expense side. on the operating expense side, i think about 60% of our total operating expenses is sort of tied to time, right? so, things like your salaries, your operating supplies and stuff like that. so if you think about -- if you take 50% of operating expenses some day you linearize it over 14 weeks that will give you a pretty good estimate of what the operating expense impact is.
craig ellis -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
very helpful, thank you.

our next question comes from the line of mitch steves with rbc capital markets. please proceed with your question.
mitch steves -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for taking my question. i just had a quick one, i guess maybe a bigger one -- bigger picture one, just on the strategy for semtech now. i know before you guys have talked about potentially kind of spinning out the lora business being its own entity or potentially selling that piece of the business relative to semtech hold. can you maybe provide us an update on what kind of the view is now given that you've kind of survived kind of this downturn in 2021? i'm sorry, 2019 and 2020 what the plan is for lora business or semtech as a whole relative to that outcome?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, mitch. the thought has always being that if lora becomes the de facto standard in the industry and we are generating around $100 million of recurring cloud services revenues, then we could start to look at some ideas about how to move that business to a different level. and so that's the thought and i would say we're still probably two, three years away from that. obviously, every day we get good momentum and new announcements like the amazon sidewalk and our lora edge announcement to get closer, but we're not there yet. i think i would say, two, three years still is the timeframe.
mitch steves -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yeah. and then can you provide us -- so you said cloud service kind of recurring revenue. what's kind of the revenue run rate now relative to kind of just a straight sales you guys are doing?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
that's -- it's brand new. so we've just announced our cloud services geolocation service. it's the first one. so it's very --we're just starting to get contracts in place now and things like that. so i would say next year, end of next year would be a good measure for are we on track to do the $100 million in three to five years and what's the pick-up and what's the value that we're bringing. it is dependent on our new platform, the lora edge platform, as i mentioned, and i think we'll start to get some good feeling for that as customers deploy their platform and give us feedback on the value.
mitch steves -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yeah, i guess just one last one if i could, just to clarify those comments. so what would be kind of the first major customer, major launches you guys would expect, call it in '21 and '22? you're not looking for logos or anything like that, but how should we think about the rollout of that new product or business line?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
well, the way to think about is asset tracking and asset management is really the first target with geolocation. and so obviously, once our customers are testing and they feel that there is value we'll start to talk more about the specific application, but i would think it's in those areas in asset management and asset tracking and tied to use of lora edge indoors and outdoors. that's the beauty about lora and the lora edge platform has wifi sniffing and gps sniffing. so the concept being you can track an asset from your home, outdoors into a warehouse, into a very manufacturing facility, for example, within buildings, deep indoors or in rural areas and have one platform, which is utilizing and optimizing the battery power consumption effectively. so it's a very nice concept. it's very, i think it's a very unique capability we have, but we have to get it out there and demonstrate the value, right?
mitch steves -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
understood, very helpful, thank you.

our next question comes from the line of scott searle with roth capital. please proceed with your question.
scott searle -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. hey, just a couple of quick clarifications. i missed what you said about the sequential outlook for protection. just wondering if that was up, down, flat? and while we was in the quarter, i know you were indicating your guidance doesn't reflect any incremental contribution from huawei, hisilicon in the fourth quarter. and then i had a couple of follow-ups.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
so protection, we're expecting to continue to be up. it was up in q3 and we expect it to be up in q4, driven mostly by the consumer space, but also in our industrial, more broader industrial telecommunications, automotive sectors are all doing quite well for us. so we're expecting that to grow in q4 also. and then on huawei, huawei for this quarter we're not expecting much at all. we haven't shipped much and we're not expecting to ship much in q4, so pretty minimal revenues from huawei this quarter once -- obviously, we have some licenses as i mentioned on the prepared remarks, but it's fairly modest any revenues that come from that. and it's not clear to us whether huawei has already built up inventory and so whether they need the material. so we've essentially taken it out of our guidance.
scott searle -- roth capital partners -- analyst
great, perfect. and on wireless and sensing absolutely huge quarter. part of that, it sounds like a combination of proximity sensors and lora. i was wondering if you could parse that a little bit more, up 32% sequentially. the smartphone market, broadly in general was up about 20% plus i think on a global basis so you're benefiting from that. was there something in there -- was proximity bigger versus lower, just to kind of get calibrated on that because given the performance of that segment, i would have thought you'd be at the higher end or even above the higher end of the range of $85 million to $95 million for lower this year.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, they're both doing extremely well, i would say. obviously, proximity sensing for us has been -- its driven by mostly the smartphone business and so that has obviously done quite well in q3 and we're expecting stronger proximity sensing in q4. as i mentioned consumer tends to be weak in q4, but this year is unique in the sense that the first half was very, very weak. so we're starting to see maybe a bit of that effect kind of playing out here in the q4 time frame. but with lora, it's more consistent. i mean it's just continuous consistent growth and -- with lora it's more about how fast the pocs are moving over to revenue, right? so we have plenty of pipeline. i mean, as i mentioned, we have $500 million of pipeline. so it's only a question of how quickly those could move through the pipe to revenue, and that's where something like the amazon sidewalk announced i think really starts to help in a way because lora is a great technology for industrial. it's clearly proven in utilities already. it's clearly proven itself in some of the asset management and broader kind of industrial use cases. but where we have been hoping somewhat speculating, but now we have real evidence of it since the smartphone use cases and some of the more consumer use cases, which drive growth typically faster. now, they could be volatile as well. i mean, they can have shorter life cycles as well, but typically they can ramp up fast and so as i said, i don't think we'll start to see it really until mid next year the growth there, but it's coming.
scott searle -- roth capital partners -- analyst
got you. if i could mohan, follow-up on the lora front as it relates to sidewalk, could you talk a little bit about the ecosystem that's built around it right now? now you got the anchor, right? you got the base station there in effect with the echo dot. how is the rest of the ecosystem and design activity around that starting to form? i was wondering if you could update as well on tags? haven't heard a lot about that late. i know that was out further out on the horizon, but you're starting to talk about cloud and recurring opportunities. what's the latest thoughts on tags?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i'm pretty excited about tags but i think it's still early. we still have to get the price points down and we do need something like a sidewalk network in place for that to become an effective vehicle. with regards to the ecosystem, it's really driven by amazon. i think we're participating obviously in helping and facilitating but a lot of the momentum is going to be driven by them to directly and i think we'll continue to help drive that process. but when you look at the ecosystem, there is clearly an opportunity for [technical issues] who want to connect to a gateway in the home in lighting area, in the tracking area, in the security area and the safety area, irrigation just a whole bunch of sensors. there's clearly opportunity for software companies to partner with amazon and figure out how to connect with them. there's clearly opportunity for system integrators who want to connect to home-based network opportunities. there's just the whole ecosystem around the smart home i think comes into play quite nicely. and i think we'll start to see that. so that's probably the second half of next year, but as the network and stuff get rolled out and customers and consumers start to deploy sidewalk networks, i think that's when we really start to see the momentum.
scott searle -- roth capital partners -- analyst
and lastly if i could, just on in signal integrity, pam4 product line. i think you're starting to see some 100 gig contribution i thought in the third and fourth quarters start to see some initial revenues. i was wondering if you could update us on that front? and then looking forward to the 200 gig, 400 gig i thought that with design activity, which would start to translate into revenue in the first half of fiscal '22. i was wondering if could just update us on those two fronts? thanks.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we're starting to see revenues now. it's small, but we are seeing clearedge revenues now, pam4 revenues and we've got some very good momentum. as i mentioned we have over to two dozen design opportunities that are in play at various stages, some early stage evaluation, some more qualification type of stages. and so that's going to start ramping, and yeah, next year should be a very good year for tri-edge i think.
scott searle -- roth capital partners -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from the line of christopher rolland with susquehanna. please proceed with your question.
christopher rolland -- susquehanna financial group -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for the question. i think most of the good ones have been asked so i'll just ask two. i guess the first one here on the 5g opportunity; perhaps you can give us [technical issues] that it would grow. i think most people are expecting that. but perhaps if you can give us this year the kind of growth rate we should expect in this business for the next couple of years? and then if you could break out perhaps units or asps. it sounds like you're moving to 25 gig, so i want to explore that opportunity a little more? thanks.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so the main thing to remember with 5g for us in the optical modules is that with 4g there is typically just a pmd device of some sort. with 5g there'll be a cdr as well as a pmd device. so the opportunity for us in 5g is either clearedge cdr and fiberedge pmd device for 25 gig. if they go to 50 gig links say, tri-edge pam4 and fiberedge device for 50 gig so asp does increase for us. in addition, there is more typically with 5g, there's going to be more front links. i think it's been, it goes from 6 to 12 from holdings. so there is significant increase in the number of ports will be going forward so increased content, more ports. but then i think the other thing that's somewhat different for us and for everybody i think in 5g is that historically it's been china and i think, for sure, china will still be the predominant volume driver, but we are starting to see some of the oems around the world really take a more aggressive stance and trying to be successful in this market, and at least participate and some of that's geographical dependent on which regions are driving the need to have local suppliers support their 5g infrastructure, but that will also drive opportunity for us. i think for 4g, we have about 30% share of the market, we think we can hold that share at least for 5g and so that's kind of thinking and it should grow double-digits for sure over the next couple of years.
christopher rolland -- susquehanna financial group -- analyst
excellent. and then also if you could talk about the datacenter opportunity, at least the datacenter end market more broadly there. intel talked about perhaps demand slowdown. i just wanted to see if you agree with that or not? and then more specifically if you could talk about your optical opportunity there with tri-edge -- you mentioned cost versus analog. what is that discount that you get for analog and perhaps discuss how sales are tracking on that side?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. well, datacenter had a very strong [technical issues] had a record first half, so there was some expectation technology is going to [technical issues] and that's really what's happened is still on the annual year-on-year basis so up. and so, and will continue to grow nicely i think next year. so i think we've seen obviously some of the softness in q3, expect q4 to probably be flattish versus q3 and then start to pick up again next year. much like 5g, i mean the hyperscale datacenter is broad set of global customers. so it's pretty broad range of customers. we are obviously selling to the optical module manufacturers and they're building their modules and shipping into different datacenter customers and we've got good traction as i mentioned there. and we really expect to see production ramps for most of the 200 gig, 400 gig pam4 modules over the next few quarters here. it's already started, but i think the next few quarters, we'll start to see that and essentially, you can take a 100 gig optical module today that uses our clearedge cdrs and essentially replace it with a very similar module that uses our tri-edge cdrs and get double the bandwidth for very little incremental cost in the module. and so that's the value we see and then that's what we expect the market to recognize.

our next question comes from the line of tore svanberg with stifel. please proceed with your question.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
yes, thank you. just a quick follow-up. mohan, i think you said that the sidewalk opportunity alone could be $100 million over the next five years. is that on chip revenue or is there some royalty or even services revenue in that number as well?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i would say it's includes everything tore, so mostly chip and royalties.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of harsh kumar with piper sandler. please proceed with your question.
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
yeah, hey guys. first of all congratulations, solid guide, solid results. we appreciate it. and then i had two questions mohan. right before the ban, i think you were pretty opt -- very optimistic on the opportunities in china, with perhaps a new president seek. can you talk about -- you talked some about 5g, but could you just lay out for us the framework of how semtech would view the opportunities in china? should the gates open up for trade again?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
well, we've really been bullish on china. obviously, we invested in china for the last 15 years and so it's hard to walk away from a region that given so much growth and continues to have some performance going forward. so but i would look at the huawei situation is a unique situation. obviously, the ban on huawei has impacted us significantly, but that's kind of done now and we've been through that. the bigger challenge now is just are we going to see a opportunity to continue to grow in all of our businesses in china or is there going to be this further kind of disaggregation between the u.s. and china, and that's still on the move. and i think that's where we're waiting to see, but for sure any positive relationship improvements, i think is a positive for our business for sure because just because of the success and the momentum and the relationships and all of that we have across all of our segments. but that said we're not counting on it. as i mentioned a lot of these markets like 5g and pon are becoming a little bit more globalized in the sense that other regions are starting to recognize the need to have their own infrastructure players, and they can't depend necessarily on the chinese manufacturers to support them and be there when they need them and those types of things. so you know it's a little bit of both, but i definitely think if things improve on the relationship front at a government level then for sure that should help our business longer term.
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
mohan, so a follow-up on that one and i'll ask my next question as well. do you see opportunities -- you used to have opportunities i believe for a datacenter business in china. do you see that perhaps opening up again for you or for some semtech in china with datacenter? and then secondly, with regards to amazon sidewalk and lora, i think you were the only supplier of baseband ics for the gateways that you guys deploy on the infrastructure side. is that still the case? and will the typical consumer be relying on sort of the amazon infrastructure that will be laid out in the city or will the consumer have to buy their own sort of gateway, which comes in a dot or echo or something else?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
so let me answer that first and then we'll go to the datacenter. so i'm on sidewalk, yeah, for sure there will be connectivity to a gateway, which will be an echo. so and amazon obviously will supply the echo's and so the connectivity will be to the echo. and then how different echo's connect with each other and how the roaming is done, that's all going to be driven by amazon. that's an amazon decision and so we'll obviously help them with that. but the main thing is getting, it's really targeted within the home, the smart home and the periphery of the home is kind of the initial thinking and then tracking of your pets and things like that outside the home and then connecting different echo's together and those type of things, i think is the broader vision, right? so we'll see how that plays out. and then on the datacenter side for sure, yeah, all of the chinese datacenter -- the hyperscale datacenter guys are our partners, customers, potential opportunities for tri-edge for sure and we are working with them. we continue to work with them. we don't see any real issues at the moment. i don't think that there will be, but yeah, we have very close relationships and expect to see some good growth there.
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks mohan and thank you, guys.
operator
our next question comes from the line of tristan gerra with baird. please proceed with your question.
tristan gerra -- robert w. baird -- analyst
hi guys. thanks for letting me in. you've mentioned that amazon was a 10 to 20 year opportunity. so clearly there is a long-term investment. could you give us a sense of what's the magnitude of those logical, potential end customer like amazon? and given those investments is there any incentive for them to eventually use the same technology in other platforms outside of consumer? amazon for example is also pushing iot solution in industrial. is that an opportunity that you see specific to this customer, but elsewhere versus cellular base network? and generally, what's the incentive large customers have to one thing that to lora to leverage that into different end markets?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, tristan, i think all of the companies we deal with, we mentioned cisco earlier and amazon and other companies are starting to understand the value that lora brings. it's not -- the value is increased actually when lora is combined with other technologies. so when you combine with bluetooth or wifi or gps, as i mentioned on lora edge. one of the reasons why we developed the platform, so that it has wifi sniffing and gps sniffing and lora on its own has some limitations in the sense that it's not a high-bandwidth connectivity, right? but i think at some these use cases start to get deployed, there's going to be use cases across the board in all segments and industrial is where i think the biggest value, the largest value is for sure because of the very low power and the range. but then when you see the smart home initiative this is really driven through the sidewalk initiative, it really is going to change the way home automation and smart home is thought about when you start to look at the periphery of your homes and you go into the attic or into the garage or into the basement or into the outdoors into the yard and can then put smart automation around that. that really starts to change that dynamic a little bit. so i think there is a huge opportunity. we'll see -- it's baby steps, as i said, but we have some big hitters that are behind the technology pushing it, right?
tristan gerra -- robert w. baird -- analyst
great. and then just a quick follow-up. so, you've mentioned a bit earlier about lean inventories in the channel and tightness in supply across the board. and you mentioned, nothing specific to lora. are you shipping exactly in line with end demand in lora or are you still catching up for what was following supply chain disruptions earlier in the year? just trying to see if there is any catch up revenue or it's really just linear with end demand?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i would say if the question is specifically about lora, i think we're shipping to demand. i think it's in good shape. i think there the real question there is in fy '22 if the consumer demand picks up rapidly, then hopefully we'll be able to supply to that and i think we've had -- so we're in fairly good shape. with regard to the rest of the business, demand is extremely strong, bookings have been extremely strong. so we are a little bit cautious, particularly on the consumer side. with regard to making sure we understand how much inventory is being built and trying to maintain some balance there by keeping our channel lean and things like that. so it's hard to know, to be honest with you tristan exactly, but we'll see it play out. we're expecting a very strong q4. we're expecting a strong q1. i think the first half of next year looks like it's going to be strong. then the question is what does second half look like, right? but we'll see by then.
tristan gerra -- robert w. baird -- analyst
great color. thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from the line of karl ackerman with cowen. please proceed with your question.
karl ackerman -- cowen & company -- analyst
yes, thank you for squeezing me in. your signal integrity business will grow mid teens, at least in fiscal 2021. how do you think about the trajectory of that business entering fiscal 2022 in the context of your longer term [technical issues]? i asked because it would seem another healthy year with 10 gig pon is on the come, demand remains healthy for 25 gig and higher gig optical products in asia. yet, at the same time proponents of 400 gig pam4 would argue the second half of 2021 will begin the demise of nrc for short reach application. so just would love to hear your thoughts on that.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
while we think 100 gig modules and connectivity will continue for some time, i don't think there will be a demise. it may start to flatten up and for 200 gig and 400 gig pam4 modules will starts to pick up for sure. but we are hoping to participate in that, of course with tri-edge and we see good design and momentum, as i said, so to answer your question we think all the infrastructure segments are going to do quite well next year. part of that is working from home and all of the covid-related dynamics that have driven infrastructure investments and the need for more bandwidth and all those things. so yes, sip our signal integrity product group, we're expecting pretty good growth next year across the board. and this year has been extremely weak year for video for example as well, so we're expecting fy '22 to see that pick up also that segment. we anticipate that to continue to contribute to the growth next year also.
karl ackerman -- cowen & company -- analyst
understood. last question if i may, what order trends are you seeing by asia-based datacenter customers? i ask because your primary peer spoke about that for 25 gig and 100 gig products, again just a double click on the channel inventory commentary. we've kind of heard some mixed commentary, but i'd appreciate your thoughts on how you feel about the situation for optical components, particularly for datacenter, and long haul? thank you.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
for us the channel is pretty, pretty light. it's not, it's certainly in the range we feel comfortable with, demand is very strong as i mentioned, bookings are strong. indications are q1, i mentioned that q4 was going to finish to be a little bit light for datacenter probably flattish, 5g is going to be a little bit stronger. and we expect pon to be stronger in q4 and then we expect infrastructure segment to do nicely in q1. so yeah, at this point channel is light. i think relatively and demand continues to be strong and bookings are strong. so we think we're in pretty good shape.
operator
and our final question comes from the line of craig ellis with b. riley. please proceed with your question.
craig ellis -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
thanks for coming back to me it and getting the end before we wrap up. mohan, i really appreciate all of the metrics that you gave before and the transparency they provide. but i missed what you said about the opportunity funnel. so one, can you repeat that number? and two, did it change from the last quarter and three when we go through a period that's just dynamic is what we've seen year-to-date where the whole world is just turned upside down with a covid crisis. how does the company manage its funnel and kind of quality check and resiliency check the items that are in that funnel as we get to the other side now are looking at what should be a global recovery, but can you just walk us through how you're maintaining that bundle and where it stands currently versus prior expectations?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so, currently, the pipeline is about $500 million. we look at the leads that drive the pipeline. it's about $200 million. so there is no pretty sizable pipeline compared to what i found revenue is and the main area of focus is conversion of those pipeline opportunities to revenue. that's been the key, so kind of key focus for us is how do we make sure and enable that to occur, it's fairly well balanced. as you know, the pipeline has in the funnel about 21% is china and then about 70% is europe and americas, which is good because that's the balance of the revenue today. the revenue is about 49% china and 40% europe and americas. so we wanted to get that balance more balanced. and if we executed the funnel and turns over to revenue as we expected to in time, then that would be a nice thing to have just more balance. also lots of use cases. lots of different use cases. so there's obviously, now a hefty smart home it's also in that funnel, utilities, asset management, smart city and building so fairly well balanced there. this year, obviously has been a tough year for customers to prioritize new initiatives.
and that's been really the difficulty we've had where most of many of our company and customers have been focused on just making sure people are safe, and making sure people have jobs, and those types of things. putting a priority on a new technology and a new market, new initiative has been challenging, but it's starting to get turned around. and i think as i mentioned with the amazon sidewalk initiative that's initially was significantly going to be announced much earlier but was pushed out and now is out there and i think we're going to see more of this type of thing as our customers start to get a handle and countries start to get a handle on the pandemic and the way forward. so my expectation is next year the opportunities will increase rapidly.
craig ellis -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
thanks mohan.

and with that we reached the end of our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
thank you. in closing, we were pleased to deliver another solid quarter and remain encouraged that our strategies for multi-sourcing, our investments in it, operations and sales infrastructure and systems continue to limit the impact of covid on our business operations. i want to once again acknowledge all of the talented and committed semtech employees across all our global locations and thank them and the team for their ongoing efforts. we believe our strategy along with that diversified offering, balance and the market approach and strong customer relationships should enable us to continue to deliver growth. with that we appreciate your combined continued support of semtech and look forward to updating you all next quarter. thank you.

operator
greetings and welcome to semtech corporation's q2 fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note this conference is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to your host, mr. sandy harrison, vice president of investor relations. thank you. you may begin.
sandy harrison -- senior director of investor relations
thank you devon and welcome to semtech's conference call to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year '21. speakers for today's call will be mohan maheswaran, semtech's president and chief executive officer; and emeka chukwu, our chief financial officer. a press release announcing our unaudited results was issued after the market closed today and is available on our website at semtech.com.
today's call will include forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in these statements. for a more detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please review the safe harbor statement included in today's press release and in the other risk factors section of our most recent periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission. as a reminder, comments made on today's call are current as of today only. semtech undertakes no obligation to update the information from this call, should facts or circumstances change.
during the call, we will refer to non-gaap financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a discussion of why the management team considers such non-gaap financial measures useful, along with the detailed reconciliations of such non-gaap measures to the most comparable gaap financial measures, are included in today's press release. as a reminder, all references to financial results in mohan's and emeka's formal presentations on this call will refer to non-gaap measures unless otherwise noted.
with that, i will turn the call over to semtech's chief financial officer, emeka.
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, sandy, and good afternoon everyone. for q3, fiscal year '21, net sales increased 7% sequentially and 9% over the prior year to $154.1 million, which was at the upper end of our guidance. in q3, shipments into asia represented 80% of net sales. north america represented 12% and europe represented 8%, total direct sales of approximately 18% and sales to distribution of approximately 82% of net sales. our distribution business remains balanced with 39% of the total pos coming from the infrastructure end market and 30% from the industrial end market and 31% from the high-end consumer end market. bookings increased strongly over the prior quarter and resulted in a book-to-bill above 1. pos bookings accounted for approximately 25% of shipments during the quarter.
q3 gaap gross margin decreased as expected by 40 basis points due to a higher mix of consumer revenue. we expect our q4 gross margin to be flattish sequentially. q3 gaap operating expense increased 4% sequentially due to higher performance-based compensation expense, offset by lower new product expenses. we expect our q4 gaap operating expense to increase 4% to 6% sequentially primarily due to it being a 14-week quarter and higher share-based compensation expense driven by a higher stock price. q3 gaap other expenses was $1.6 million versus $2.9 million in q2. the decrease was primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses than those that were recognized in q2. in q3, our gaap tax expense was 7.9% as a result of a favorable regional mix of income and several discrete tax benefits.
in q4, we expect our tax to range between 10% and 13%. moving onto the non-gaap results, which exclude the impact of share-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition-related and other nonrecurring charges, gross margin was 61.5% and in line with expectation. our gross margin remains stable with the key driver being end market revenue mix. in q4, we expect gross margin to remain flattish due to a higher mix of consumer revenue. in fiscal year '22, we expect to see gradual increases to our gross margin as we see an increase in revenue contribution from our higher margin growth drivers of lora-enabled 5g wireless pon datacenter infrastructure platforms.
our q3 non-gaap operating expense increased 6% sequentially on higher compensation expenses offset by lower new product expenses. in q4, we expect our non-gaap operating to increase 1% to 4% sequentially primarily due to the generic quarter being a 14-week quarter. for fiscal year '22 consistent with our target, we expect operating expenses to increase at approximately half the rate of revenue growth. in q3, our non-gaap tax rate came in at 14.8% and we expect our q4 and fiscal year '22 tax rates to be in the range of 15% to 17%. in q3, cash flow from operations decreased to 18% of net sales due to the adverse impact of withholding taxes paid in q3 related to the q2 repatriation of cash to the u.s. we repurchased approximately 440,000 shares or $24 million of stock in q3 and our stock repurchase authorization now stands at approximately $44 million.
we expect to continue to use our cash to opportunistically repurchase our shares, make strategic investments and pay down our debt. in q3 due to higher net sales and timing of shipments during the quarter, accounts receivable increased 14% sequentially and represented 33 days of sales, which remains well below our target range of 40 to 45 days. net inventory in absolute dollar terms was approximately flat sequentially while days of inventory decreased by 9 days to 118 days, which remains above our target range of 90 to 100 days. in q4, we expect our net inventory to increase due to the strong demand that we are seeing and the tightening supply lead times. in summary, we are pleased to deliver q3 results that were at the upper end of our guidance. we look forward to ending a very challenging year on a strong note and we believe that our strong business fundamentals position us nicely to continue to deliver growth and solid financial results.
i will now hand the call over to mohan.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
thank you emeka. good afternoon, everyone. i will discuss our q3 fiscal year '21 performance by end market and by product group and then provide our outlook for q4 of fiscal year '21. in q3 of fiscal year '21, net revenue increased 7% sequentially and 9% over the prior year to $154.1 million. stronger demand from the high-end consumer and industrial end markets was offset by softer demand from the infrastructure end market. we posted non-gaap gross margin of 61.5% and non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $0.47. in q3 of fiscal year '21, net revenue from the high-end consumer market increased 43% sequentially and 21% over the prior year and represented 29% of total net revenues. approximately 19% of high-end consumer revenue was attributable to mobile platforms and approximately 10% was attributable to other consumer systems.
the industrial end market net revenue increased 14% sequentially and 4% over the prior year and represented 32% of total net revenues. net revenues from the infrastructure end market decreased 13% sequentially and increased 6% over the prior year and represented 39% of total net revenues. i will now discuss the performance of each of our product groups. in q3 of fiscal year '21 as expected, our signal integrity product group decreased 14% sequentially and increased 5% over the prior year and represented 40% of total net revenues. in q3 of fiscal year '21, demand from our datacenter customers softened following the strength experienced in the first half of the year.
we believe the demand for higher bandwidth datacenter connectivity remains very strong and our clearedge, fiberedge and tri-edge platforms all have significant design-in momentum in 100 gig, 200 gig and 400 gig optical modules being deployed in global cloud and hyperscale datacenters. design activity for our tri-edge pam4 platform remains strong and we now have customers working on almost two dozen design-ins for use in 100 gig, 200 gig and 100 gig pam4 optical modules. the lower cost, lower power and lower latency performance enabled by our tri-edge analog cdr platform provides a significant advantage over existing dsp solutions. we believe the secular trends that have been driving growth in the datacenter market should continue to drive that datacenter business plan over the next few years.
in q3 of fiscal year '21 demand from the wireless base station market softened from the prior quarter's record as build-outs in china slowed from first half levels. global customers are increasingly deploying 25gig optical modules for front holdings in 5g base stations. as a result, we are seeing increased design-in activity for our high-performance cdr and pmd platforms for 5g wireless base stations globally. we expect 5g infrastructure spending to increase in fiscal year '22 and expect this market to continue to grow for several years. in q3 of fiscal year '21 revenue from our pon customers was flat with the prior quarter. while demand for our pon platforms has been largely driven by china we are continuing to see a number of new pon initiatives outside of china where pon is used to channel high speed data to the home, enterprise and campus networks.
semtech remains the leading supplier of 10 gig pon platforms for the onu and olt markets and we expect our latest innovative 10 gig products to enable us to further benefit from the global trend toward increased pon deployments. despite the inherent lumpiness associated with the infrastructure markets we believe the secular trends led by the upgrade of datacenter connectivity and the expansion of 10 gig pon and 5g wireless network capabilities should drive future demand for our optical platforms across all our target infrastructure markets. for q4 of fiscal year '21, we expect net revenues from our signal integrity product group to increase driven by all infrastructure segments and a recovering video market.
moving on to our protection products group; in q3 of fiscal year '21, net revenue from our protection products group increased 25% sequentially and 3% from the prior year and represented 27% of total net revenues. in q3 of fiscal year '21, demand from our korean smartphone customers rebounded strongly from the covid-related issues that have impacted them in the first half of the year. demand from our north american smartphone customers also remained solid. we expect our protection products group to continue to benefit from our ongoing diversification strategy. many of today's high performance systems across all industry sectors are starting to incorporate advanced lithography devices and high-speed interfaces such as usb c, 10 gigabit ethernet and hdmi 2.1 resulting in the need for semtech's high performance protection.
we expect these trends to continue and contribute to the long-term growth of our protection business. in q4 of fiscal year '21 we are expecting our protection revenue to increase led by growth from the broad-based industrial and communications markets and stable smartphone demand in what is typically a seasonally weaker quarter. turning to our wireless and sensing products group; in q3 of fiscal year '21 net revenue from our wireless and sensing products group increased 32% sequentially and 21% over the prior year and represented 33% of total net revenues, resulting in a new quarterly revenue record for our wireless and sensing products group.
our lora enabled platform continued its steady growth and experienced another record quarterly performance. in q3 of fiscal year '21 we continue to see excellent progress against the goals for our lora metrics we had targeted at the beginning of the year. these include the number of countries with lora networks now stands at 99 countries and we expect over 100 countries to have lora networks by the end of fiscal year '21. the number of public or private lora network operators grew to 148 and we expect 150 lora network operators by the end of fiscal year '21. the number of lora gateways deployed grew to nearly 1.2 million from the 640,000 gateways at the end of fiscal year '20 and we are expecting the number of gateways deployed to increase to over 1.3 million by the end of fiscal year '21.
the cumulative number of lora end nodes deployed increased to 167 million from 135 million at the end of fiscal year '20 and we expect this number to exceed 180 million cumulative end nodes by the end of fiscal year '21. in q3, we shipped a record number of lora devices. finally, the lora opportunity pipeline, which includes both opportunities and leads stands at approximately $500 million with approximately $200 million of leads feeding the future opportunity pipeline. we expect the opportunity pipeline to increase rapidly in fiscal year '22 as we anticipate the inertia associated with the global pandemic to gradually subside. our opportunity pipeline remains geographically well-balanced with approximately 70% of the opportunities now coming from the americas and europe and includes an increasing number of use cases in the smart home, asset tracking, and supply chain logistics markets.
in addition to the record revenue and the continued progress on our lora metrics in q3 we made several important announcements related to our lora business. these include amazon's use of lora in their new sidewalk network, unique capabilities of lora extends the range of smart home networks to connect both indoor and outdoor sensors enabling new use cases. these include smart lighting, smarter safety, pet trackers, asset tracking, smart irrigation and many others. the use of lora in the smart home segment demonstrates the value and versatility of lora in low power lan and low power wan segments of the iot market. we believe that amazon's use of lora in sidewalk opens up a huge opportunity for semtech's lora-enabled business starting in fiscal year '22.
and cisco's use of lorawan courts industrial asset vision system for enhanced visibility into physical spaces for it and operational technology environments. this lora-based system is a simple and secure solution for remote asset management equipped with a cloud-based dashboard to monitor and manage the condition of assets and facilities that can be deployed in minutes using a simple qr code. we also announced the availability of our lora edge tracker reference design that includes our new lora cloud geolocation service. our lora edge platform is our first lora-based software defined radio platform that integrates wi-fi and gps sniffing along with lora. we are seeing a significant ramp in new design and activity and believe that lora edge is the ideal platform for asset tracking and asset management use cases and will be the main enabler of our future cloud services revenues.
we believe that the flexibility, long range and low power of lora-based networks critical components of any successful low power iot deployment. with the record q3 performance and anticipation of a record annual performance and with the exciting smartphone opportunity driven by amazon as well as numerous new industrial iot opportunities we continue to expect our lora enabled revenues to grow at 40% cagr over the next five years and to become the de facto standard for the fast emerging lpwan market. in q3 of fiscal year '21 net sales from our proximity sensing platforms grew nicely over the prior quarter, helped by the recovery in the smartphone market, along with several new design wins that move to production, and should continue to ramp.
we are also seeing increased design activity as global rf safety regulations become more stringent as you new 5g based phones emerge. for q4 of fiscal year '21, we expect net revenues from our wireless and sensing products group to increase and achieve another quarterly record led by another record performance from our lora enabled business. moving on to new products and design wins; in q3 of fiscal year '21 we released 12 new products and achieved 3,397 new design wins, which also represented a new quarterly record. while this year has presented its share of unique challenges i believe that our key stakeholders, including our investors, customers, suppliers and employees have all played a critical role in driving the company's growth and success.
we remain committed to considering the impact of key environmental, social and governance factors in our decision-making processes. we're also focused on developing products that will make the planet a smarter, more connected and more sustainable place to live. we view our employees as the company's most important resource and have an established set of core values that hold each of us responsible and accountable for doing the right things for the company and its employees. i am excited about the company's future opportunities. i believe that our vision, our strategy and our focus on providing products for a smarter, more connected planet and our commitment to a more diverse and inclusive workforce should enable the company to continue to be extremely successful.
now, let me discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal year '21. we believe the underlying secular demand for our growth platforms remain solid. based on very strong bookings and record high stocking backlog entering the quarter, we are currently estimating q4 net revenues to be between $153 million and $163 million. to attain the midpoint of our guidance range or approximately $158 million we needed net turns orders of approximately 20% at the beginning of q4. while we have been issued some licenses that allow us to ship to huawei our guidance assumes no more shipments to huawei or hisilicon. we expect our q4 non-gaap earnings to be between $0.45 and $0.51 per diluted share.
i will now hand the call back to the operator and sandy, emeka and i will be happy to answer any questions. operator?

thank you. we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question comes from tore svanberg with stifel. please proceed with your question.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
yes. thank you and congratulations on the record results. mohan, you talked about targeting 20 service agreements by the end of fiscal '22 for lora. could you elaborate a little bit more on the size of those? i mean are these kind of like million dollars agreements? just trying to understand how quickly the services revenue can ramp, but i know eventually obviously your target is about 100 million, but just wanted to understand for fiscal '22, how much is ramping?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
the thinking tore is that and agreements will really be focused on connecting devices. and so obviously if there is a very high volume of devices and usage of those devices accessing the cloud services then the revenues will go up. so it depends on use case, it depends on number of devices, so each one is kind of individual on its own. but that's the way the thinking is. so the revenues will be generated by number of times the algorithms are accessed and the number of devices etc, things like that. so obviously fy '22 for us, this is almost a trial year to see, make sure we fine-tune the system, i mentioned the three areas we're starting off with device provisioning, which is about connectivity to the network and the cloud. device management, which is about monitoring the device itself, making sure the battery, telling you what the level of the battery is and things like that. and then geolocation, which is about locating the device and tracing it and things like that. so we have to demonstrate the value. but as we demonstrate the value, i think as customers recognize the value of each of those aspects of the service, then they'll be quite happy to pay for it and that's the thinking and we'll see how it plays out.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
yes, thank you for that. and as my follow-up. you sound pretty confident that gross margin could expand this year obviously driven by mix. does that mean that your visibility in your infrastructure markets including 5g and datacenter is pretty decent right now. because i know those markets have been a bit softer as of late, but it sounds like you have pretty good visibility out there though?
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, tore. this is emeka. so yes, i think we feel very good about what is happening in the optical infrastructure space. we've continued to see a whole lot of design wins with some of our newer product platforms. and so the expectation on our side is that we have a lot of good things going on the gross margin side. a lot of new products driving the top line revenue. but speaking on the gross margin, the one thing that is still out there that we are trying to really assess is what is the impact of our cost increases within the supply chain. although our feeling is that any negative impact would get from there should be mitigated by not giving us much pricing reductions or actually in some cases going back and asking for higher prices from our customers. so to your point, it definitely, like i said before, i think it was last quarter, i'm still anticipating same gross margin expansion anywhere from 50 basis points to 100 basis points and we're still pretty good about that based on the visibility that we have at this time.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
very good. congrats again.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from tristan gerra with baird. please proceed with your question.
tristan gerra -- robert w. baird -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. just following up on the same topic. any concerns about availability of any component or in terms of wafers for this year. and also have you implemented any type of non-cancelable order policies with your customers?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
so, tristan, i think on the first part of the question we have -- you can see probably since the second half of last year, we've been building more internal inventory and one of the reasons for that is the increasing lead times and supply chain. so we don't anticipate any major issues and at least in the first half of the year. we think we're going to be good for most of the year. obviously it's a daily -- we're looking at it daily and it depends on demand. we have a couple of constraints around the business in terms of supply, but fairly small modest in nature i would say, less than a few million dollars. so i think here and there. and then we'll just wait and see what the upside -- where the upside is. and as i said, we think we have it covered with our demand management and inventory management and the way we're managing the business. so i think we're ok.
and then as emeka pointed out, obviously we have some supply constraints and in those cases, we are going out and looking at whether we can -- when we get increases in the supply side. on the cost side we are going out and deliberately looking specifically at where we can also offset that with raising prices, in some cases, i think it's also being more disciplined about how we work with our partners. in general, at the moment, we don't have to do anything. i think first half is going to be fine. i think it's really going to be a question of how the second half plays out and if demand continues to be extremely strong and improves and the markets continue to improve, then we may have to do some of those things, but i think at this point we're ok.
tristan gerra -- robert w. baird -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from harsh kumar with piper sandler. please proceed with your question.
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
yes. hey, guys. first of all congratulations on some very good numbers and some very good guidance despite all the challenges in the market. so we do appreciate that as investors. i wanted to ask you mohan, of all the things that you see positive that are going on with your company, what are some of the things that you are the most excited about? or do you feel that will grow the fastest for you? and then i have a follow-up.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
well, this year, i think is going to be the year where lora is really -- moves into the mainstream. i've said that before there will be catalysts and i think we are starting to see that. obviously the amazon sidewalk announcement was exciting. the amazon aws iot core announcement was exciting and the cloud services, the first time we've really gone out there with cloud services as a capability and we're going to test them and check that out and see. but we're very excited about that. obviously, we'll see how the results play out over the next few years, but that's obviously exciting.
all of our businesses in the infrastructure side on the signal integrity product side are doing extremely well. obviously, it's largely to do with the world moving to more higher bandwidth across different segments of the market, but because we play in all areas, datacenter, base stations and on the access side with pon, we can see that there is demand in all areas. and one feeds the other. if you have core bandwidth increase you need base station bandwidth increase. if you have base station bandwidth increase you need access bandwidth increase. and so we're seeing that definitely become playing out.
and i think the other thing that's exciting about that is, that it's becoming more global for a large part of our last five years, if you look at it, i mean a lot of the growth has come from china and what we're seeing now is a lot more growth in other regions. very excited by tri-edge. got great momentum with that and so we'll see how that plays out, but we are very excited by the work that's going on with customers and on the feedback and we started to get very good orders in that area. so that's very exciting.
and then i think the protection business is, you know, we made the decision to diversify a few years ago, that's starting to play out nicely for us and i think that could be extremely positive for us as well. so lots of areas harsh, it's tough for me to pick out one, but i think if you have to -- if we have to pick out one it would still be lora.
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay, awesome. thank you mohan. and then thanks for mentioning tri-edge, i was going to ask about that. so i'll ask you now about what kind of interest are you seeing regarding your cloud services from customers? have you talked to the folks out there that are going to buy the services? are they excited or is it just more of a push or show me the concept kind of thing at this point?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
it's a little bit of both. i think the initial show me, show me, but once they see what we have, i think there's a lot of excitement. i think it's very unique platform right. i mean, we're the only real guy out that provides -- providing device to cloud services that offer this type of capability. we can offer very good security in terms of device provisioning, joining network obviously because we are in both the end devices and in the gateways and obviously have worked with the cloud guys. so on the device management side, that's also a very unique capability of being able to update the device itself over the year in software. and then geolocation, the unique -- obviously another unique capability for us with what we have with wifi sniffing and gps sniffing essentially being able to allow the device to be tracked indoors and outdoors, is a very nice feature as well. so lots of my things we have to -- it's embryonic. i mean it's very new. but the opportunity is clearly there. the market is huge. and now, i think if we execute, we should do very well.
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you, mohan.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from gary mobley with wells fargo securities. please proceed with your question.
gary mobley -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hey, guys. let me extend my congratulations on a strong finish to the year. we have seen and heard out there in the marketplace of manufacturing constraints for automobiles as shortages automotive semiconductors, we heard just yesterday, samsung talking about smartphone supply chain constraints. and so my question to you is, to what extent have you factored into your guidance any supply chain constraints unrelated to your specific products?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
unrelated to our specific products is tricky, because we don't really know until we hear about it right, gary. but i would say you can tell from our tonne number required, we are -- obviously we're guiding to a number we feel comfortable with based on how much tonnes we need. the question really is whether our customers change their demand outlook and then reduce the need for the devices. i doubt that's going to happen. if anything, i think it will go the other way, which is as lead times continue to extend out they'll want more material and need more material if they're going to continue to be successful. and so i don't think it changes much from our perspective. obviously there could be a surprise if some customers come back and cancel phones and things like that, but the likelihood is, it's just a temporary blip and the next quarter will probably be the stronger if they choose to grow their businesses right.
gary mobley -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
okay, i appreciate it mohan. so my follow-up, i had a couple of quick housekeeping questions. could you share with us perhaps how much the extra week in the quarter impacted the sales? and as well, could you give us an update on what your distribution -- sorry, your distributor inventory stand in terms of days or weeks?
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so, gary, with regard to the impact of the 14 week on sales, it's really kind of hard for us to estimate that. so i think what most people have basically done is just look at it on a linear basis, right. and in terms of distribution we then announce the days publicly, but i can tell you that we're very pleased with where the distribution inventory is and is probably a little bit on the lower side, if i were to add some color to that.
gary mobley -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
all right. thanks emeka. thanks everybody.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from quinn bolton with needham. please proceed with your question.
quinn bolton -- needham -- analyst
hey guys. i'll offer my congratulations as well. and i apologize that my call dropped during the q&a. so i apologize if somebody else asked the question, but mohan, you talked about a strong outlook for the lora business in fiscal '22, really starting to hit the mainstream and a 40% longer term five-year cagr. wondering if there is any reason to think that the growth in fiscal '22 for lora would be wildly off that 40% year-on-year rates implied by the longer term cagr you're looking at?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
nothing i can think of quinn, other than macro events. i mean this last year pandemic, something like that occurring is just a little bit are off right now on what type of things are going on, but the pipeline is good, the activity is good, number of new big initiatives like the amazon initiatives i mentioned, we've got more in the pipeline on those that will be announced soon. i think cloud services, as i mentioned, we just got great momentum. and one of the things about lora and iot and specifically the lpwan market, it's a market that has been created, and a lot of the use cases are around climate pollution -- climate initiatives, pollution initiatives, green initiatives, energy savings initiatives and then there is just great momentum. so my own sense is that, if anything, the momentum will be better, but at this point in time we just -- we're just monitoring it case-by-case. we look at all the use cases. we look at all the proof of concepts that are in place and how we can move those to revenue. but yes, i think there's a lot of initiatives, obviously the amazon sidewalk initiative as an example of that, it's -- once it starts to really get out there and i think it's more the second half of this fiscal year, but as it starts to ramp, i mean that could really ramp very, very nicely, very quickly, or it may not right. so we'll have to wait and see, but we're confident about it.
quinn bolton -- needham -- analyst
and just a quick clarification mohan on the amazon sidewalk. when you're talking about that second half of '21 ramp, is that more on the gateways or is that on the end-node side?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
well at once the -- what we know and obviously i can't say -- talk about it too -- in too much detail, but we do know is that work is going on in both ends of devices and gateways, but from a use case standpoint you really kind of need the gateways out there first and then that will drive more end-nodes and more sensors. and once the gateways are in place of course, you can then add infinite amount of sensors. and so i think once they are in place and you have an installed base of gateways out there i think the next five to 10 years will be very interesting to see how many sensors are actually connected.
quinn bolton -- needham -- analyst
the second question i have is just on the protection business. i think you said that outlook for growth in fiscal '22 which was 10% or better. i might have missed it, but did you give an outlook for signal integrity. it sounds like, base station, pon, datacenter all going to be pretty good growth here. so just wondering if you had an -- kind of a fiscal year '22 target for the signal integrity business?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
we -- i expect it to have another record year quinn and grow double-digits again. so very strong. all areas of the business, i expect datacenter, base station and pon will do very well. and then as i mentioned, the pam4 side of the tri-edge is doing very well. so i expect that to grow very nicely in fy '22. and then some of the segments that has struggled in fy '21, particularly video, broadcast, the pro av stuff really struggled in fy '21 through covid. i think some of that's going to come back quite nicely in fy '22. we'll see. it may be second-half loaded. again as live events come back on and as more people start to get out there to sports, bars and things like that, i do expect a ramp-up of pro av as well.
quinn bolton -- needham -- analyst
i'll be waiting [phonetic] for the video broadcast business then. thanks, mohan.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from karl ackerman with cowen. please proceed with your question.
karl ackerman -- cowen -- analyst
yes, good afternoon gentlemen. appreciate you let me ask the question. two if i may. first, some 5g networking supply chain players have noted a pause in china infrastructure projects until tenders are granted. given your unique position within the supply chain, i guess, what level of activity are you seeing in china infrastructure spending today? and i guess also in the context of 10 gig pon order rates for the april quarter?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
we see strength in both areas, 10 gig pon and 5g base stations. as you know, com is sometimes lumpy in one quarter here. sometimes you wait, but in general, everything's up into the right, and that's not a surprise. infrastructure across the globe is increasing. 5g base stations are increasing. 4g also is increasing. pon is doing nicely. and as i mentioned, 10 gig pon specifically because of the bandwidth expansion needs is increasing quite nicely.
the other thing is it's not just china and i think that's an important takeaway is that we are starting to see a lot more activity in both 5g and pon in north america and europe and other regions of the world which is also quite good, very positive. and remember both 5g and pon we have more content than we have with 4g. so with 5g obviously we have now cdrs as well as pmd function. also with 5g there's typically more front haul modules. and so -- and then you have expansion in the geographical side. and then on the pon side, not only do we have 2.5 gig and 10 gig pon, but in 10 gig pon we also have olt side, so onu and olt side, so kind of the cpe and central office side, if you like, and that's also giving us more content. so both these segments of the market we're doing extremely well. i would say that both markets are also doing quite well though.
karl ackerman -- cowen -- analyst
got it. i appreciate that mohan. for my follow-up, you spoke about how protection business can grow double-digits this year. how does automotive play into that outlook and how should we think about the incremental revenues here and i guess the margin profile for those as you look to expand into this area? thank you.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
so, protection is doing very well in automotive. it does take longer though. this is all fairly new design wins in automotive and those take some time, so that they kind of have more of a industrial growth rate i think. but yes, i do expect to do well and anything in any protection that goes into automotive or into iot or into communications infrastructure or into broader industrial will be at either our corporate average or much higher actually. so in general, it's the consumer protection business, that's the lower margin for us. and so i think as emeka pointed out, we get the right mix in both our different businesses, but across the company that should be accretive to gross margins. operator?
operator
thank you. our next question comes from rick schafer with oppenheimer. please proceed with your question.
andy hummel -- oppenheimer -- analyst
hi, this is andy hummel on for rick. thanks for taking my question. the first one, just on with lora and some of the amazon wins that you announced. but more specifically on the aws iot side, but can you just talk a little bit more about the opportunity with that platform. what are some of the factors that amazon has that helps you accelerate lora adoption? and then more broadly, if you can just remind us what your revenue opportunity is with the amazon partnership?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so aws iot core is really an important initiative. it's taken several years i think to come up with and develop and create but essentially it creates a plug and play experience for enterprise solution providers that enables them essentially to connect their iot sensors directly to the amazon cloud. and why that's important is essentially as a time to market thing and also a competence thing, because aws already has software developed for applications, has different unique kind of vertical application software that it can be applied to different segments and so not only the connectivity enablement which is easier and faster, but then also the ability to provide a kind of end-to-end solution quicker is also important. so i would say that's the key thing.
and so for enterprise, it's really an enterprise play different than sidewalk which is more of a kind of a smart home consumer play. that gateway connectivity directly to the cloud is really significant for large enterprises. and so we do expect that to be part of our $100 million in five years with amazon as tied to sidewalk and some of it is tied to aws iot core, but i think that's kind of the goal.
andy hummel -- oppenheimer -- analyst
okay, great, thanks. and then the follow-up. just on the 10 gig pon market, do you guys have a sense for where customers are at in the upgrade cycle? is there a way to quantify, i guess like, what percentage of customers that that might end up upgrading at some point have already upgraded the 10 gig?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
well about 50% of our revenues that are coming in quarterly now our for 10 gig. so that's a very rapid increase. i wouldn't have expected that and we knew 10 gig was going to ramp up, but that tells me that the market is moving to higher bandwidth pon quite quickly and we're expecting that to continue to grow that way. so, yes, it's moving fast. i mean if you think about a 10 gig is a natural hand-off for 5g. it's also a natural connectivity point for hdtv, things like that. so it's really a nice kind of data point. 10 gig typically is really as a good hand-off point for high speed data and so i think 10 gig pon has an option to do very well. and we look at it, if you've got a greenfield site certainly in china, but i think it's also a place to other regions of the world where you don't have optical cable, but you're going to lay out optical cable, you'd go with the higher bandwidth optical connectivity, right. so that's why we'll go with 10 gig pon or above even, we have customers who are looking at higher bandwidths as well so, which again will help semtech.
andy hummel -- oppenheimer -- analyst
okay, great, thanks. appreciate it. and congrats on the quarter.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from craig ellis with b. riley securities. please proceed with your question.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
yes, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the results. mohan i wanted to start with lora but, before i ask the question, thanks for keeping the dashboard fresh and the metrics relevant to the things that are evolving in the business. the question on lora though is, if we look back a year ago, i think it was a priority to really increase the next design win and engagement activity in us and europe and the team clearly did that and did that well. as you look ahead to 2022, are there any areas of geographic emphasis as you look at pursuing some metrics that you talked about in this year's lora dashboard?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
i think we still have to execute on that craig, i would say it's [indecipherable] now, and so a lot of the opportunities are outside china. i don't think that we necessarily are changing our strategy in china, our momentum in china is still very good. it's more a question of, let's make sure we have momentum in other regions of the world and clearly north america now with amazon and some of the things that are going on in the enterprise space in north america is extremely good and in europe as well. so i think it's more of the same. we just want to keep doing that, executing on that. and you know now, as i mentioned, really lora is quite well adopted around the world globally. i mean it's really acknowledged as a great technology for lpwan. so i think our focus now is on executing on the proof of concepts and making sure this end-to-end solutions there is enough sensors, there's enough gateways, there's high quality software out there, there's cloud connectivity, those type of things. and really focusing now on the use cases, make sure that the customers themselves who are implementing those use cases are not having any challenges with the use of lora from an end-to-end solution standpoint. and there in lies the opportunity with lora cloud i think and with some of the things we're doing with amazon on the aws iot core, for example.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
got it. and then the follow up emeka is for you. in your prepared remarks, you mentioned rising input costs and the potential to make some pricing moves. and i just want to dig into a little bit further on what was possible, for example, i would expect in some parts of the business it may not possible to raise prices due to your relationship with existing tier 1 customers, but in other parts of the business it may be more feasible. so can you just provide some further color on what the company might be able to do and when in fact the company might be able to make some moves if it chose to act in that direction? thank you.
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, craig. i think, we already seen like mohan did mention, we already seen some expenses where we are getting indications of price increases from the supply chain and we're assessing that. it's not really -- it is pretty much going to be across the board where we continue to look at where, which product lines, which areas are we seeing the impact of this increases. and then i will have to figure out whether the strategies are going to be as you're coming through every year, you plan for a certain amount of asp reductions. may be the answer is going to be ok, we're not going to give those planned asp reductions and in some cases, if the increase is on the supply chain is pretty significant then we'll have to expect that our customers to help us share some of those [indecipherable], but it is very -- i'm not sure that i can comment now and tell you exactly where we are seeing things to [indecipherable]. our assess though is that we should be able to find opportunities to offset the impact of cost increases that we get.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
one thing to remember craig, as i mentioned earlier is that we have done a really fantastic job in my view of building more inventory in anticipation of some of these issues. and so i think at least for the first half i think where we feel pretty good about where we are from a supply standpoint. the question really is in the second half if demand increases and we need to go to our suppliers and get more material than it's going to come at a higher price right. and for those we may have to go to our customers and request higher pricing.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
well, certainly you wouldn't be the first doing so there. so guys, thanks very much and good luck.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from chris rolland with susquehanna. please proceed with your question.
chris rolland -- susquehanna -- analyst
hey guys. this one will be for mohan. so i recently ordered a helium hotspot, so i am back ordered on that, but if you look at the token value market cap implied by the network we are in the hundreds of millions now, which would imply this would be a real thing. so i was wondering mohan, if you could talk about this. do you think this could be a real thing? is this something that maybe you thought comcast was going to be. can you talk about kind of where we are now and if this -- how you're viewing this whole network?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes, that's a really interesting question chris. i would say that was our vision and dream with comcast and for whatever reason they decided not to go down and continue to execute on that. they are still involved, but not with the ambition that we thought they initially had. we do think that that's the same kind of concept which is amazon sidewalk is -- has and others that are in the pipeline. and helium's approach is very interesting and very unique and very creative, which obviously fits well with lora and all of the things that are going on. so yes, i think it could work to some extent with some of these networking approaches.
it's, the beauty of lora which is very flexible where you could have very low cost, very secure networks that connect together and it just changes the world of networking to some extent. and i think that's the ambition, right. so take it away from the big guys and give it to the small guys and see what happens. and so, we'll see, it's early, and i think with helium obviously being a start-up, they have to execute, but we see this in several countries in the world going on. it's not just in the us and as i say, i think, definitely the momentum is there. we'll see how it plays out. the use cases of the key in my view as more and more use cases become available and make the network itself very valuable, then i think it could work for sure.
chris rolland -- susquehanna -- analyst
understood. my second question is around china, both on the handset side and the optical side. i think you said trying to handset was good. do you have any viewpoint on china inventories and how much you were helped by inventories that may have been built as huawei has been struggling here, the other guys have been said to have been building inventory? and then secondly on the 5g infra side, i think you mentioned some optical strength is that where it came from, is it china optical on 5g?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think -- first the 5g strength today is mostly china, but i think we are starting to see new opportunities now emerge from other regions of the world, which is as i said, very encouraging. so, and it's not -- it's well understood i think around the world that some of the north american and european companies, nokia, samsung, ericsson, cisco are all engaged in trying to build 5g systems and equipment and so we see definitely a good momentum there more globally. and then on the smartphone, question on mobile question, for sure china has ramped up and specifically non huawei smartphone manufacturers have ramped up their demand and are looking to get more material. we are seeing that strength. i would say it's also north america the strength is there. korea has been slightly not so strong. i do think that might come back in q1 and beyond, but certainly for q4 china was strong and probably will be for the first half of this year. i don't know how much of that is supply chain driven. i don't think it is, i think we saw -- start to see that well in advance. i think it's more in anticipation of maybe winning some of huawei's business. but at the end of the day, we look at across all of our customers and are looking at carefully at how much -- what is demand and what's being consumed and how much material is out there in the channel and paying a lot of attention to that.
chris rolland -- susquehanna -- analyst
thanks guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from cody acree with loop capital. please proceed with your question.
cody acree -- loop capital -- analyst
yes, thank you guys for taking my question. if we can go back maybe toward the beginning, i'm just trying to get a better sense of the velocity of your bookings level as we push here through the first part of the year just on a linearity basis? and then what is that? is there a correlation between that bookings uptick and expansion -- or the expanded lead times?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
i would say that the demand came first cody, i mean we definitely start to see bookings, very strong bookings in october, november, december. i mean, very, very strong chinese new year, softened a little bit, but then bookings have been very strong since then. lead times have been gradually increasing. supply lead times of gradually increasing, so customers obviously want to give you more visibility as they get concerned about supply constraints. but i think it's a healthy position for someone like us. we've built inventory. we have enough material to support customers. it's just a question now of making sure that the materials we ship out are being consumed effectively and i think that's what, as i said, we're keeping a close eye on. but, that's kind of how the way we think about it.
cody acree -- loop capital -- analyst
mohan, i guess, given your position, how much visibility do you have -- do you feel comfortable with having on the possibility of double ordering or just inventory restocking efforts. we all know how this ends, but what visibility do you have? and then maybe why the 16% turns guidance visibility is so high. why not a higher guidance that much booked for the quarter?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
well we -- so we do have very good visibility actually and that's the good thing. and as i said, that's not a surprise. the turns number and the reason for the low percentage turns is mostly because of that consumption question as i answered is that, while customers are asking for more, we want to be cautious about making sure that there is no excess channel inventory, and so we pay a lot of attention to that as emeka said, it's kind of the low end. i would like to keep it there. and so we are making sure that whatever we ship out is being consumed effectively and it's not double ordered and things like that. so we're taking specific steps on that front and that's the way -- that's the reason why our turns numbers is what it is.
cody acree -- loop capital -- analyst
great, thank you guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from tore svanberg with stifel. please proceed with your question.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
yes, thank you. i just had a few follow-up housekeeping ones. mohan, you talked about the lora pipeline being 700 million. i believe in the past you've talked about the funnel and leads to the funnel. so is that 700 million now basically just adding those two up?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes. opportunities and leads, tore. i would say this last year in fy '21, normally a lot of the leads come from shows, conferences, events and things like that, and of course we went in q1 into a period where nothing was happening. so i think that's going to change this next fiscal year when things start to get back to normal in terms of some conferences being open, shows starting to open up a little bit and people traveling a little bit more. we'll start to see those leads expand, but yes -- but to answer your question, it's a combination of both opportunities that are in the pipeline that are running proof of concepts and leads.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
got it, got it. and then i just had a question on sort of the math of the number of the gateways and the end-nodes versus your revenues. so i think end nodes grew about 30%, gateways i think doubled year-over-year. your revenues grew 20%. so how should i just think about the math there? and of course, i'm not looking at perfect tides here but...
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes the way to think about it, tore remember, gateways is installation is a question of a network. so they are creating the networks first according to gateways, whether that's a private network or a public network. the end-nodes are tied to actual sensors being connected to those gateways. now remember the end-nodes the timing of an end-node when we ship a device out, the device typically will go to a distributor. the distributor will then ship it to a customer. the customer will then put that for example that device, we just tell a radio component they will put it into a system, build the whole sensor node and then it gets connected to the gateway. so there are -- there is a different timing components here, but the reason why i shared these metrics, obviously the gateways are important, because it tells you about the capacity that's out there to support lora. so with the current capacity of 1.3 million gateways that can support about 5 billion sensors there. so there is no -- there's plenty of availability of networks to support centers. and then the cumulative end-nodes is important, because it tells you exactly how many nodes are now connected to the gateways. in terms of our revenue, it's when we ship devices to our customers right.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
right, that's very helpful. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. there are no further questions at this time. i would like to turn the call back over to mohan for any closing comments.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
okay. in closing, we were pleased with our strong q4 and fiscal year '21 results, despite the impact of the pandemic, our multi-sourcing initiatives, our investments in it, operations and sale infrastructure, limited the impact of covid on our business operations. we also benefited from the strengthening of several secular themes driving our key growth engines, targeted at the datacenter, internet of things and mobile device segments. we remain committed to considering the impact of environmental, social and governance factors in our decision-making processes. given our diverse product offering, balanced end-market approach and strong customer relationships, we expect to see growth and a strong financial performance in fiscal year '22. with that, we appreciate your continued support of semtech and look forward to updating you all next quarter. thank you.

with that i will turn the call over to semtech's chief financial officer, emeka chukwu. emeka?
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you sandy. good afternoon, everyone. for q4 fiscal '21, net sales was $164.7 million. this came in above the upper end of our guidance. this represented a 7% sequential increase and 19% growth over the same period a year ago. despite the challenges presented earlier in the year by the pandemic, fiscal year '21 net sales increased 9% to $595.1 million, driven by the strength of the underlying secular themes driving our growth engines. in q4, shipments into asia represented 79% of net sales, north america represented 12% and europe represented 9%. total direct sales represented approximately 13% and sales to distribution represented approximately 87%. our distribution business remains balanced with 33% of the total pos coming from the high-end consumer end markets, 37% coming from the infrastructure end market and 30% from the industrial end market. q4 bookings increased significantly both on a sequential and year-over-year basis and was a quarterly as well as annual record for fiscal year '21 and resulted in a book-to-bill significantly above 1. the pos bookings accounted for approximately 24% of shipments during the quarter. the bookings threat has continued into q1.
q4 gaap operating expense increased 12% sequentially due to the impact of a 14 week quarter and part of the weaker us dollar, higher new product expenses, and stock-based compensation expense associated with the increase in our stock price. we expect our q1 gaap operating expense to decline from q4 and a return to a 13-week quarter and lower stock-based compensation expense, slightly offset by the customary reset of expenses associated with the start of the new year, higher new product expenses and the impact of the weaker us dollar.
q4 gaap order expenses was $2.7 million versus $1.6 million in q3, primarily due to the impairment of some of our minority investments and higher foreign exchange losses due to the weaker us dollar. in q4, our gaap tax rate was 5.5% as a result of a more favorable regional mix of income. in q1, we expect our gaap tax rate to range between 9% and 11%. our gaap tax rate forecast excludes consideration of any impact from discrete items, including excess tax benefit or depreciate from the exercise of stock options.
moving on to the non-gaap results, which exclude the impact of share-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition-related and other non-recurring charges. q4 non-gaap gross margin of 61.5% was in line with our expectations and we expect q1 non-gaap gross margin to be generally flat with q4 levels, reflecting a high mix of consumer revenue. in fiscal year '22, we expect our gross margins to trend higher from a more favorable mix as we expect much of our revenue growth to come from our higher margin growth platforms. we expect that any increase is due to the global supply chain constraints should be mitigated by slower customer pricing reductions or in some cases price increases. as a reminder, our long-term gross margin target model is 58% to 63%.
q4 non-gaap operating expense increased 9% to $62.3 million, driven by the impact of the 14th week. the negative impact of the weaker us dollar and higher new product expenses. in q1, we expect non-gaap operating expense to be approximately flat with q4 levels as the benefit of a normal 13 week quarter is offset by higher new product expenses, increased payroll expenses associated with the new year and the impact of a weaker us dollar. for fiscal year '22, we expect our non-gaap operating expenses to grow about half the rate of our revenue growth.
in fiscal year '21 non-gaap operating margin was 23.4%, a 50 basis point increase from fiscal year '20. we expect to leverage revenue growth, stable and expanding gross margins and reasonable operating expense growth to drive the operating margin to our target model of 32% to 36%. in q4, our non-gaap tax rate decreased to 9.5%, as a result of a favorable regional mix of income and discrete tax benefit.
beginning with our fiscal year '22 results, we will use non-gaap normalized tax rate for the full fiscal year. we believe this will provide better comparability across our quarterly results by reducing the variability in non-gaap tax rates that can occur throughout the year. we plan to update this tax rate annually at the beginning of each fiscal year. for fiscal year '22 our non-gaap normalized tax rate is 13%.
in fiscal year '21, cash flow from operations was approximately $119 million or 20% of our net sales and free cash flow was approximately $87 million or 15% of our net sales. our long-term target for free cash flow is 25% to 30% of net sales. we repurchased approximately 1.6 million or $71 million of our shares in fiscal '21, which represents 82% of our free cash flow. the board recently increased our stock repurchase authorization by $350 million, resulting in approximately $389 million of outstanding authorization. we expect to continue to use our cash to opportunistically repurchase our shares, make strategic investments and pay down our debt.
accounts receivable in q4 represented 36 days of sales which is below our target range of 40 to 45 days. in q4, net inventory increased 12% in absolute dollars from q3, while days of inventory remained consistent 118 days and remains above our target range of 90 to 100 days. in q1 we expect less inventory to increase in absolute dollars and days to support higher sales and to address the type of supply chain.
in summary, we are very pleased with our solid financial performance in fiscal year '21, despite the many challenges from the pandemic. our business fundamentals remain strong and we are well positioned to benefit from the secular drivers in the high growth markets of iot, communications, infrastructure and mobile devices. we expect to leverage our stable and expanding gross margin on a well controlled operating expenses to grow our [indecipherable] much faster than revenue and continue to generate strong cash flow.
i will now hand the call over to mohan.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, emeka. good afternoon, everyone. i will discuss our q4 fiscal year '21 performance by end market and by product group, discuss our fiscal year '21 performance and then provide our outlook for q1 of fiscal year '22. in q4 fiscal year '21, net revenues increased 7% sequentially to $164.7 million, higher demand across all three of our end markets drove better than seasonal q4 results. we posted non-gaap gross margin of 61.5% and non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $0.51. in q4 fiscal year '21, net revenues from the high-end consumer market increased 10% sequentially and 32% over the prior year and represented 30% of total revenues. approximately 19% of high-end consumer net revenues was attributable to mobile devices and approximately 11% was attributable to other consumer systems. net revenue from the industrial end market increased 9% sequentially and 25% over the prior year and represented 33% of total net revenues. net revenue from the infrastructure end market increased 3% sequentially and 7% over the prior year and represented 37% of total revenues.
i will now discuss the performance of each of our product groups. in q4 of fiscal year '21, our signal integrity product group grew 1% sequentially and represented 38% of total revenues. stronger demand from our pon and wireless base station business contributed to the growth. in q4, demand in the data center market remained soft as customers continue to consume excess inventory following the strong first half. we believe inventory levels have reduced and we are expecting datacenter revenues to grow in q1.
customer activity around our tri-edge pam4 cdrs remains high, and we now have multiple design wins that are in various stages of qualification in 100 gig, 200 gig and 400 gig pam4 optical modules. we expect our tri-edge revenues to increase nicely in fy '22 as customers move to full production. our fiberedge pmd platform which complements our clearedge and tri-edge cdr platforms as well as dsps continues to gain solid momentum in 400 gig and 800 gig pam4 optical systems. we are confident that tri-edge's lower power, lower cost and lower latency together with fiberedge's higher performance will enable us to continue to grow our hyperscale datacenter business and achieve another record in fiscal year '22.
in q4 of fy '21, our pon business grew nicely, driven by record 10 gig pon revenues as the ongoing demand for higher bandwidth connectivity is resulting in an increase in pon demand globally. while the china market is expected to lead pon deployment growth in fy '22, other global service providers, including in the us, india and europe have also announced deployment plans that we believe bodes well for our 2.5 gig and 10 gig pon platforms. semtech remains the leading supplier to the global pon market, providing the most comprehensive pon pmd portfolio. we expect our pon business to continue to grow and achieve another record performance in fy '22.
in q4 of fy '21, revenue from our wireless base station business increased nicely as our clearedge platform continued to establish a leadership position in 5g front haul optical modules. we also recently announced the availability of our new tri-edge 50 gig pam4 platform targeted at 5g front haul optical modules. we believe our established position in 4g, along with the 5g momentum from our new clearedge and tri-edge platforms targeted at front haul and mid haul optical module applications should enable our wireless base station business to deliver another record performance in fy '22. the underlying secular demand driven by the quest for higher bandwidth globally in datacenters, pon and wireless broadband networks is expected to drive solid growth from our signal integrity product group in q1 and in fiscal year '22.
moving on to our protection product group. in q4 of fiscal year '21, net revenues from our protection product group increased 15% sequentially and 26% over the same period last year and represented 29% of total revenues. in q4, our protection consumer business experienced better than seasonal demand led by a recovery in smartphones, following the weak start to the year due to covid. stronger demand from our asian smartphone customers, along with record revenue from our north american smartphone customers contributed to the q4 strength. in q4, demand from the broad based industrial markets was also stronger as our protection product group continues to diversify into a broader range of industrial and communications markets, including the automotive and iot markets.
semtech is the global leader in high performance protection solutions and our system design as used more advanced process geometries. the need for more robust protection to protect the sensitive devices will continue to increase. in addition, many of today's newer industrial systems and mobile platforms are using higher speed interfaces and advanced charging solutions where high performance protection is required. we believe these secular trends will drive increasing adoption of our protection platforms used in mobile systems, displays, accessories and increasingly across broad based industrial automotive and communications platforms. in q1 of fiscal year '22, we expect our protection revenues to be approximately flat.
turning to our wireless and sensing product group. in q4 of fiscal year '21, revenues from our wireless and sensing product group increased 6% sequentially and 32% over the prior year to achieve a new quarterly record and represented 33% of total revenues. in q4, our lora enabled platforms also delivered a new quarterly record and we announced several key initiatives that demonstrate the increasing acceptance of lora in low power iot applications. these include the following: aws announced the integration of the lorawan protocol with aws' iot core, a fully managed service that enables iot developers to easily connect low power lora based sensors to the aws cloud. swarm technologies, a global satellite communications company integrated lora into their platform that enables two-way communications to and from its leo satellites. lora is well suited for these long distance, low power applications enabling satellite based use cases for logistics, agriculture, connected cars and energy. witrac the developer of real-time location and telemetry capabilities integrated lora into its global track and trace platform to enable customers to guarantee delivery times and maintain appropriate temperature of fresh food inside refrigeration units throughout the entire cold chain. and ripl networks, a provider of ip networking of low power devices announced the use of lora in its ip mesh 3d location tracking software to help secure naval ports where 20-kilometer sensor connectivity range and 10 year battery life is required. these are just a few examples of the emerging use cases where lora's low power, long distance and flexibility demonstrate the value of lora technology in enabling a smarter, more connected and sustainable planet.
in q4 fiscal year '21, we also experienced record quarterly demand for our proximity sensing platforms led by strength from our asian smartphone customers. global rf regulations are increasing the proximity sensing requirements on smartphone manufacturers that wish to compete on a global stage. we expect our proximity sensing business to benefit from these enhanced requirements and recent design win activity in new 5g smartphones and the wearable devices where there are an increasing number of high-performance radios being used, indicate that our proximity sensing business will continue to grow nicely. for q1 of fiscal year '22, we expect net revenues from our wireless and sensing product group to increase and deliver another record quarter led by growth from our lora business.
moving on to new products and design wins. in q4 of fiscal year '21, we released 18 new products and achieved 3,080 new design wins.
now, let me comment briefly on our fiscal year '21 performance. in fiscal year '21, net revenues increased 9% to $595.1 million, driven by strength from all of our product groups. in fy '21 we had 56 new product releases and achieved a new design win record of 11,271 new design wins. in fy '21, our signal integrity product group grew 15% over the prior year as infrastructure spending increased. our sip product group achieved record bookings and had record 100 gig revenues, record 5g base station revenues and record 10 gig pon revenues. we expect these businesses along with our pam4 and pro av businesses to all achieve records in fy '22 and contribute to strong growth in our signal integrity product group in fiscal year '22.
in fy '21, our protection product group grew 3% over the prior year as the high-end consumer market strengthened and our diversification strategy began to yield results. we expect that protection business to achieve double-digit growth in fy '22 as our diversification efforts continue to bear fruit in both the consumer market and the broader industrial automotive and communications markets. in fy '21, our wireless and sensing product group grew 6% over the prior year, despite the slow start to the year due to covid, our lora enabled revenue grew 19% to approximately $88 million in fy '21. in fy '21, our lora business met or exceeded most of the metrics we targeted at the beginning of the year. these metrics included the number of countries with public lower networks in fy '21 grew to 100 countries from 91 at the end of fy '20.
as lora is well established in most regions of the world, we will no longer report on this specific metric. the number of public or private lora network operators grew to 150 at the end of fy '21 from 133 in fy '20 and we expect 165 lora network operators by the end of fy '22. the number of lora gateways deployed more than doubled from 642,000 gateways in fy '20 to over 1.3 million gateways at the end of fy '21. and we expect the number of lora gateways deployed to increase to over 2 million by the end of fy '22. the cumulative number of lora end-nodes deployed increased to 178 million at the end of fy '21 from 135 million at the end of fy '20. we expect this number to exceed 235 million cumulative end-nodes by the end of fy '22. the lora opportunity pipeline, which includes both opportunities and leads ended fy '21 at approximately $700 million. we anticipate that on average 40% to 50% of the opportunities currently in the pipeline will convert to deployments over a 24-month timeline. our opportunity pipeline is geographically well-balanced with use cases primarily in smart utilities, smart logistics and asset tracking, smart home and smart cities. at the end of fy '22, we are anticipating our total opportunity pipeline should exceed $850 million.
in fy '21, our lora business achieved several major accomplishments. these include our partnership with amazon on several projects including the amazon sidewalk network, design for smart home, community and consumer applications, providing low power, broad coverage for indoor and neighborhood area iot devices. we expect revenues from our amazon activities to start to ramp this fiscal year. our lora global platform that uses a 2.4 gigahertz version of lora has been adopted in a number of global use cases that require higher bandwidth or connectivity in areas where lorawan networks may not be present. and our lora edge platform enabled our first device to cloud platform and associated cloud services. in fy '21, we launched our first lora cloud services, offering device provisioning, device management and geolocation services. we have closed on our first cloud services agreements and expect initial cloud services revenues this fiscal year. we anticipate signing up over 20 cloud services agreements with customers by the end of fiscal year '22 as we fine-tune our capability and service offering. this is a new metric that we will report on quarterly. these accomplishments demonstrate the evolving maturity and acceptance of lora. the growing momentum and along with the continued influence of the lora alliance, we expect to continue to drive lora to become the de facto standard for the global lp wan market in what we expect to be a multi-billion unit industry in the next five years. for fy '22, we are expecting positive momentum from our lora business and anticipate a 40% cagr for our lora enabled business over the next five years.
now let me discuss our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year '22. following a record bookings in q4 and a record bookings year, we entered q1 with record backlog. we are currently estimating q1 net revenues to be between $164 million and $172 million. to attain the midpoint of our guidance range or approximately $168 million, we needed net terms orders of approximately 16% at the beginning of q1. we expect our q1 non-gaap earnings to be between $0.49 and $0.55 per diluted share.
i will now hand the call back to the operator and sandy, emeka and i will be happy to answer any questions. operator?

thank you. at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions]. our first question is from tore svanberg of stifel. please state your question.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
yes, thank you, and congratulations on the strong results. mohan, you just indicated that you only need 1% turns to meet the midpoint of the guidance. i'm just wondering, why you wouldn't guide higher? is it simply because of capacity constraints, because i honestly can't remember the last time you only did 1% turns?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so tore, i think since i've been the ceo over 15 years now, that's been -- that's clearly the lowest number of turns. i think the key thing to remember are, booking is extremely strong. demand is extremely strong. what we are monitoring very closely is consumption. we want to make sure that whatever we ship has been consumed. and so it's really -- we don't need any more turns for sure, but we are monitoring our pos activity to make sure that everything we see from our customers and our distributors who are servicing those customers is being consumed, and that really is why we are being fairly conservative on the turns number -- on the guidance and the outlook.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
that's great. and as a follow-up, could you just elaborate a little bit on both 5g and data center? it sounds like your visibility is improving quite a bit there. is that tied primarily to, obviously, continuous data center upgrades, but then also 5g deployments in north america, or is china still in the mix here=?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
so for 5g, for sure, it's all regions. i would say china is definitely in the mix still, and we are seeing some indications, the second half is going to be quite strong for 5g. and then on the data center side, yeah, it's a mixed bag, obviously, 100-gig is doing extremely well at the moment. we're expecting 200-gig to start to pick up in the second half and -- actually starting q2 and then picking up nicely in the second half as well. so we expect data center to have a pretty good year.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
great. thank you and congrats again.

our next question is from tristan gerra of baird. please state your question.
tristan gerra -- baird -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. could you talk about the gross margin drivers in the second half? how much of that is driven by mix and presumably data center versus price increases? and also, if you could remind us, where does your base station gross margin profile fits, relative to the corporate average?
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so tristan, thanks. as i said in my prepared remarks, we are seeing a lot of gross margin uplift that we expected from our new product areas, lora enabled, our tri-edge platforms, our industrial protection platforms, the wireless and others and so we are seeing a lot of gross margin expansion from them. and the expectation is that, as we go through the second half of the year, we should continue to see accelerating revenues from those platforms. so my expectation is that we will continue to see gross margin expansions going forward. with regards to the wireless side of stuff, the gross margins for the wireless business is above the corporate average at this point.
tristan gerra -- baird -- analyst
great. and are you supply constrained currently?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
there's pockets of supply constraints, tristan. i think one thing about us is, really about a year ago -- over a year ago, we made the decision strategically to put in place more internal inventory, which you can see. we're above our target range, our model range in internal inventory, and that has helped us for sure. so we're in a position where we're quite comfortable for this year. we'll have the supply to grow significantly and probably for next year. obviously, there are pockets of constraints where demand suddenly comes across us and we see a sudden increase in certain areas, and it's difficult to get the upside supply to support that. but in general, i think we're in pretty good shape.
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hello. tristan, this is emeka. just wanted to make sure that my comment on gross margin and the wireless., that you understand that i'm talking about wireless base stations, right?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
5g.
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer

our next question is from karl ackerman of cowen. please state your question.
karl ackerman -- cowen -- analyst
yes. thank you. i have a few questions as well.
sandy harrison -- vice president of investor relations
ey karl, could you speak up, please? we're having a tough time hearing you.
karl ackerman -- cowen -- analyst
is this better?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
go ahead.
karl ackerman -- cowen -- analyst
great. thank you. could you discuss the number of designs you now have for pam4, particularly around 200-gig and 400-gig, that are expected to see and probably greater adoption, at least across one [indecipherable]. if you could just talk about just the number of designs you see there, that would be helpful.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we -- i can't talk specifically, karl, but we have about 25 kind of design win activities going on at the moment. and i think some of those are starting to move to design wins and some of them even going to production. so -- and obviously, we're getting orders now. so the momentum looks quite good. it's our first set of products that are coming out. now we have the opportunity to bring more products out that have a little bit longer reach and a little bit more variance of our tri-edge platform, now that we've gotten through kind of our first cycle of learning from them. so i expect over the next year, we'll release more products and i think over the next few years, we'll have some good momentum in 100-gig, 200-gig or 400-gig and then beyond that, depending on what roadmap looks like at that point.
karl ackerman -- cowen -- analyst
great. thanks for that. i guess for my follow-up, in your protection business, i know you have historically been concentrated in mobile. but you highlighted, at least in your prepared comments, some opportunities within automotive and industrial, and i was hoping you could just detail that in a bit more detail that is supporting this business over the next couple of quarters? thank you.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, our protection business -- obviously, historically, it has been very strong in the mobile segment and as you know, we diversified within that segment, we used to have a lot of exposure to samsung. we now have exposure to other north american smartphone manufacturers, china manufacturers, wearables, display. so we've diversified within mobile.
but outside mobile, which is where the focus of our r&d -- a lot of the focus of our r&d efforts have been for interfaces, high-performance interfaces in communications infrastructure, like ethernet ports, automotive infrastructure, iot, hdmi 2.1 ports, usb-c. and what we found is across the whole industrial communications, automotive space, there is an increasing need for those high-performance interfaces in new systems. and so, that's what a lot of our focus is being put. we put a lot of focus into that area. and clearly, now, that's -- about 35% of our protection business is now in that area. and so, it's starting to grow in the right direction. that's obviously accretive to gross margins as well. so we feel good about the momentum there. we just have to -- it takes time. that's not a segment that grows rapidly, but it's a very -- has much longer lifecycle. so i think it will just continue to drive good growth for us over many years.
karl ackerman -- cowen -- analyst
thank you.

our next question is from quinn bolton of needham. please state your question.
michelle waller -- needham -- analyst
hi, guys. this is michelle on for quinn. thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results and solid execution. so my first one, just on the seasonality. if i'm not mistaken, you guys typically have a slightly more back half weighted year. but given the growth that you guys are expecting in the back half of fiscal '22, particularly with signal integrity and lora businesses, would it be reasonable to think that the second half might actually be more than slightly above 50% of fiscal '22 revenues, or would you think that revenues might be kind of in line with typical seasonality?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
well, obviously, we're still -- we're anticipating a very strong second half, as well as a pretty strong first half. actually, our q2 guidance obviously indicates that we're comfortable with q2. we have very strong backlog for supporting a very strong q3 and even for q4, we're starting to get very comfortable with that. so it's looking like, seasonality this year will be tricky to kind of call -- normally, q4, we would expect q4 to come down. that's still the expectation to some extent. but given where most of our growth engines are at the moment and some of the anticipation that some segments like 5g and data center are probably going to continue to be quite strong in the back end, we may see less of a decline, but that's a long ways off yet.
michelle waller -- needham -- analyst
yeah. okay. that's helpful. thanks. and then, just on my follow-up, on your -- on the last call, you guys had -- you mentioned the protection business was expected to grow. i think you guys said double digits in fiscal '22. just wondering if the softness in the smartphone side of the business during the first quarter, if that has maybe changed your expectations for the year, if you're maybe expecting slightly lower growth or what have you and -- for fiscal '22? just any update that you might have there would be helpful.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. actually the contrary, i think we're even more comfortable that protection is going to grow very nicely this year. remember what i said in my prepared remarks, on the consumer business, particularly the smartphone business, most of the -- i mean, there was a slight decline in our protection business, but a lot of that decline was driven by not demand and not by customers not wanting the materials, but them not being able to get enough components from other suppliers. and so that's not a demand issue, and i think we'll see that pick up throughout the rest of the year. so, we're still expecting pretty good growth for our protection business this year.
michelle waller -- needham -- analyst
okay, great. thanks and congrats again.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question is from harsh kumar of piper sandler. please state your question.
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
yeah. hey mohan, emeka and the team, just a fantastic job here. i love what is happening in your business. i had a strategic question, mohan. your kind of -- your company is humming and going. the question is, when do you see yourself coming to scale? is this a situation where -- what kind of optimizes the possible view for you, with a company like yours and a model like yours and what revenue do you start to maybe get into the 30% range for the op margin? and pick [phonetic] a number that you want to talk about, i guess, from aspirational standpoint in op margins?
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so, harsh, this is emeka. let me take that. i think the last analyst day we had probably two years ago, something, we talked about our expectations of our operating margin on a non-gaap basis to be in the 32% to 36% range. given the traction that we are seeing from our growth platforms and the gross margins that they come with, and the way we've typically managed our operating expenses, which we do expect to continue despite the fx headwinds that we're seeing at this point. we do believe that at $1 billion of revenue, we should be at the low to the mid-point of that range.
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. emeka, that's very helpful. and then, mohan, i just want to say, i've never -- i've covered your company for over a decade. i don't think -- there were very few times that i've seen you this optimistic about your business. i think i get the message that you feel extremely good about exceptional growth for much of the remainder of the year. if you can just reassure us that, that's the case based on whatever visibility you have in terms of bookings and backlog? and also, you covered up on the supply to be able to meet this kind of exceptional growth. in other words, can we expect, call it, 5% to 6% sequential growth consistently through the rest of the year outside of the seasonally down fourth quarter?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
so let me take the supply part of that first, harsh. i think we are comfortable with the supply. as i mentioned, we put in place inventory strategically for this scenario, and i think it's playing out to our advantage. obviously, there are always mix issues, and so one has to continue to manage that and monitor that and things do change. so -- but at this point in time, we feel quite comfortable that we can supply to the current demand levels.
and then on the demand side, yeah, we are very confident. a lot of the growth is coming from platforms we've invested in for many years. as you know, lora has taken us quite a while, and it's not a short-term investment. this is something that's been invested -- we've invested in for many, many years and when you build a foundation that's structured that way, it can be very successful. obviously, as you know, we have had to be very patient, but things are starting to play out quite nicely now in that business. i feel very good about it. we've said, we expect 40% cagr, and i think we're very comfortable with that number. so, the lora-enabled business is looking very strong.
our other growth engines, as you know, proximity sensing, again, another platform we've invested in for many years, starting to play out because of the 5g and high power radios. so, a lot of trends going in our favor there. the data center side, we've invested heavily in 100-gig nrz platform. we've invested heavily in our pam4 platform, the tri-edge and fiberedge and so those are playing out well as well. 10-gig pon is another growth area where we've invested in heavily for many, many years, and so that's playing out quite nicely. that's going to be another good growth driver for us. i mentioned 5g wireless. it's a little bit lumpy. as you know with pam infrastructure, but i think that also is going to do quite well.
and then on the protection side, i think this is one of the areas where we're really pleased to start to see the diversification play out. and the broader protection business has a much larger tam potential. it takes time, but as we start to see that gain momentum, i feel very good about that business because it's very accretive to gross margins, obviously and i think the more momentum we get there, i think the better for the company.
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, thank you mohan and congratulations, guys, once again.

our next question is from craig ellis of b. riley securities. please state your question.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
yup, thanks for taking the question and congratulations team on the great execution. so mohan, i don't typically ask about the end markets, but i thought there was something interesting in them. so, i wanted to direct my first question that way. so great to see high-end consumer up 52%, and industrial up 41%. the question around infrastructure which is up 6%, is -- we can all see that the enterprise spending backdrop was really severely impacted post covid and that we are far from firing on all cylinders with cloud and data center. but the question is this, with more and more reports suggesting an upturn in enterprise spending in the other two end markets, is it possible that we'll see infrastructure achieving similar year-on-year growth rates, but maybe with two, four, six quarter delay to what we're now seeing in high-end consumer and industrial, especially given the product cycle positioning that you talked about through your prepared remarks and q&a.?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes, craig. we're very positive about infrastructure. i think infrastructure did quite well last year and so i think that's part of the challenge with the year-on-year growth. but definitely, 10-gig pon -- i mean, pon in general, i think so excess bandwidth, i think we're going to -- we're expecting very strong growth this year. we're still expecting some growth in hyperscale data center this year. and so, for me that's an interesting data point, given the inventory that was built up. and so, i think we're starting to see, in general, some of the infrastructure space segments coming back, and these segments tend to be a little bit more lumpy. you've got kind of a spate of investment and then a lot of deployment and then there's kind of a period of digestion and then it comes back again, but it will be up into the right. there's no question that the need for infrastructure across all of our segments that we play in, hyperscale, 5g, 10-gig pon, is there -- the need is there. and then when you add to that some of the other emerging segments, i think that, for sure, is going to still continue to grow.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
that's great. and then switching gears over to lora, and i'm surprised there wasn't a question already, although many good ones asked. but with regards to lora, there's been a lot of talk on call similar to this over the last three or four quarters about the potential for high volume, endpoint wins. and we do still have that nice year-end program bogey out there. so the question is this, how are you feeling about the potential with some of your bigger customers or partnerships to secure some high volume wins, and when would you expect to get some visibility that those might ramp?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
well, we feel good about it. i think my sense is we're going to have a very strong year, even without that. to be honest with you, craig, i think we've got a lot of momentum in the business through -- just globally and some of the recovery from covid from last year's issues. and so i think a combination of some use cases really starting to grow nicely. more new products that we -- with our lora edge platform, that's driving new opportunities. and i think now -- with more gateways being deployed. if you do monitor the number of gateways deployed, you'll see a pretty large acceleration in the number of gateways. we had 1.3 million gateways deployed by -- at the end of fy 2021. by the end of fy '22, we will already have 1.7 million gateways deployed.
so i think that all tells me that things are going in the right direction. and yeah, we continue to work, obviously, with some very big guys who are working some very nice use cases, and we'll see -- always the proof is in the pudding and if those use cases get deployed and how much business that can drive for us. in the end, i think when we look at lora, we look not just for one use case or one customer or one region, we're looking across the whole landscape of low power wireless connectivity and really monitoring the progress across the board and i would say it's very exciting.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
good to hear. thanks much, mohan.

our next question is from gary mobley of wells fargo. please state your question.
gary mobley -- wells fargo -- analyst
hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. i wanted to ask about your inventories and maybe what they're signaling. so you're running, what, 26% above the high-end of the inventory days target and it's up sequentially, again, speaking of your own inventories, we don't know, however, what your distributor inventories are, and i know you don't normally disclose that, but can you give us a sense of the sequential direction in your distributor inventory? seemingly, you're having a little bit easier time than some of your peers in securing some wafer supply and finished product and whatnot. and so my question related to all this is, given that you seem to have adequate inventory, is there less motivation for your end customers or your distributors to double order or order more product than they actually need?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
well, that's a good question. i think one of the things we're doing -- so first of all, to answer your question on distributor inventory, distributor inventory from our standpoint is pretty low, continues to reduce. demand is extremely strong, though, and bookings are extremely strong. so the thing we do, gary, is we monitor our pos very closely. so that's shipments out of our distributors to our customers and we talk to our end customers, and we try to get a gauge on consumption. and the consumption is really the key, right, because as long as you're shipping to consumption levels, which we believe we are and we believe we can continue to support consumption levels, then i think we'll probably -- we can continue to see growth in the business. and so that's the game that we're playing. i don't know if emeka, you want to add anything to that?
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, yeah. i think just like i said in my remarks, gary, like mohan said, the bookings are very strong. the demand is very strong. so with regards to sort of the question you have is the multiplication for our distributors to maybe double book our stuff. i don't think we're seeing any evidence of that. what we are definitely seeing though, is that the evidence of the concern about being able to get -- have access to inventories in the long run. so we are seeing these guys placing orders and maybe requesting them out into the future and things like that. but like mohan said, we are managing these things very clearly, very concisely. i think we're very happy with what we have in terms of the internal inventory, knowing that we are very well positioned for the most part, to support the strong demand that we are seeing. but at the same time, trying to make sure that we're not just shipping the half stuff resting in terms of the distributor shelves, right?
gary mobley -- wells fargo -- analyst
sure. appreciate the color. so my follow-up i wanted to ask about your tia, lidar products, in particular with your recently announced extension or perhaps new relationship with intel. is this lidar for industrial applications? lidar for automotive applications? and in general, how would you size up your market opportunity for your tias, in particular in the lidar market?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
so from an end market standpoint, it's very much a platform for intel and intel's use for all their applications, whether that be in industrial, i think the first target is industrial/consumer and then automotive eventually. i would say that it's more of a longer term opportunity, gary. we've obviously -- we're working with them very closely, but there are still technology challenges and market validation and stuff like that. but the technology development is what we call one of our emerging growth engines.
so if i look at our current portfolio of growth engines, which includes lora and proximity sensing and tri-edge and some of the products, those are all in growth phase, but we have a number of follow-on technologies that are coming on and lidar is one of them, which we've invested in for several years now. we'll continue to invest in for another several years, i think and hopefully, that will become a very good growth driver for us in the future. but i think it's early days, but it's good to be working with a partner like intel, and hopefully, it will turn into real business for us.
gary mobley -- wells fargo -- analyst

our next question is from christopher rolland of susquehanna. please state your question.
christopher rolland -- susquehanna -- analyst
thanks guys. mohan, you had mentioned gateways and that 400,000 number, which was pretty impressive. can you remind us on -- or update us on content per gateway now? and then also, if you can talk about kind of the drivers of gateway, i think you hinted to some of those. but talk about the mix of revenue gateways versus nodes now and some of the changes that we've seen, as of late and how you think those will trend?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so we have 191 million end nodes connected now. it's a cumulative number, still connected to those gateways. the number of gateways out there now with being 1.7 million, actually, that supports well over 5 billion sensors. so we have plenty of capacity out there for more sensors. so that's a good thing.
the thing to remember about gateways, we have different types of gateways. we have macro gateways, which go on towers, 30-kilometer range. those are $1,000 kind of gateways. on the other end of the scale, we have picocell gateways that are $100 and very low cost, and really target to that indoor use cases, support 5,000 sensors, things like that and about 1-mile range. so a range of different gateways. and every use case and every customer has a different application. they can deploy different types of gateways in some cases or where they're doing indoor and outdoor connectivity. so it very much varies, chris.
i think the key thing, though, what's driving the sudden acceleration is one of the use cases i mentioned, is this concept of building up a network that then monetizes the person who is using the gateway or who has the gateway in their house or in their enterprise and that monetization through cryptocurrency. as you know, that's the helium approach, and there are other companies now thinking about that and doing that. so that's pretty exciting for us. we'll see. it's a new use case. we don't know if it's going to really fly longer term, but it sounds like a very nice interesting opportunity.
and one in which you're doing real stuff. i mean, people are using gateways for monitoring, tracking assets and tracking important things in their life or using it for special kind of monitoring of low power sensors. so yes, it's a really interesting application.
there are other use cases that are now starting to drive more gateway deployments, i think, across the globe. i think not only the smart home, but the smart asset tracking and logistics in general, i think, is driving the need for more gateways. so that also is another use case. so we're pretty excited by it. we'll see where it leads to.
christopher rolland -- susquehanna -- analyst
great. and my hotspot is on order and backlogged as well for that. but actually speaking about that, it does seem like there's -- from this supplier, at least there's a multi-month backlog of gateways in hundreds of thousands of units, actually. so maybe you could talk about that. are you severely constrained there? when do you think you might be balanced out with demand -- supply demand balance there? and then just to confirm, are you saying that there's between $100 and $1,000 of semtech content in those gateways? thanks.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
no. so the gateways are -- the prices i was giving you is kind of the retail kind of price out there. our content is $3 to $5 in the small gateways and $30 in the larger gateway. so that's our content. but coming back to the discussion on supply/demand for gateways, you know, the constraint is not our devices. the constraint, i think, that manufacturers are having in some microcontrollers and microprocessors and other components that go -- that make up the gateway. of course, we only develop the radios, right? so our -- we have materials, but i think there's other components that are limiting the availability.

thanks and i'll add my congratulations, guys. maybe one more lora question, i know it's been a lot. but i know some industry folks are calling 2021 the year of scale for lora. i think the number of lora-certified sensors is something like 35% or 40% over the last year. where i'm going with the question is, i mean, are we finally at that tipping point with lora here? i mean, i think if i heard you correctly, mohan, you talked about exiting this year at about $850 million pipeline. something around 50% of that converting to revenue over the following couple of years. so, i mean, if you run the math on that, it's pretty significantly above your 40% cagr you've talked about for that business. so, i'm just curious if you could maybe -- i could have misheard you too, i guess. but i'm just curious, what's changing and what kind of color you can add to that, and i guess back to just a question ago, how big of an issue is supply constraint for you in terms of capitalizing on that backlog?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
so rick, i think you heard correctly. i do think momentum is accelerating now and i think we're starting to see some of that funnel really convert to deployment. and that's always been the challenge for us is trying to figure out, ok, we have this huge funnel, and we have number of pocs and customers love the technology, when are they going to deploy? and i think obviously, with the setback of the pandemic and with the china issues over the last couple of years.
but i think now, we're just starting to see that the realization is this technology really does add value to use cases that -- related to climate change, related to pollution control, related to safety, related to asset tracking, logistics, smart home initiatives, smart city initiatives, the technology is really good for it. and so i think what we're starting to see is just the realization that this is -- some of the pocs that have been going on, are now starting to remove the bottlenecks. you mentioned sensors, software is another one. and with the announcement with aws on the aws iot core platform, things like that, it really removes the need for software developments and removes some of those bottlenecks.
and so i think over time, just those bottlenecks will be removed and then it's very simple to deploy an end-to-end lora use case. and i think as that happens, we're going to see really this whole funnel that we have, not only the funnel getting larger, but i think the funnel will have -- we'll have a little bit more confidence about the conversion and the rate of conversion into revenue.
and then you add to that, as i mentioned to tristan, in his question that -- we're starting to see some of the big guys really talk about good technology. amazon really put a lot of discussion around sidewalk this last quarter, not something that was driven by us. it was pretty much them going out and talking about it and we're starting to see others now utilize the technology and talk about their own systems. and so this is all positive for us and then we add to that, some of the cloud services and other things that are coming along. it just makes us feel really good about where the business is, and where it's headed. so, we'll keep monitoring. obviously, we want to keep growing the number of gateways deployed, the number of n-nodes that are connected and the number of services that are connected and the value that those services provide, and that should drive continued revenue growth for us.
rick schafer -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thanks for that color. and another area that's really hit -- and i feel like it's the stride for you guys is proximity sensing. do you have a sense of what proximity sensing -- or what the penetration rate is today, kind of where we're at?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think today, so most phone manufacturers, obviously, they have a range of different phones. and the high-end phones, particularly the 5g phones and the ones with multiple high-powered radios tend to be the ones that they are putting proximity sensing into and then -- so that's one dynamic, is where you have more power -- high powered radios. and then the other thing is, depending on where you ship those phones to. so, if you're a global player and you ship to europe and north america, you almost certainly need to have proximity sensing in those phones, just because of regulatory requirements. those regulations are starting to expand globally, by the way. so i do think that the -- there's going to be an increasing need for more proximity sensing on these higher end phones, as we go forward. but today, i would estimate probably about 30% of the phones have proximity sensing.
rick schafer -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thanks for that color.
operator
our next question is from scott searle of roth capital. please state your question.
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. just to go back quickly to lora, i wanted a couple of clarifications, mohan. i'm not sure if i heard it in your opening comments, but you talked about proximity sensors being at record levels. was lora at record levels in the quarter? it certainly looks like it based on the numbers, and kind of how you expect that to build over the course of this year. should we be thinking about sequential growth or even flattish? because it looks like you're basically honing in on 40% plus growth where we are today. and it doesn't sound like you're counting on any sort of large-scale consumer contribution outside of china kicking in, in the current fiscal year?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah scott. so the lora was record, and i expect q2 to be a record. and actually, we expect every quarter, lora to have a record quarter this year and to achieve that 40% growth at least, that momentum is very good for lora as well as it is proximity sensing. and then, yes in general, i would say that the business is just kind of kind firing on all cylinders. it has been -- for the last couple of years, it has been challenging i think. there's been a lot of headwinds. but i think now we're starting to see that momentum build up, and that's just playing out well for us.
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
great. and lastly, if i could, on the protection side of the business, you talked about a long-term or intermediate term double-digit growth rate. now certainly, in the near term, the handset market has been challenged and constrained by other component availability and i would expect that to bounce back. but when you think about that 10% plus kind of growth and the mix of your current business being more skewed toward mobile, the smartphone market is expected to grow mid to low single digits on a normalized basis over the next several years. so are you expecting to grow faster than that in mobile or the non-mobile components in terms of industrial and auto, expected to see such strong double-digit growth, that's kind of how you get to the 10%-plus growth number? thanks.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, a little bit of both, scott. i think within mobile, we are expecting more diversification there. so we include displays in mobile, for example, we include wearables in mobile. so it's not just samsung phones. so we expect that to continue to grow. but clearly, our investment -- most of our r&d investments are going into the broader protection market. and, yeah, our hope is that, that can grow well above double digits. we'll see how -- the market itself may not be growing that fast, but the tam is large, and it's converging a lot of the segments within that space are converging to the point where they need to use higher-end protection, because of some high performance interfaces that they're bringing into their systems. and i mentioned hdmi 2.1 usb-c, ethernet infrastructure and some of that requires more protection, higher-end protection. so that's our goal, is to try to grow our broader business at a faster rate.
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
great, thank you. great quarter.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
our final question is from tore svanberg of stifel. please state your question.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
yeah. thanks. just some follow-up. first of all, mohan, now that the matter is sort of unifying some of the other iot standards, should we view zigbee and some of these standards as still competitors to lora, or with matter can you start to see more cooperation between lora and matter? because i know in the past, you've talked about sort of lora plus wi-fi and lora plus bluetooth, and i'm just wondering also if there is a way to see lora plus matter?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we don't really worry about or mind, who we're partnering with, and it's really driven by customers. if customer says, well, we want to build a system where it's lora plus zigbee or lora plus wi-fi or whatever, we'll work with them. and that's one of the reasons we licensed the ip out to certain companies and so they can build different solutions. our goal is simply to make lora the de facto standard for lp-wan in the industry. how we achieve that goal, there's obviously various ways to get there.
so what -- when we look at lora though, the uniqueness of lora makes it a very valuable additional radio to have in a system compared to -- when it's added to 5g wireless, for example, you have a very high bandwidth radio, and then you have a low power sensor connectivity radio. there are some technologies where there is some complement, but it's more of an overlap. and i would say zigbee, z-wave and wi-fi, as it pertains to low power sensor connectivity, i think are areas where there's maybe more overlap than complement. but most of the technologies, the other radio technologies are very complementary.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
that's very helpful. and just one last clarification one for emeka. when you talked about the opex sort of staying at this level, could you clarify what you meant by that? is that a percentage of revenue and how much of an impact is the exchange rate having on opex, i guess, from a percentage perspective?
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so my comment was actually more toward the absolute dollar amount of the opex. i think, for our second quarter, the q2 guidance, i think non-gaap operating expenses would get it to about $65 million or something like that, if i remember correctly. so that's what i'm referring to that, i should expect that the operating expenses for the rest of the year to stay somewhat around that area, those levels.
with regards to the fx impact, it is actually, if you think about the operating expenses being slightly above half the rate of revenue growth that we've talked about before, which is our model. most of that is being driven -- most of that excess, if you will, has been driven by the impact of the weak u.s. dollar.
tore svanberg -- stifel -- analyst
very helpful. thank you.
operator
we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. i will now turn the call back over to mohan maheswaran for closing remarks.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
in closing, we are pleased with our q1 results and the strong start to fiscal year '22. the company is benefiting from the strength of our growth engines, addressing the infrastructure, smarter planet and mobility markets that we believe will produce -- provide sustainable long-term growth. we have been successfully navigating through the pandemic and more recently, the challenging supply chain environment. we have also doubled down on our commitment to sustainability efforts and our human capital development. given our diverse product offering, balanced end market approach and strong customer relationships, we expect to deliver a record financial performance in fy '22.
with that, we appreciate your continued support of semtech and look forward to updating you all next quarter. thank you.

operator
greetings. welcome to the semtech corporation q1 fiscal year 2022 earnings call. [operator instructions].
i will now turn the conference over to your host, sandy harrison, vp of investor relations. thank you. you may begin.
sandy harrison -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, hillary, and welcome to semtech's conference call to discuss our first quarter fiscal year '22 financial results. speakers for today's call, will be mohan maheswaran semtech's president and chief executive officer; and emeka chukwu, our chief financial officer. a press release announcing our unaudited results was issued after the market close today, and is available on our website at semtech.com.
today's call will include forward-looking statements, that include risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in these statements. for a more detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please review the safe harbor statement included in today's press release, and in the other risk factors section of our most recent periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission. as a reminder, comments made on today's call are current as of today only and semtech undertakes no obligation to update the information from this call, should facts or circumstances change. as a reminder, all references made to financial results in mohan's and emeka's prepared remarks, during the call, will refer to non-gaap financial measures unless otherwise noted. a discussion of why the management team considers such non-gaap financial measures useful, along with the detailed reconciliations of such non-gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measures, are also included in today's press release.
with that, i'll turn the call over to semtech's chief financial officer, emeka chukwu, emeka?
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, sandy. good afternoon, everyone. as sandy stated, unless otherwise noted, i will be reviewing our non-gaap financial results and their reconciliation table is available in today's press release.
for q1 fiscal year '22, net sales grew 3% sequentially and 28% over the same period a year ago to $170.4 million, and above the midpoint of our guidance, led by the continued strength of the secular themes driving our growth platforms. in q1, shipments into asia represented 78% of net sales. north america represented 13% and europe represented 9%. we estimate that approximately 35% of our shipments is consumed in china.
total direct sales represented approximately 14% and sales to distribution represented approximately 86%, and our pos represented another quarterly record. our distribution business remained balanced, with 31% of the total pos coming from the high-end consumer end market, 37% coming from the infrastructure end market, and 32% from the industrial end market.
q1 bookings increased on both a q-over-q and year-over-year basis and once again, represented a new quarterly record and resulted in a book-to-bill well above one. sales [phonetic] bookings accounted for approximately 17% of shipments during the quarter. q1 non-gaap gross margin increased 50 basis points sequentially to 62%, which was at the high end of our guidance range, due to a more favorable product mix. for q2 and fiscal year '22, we continue to expect our gross margin to trend higher as we expect net sales growth to come from our growth platforms that tend to have higher margins. we believe that we can continue to mitigate the higher costs associated with the challenging global supply chain through slower customer pricing reductions or through price increases.
q1 non-gaap operating expense increased 3% to $64.1 million, driven by the negative impact of the weaker u.s. dollar and higher new product development expenses. for the rest of fiscal year '22, due to the weaker u.s. dollar, we expect our non-gaap operating expense to be slightly above current levels. in q1, we were pleased to see our operating profit on a sequential basis and year-over-year basis grow significantly faster than our revenue, due to gross margin expansion and modest growth in operating expenses. we expect to see continued operating leverage, as we go through the year, driven by revenue growth from our lora enabled, our tri-edge and our industrial protection platforms.
as a reminder, beginning in fiscal year '22, we started using a normalized non-gaap tax rate of 13% for the full fiscal year, that we believe reduces the variability in non-gaap tax rates that can occur throughout the year. we will update this tax rate annually at the beginning of each fiscal year.
in q1, our cash flow from operations increased 20% sequentially to $33 million or 19% of net sales. our free cash flow increased 61% sequentially to 16% of net sales, compared to our long-term free cash flow target of 25% to 30% of sales.
in q1, we repurchased approximately 361,000 shares of our outstanding stock for $25 million, resulting in $364 million remaining in our outstanding authorization that was expanded by our board during the quarter. we expect to continue to use our cash to opportunistically repurchase our shares, make strategic investments and pay down our debt.
accounts receivable in q1 decreased 6% from q4, while days of sales increased a day to 37 days and remains below our target range of 40 to 45 days. in q1, net inventory in absolute dollar terms increased 7% sequentially, and days of inventory increased to 126 days from 116 days at the end of q4, and remains above our target range of 90 to 100 days. we expect our net inventory to remain above our target range, to support stronger demand and to address the tighter supply chain environment.
in summary, fiscal year '22 is off to a strong financial start. our growth platforms are showing strength. our gross margins are expanding, driven by those platforms and our optimized operating expenses are leading to a rapidly expanding operating margin. our cash flow generation remains strong, and we continue to focus on the execution of those things that we can control and believe the long-term secular nature of our growth engines position us nicely for strong growth and a record financial performance in fiscal year '22 and beyond.
i will now hand the call over to mohan.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, emeka. good afternoon, everyone. i will discuss our q1 fiscal year '22 performance by end market, and by product group, and then provide our outlook for q2 of fiscal year '22.
in q1, net revenue increased 3% sequentially and 28% over the prior year to $170.4 million. higher demand across all three of our end markets drove the q1 growth. we posted non-gaap gross margin of 62% and non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $0.53. in q1, net revenue from the high-end consumer market increased 8% sequentially and 52% over the prior year and represented 32% of total revenues. approximately 21% of consumer net revenue was attributable to mobile devices, and approximately 11% was attributable to other consumer systems.
net revenue from the industrial market increased 1% sequentially and 41% over the prior year and represented 32% of total net revenues. net revenue from the infrastructure market increased 1% sequentially and 6% over the prior year and represented 36% of total revenues.
i will now discuss the performance of each of our product groups. in q1 of fiscal year '22, our signal integrity product group grew 7% sequentially and represented 39% of total revenues. demand increased across our data center, pon and wireless base station businesses. in q1, revenue from the data center market increased, as demand for 100 gigabit per second optical modules continued to increase. data center bookings grew strongly in q1, and we are expecting strong growth for the rest of the year, driven by 100 gigabit per second, 200 gigabit per second and 400 gigabit per second optical modules. momentum for our tri-edge pam4 cdrs in 100-gig, 200-gig and 400-gig optical systems is increasing, as these design wins transition to production over the next few quarters.
our tri-edge products experienced record bookings in q1, as customers begin early deployments that are expected to ramp at global data center customers in the second half of this fiscal year. we expect our revenue from tri-edge optical modules to grow nicely in fy '22 and over the next few years, as more programs move to production. our fiberedge pmd platforms are also doing well, as they complement our clearedge and tri-edge cdr platforms and dsp-based modules, where customers are taking advantage of the higher performance and increased integration provided by fiberedge.
we are pleased with our progress in the pam4 optical module market and are increasingly confident that the lower power, lower cost and lower latency that tri-edge provides, together with fiberedge's higher performance and integration, should enable our hyperscale data center business to continue to grow and achieve a revenue record in fy '22.
in q1 of fy '22, our pon business increased, led by another record quarter for 10-gig pon revenue. in q1, we had record pon bookings, driven by demand from chinese, european and north american service providers, that we believe bodes well for future growth from our 2.5 gig and 10-gig pon platforms. semtech provides the most comprehensive pon portfolio available in the market and is the leading provider of 10-gig pon solutions for both the onu and olt segments. we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the increasing global demand for higher bandwidth, access connectivity and expect our pon business to grow nicely in fy '22.
in q1 of fy '22, revenue from wireless base stations, increased as our 5g solutions achieved another revenue record. in q1, we began sampling our recently announced 50-gigabit per second pam4 tri-edge phone, targeted at front-haul optical modules for the 5g wireless market. we expect 5g wireless deployments to accelerate in the second half of fiscal year '22, and continue to ramp for several years.
in q2, bookings for our signal integrity product group reached a new record, as demand for high bandwidth global infrastructure continued to increase. we expect these businesses, along with our video business, and our emerging lidar business to drive sustainable long-term growth for our signal integrity product group. in q2 fiscal year of '22, we expect our signal integrity revenues to increase and achieve a new quarterly revenue record on higher demand from the data center and pon markets.
moving on to our protection product group. in q1 of fiscal year '22, net revenues from our protection product group decreased 5% sequentially and increased 13% annually and represented 27% of total revenues. in q1, protection smartphone revenue declined, as some smartphone customers experienced supply constraints, not related to semtech, impacting their ability to build complete systems. demand and bookings from our smartphone customers continue to increase, and we expect revenues to recover in the next few quarters.
in q1, demand for our protection devices from the broad-based industrial market continued to grow and experienced record bookings, as our diversification efforts into the broader protection market, including the automotive and iot markets, gained momentum. many of today's high tech systems are using more advanced process geometries that require robust high performance protection technology, to prevent damage to their highly sensitive devices. we expect this secular trend to continue and drive increased adoption of semtech's protection platforms in mobile systems, and increasingly across broad-based industrial, automotive and communication systems, that should enable our protection business to deliver double digit growth over the next several years. in q2 of fiscal year '22, we expect our protection revenues to increase nicely, driven by strength from all segments.
turning to our wireless and sensing product group. in q1, revenues from our wireless and sensing product group increased 7% sequentially and 78% over the prior year and achieved another quarterly record and represented 34% of total revenues. in q1, as expected, our lora-enabled platforms delivered another quarterly record, as the lora momentum starts to accelerate globally across multiple use cases.
we recently announced a number of new initiatives that further demonstrate the value that lora technology delivers to emerging iot applications. these included, echostar joined the lora alliance and launched an initiative to use lora wan networks to bring new, lower-cost satellite-based connectivity services to the logistics, asset tracking, utility and agriculture segments. sas, a leader in iot software analytics and services, announced the use of lora wan, together with its sas ai platform, and in conjunction with microsoft azure will offer a suite of end-to-end solutions to resolve real-world issues associated with flood prevention, precision agriculture, livestock wellness and smart energy.
inview, a global leader in retail systems announced the integration of lora wan into its inview live platform to improve the retail shopper experience. and the mxc foundation announced that lora wan network using personal gateways, similar to the recently announced helium network, over which individuals can mine cryptocurrency. we are seeing more of this type of shared lora wan network model emerge, which is contributing to the rapid growth in lora wan gateway deployments. these are the some examples of emerging use cases, as the low-power, long-range and flexibility of lora is enabling a smarter, more connected and sustainable planet.
in q1, our lora business metrics continued to progress well against our targets for fy '22. the number of lora network operators grew to 151, and we are expecting 165 lora network operators by the end of fy '22. the cumulative number of lora end nodes deployed increased to 191 million, and we expect this number to exceed 235 million cumulative end nodes by the end of fiscal year '22. the number of lora gateways deployed increased to more than 1.7 million and we expect the number of lora gateways deployed to increase to over 2 million by the end of fiscal year '22.
the lora opportunity pipeline now exceeds $700 million and by the end of fy '22, we are anticipating our opportunity pipeline to exceed $850 million. we anticipate that, on average 40% to 50% of the opportunities currently in the pipeline will convert to deployments over a 24-month timeline. our opportunity pipeline remains geographically well balanced, with used cases primarily in smart utilities, smart logistics, asset tracking, smart home and smart cities. these metrics demonstrate the growing adoption of lora, across a broadening low power wireless landscape. with this strong momentum and along with the continued influence of the lora alliance, we expect to continue to drive lora to become the de facto standard for the global lp-wan market, in what we expect to be a multibillion unit industry in the next five years.
in q1, we experienced record quarterly demand for our proximity sensing platforms, led by continued strength from our asian smartphone customers. as global rf power regulations become more broadly adopted, driven by environmental and social health concerns, leading smartphone manufacturers competing on a global stage are implementing proximity sensing technology into their 5g devices. semtech's leadership and highly innovative proximity sensing platform delivers the industry's most advanced, lowest power and highly integrated proximity sensing technology. with the increasing use of 5g phones and the increased deployment of high-powered radios across the whole mobile industry, we expect the demand for our proximity sensing platforms to increase over the next few years. for q2 of fiscal year '22, we expect net revenues from our wireless and sensing product group to increase and deliver another record quarter, led by new records from our lora and proximity sensing businesses.
moving on to new products and design wins; in q1 of fiscal year '22, we released 11 new products and achieved 3,036 new design wins, which represents a 38% increase over the previous year.
now let me discuss our outlook for the second quarter of fy '22. driven by the record bookings in q1, we entered q2 with record backlog, and we are currently estimating q2 net revenues to be between $177 million and $187 million. to attain the midpoint of our guidance range or approximately $182 million, we needed net term orders of approximately 1% at the beginning of q2. we expect our q2 non-gaap earnings to be between $0.57 and $0.65 per diluted share.
i will now hand the call back to the operator and sandy, emeka and i will be happy to answer any questions. operator?
",2022-Q1,SMTC
1.0,1.0,,,":
operator
thank you. at this time, we would like to begin a question and answer session. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of tore sandberg with stifel. you may proceed with your question.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
yes, thank you and congratulations on the record results. mohan, i think you mentioned that lora is now basically on track growing at the sort of 40% forecast. does that mean this year is also now tracking for lora to be up 40%?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
it is, it's tracking, i would say, it's tracking ahead of that actually. so, that's our expectation to be at least 40%, yeah.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
very good. and as a follow-up, but just to clarify, when you talk about protection business, you expect it to be at the double-digit growth business going forward. was that, specifically for the non-consumer part or was that for the entire category?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
for the entire category. i think, consumer obviously grow faster, but it can also come down faster, it's little bit more volatile. our broader industrial protection is more stable growth i would say, it's not going to -- you're not going to see the very high and a very drop it just more, just kind of whatever the industry is growing at plus x% and i think one of the things about this business is that we are really just starting to play in the broader industrial protection business, so we have a lot of the ability to increase penetration there i think is much better for us for some of those trends i mentioned go in our favor. so, as a total, we think, we can grow double-digits nicely. the other thing to remember in this business is that the broader industrial protection business is much higher gross margin typically than the consumer protection, so that will definitely be a positive for us.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
very good, thank you very much. congrats again, i'll go back in line.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of tristan gerra with baird. you may proceed with your question.
tristan gerra -- r.w baird -- analyst
yeah. congrats. about the 40% of the 900 million pipeline in lora that you expect to deploy over the next 24 months. can you remind us of the average duration of those design wins?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
so the opportunity funnel, tristan covers several years of design opportunity, some of those will move faster and can return to revenue in 12 months. others may take 36 to 48 months depending on what it is, if it's a meter relative to maybe a smart home applications as an example. so, on average we would say 40% of that total opportunity pipeline will convert over the next couple of years, maybe the way to think about is probably two to three year timeline, 40% of those opportunity -- opportunities will convert to design wins in revenue.
tristan gerra -- r.w baird -- analyst
okay. and then as a quick follow-up, if you could reconcile, obviously you have very strong visibility, very low net turns to meet your quarter guidance, but you also raising inventories internally, how much are you suffering from supply constraints right now and when would you expect a catch-up shipments relative to the real level of demand that you're seeing?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
well, we are shipping nicely to consumption, which is what we believe is the right thing to do. so we don't believe any of our customers and customers are short, there are pockets of supply constraints from -- in certain businesses that are doing extremely well, but in general, we think we're quite comfortable, we've built a good amount of inventory with anticipated demand strength and that's what we're doing. so, i think we're good for this year to support the consumption that we believe is required. as we go into next year, we're going to have to take a close look at it, but we continue to believe the right thing to do is to build our own internal inventory and make sure that we are shipping to consumption levels.
tristan gerra -- r.w baird -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of quinn bolton with needham and co. you may proceed with your question.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
hey, guys, firstly echo my congratulations as well. mohan, wanted to start with the lora opportunity pipeline, which is expanding nicely. can you talk about is -- are you seeing a broadening out in that business in pipeline or are there a couple of specific smart city, smart home applications that are really starting to drive a lot of the growth in the pipeline?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
it's -- so, i would say it's very broad, quinn, and it's also regionally quite well balanced, which is important. so i would say in the americas, it's smart home driven, smart utilities and logistics; in china, it's smart utilities, smart city and industrial iot; and in europe, it's smart utilities, logistics and industrial iot. so it's different segments driving most of the opportunities, not a surprise that those segments are the ones that are driving the business, because that's where lora fits very well into those categories. and so that is what we expect and that's what we're seeing, so not really a surprise. i think over the last couple of years, as you know, with the pandemic and some of the china trade issues, the opportunity funnel hasn't increased the way we would have liked it we've done, but we're starting to see that now. and that's really a positive thing because that really will drive the future growth.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
great [indecipherable] nice job on the gross margin expansion and particularly, so on the guide. and i guess just looking forward, it sounds like a lot of the growth are coming from the higher margin products. and so i guess it just begs the question, if you think you can be 62.8 to 63.8 in the october quarter, where do you think margins could go over the next one to two years. do you think you could see 64 to 65, what's the upper limit, we should be thinking about?
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so, when we look at our gross margin story, it is actually very pleasing to see it's playing out of the way we had expected, right. we've always talked about these high gross margin growth engines that we have you look at lora, you look at the tri-edge platform, you look at our 10-gig pon our 5g wireless. so those things are really industrial -- broad based industrial protection. so they are really tracking very nicely. if you look at those just by themselves alone, you will definitely make the case for continued gross margin expansion. the one headwind that we have, what i think we have managed it very well so far is all of these supply constraints we have right now and the fact that is driving a whole lot of price increases in terms of wafer pricing and the back end pricing as well. so, so far so good we've been able to manage, but as you probably know there has been a lot of news in that space lately, that there's going to be additional increases in that area. so we just have to see how that plays out, but my expectation and this is a long-winded way of saying this, but my expectation is that we should continue to see some gross margin expansion being driven by this new growth engines that are really beginning to scale for us.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
great. thank you.

our next question comes from the line of karl ackerman with cowen. you may proceed with your question.
karl ackerman -- cowen & company -- analyst
yes, good afternoon gentlemen. two questions for me, please. first, could you discuss your ability to secure additional wafer capacity over the last 90 days and whether that might improve for the october quarter. additionally, what kind of visibility do you have into your bookings pipeline across each line into the second half of fiscal year?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
so, karl, let me start with that first. the visibility is very good. we have very -- obviously very good visibility into q3. that is why the tons number is relatively low for us. we also have pretty good visibility, i think into q4. yeah, bookings are very strong, so customers are giving that -- giving us the visibility into what they need into really throughout the rest of this year, which is good and helpful for us.
on the supply side, as you know we've built inventory over the last couple of years, we made a strategic goal to do that. we knew this was going to happen, and so we're in pretty good shape i would say. but the other thing that we have done over the last couple of years is to build and try and build as much as we can parallel supply chains and mitigate against the one wafer fab or one back end either struggling to pandemic or issues or in this case your question capacity constraints, right. so we've been able to do a pretty good job there. it's not the case in all products, but in most cases, we do have multiple supply chains now. that said, everybody seems to be very tightened supply, so i don't think there's one foundry or one back end partner, it's really everybody in the industry seems to be very tight at the moment. so our job is to just kind of keep working through it and that's why i said we are shipping to consumption, very important point that is that we are shipping to what we believe our customers need and to ensure that they can build their products and that's what our continuing goal will be for the rest of this year is to make sure we ship to consumption, so that they're not building inventory and our channel is not building inventory and it's a healthy pipeline -- operational pipeline.
karl ackerman -- cowen & company -- analyst
yeah. very helpful. for my follow-up, what i was curious what portion of your optical products now address pam4 because it does appear that you continue to win incremental designs for higher transmission rates. and then secondarily, i was curious you could -- i guess as you address that question, i was hoping you might discuss the demand outlook you are seeing from module makers who sell into the recently awarded 700 megahertz and 2.1 gigahertz tenders in china, and perhaps how you would characterize the current spending environment for telecom operators outside of china? thank you.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
again, i'll start with that. the -- we're seeing obviously there is a lot of potential growth here in 5g, china is still the driving force for this year. i think starting to see more growth in other regions, but certainly next year, we expect that to ramp up. and i would say still today is that the rest of the world is catching up a little bit in terms of the service providers and even the oems, but that's -- that globalization, i think is really beneficial for companies like us because we are shipping into all of the module manufacturers and we would like to see a more balanced geographical landscape for 5g in terms of opportunity. so i think that's good.
coming back to the pam4 question. we've invested heavily in our fiberedge and tri-edge pam4 products. i mean both for 5g wireless and for data center as you know. and i think now we are just starting to release those products to production, get design wins and we're starting to see the ramp of those. there is limitations at this point because our products are mostly short reach at least on the tri-edge side of things and we have to develop -- we have to release our longer reach products as i mentioned, but as we do that, i think we'll start to get more penetration of 200 gig and 400 gig pam4 modules and and start to see a little bit more of a balanced approach there in terms of growth in some of those pretty attractive segments. again, the focus of our strategy on the pam4 side is analog side of things. so we are focused very much on lower cost, lower latency, lower power and that's what our strategy is for now and that's what we'll continue to do.
karl ackerman -- cowen & company -- analyst
very helpful, thank you.

our next question comes from the line of scott searle with roth capital. you may proceed with your question.
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. nice quarter. mohan, just real quickly, i wanted to get a clarification on the $850 million lora opportunity pipeline. i just wanted to get a clear definition in terms of how you're defining that again. is it is over the lifetime of the expected design win, is there is a specific time period associated with it once it goes live?
also, i'm not sure if you provided a percentage outside of china on that opportunity pipeline. i recall in the past, i think you've gotten over 50%, just kind of wondering if we're in that same sort of ballpark?
and then as it relates to the applications on the lower front, it sounds like more and more, it's expanding beyond what we're more localized and campus applications into more pam regional opportunities be smart city in other words, so i was wondering if you could comment on kind of the evolution of how that's going from a, i guess a geographic coverage standpoint?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
okay. so there's a lot of questions there. scott, let me see if i could remember. and so the first was the pipeline itself. yes. so, the $850 million covers everything in our pipeline, so it's from concept, through design, through the production stage, to the end of production, so we capture everything. of course, once it's gone into design wins, our confidence level start to increase quite dramatically, that opportunity pipeline is going to lead to revenue. but until it does, we don't really consider it to be revenue, that's why i say 40% typically is converting, obviously once it gets into production, then our confidence level gets very high and and then we monitor the production ramp. so that's the first thing.
and then on the geographical scale. yeah, i think, revenue-wise, about 50% of our business is from china and about the rest is, the rest of the world, europe and north america. important to note that about 35% is consumed in china. so even though we're building in china a lot of that may be shipped outside. but the funnel is interesting because a lot of the opportunity, about 75% i would say is outside of china. and part of that is just the maturity of some of the regions now. north america is starting to really ramp its design-in activity on lora as europe. and as i mentioned, some of the use cases for example in americas, smart home is a very big opportunity in the americas, smart utilities, logistics very big in the americas. in china, smart utilities continues to be very big, a smart city also is a very big opportunity in china and industrial iot. and then in europe, it's utilities logistics and industrial iot. so it's a little bit of a mixed bag across each different region, which is very nice to see actually and these are just some of the segments, i mean, obviously, i'm naming the big ones, but we have a lot of other opportunities, healthcare and agriculture and all those type of things, but these are the big ones. and i think that it really starts to again put a real -- some real clarity behind why we believe lora is going to be extremely successful.
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
great, very helpful. and if i could on the protection front, i think historically it's been more skewed toward smartphones mobile devices. i wonder if you could calibrate us in terms of where that mix is today and where -- when you would expect, non-mobile applications to surpass mobile applications on the protection front. and lastly seasonality, fourth quarter typically seasonally a little bit down, it's been anywhere from, i think 4% to 9% depending on the year, this is certainly an unusual set of circumstances given demand and supply headwinds. so i'm wondering what your early thoughts are as we're starting to look out into that fiscal fourth quarter. thanks.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so, protection business 65% as a consumer, 35% is broader industrial roughly just kind of high level and those broader industrial include pam crude [phonetic] iot, crude [phonetic] automotive. so anything that's non-consumer really. and so, as we see a lot of our investments historically have been in the consumer protection space, we've now kind of switched that and lot of our investments are going into the broader industrial protection space, especially automotive and pam and iot, and so i expect that mix to shift slightly, so probably 45% protection business eventually and maybe 55 consumer, but it's going to take time and one of the reasons why it can take time, we are doing extremely well still in consumer and we're not shying away from that business and we are -- continue to do very well, and some of the trends are going in our favor. so we'll see how it plays out. but, yeah, that's the goal is to try to get a little bit better balance in terms of broader industrial versus consumer.
and then the...
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
seasonality.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
seasonality. yeah, i mean, so the seasonality typically for us in q4 will come down and a lot of that is driven by the consumer business, you guys like samsung will bring down their inventory levels and end of year that tends to be the case in consumer, we'll start to see companies reducing inventory levels and things like that. as you said, this year is going to be different. i think probably because of lead times on supply, so i'm not sure that we're going to see such an aggressive reduction. so we still expect some decline in q4, but i don't know exactly how much.
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
great. thank you.

our next question comes from the line of rick schafer with oppenheimer. you may proceed with your question.
rick schafer -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thanks. i'll add my congrats. so pam4 is picking up nicely, obviously i'm curious, mohan, if you could level set us i think last quarter you talked about tri-edge, i think it was a 24 evaluations and just was curious if you could maybe update us on what that number looks like now, maybe give us some color around what the year in terms of design wins or revenue pipeline might look like for tri-edge in particular. and i don't know, as part of your answer, if you could kind of also level set us on sort of what your expectations are for the analog pam4 market, i mean how big you would expect it to be compared to dsps and and sort of what realistic share assumptions are for you guys given, i mean, you're in such a dominant position in data center today and things like cdr, so it seems like you're kind of getting off on the right foot there. so i'm just curious, i know there are several questions in there, but i'd be curious with you what you think?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so it's early days for us, rick, i would say, we are getting a lot of good design wins, the momentum is good, particularly on the shorter reach, obviously the short reach aoc kind of stuff, it's fairly global as well. we're doing quite well in asia, we're doing quite well in north america and in some of the hyperscale computing kind of related stuff. i think were analog wins and where we have a good chance is where there is latency needs and when cost requirements are low and when the power is important, and those three -- if those are three critical elements of deployment, then we stand a very good chance with the analog pam4 products we have and tri-edge is doing well. fiberedge also which complements dsps also is doing well for us. i think once we get our longer reach platforms out, which is toward the some toward the end of this year, maybe some early next year, i think, we then we'll open up to 200 gig and 400 gig market, it's the whole market, and then we'll really be able to sit down and evaluate what we think our long-term position in this market will be. but for now, i think it's just kind of getting out there and blocking and tackling trying to win as many as we can in the shorter reach use cases, and i'm delighted with the progress, i mean, obviously this is going to be a nice growing business for us, at least for this year and for next year quite rapid growth, we're expecting some good share there. so we'll see how it plays out.
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks a lot. and maybe one for emeka if i could. i mean, as your top line is accelerating to that sort of 1 billion. you've talked about being optimized for thinking in annual revenues. is there any reason as we start looking out. i know you're not guiding to calendar '22 or '23, but any reason to see investment pick up as you guys, let's say need to add more capacity here or should we think sort of for the foreseeable that opex kind of continues to grow sort of roughly half past topline. thanks.
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so, rick, that is our model, has worked out for us very nicely and we've been able to maintain for the most part. so that's what we still expect this to continue to see very nice top line growth from all the growth drivers that we have been talking about. see gross margin expansion and then have operating expenses coming about half the rate of revenue growth. that's how we manage the company and we expect to continue to do that.
rick schafer -- oppenheimer -- analyst
great, thanks for the color.

our next question comes from the line of harsh kumar with piper sandler. you may proceed with your question.
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
yeah. hey, guys. first of all, strong congratulations. very nice quarter. very nice guide. mohan, i had one for you. you had a very impressive something kind of very impressive infrastructure increase. i was curious if 10 gigabit pon is a bigger driver of that increase or is it the data center side. and then, as a part of the data center side, are you able to sell to wiley at this time, we've heard a couple of companies selling optical components there. and maybe just give me an idea of, is your data center business more so u.s. centric or china centric?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
so, let me take that first, harsh. it's mixed. it's actually quite well balanced between americas and asia. asia probably have more design wins and i think momentum is good there. on the pon side, pon is extremely strong at the moment, 10-gig pon, particularly is very, very strong, i would say that's probably the strongest outside lora, the strongest growth area for us. and then, data center is also doing extremely well. and, in the pockets, of course more so in the 200 gig area, pam4 area is growing nicely. but, yeah, i think, across the board, we're very pleased with the infrastructure growth and i think we anticipate that it's going to continue to grow, whether it's on the access side, which will help pon, whether it's on the kind of base station side or it's 5g deployments occur or in the data center side, we would expect that those three areas to continue over the next three to five years to get quite sizable investments around the world just for more bandwidth and we should see the benefit of that.
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
well, i also had a question about wiley. are you able to sell to wiley at this point, where they part of their earnings?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, each one is, actually, wiley is very little revenue for us at this point in time. i think, each product we apply for license and it's hit and miss actually, we don't really understand what, how the decision that we made, but i would say most of the businesses at the moment, we're not shipping a lot into wiley themselves. i think, yeah, that's probably the case right, emeka do you have..,
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. from our last one, so lora you had records all around. i was wondering if you could address the u.s. based activity with large customers. and if you feel like the u.s. revenues have started to kind of mobilize in a meaningful way, are we there at this point or you feel like you still -- we still have to wait for a little bit of momentum in the u.s. market from the revenue standpoint?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
so, in the u.s. there's a lot of activity across the board utilities, logistics, smart home is all going very well. i would say that we haven't yet seen the benefit really all from the activity and i anticipate that really, it's probably going to be first half of next year maybe when we start to see it. we're starting to see some this second half, i think, but i think the real pickup is going to be next year. so yeah, i think it's still lot of activity -- lot of good activity, lots of momentum, for sure you'll see and hear some announcements over the next quarter here of more things that are going on. but in terms of revenue, i think relatively small today.
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks, mohan.

our next question comes from the line of gary mobley with wells fargo. you may proceed with your question.
gary mobley -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
hey guys, let me extend my congratulations on strong results. i had just one multi-part question for you guys, and that relates to supply chain constraints and the price increases. we've all been hearing and reading about coming out of taiwan. i presume correct me if i'm wrong, but i presume that that isn't going to immediately pose a margin pressure for you, given that you were able to grow your inventories and you're maintaining inventories above historical ranges. but when that day comes that you start to face these inflationary pressures from your supply chain, have you communicated to customers, the possibility of raising prices? and can you maybe share with us what the feedback has been from those customers?
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so, gary, yeah, that's a very good question. and i think, i would like to answer it by saying that so far this year we've actually received price increases from some of our foundry partners and back end partners. and i think for the most part, we have been successful in sharing that board with our customers. with regards to some of the new announcements coming out of taiwan, like you mentioned, it is still, it just came out. we've don't expect that to impact our current quarter but the expectation is that we are going to handle it the same way. we're going to try to share some of that with our customers and hopefully we can see the same type of success that we saw before but of course it has to play out
gary mobley -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
emeka for clarification, you said your days of inventory were 129 days, that was up three days sequentially, is that right.
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes.
gary mobley -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
all right, great, thank you guys.
operator
our next question comes from the line of craig ellis with b. riley securities. you may proceed with your question.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for including me and nice job with the quarterly execution. mohan, i wanted to start just by following up on part of the question that was recently asked, and it's about lora. so, it seems like after some of the work that was done to get the lora pipeline in place in u.s. and europe, we had covid and we're coming off of that with continued strong pipeline growth and we're entering a period of acceleration. and i think you mentioned that your expectation is that lora would grow above 41%, or excuse me, above 40% this year. so above that long term cagr. the question is this, if we now have two big geographies, the u.s. and europe that are hitting their stride in uptake acceleration and given that with wireless technologies, that part of the adoption curve can accelerate on a multi-year basis. what are the gives and takes with lora actually performing above the 40% cagr when we look out to next year calendar '22 or fiscal '23?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think that's a good question craig. if you go back to the past certainly over the last five years, i've always been saying that i expect this business to double every year for a long time. and obviously in the last couple of years, it didn't grow that well for pandemic reasons and the china related issues and whatever. so i'm a little bit more cautious about how i project the growth. but what i would say is that when you look at the market, the lp wan market, a lot of the lp wan drivers are things like climate change, environment efficiencies, utility management, things like that, which, around the wall, you just see it every day that there's a need for it and that's what's transpiring in my view is that it's going from being a nice to have, to a real need. and that need is, i think, is going to drive a faster adoption of some of the lp wan technologies. and i think lora is the best and the most capable technology and so that's what i think is going to drive the growth.
in addition to that, if we look at new segments, like the smart home segments, we talk about sidewalk and amazon, we don't even consider that to be lp wan, we consider that to just be low power wireless market. we're seeing in the lora is starting to find its way into other low power wireless segments. and so, i do think the growth can be greater, but i think we will stick with the 40% cagr as our goal and make sure we execute on that, right?
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
yeah. that makes a kind of sense. and then emeka, i just wanted to clarify that i was hearing you correctly in terms of how you're characterizing the impact of the various supply chain issues that are out there. and admittedly, i missed the prepared script part of the call, but i think what i gathered was that you were conveying that there is an impact to gross margin in the business, even though you do have some success ensuring some of the price increases that are starting upstream from you, with your customers. but i thought i heard you say that there wasn't a revenue impact in either the quarter or the outlook, is that correct? and if not, please set me straight. thank you.
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
okay. so what i was saying was that we have actually had price increases so far this year, right? and that we have been able for the most part, have been able to pass that onto our customers. we've been able to share that to boarding with them. and so the answer that i was giving was saying that, as we go forward with some of the new news, but in new news that is out there, especially out of taiwan, that they are going to increase their wafer prices. that our expectation will be that we should see the same kind of success that we saw in the past with i guess to how we share that burden with our customers. obviously we have to see how it plays out, right. but we're very hopeful that that is something that should not significantly impact our gross margin expectations.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
one of the things to remember craig is that when you look at a lot of our growth as emeka pointed out, it's coming from new platforms that really drive -- are driving higher asp's for us, you know, the 10 gig pon is an example of that. the data center products, the tri edge and 5g wireless, iot that was a lora related products and protection broader protection products. so as we see the supply chain increases, part of our goal is to make sure that we are pricing appropriately, right? so because we have new products coming out at the same time, i think that's an opportunity for us to take advantage of that.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
yeah. certainly the new -- the strong new product cadence is something you can leverage in this environment. i appreciate the input guys. thank you very much and good luck.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of tore sandberg with stifel. you may proceed with your question.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
yes. thank you. i just had a follow-up on lora and on one of the metrics. the one metric that really caught my attention was the gateways it's gone up quite dramatically the last two quarters. mohan is that simply because lora is becoming more and more of a consumer technology?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
i would say it's a little bit of both tore. i would say that it's not so much consumer, but we are getting some smart home deployments and of course, if you think about echos in the home, or if you think about the helium gateways, which are really smart home type of initiatives that drives a high volume of gateways. but yeah, you're right, even for us, it's a surprise to see quite aggressive growth there. we had as you mentioned the target for the year was 2 million gateways, and we're already at 2.2 million gateways. so we've raised that to 2.9 million. but, to me, the beauty about the gateway deployments is really just drives the capacity to support billions of sensors and that to me is the key. so if you have infrastructure out there, then it's just a question of time for the census and the used cases to catch up. there's a couple of bottlenecks still. software, there's a bottleneck, and i think census is a bottleneck in some cases, but as those bottlenecks get removed, then there's no reason to question the growth in the opportunity there.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
very helpful. thank you.

at this time, there are no more questions, i'd like to pass the call back over to management for any closing remarks.

in closing, we are pleased with the strong first half results as we saw increased adoption of our growth engines in the infrastructure, smarter planet and mobility markets that should provide sustainable long-term growth. we have been successfully navigating the challenging supply chain environment and expanding on our sustainability efforts, including our commitment to human capital development. given our diverse and growing product offering, balanced markets and strong customer relationships, we expect to deliver a stronger second half and record financial performance in fy'22. with that, we appreciate your continued support of semtech and i look forward to updating you on next quarter. thank you. operator?

operator
greetings. welcome to the semtech corporation quarter 2 fiscal year 2022 earnings call. [operator instructions]. please note that this conference is being recorded. i will now turn the conference over to your host, sandy harrison. you may begin.
sandy harrison -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, john and welcome to semtech's conference call to discuss our second quarter of fiscal year '22 results. speakers for today's call will be mohan maheswaran, semtech's president and chief executive officer and emeka chukwu, our chief financial officer. a press release announcing our unaudited results was issued after the market close today and is available on our website at semtech.com.
today's call will include forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in these statements. for a more detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please review the safe harbor statement that is included in today's press release and in the other risk factors section of our most recent periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission.
as a reminder, comments made on today's call are current as of today only and semtech undertakes no obligation to update the information from the call should facts or circumstances change. all references made to financial results in mohan's and emeka's prepared remarks during this call will refer to non-gaap financial measures, unless otherwise noted.
a discussion of why the management team considers such non-gaap financial measures useful along with detailed reconciliations of such non-gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measures are also included in today's press release. i want to also highlight semtech will be hosting its first ever tech topic webinar that is scheduled for wednesday, october 6th, where we will focus on our lora platform. more details on the event, including the agenda and sign of information will be coming soon.
with that, i'll turn the call over to semtech's chief financial officer, emeka chukwu. emeka?
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, sandy. good afternoon, everyone. as is our practice, i'll be focusing my comments on our non-gaap financial results unless otherwise noted. for q2 fiscal year '22, the net sales grew 9% sequentially and 29% year-over-year to $185 million, which was above the midpoint of our guidance and represented a new quarterly record led by the secular momentum that contributed to new records achieved by several of our growth -- of our key growth platforms. in q2, shipments into asia represented 81% of net sales, north america represented 11% and europe represented 8%. while these represent the ship to addresses for our distributors and oems, we estimate that approximately 35% of our shipments are consumed in china, 27% in the americas and the balance over the rest of the world. total direct sales represented approximately 13% of net sales and sales to distribution represented approximately 87%.
and our pos was another quarterly record. our distribution business remains balanced with approximately 39% of the total pos coming from the infrastructure end market, 31% from the industrial end market and 30% from the high-end consumer end market. q2. bookings remained strong and increased 75% year-over-year and resulted in a book-to-bill well above one. pos bookings accounted for approximately 3% of shipments during the quarter. q2 gross margin increased 70 basis points sequentially to 62.7%, which was at the upper end of our guidance range due to a more favorable product mix. our gross margin is benefiting from a higher mix of sales from our growth platforms, including lora enabled data center tri-edge pam4 cdr, 10-gig pon, 5g wireless and broad-based industrial protection.
for q3, we expect gross margin in the range of 62.8% to 63.8%, as we anticipate greater contribution from these growth drivers. q2 operating expense increased 3% to $65.9 million, driven by higher variable compensation expenses, slightly offset by lower new product development expenses. for the rest of fiscal year '22, we expect our operating expense to be in line to slightly above current levels. in q2, we were again pleased to see our operating profit on a sequential and year-over-year business grow much faster than sales, due to the gross margin expansion and stable operating expenses. this drove a 270 basis points sequential expansion of our operating margin to 27.1%. we expect continued operating leverage as we make progress toward our 32% to 36% long-term target model. in q2, cash flow from operations increased 63% sequentially, to a record $53 million or 29% of net sales, while free cash flow increased 71% sequentially to 25% of net sales, achieving the lower end of our long-term free cash flow target range of 25% to 30% of net sales.
in q2, we repurchased approximately 1% of our outstanding stock for $42 million, resulting in $322 million remaining in our outstanding authorization. we expect to continue to use our cash to opportunistically repurchase our shares, make strategic investments and pay down debt. accounts receivable in q2 increased 10% from q1, while days of sales decreased 3 days from q1 to 34 days, and remains below our target range of 40 to 45 days. in q2, net inventory in absolute dollar terms increased 10% sequentially and days of inventory increased by 3 days to 129 days at the end of q2. we expect our net inventory to remain above our target range of 90 days to 100 days to support the stronger demand and the tighter supply chain environment. in summary, we are pleased with the strong first half momentum we are seeing from our higher margin growth engines, which we expect to continue in the second half. we believe the sustainable secular drivers behind our growth engines are expanding gross margins, stable operating expenses and strong cash flow generation have positioned us well to deliver a record financial performance in fiscal year '22 and beyond.
i will now hand the call over to mohan.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
thank you. emeka. good afternoon, everyone. i will discuss our q2 fiscal year '22 performance by end market, and by product group, and then provide our outlook for q3 of fiscal year '22.
in q2, net revenue increased 9% sequentially and 29% over the prior year to a record $185 million. high demand across all three of our end markets contributed to the q2 growth. we posted non-gaap gross margin of 62.7% and record non-gaap earnings per share of $0.65. in q2, net revenue from the infrastructure market increased 10% sequentially and represented 37% of total net revenues. industrial market net revenue increased 5% sequentially and represented 31% of total net revenues. the high-end consumer market net revenues increased 10% sequentially and represented 32% of total net revenues. approximately 21% of consumer net revenue was attributable to mobile devices and approximately 11% was attributable to other consumer systems.
i will now discuss the performance of each of our product groups. in q2 of fiscal year '22, our signal integrity product group grew 10% sequentially and represented 39% of total revenues. strength from the data center and pon markets drove the growth in our sip business. in q2, revenue from the data center market grew sequentially, led by record revenues from our pam4 platforms. strong design win momentum in 100 gig, 200 gig and 400 gig pam4 optical modules is expected to contribute to a strong second half for our data center business. we are very pleased with the progress of our tri-edge short reach platforms and we expect to introduce our new longer reach tri-edge platforms over the next 12 months, that we believe will open up the full 200 gig and 400 gig pam4 data center market to us.
we remain confident in our strategy and as we execute on delivering our tri edge and fiberedge platform that deliver lower power, lower cost and low latency, we should see continued growth in our data center business in fy '22 and beyond. in q2 of fy '22, revenue from our pon products grew sequentially and achieved a new revenue record. demand for our 10 gig pon products remained very strong and achieved another record and now represents the largest revenue segment within our pon business. semtech provides the most comprehensive pon pmd portfolio available in the market today and we expect our pon business to continue to benefit from the global demand for higher bandwidth access solutions. we expect our pon business to remain strong over the next few years as global service providers accelerate their deployments of broadband access equipment.
in q2 of fiscal year '22, 5g demand slowed as expected following the prior quarter's record results. however, with several china tenders recently announced and carriers in north america and europe, expected to begin 5g build-outs, over the next 12 months. we expect to see demand for our 5g platforms pick-up during the second half of this year. we continue to see design wins for both our 25 gig clearedge and 50 gig pam4 tri edge platforms in 5g fronthaul optical modules and we believe we are well positioned to benefit from next generation wireless network deployments. as users demand greater bandwidth, we expect the infrastructure segment to continue to grow and expect this to result in sustainable long-term growth for our signal integrity product group. in q3 of fiscal year '22, we expect revenue from our signal integrity product group to increase and achieve another record driven by growth from all the infrastructure segments.
moving on to our protection product group. in q2 of fiscal year '22, net revenues from our protection product group increased 9% sequentially and increased 49% year-over-year and represented 27% of total revenues. in q2, protection revenue from our consumer customers rebounded nicely over the prior quarter, led by growth at our north american and korean customers as their supply constraints improved. demand also increased across the broad based industrial markets led by stronger demand from north american and european automotive and industrial customers. many of today's automotive, iot and communication systems use advanced lithography chips that require higher performance protection. our latest protection platforms deliver technology that prevents damage to these highly sensitive chips. in addition, as part of the industry's ongoing push on esg, we are seeing an increased focus on the reduction of electronic wastage, which we believe will further accelerate the adoption of semtech protection products. we expect both these trends to continue to drive further adoption of semtech's protection platforms across all market segments and enable us to deliver double-digit growth with increasing gross margins over the next several years.
in q3 of fiscal year '22, we expect our protection revenues to increase again nicely led by continued strength from the broad based industrial markets.
turning to our wireless and sensing product group. in q2, revenues from our wireless and sensing product group increased 7% sequentially and 61% over the prior year and achieved another quarterly record and represented 34% of total revenues. in q2, our lora enabled platforms delivered another quarterly revenue record driven by the smart utility, smart city and industrial iot segments. the momentum from our lora platforms has really started to accelerate globally and we expect to see continued growth this year in line with our long-term 40% cagr forecast. we are also seeing a tremendous number of new lora based use cases globally that support future growth. recently announced initiatives include ldt, a south korean smart sensor network provider integrated lora into its smart fire prevention system that provides real-time analytics sensing connectivity and geolocation to protect commercial facilities, such as shopping malls and local markets. swiss post have deployed smart connected pens that leverage its nationwide lorawan network to help digitally transform the swiss postal service. offset, an iot solutions expert is collaborating with semtech to support a number of new smart utility iot initiatives targeted at the oil gas and communications industries.
and skylab, a supplier of wireless sensors and gps tracking and measuring systems will be using our lora edge platform to develop a solution for indoor and outdoor asset management of vehicles, vessels and containers. this is one of many asset tracking design wins based on our lora edge platform that are expected to convert to revenue in the next 12 to 18 months. these are just a few of the new use cases that highlight the flexibility, scalability and momentum of lora that is enabling a smarter, more connected and sustainable planet. in q2, our lora business metrics progressed very well against our fy '22 targets. the number of lora land network operators, grew to 156 and we are expecting 165 lora network operators by the end of fy '22. the cumulative number of lora end nodes deployed increased to 208 million and we expect this number to exceed 236 million cumulative end-nodes by the end of fy '22.
the number of lora gateways deployed increased to over 2.2 million and has already exceeded the goal we set for the full year. as a result, we are increasing our gateway target for the year to 2.5 5 million. the lora opportunity pipeline increased nicely in the quarter and now stands at over $850 million, which also exceeded the target we had set for the whole year. as a result, we are increasing our opportunity pipeline target for the end of the year to $900 million. we anticipate that approximately 40% of the opportunities, currently in the pipeline will convert to deployments over a 24-month timeline. our metrics demonstrate the growing adoption and deployment of lora with a long-range, low power and low cost of lora is being leveraged. we believe that this momentum in our metrics along with the increasing influence and efforts of the lora alliance, we will continue to enable lora to become the de facto standard for the fast emerging lpwan market.
in q2, our proximity sensing platforms achieved another quarterly record led by strength at our smartphone customers. semtech's proximity sensing platforms provide the industry's most advanced and highly integrated proximity sensing technology for mobile and wearable devices. the growing adoption of 5g phones and the use of high-powered radios is contributing to an increasing number of social health concerns, resulting in more stringent rf power regulations globally. this trend is expected to result in increasing demand for our proximity sensing platforms over the next few years. for q3 of fiscal year '22, we expect net revenues from our wireless and sensing product group to increase and deliver another record quarter led by another record from our lora business.
moving on to new products and design wins, in q2 of fiscal year '22, we released 11 new products and achieved 3,090 new design wins, which represented a 16% increase over the previous year.
now let me discuss our outlook for the 3rd quarter of fy '22. following very strong bookings in q2 that increased 75% over the previous year and record pos. we entered q3 with record backlog. we are currently estimating q3 net revenues to be between $188 million and $198 million. to attain the midpoint of our guidance range or approximately $193 million, we need a net term orders of approximately 5% at the beginning of q3. we expect our q3 non-gaap earnings to be between $0.68 and $0.76 per diluted share.
i will now hand the call back to the operator and sandy, emeka and i will be happy to answer any questions. operator?

operator
thank you. at this time, we would like to begin a question and answer session. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of tore sandberg with stifel. you may proceed with your question.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
yes, thank you and congratulations on the record results. mohan, i think you mentioned that lora is now basically on track growing at the sort of 40% forecast. does that mean this year is also now tracking for lora to be up 40%?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
it is, it's tracking, i would say, it's tracking ahead of that actually. so, that's our expectation to be at least 40%, yeah.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
very good. and as a follow-up, but just to clarify, when you talk about protection business, you expect it to be at the double-digit growth business going forward. was that, specifically for the non-consumer part or was that for the entire category?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
for the entire category. i think, consumer obviously grow faster, but it can also come down faster, it's little bit more volatile. our broader industrial protection is more stable growth i would say, it's not going to -- you're not going to see the very high and a very drop it just more, just kind of whatever the industry is growing at plus x% and i think one of the things about this business is that we are really just starting to play in the broader industrial protection business, so we have a lot of the ability to increase penetration there i think is much better for us for some of those trends i mentioned go in our favor. so, as a total, we think, we can grow double-digits nicely. the other thing to remember in this business is that the broader industrial protection business is much higher gross margin typically than the consumer protection, so that will definitely be a positive for us.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
very good, thank you very much. congrats again, i'll go back in line.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of tristan gerra with baird. you may proceed with your question.
tristan gerra -- r.w baird -- analyst
yeah. congrats. about the 40% of the 900 million pipeline in lora that you expect to deploy over the next 24 months. can you remind us of the average duration of those design wins?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
so the opportunity funnel, tristan covers several years of design opportunity, some of those will move faster and can return to revenue in 12 months. others may take 36 to 48 months depending on what it is, if it's a meter relative to maybe a smart home applications as an example. so, on average we would say 40% of that total opportunity pipeline will convert over the next couple of years, maybe the way to think about is probably two to three year timeline, 40% of those opportunity -- opportunities will convert to design wins in revenue.
tristan gerra -- r.w baird -- analyst
okay. and then as a quick follow-up, if you could reconcile, obviously you have very strong visibility, very low net turns to meet your quarter guidance, but you also raising inventories internally, how much are you suffering from supply constraints right now and when would you expect a catch-up shipments relative to the real level of demand that you're seeing?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
well, we are shipping nicely to consumption, which is what we believe is the right thing to do. so we don't believe any of our customers and customers are short, there are pockets of supply constraints from -- in certain businesses that are doing extremely well, but in general, we think we're quite comfortable, we've built a good amount of inventory with anticipated demand strength and that's what we're doing. so, i think we're good for this year to support the consumption that we believe is required. as we go into next year, we're going to have to take a close look at it, but we continue to believe the right thing to do is to build our own internal inventory and make sure that we are shipping to consumption levels.
tristan gerra -- r.w baird -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of quinn bolton with needham and co. you may proceed with your question.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
hey, guys, firstly echo my congratulations as well. mohan, wanted to start with the lora opportunity pipeline, which is expanding nicely. can you talk about is -- are you seeing a broadening out in that business in pipeline or are there a couple of specific smart city, smart home applications that are really starting to drive a lot of the growth in the pipeline?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
it's -- so, i would say it's very broad, quinn, and it's also regionally quite well balanced, which is important. so i would say in the americas, it's smart home driven, smart utilities and logistics; in china, it's smart utilities, smart city and industrial iot; and in europe, it's smart utilities, logistics and industrial iot. so it's different segments driving most of the opportunities, not a surprise that those segments are the ones that are driving the business, because that's where lora fits very well into those categories. and so that is what we expect and that's what we're seeing, so not really a surprise. i think over the last couple of years, as you know, with the pandemic and some of the china trade issues, the opportunity funnel hasn't increased the way we would have liked it we've done, but we're starting to see that now. and that's really a positive thing because that really will drive the future growth.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
great [indecipherable] nice job on the gross margin expansion and particularly, so on the guide. and i guess just looking forward, it sounds like a lot of the growth are coming from the higher margin products. and so i guess it just begs the question, if you think you can be 62.8 to 63.8 in the october quarter, where do you think margins could go over the next one to two years. do you think you could see 64 to 65, what's the upper limit, we should be thinking about?
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so, when we look at our gross margin story, it is actually very pleasing to see it's playing out of the way we had expected, right. we've always talked about these high gross margin growth engines that we have you look at lora, you look at the tri-edge platform, you look at our 10-gig pon our 5g wireless. so those things are really industrial -- broad based industrial protection. so they are really tracking very nicely. if you look at those just by themselves alone, you will definitely make the case for continued gross margin expansion. the one headwind that we have, what i think we have managed it very well so far is all of these supply constraints we have right now and the fact that is driving a whole lot of price increases in terms of wafer pricing and the back end pricing as well. so, so far so good we've been able to manage, but as you probably know there has been a lot of news in that space lately, that there's going to be additional increases in that area. so we just have to see how that plays out, but my expectation and this is a long-winded way of saying this, but my expectation is that we should continue to see some gross margin expansion being driven by this new growth engines that are really beginning to scale for us.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of karl ackerman with cowen. you may proceed with your question.
karl ackerman -- cowen & company -- analyst
yes, good afternoon gentlemen. two questions for me, please. first, could you discuss your ability to secure additional wafer capacity over the last 90 days and whether that might improve for the october quarter. additionally, what kind of visibility do you have into your bookings pipeline across each line into the second half of fiscal year?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
so, karl, let me start with that first. the visibility is very good. we have very -- obviously very good visibility into q3. that is why the tons number is relatively low for us. we also have pretty good visibility, i think into q4. yeah, bookings are very strong, so customers are giving that -- giving us the visibility into what they need into really throughout the rest of this year, which is good and helpful for us.
on the supply side, as you know we've built inventory over the last couple of years, we made a strategic goal to do that. we knew this was going to happen, and so we're in pretty good shape i would say. but the other thing that we have done over the last couple of years is to build and try and build as much as we can parallel supply chains and mitigate against the one wafer fab or one back end either struggling to pandemic or issues or in this case your question capacity constraints, right. so we've been able to do a pretty good job there. it's not the case in all products, but in most cases, we do have multiple supply chains now. that said, everybody seems to be very tightened supply, so i don't think there's one foundry or one back end partner, it's really everybody in the industry seems to be very tight at the moment. so our job is to just kind of keep working through it and that's why i said we are shipping to consumption, very important point that is that we are shipping to what we believe our customers need and to ensure that they can build their products and that's what our continuing goal will be for the rest of this year is to make sure we ship to consumption, so that they're not building inventory and our channel is not building inventory and it's a healthy pipeline -- operational pipeline.
karl ackerman -- cowen & company -- analyst
yeah. very helpful. for my follow-up, what i was curious what portion of your optical products now address pam4 because it does appear that you continue to win incremental designs for higher transmission rates. and then secondarily, i was curious you could -- i guess as you address that question, i was hoping you might discuss the demand outlook you are seeing from module makers who sell into the recently awarded 700 megahertz and 2.1 gigahertz tenders in china, and perhaps how you would characterize the current spending environment for telecom operators outside of china? thank you.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
again, i'll start with that. the -- we're seeing obviously there is a lot of potential growth here in 5g, china is still the driving force for this year. i think starting to see more growth in other regions, but certainly next year, we expect that to ramp up. and i would say still today is that the rest of the world is catching up a little bit in terms of the service providers and even the oems, but that's -- that globalization, i think is really beneficial for companies like us because we are shipping into all of the module manufacturers and we would like to see a more balanced geographical landscape for 5g in terms of opportunity. so i think that's good.
coming back to the pam4 question. we've invested heavily in our fiberedge and tri-edge pam4 products. i mean both for 5g wireless and for data center as you know. and i think now we are just starting to release those products to production, get design wins and we're starting to see the ramp of those. there is limitations at this point because our products are mostly short reach at least on the tri-edge side of things and we have to develop -- we have to release our longer reach products as i mentioned, but as we do that, i think we'll start to get more penetration of 200 gig and 400 gig pam4 modules and and start to see a little bit more of a balanced approach there in terms of growth in some of those pretty attractive segments. again, the focus of our strategy on the pam4 side is analog side of things. so we are focused very much on lower cost, lower latency, lower power and that's what our strategy is for now and that's what we'll continue to do.
karl ackerman -- cowen & company -- analyst
very helpful, thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of scott searle with roth capital. you may proceed with your question.
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. nice quarter. mohan, just real quickly, i wanted to get a clarification on the $850 million lora opportunity pipeline. i just wanted to get a clear definition in terms of how you're defining that again. is it is over the lifetime of the expected design win, is there is a specific time period associated with it once it goes live?
also, i'm not sure if you provided a percentage outside of china on that opportunity pipeline. i recall in the past, i think you've gotten over 50%, just kind of wondering if we're in that same sort of ballpark?
and then as it relates to the applications on the lower front, it sounds like more and more, it's expanding beyond what we're more localized and campus applications into more pam regional opportunities be smart city in other words, so i was wondering if you could comment on kind of the evolution of how that's going from a, i guess a geographic coverage standpoint?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
okay. so there's a lot of questions there. scott, let me see if i could remember. and so the first was the pipeline itself. yes. so, the $850 million covers everything in our pipeline, so it's from concept, through design, through the production stage, to the end of production, so we capture everything. of course, once it's gone into design wins, our confidence level start to increase quite dramatically, that opportunity pipeline is going to lead to revenue. but until it does, we don't really consider it to be revenue, that's why i say 40% typically is converting, obviously once it gets into production, then our confidence level gets very high and and then we monitor the production ramp. so that's the first thing.
and then on the geographical scale. yeah, i think, revenue-wise, about 50% of our business is from china and about the rest is, the rest of the world, europe and north america. important to note that about 35% is consumed in china. so even though we're building in china a lot of that may be shipped outside. but the funnel is interesting because a lot of the opportunity, about 75% i would say is outside of china. and part of that is just the maturity of some of the regions now. north america is starting to really ramp its design-in activity on lora as europe. and as i mentioned, some of the use cases for example in americas, smart home is a very big opportunity in the americas, smart utilities, logistics very big in the americas. in china, smart utilities continues to be very big, a smart city also is a very big opportunity in china and industrial iot. and then in europe, it's utilities logistics and industrial iot. so it's a little bit of a mixed bag across each different region, which is very nice to see actually and these are just some of the segments, i mean, obviously, i'm naming the big ones, but we have a lot of other opportunities, healthcare and agriculture and all those type of things, but these are the big ones. and i think that it really starts to again put a real -- some real clarity behind why we believe lora is going to be extremely successful.
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
great, very helpful. and if i could on the protection front, i think historically it's been more skewed toward smartphones mobile devices. i wonder if you could calibrate us in terms of where that mix is today and where -- when you would expect, non-mobile applications to surpass mobile applications on the protection front. and lastly seasonality, fourth quarter typically seasonally a little bit down, it's been anywhere from, i think 4% to 9% depending on the year, this is certainly an unusual set of circumstances given demand and supply headwinds. so i'm wondering what your early thoughts are as we're starting to look out into that fiscal fourth quarter. thanks.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so, protection business 65% as a consumer, 35% is broader industrial roughly just kind of high level and those broader industrial include pam crude [phonetic] iot, crude [phonetic] automotive. so anything that's non-consumer really. and so, as we see a lot of our investments historically have been in the consumer protection space, we've now kind of switched that and lot of our investments are going into the broader industrial protection space, especially automotive and pam and iot, and so i expect that mix to shift slightly, so probably 45% protection business eventually and maybe 55 consumer, but it's going to take time and one of the reasons why it can take time, we are doing extremely well still in consumer and we're not shying away from that business and we are -- continue to do very well, and some of the trends are going in our favor. so we'll see how it plays out. but, yeah, that's the goal is to try to get a little bit better balance in terms of broader industrial versus consumer.
and then the...
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
seasonality.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
seasonality. yeah, i mean, so the seasonality typically for us in q4 will come down and a lot of that is driven by the consumer business, you guys like samsung will bring down their inventory levels and end of year that tends to be the case in consumer, we'll start to see companies reducing inventory levels and things like that. as you said, this year is going to be different. i think probably because of lead times on supply, so i'm not sure that we're going to see such an aggressive reduction. so we still expect some decline in q4, but i don't know exactly how much.
scott searle -- roth capital -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of rick schafer with oppenheimer. you may proceed with your question.
rick schafer -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thanks. i'll add my congrats. so pam4 is picking up nicely, obviously i'm curious, mohan, if you could level set us i think last quarter you talked about tri-edge, i think it was a 24 evaluations and just was curious if you could maybe update us on what that number looks like now, maybe give us some color around what the year in terms of design wins or revenue pipeline might look like for tri-edge in particular. and i don't know, as part of your answer, if you could kind of also level set us on sort of what your expectations are for the analog pam4 market, i mean how big you would expect it to be compared to dsps and and sort of what realistic share assumptions are for you guys given, i mean, you're in such a dominant position in data center today and things like cdr, so it seems like you're kind of getting off on the right foot there. so i'm just curious, i know there are several questions in there, but i'd be curious with you what you think?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so it's early days for us, rick, i would say, we are getting a lot of good design wins, the momentum is good, particularly on the shorter reach, obviously the short reach aoc kind of stuff, it's fairly global as well. we're doing quite well in asia, we're doing quite well in north america and in some of the hyperscale computing kind of related stuff. i think were analog wins and where we have a good chance is where there is latency needs and when cost requirements are low and when the power is important, and those three -- if those are three critical elements of deployment, then we stand a very good chance with the analog pam4 products we have and tri-edge is doing well. fiberedge also which complements dsps also is doing well for us. i think once we get our longer reach platforms out, which is toward the some toward the end of this year, maybe some early next year, i think, we then we'll open up to 200 gig and 400 gig market, it's the whole market, and then we'll really be able to sit down and evaluate what we think our long-term position in this market will be. but for now, i think it's just kind of getting out there and blocking and tackling trying to win as many as we can in the shorter reach use cases, and i'm delighted with the progress, i mean, obviously this is going to be a nice growing business for us, at least for this year and for next year quite rapid growth, we're expecting some good share there. so we'll see how it plays out.
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks a lot. and maybe one for emeka if i could. i mean, as your top line is accelerating to that sort of 1 billion. you've talked about being optimized for thinking in annual revenues. is there any reason as we start looking out. i know you're not guiding to calendar '22 or '23, but any reason to see investment pick up as you guys, let's say need to add more capacity here or should we think sort of for the foreseeable that opex kind of continues to grow sort of roughly half past topline. thanks.
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so, rick, that is our model, has worked out for us very nicely and we've been able to maintain for the most part. so that's what we still expect this to continue to see very nice top line growth from all the growth drivers that we have been talking about. see gross margin expansion and then have operating expenses coming about half the rate of revenue growth. that's how we manage the company and we expect to continue to do that.
rick schafer -- oppenheimer -- analyst

yeah. hey, guys. first of all, strong congratulations. very nice quarter. very nice guide. mohan, i had one for you. you had a very impressive something kind of very impressive infrastructure increase. i was curious if 10 gigabit pon is a bigger driver of that increase or is it the data center side. and then, as a part of the data center side, are you able to sell to wiley at this time, we've heard a couple of companies selling optical components there. and maybe just give me an idea of, is your data center business more so u.s. centric or china centric?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
so, let me take that first, harsh. it's mixed. it's actually quite well balanced between americas and asia. asia probably have more design wins and i think momentum is good there. on the pon side, pon is extremely strong at the moment, 10-gig pon, particularly is very, very strong, i would say that's probably the strongest outside lora, the strongest growth area for us. and then, data center is also doing extremely well. and, in the pockets, of course more so in the 200 gig area, pam4 area is growing nicely. but, yeah, i think, across the board, we're very pleased with the infrastructure growth and i think we anticipate that it's going to continue to grow, whether it's on the access side, which will help pon, whether it's on the kind of base station side or it's 5g deployments occur or in the data center side, we would expect that those three areas to continue over the next three to five years to get quite sizable investments around the world just for more bandwidth and we should see the benefit of that.
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
well, i also had a question about wiley. are you able to sell to wiley at this point, where they part of their earnings?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, each one is, actually, wiley is very little revenue for us at this point in time. i think, each product we apply for license and it's hit and miss actually, we don't really understand what, how the decision that we made, but i would say most of the businesses at the moment, we're not shipping a lot into wiley themselves. i think, yeah, that's probably the case right, emeka do you have..,
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. from our last one, so lora you had records all around. i was wondering if you could address the u.s. based activity with large customers. and if you feel like the u.s. revenues have started to kind of mobilize in a meaningful way, are we there at this point or you feel like you still -- we still have to wait for a little bit of momentum in the u.s. market from the revenue standpoint?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
so, in the u.s. there's a lot of activity across the board utilities, logistics, smart home is all going very well. i would say that we haven't yet seen the benefit really all from the activity and i anticipate that really, it's probably going to be first half of next year maybe when we start to see it. we're starting to see some this second half, i think, but i think the real pickup is going to be next year. so yeah, i think it's still lot of activity -- lot of good activity, lots of momentum, for sure you'll see and hear some announcements over the next quarter here of more things that are going on. but in terms of revenue, i think relatively small today.
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks, mohan.

our next question comes from the line of gary mobley with wells fargo. you may proceed with your question.
gary mobley -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
hey guys, let me extend my congratulations on strong results. i had just one multi-part question for you guys, and that relates to supply chain constraints and the price increases. we've all been hearing and reading about coming out of taiwan. i presume correct me if i'm wrong, but i presume that that isn't going to immediately pose a margin pressure for you, given that you were able to grow your inventories and you're maintaining inventories above historical ranges. but when that day comes that you start to face these inflationary pressures from your supply chain, have you communicated to customers, the possibility of raising prices? and can you maybe share with us what the feedback has been from those customers?
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so, gary, yeah, that's a very good question. and i think, i would like to answer it by saying that so far this year we've actually received price increases from some of our foundry partners and back end partners. and i think for the most part, we have been successful in sharing that board with our customers. with regards to some of the new announcements coming out of taiwan, like you mentioned, it is still, it just came out. we've don't expect that to impact our current quarter but the expectation is that we are going to handle it the same way. we're going to try to share some of that with our customers and hopefully we can see the same type of success that we saw before but of course it has to play out
gary mobley -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
emeka for clarification, you said your days of inventory were 129 days, that was up three days sequentially, is that right.
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes.
gary mobley -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
all right, great, thank you guys.
operator
our next question comes from the line of craig ellis with b. riley securities. you may proceed with your question.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for including me and nice job with the quarterly execution. mohan, i wanted to start just by following up on part of the question that was recently asked, and it's about lora. so, it seems like after some of the work that was done to get the lora pipeline in place in u.s. and europe, we had covid and we're coming off of that with continued strong pipeline growth and we're entering a period of acceleration. and i think you mentioned that your expectation is that lora would grow above 41%, or excuse me, above 40% this year. so above that long term cagr. the question is this, if we now have two big geographies, the u.s. and europe that are hitting their stride in uptake acceleration and given that with wireless technologies, that part of the adoption curve can accelerate on a multi-year basis. what are the gives and takes with lora actually performing above the 40% cagr when we look out to next year calendar '22 or fiscal '23?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think that's a good question craig. if you go back to the past certainly over the last five years, i've always been saying that i expect this business to double every year for a long time. and obviously in the last couple of years, it didn't grow that well for pandemic reasons and the china related issues and whatever. so i'm a little bit more cautious about how i project the growth. but what i would say is that when you look at the market, the lp wan market, a lot of the lp wan drivers are things like climate change, environment efficiencies, utility management, things like that, which, around the wall, you just see it every day that there's a need for it and that's what's transpiring in my view is that it's going from being a nice to have, to a real need. and that need is, i think, is going to drive a faster adoption of some of the lp wan technologies. and i think lora is the best and the most capable technology and so that's what i think is going to drive the growth.
in addition to that, if we look at new segments, like the smart home segments, we talk about sidewalk and amazon, we don't even consider that to be lp wan, we consider that to just be low power wireless market. we're seeing in the lora is starting to find its way into other low power wireless segments. and so, i do think the growth can be greater, but i think we will stick with the 40% cagr as our goal and make sure we execute on that, right?
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
yeah. that makes a kind of sense. and then emeka, i just wanted to clarify that i was hearing you correctly in terms of how you're characterizing the impact of the various supply chain issues that are out there. and admittedly, i missed the prepared script part of the call, but i think what i gathered was that you were conveying that there is an impact to gross margin in the business, even though you do have some success ensuring some of the price increases that are starting upstream from you, with your customers. but i thought i heard you say that there wasn't a revenue impact in either the quarter or the outlook, is that correct? and if not, please set me straight. thank you.
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
okay. so what i was saying was that we have actually had price increases so far this year, right? and that we have been able for the most part, have been able to pass that onto our customers. we've been able to share that to boarding with them. and so the answer that i was giving was saying that, as we go forward with some of the new news, but in new news that is out there, especially out of taiwan, that they are going to increase their wafer prices. that our expectation will be that we should see the same kind of success that we saw in the past with i guess to how we share that burden with our customers. obviously we have to see how it plays out, right. but we're very hopeful that that is something that should not significantly impact our gross margin expectations.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
one of the things to remember craig is that when you look at a lot of our growth as emeka pointed out, it's coming from new platforms that really drive -- are driving higher asp's for us, you know, the 10 gig pon is an example of that. the data center products, the tri edge and 5g wireless, iot that was a lora related products and protection broader protection products. so as we see the supply chain increases, part of our goal is to make sure that we are pricing appropriately, right? so because we have new products coming out at the same time, i think that's an opportunity for us to take advantage of that.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
yeah. certainly the new -- the strong new product cadence is something you can leverage in this environment. i appreciate the input guys. thank you very much and good luck.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of tore sandberg with stifel. you may proceed with your question.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
yes. thank you. i just had a follow-up on lora and on one of the metrics. the one metric that really caught my attention was the gateways it's gone up quite dramatically the last two quarters. mohan is that simply because lora is becoming more and more of a consumer technology?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
i would say it's a little bit of both tore. i would say that it's not so much consumer, but we are getting some smart home deployments and of course, if you think about echos in the home, or if you think about the helium gateways, which are really smart home type of initiatives that drives a high volume of gateways. but yeah, you're right, even for us, it's a surprise to see quite aggressive growth there. we had as you mentioned the target for the year was 2 million gateways, and we're already at 2.2 million gateways. so we've raised that to 2.9 million. but, to me, the beauty about the gateway deployments is really just drives the capacity to support billions of sensors and that to me is the key. so if you have infrastructure out there, then it's just a question of time for the census and the used cases to catch up. there's a couple of bottlenecks still. software, there's a bottleneck, and i think census is a bottleneck in some cases, but as those bottlenecks get removed, then there's no reason to question the growth in the opportunity there.
tore sandberg -- stifel -- analyst
very helpful. thank you.
operator
at this time, there are no more questions, i'd like to pass the call back over to management for any closing remarks.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
in closing, we are pleased with the strong first half results as we saw increased adoption of our growth engines in the infrastructure, smarter planet and mobility markets that should provide sustainable long-term growth. we have been successfully navigating the challenging supply chain environment and expanding on our sustainability efforts, including our commitment to human capital development. given our diverse and growing product offering, balanced markets and strong customer relationships, we expect to deliver a stronger second half and record financial performance in fy'22. with that, we appreciate your continued support of semtech and i look forward to updating you on next quarter. thank you. operator?

operator
greetings. welcome to the semtech corporation quarter 2 fiscal year 2022 earnings call. [operator instructions]. please note that this conference is being recorded. i will now turn the conference over to your host, sandy harrison. you may begin.
sandy harrison -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, john and welcome to semtech's conference call to discuss our second quarter of fiscal year '22 results. speakers for today's call will be mohan maheswaran, semtech's president and chief executive officer and emeka chukwu, our chief financial officer. a press release announcing our unaudited results was issued after the market close today and is available on our website at semtech.com.
today's call will include forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in these statements. for a more detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please review the safe harbor statement that is included in today's press release and in the other risk factors section of our most recent periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission.
as a reminder, comments made on today's call are current as of today only and semtech undertakes no obligation to update the information from the call should facts or circumstances change. all references made to financial results in mohan's and emeka's prepared remarks during this call will refer to non-gaap financial measures, unless otherwise noted.
a discussion of why the management team considers such non-gaap financial measures useful along with detailed reconciliations of such non-gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measures are also included in today's press release. i want to also highlight semtech will be hosting its first ever tech topic webinar that is scheduled for wednesday, october 6th, where we will focus on our lora platform. more details on the event, including the agenda and sign of information will be coming soon.
with that, i'll turn the call over to semtech's chief financial officer, emeka chukwu. emeka?
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, sandy. good afternoon, everyone. as is our practice, i'll be focusing my comments on our non-gaap financial results unless otherwise noted. for q2 fiscal year '22, the net sales grew 9% sequentially and 29% year-over-year to $185 million, which was above the midpoint of our guidance and represented a new quarterly record led by the secular momentum that contributed to new records achieved by several of our growth -- of our key growth platforms. in q2, shipments into asia represented 81% of net sales, north america represented 11% and europe represented 8%. while these represent the ship to addresses for our distributors and oems, we estimate that approximately 35% of our shipments are consumed in china, 27% in the americas and the balance over the rest of the world. total direct sales represented approximately 13% of net sales and sales to distribution represented approximately 87%.
and our pos was another quarterly record. our distribution business remains balanced with approximately 39% of the total pos coming from the infrastructure end market, 31% from the industrial end market and 30% from the high-end consumer end market. q2. bookings remained strong and increased 75% year-over-year and resulted in a book-to-bill well above one. pos bookings accounted for approximately 3% of shipments during the quarter. q2 gross margin increased 70 basis points sequentially to 62.7%, which was at the upper end of our guidance range due to a more favorable product mix. our gross margin is benefiting from a higher mix of sales from our growth platforms, including lora enabled data center tri-edge pam4 cdr, 10-gig pon, 5g wireless and broad-based industrial protection.
for q3, we expect gross margin in the range of 62.8% to 63.8%, as we anticipate greater contribution from these growth drivers. q2 operating expense increased 3% to $65.9 million, driven by higher variable compensation expenses, slightly offset by lower new product development expenses. for the rest of fiscal year '22, we expect our operating expense to be in line to slightly above current levels. in q2, we were again pleased to see our operating profit on a sequential and year-over-year business grow much faster than sales, due to the gross margin expansion and stable operating expenses. this drove a 270 basis points sequential expansion of our operating margin to 27.1%. we expect continued operating leverage as we make progress toward our 32% to 36% long-term target model. in q2, cash flow from operations increased 63% sequentially, to a record $53 million or 29% of net sales, while free cash flow increased 71% sequentially to 25% of net sales, achieving the lower end of our long-term free cash flow target range of 25% to 30% of net sales.
in q2, we repurchased approximately 1% of our outstanding stock for $42 million, resulting in $322 million remaining in our outstanding authorization. we expect to continue to use our cash to opportunistically repurchase our shares, make strategic investments and pay down debt. accounts receivable in q2 increased 10% from q1, while days of sales decreased 3 days from q1 to 34 days, and remains below our target range of 40 to 45 days. in q2, net inventory in absolute dollar terms increased 10% sequentially and days of inventory increased by 3 days to 129 days at the end of q2. we expect our net inventory to remain above our target range of 90 days to 100 days to support the stronger demand and the tighter supply chain environment. in summary, we are pleased with the strong first half momentum we are seeing from our higher margin growth engines, which we expect to continue in the second half. we believe the sustainable secular drivers behind our growth engines are expanding gross margins, stable operating expenses and strong cash flow generation have positioned us well to deliver a record financial performance in fiscal year '22 and beyond.
i will now hand the call over to mohan.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
thank you. emeka. good afternoon, everyone. i will discuss our q2 fiscal year '22 performance by end market, and by product group, and then provide our outlook for q3 of fiscal year '22.
in q2, net revenue increased 9% sequentially and 29% over the prior year to a record $185 million. high demand across all three of our end markets contributed to the q2 growth. we posted non-gaap gross margin of 62.7% and record non-gaap earnings per share of $0.65. in q2, net revenue from the infrastructure market increased 10% sequentially and represented 37% of total net revenues. industrial market net revenue increased 5% sequentially and represented 31% of total net revenues. the high-end consumer market net revenues increased 10% sequentially and represented 32% of total net revenues. approximately 21% of consumer net revenue was attributable to mobile devices and approximately 11% was attributable to other consumer systems.
i will now discuss the performance of each of our product groups. in q2 of fiscal year '22, our signal integrity product group grew 10% sequentially and represented 39% of total revenues. strength from the data center and pon markets drove the growth in our sip business. in q2, revenue from the data center market grew sequentially, led by record revenues from our pam4 platforms. strong design win momentum in 100 gig, 200 gig and 400 gig pam4 optical modules is expected to contribute to a strong second half for our data center business. we are very pleased with the progress of our tri-edge short reach platforms and we expect to introduce our new longer reach tri-edge platforms over the next 12 months, that we believe will open up the full 200 gig and 400 gig pam4 data center market to us.
we remain confident in our strategy and as we execute on delivering our tri edge and fiberedge platform that deliver lower power, lower cost and low latency, we should see continued growth in our data center business in fy '22 and beyond. in q2 of fy '22, revenue from our pon products grew sequentially and achieved a new revenue record. demand for our 10 gig pon products remained very strong and achieved another record and now represents the largest revenue segment within our pon business. semtech provides the most comprehensive pon pmd portfolio available in the market today and we expect our pon business to continue to benefit from the global demand for higher bandwidth access solutions. we expect our pon business to remain strong over the next few years as global service providers accelerate their deployments of broadband access equipment.
in q2 of fiscal year '22, 5g demand slowed as expected following the prior quarter's record results. however, with several china tenders recently announced and carriers in north america and europe, expected to begin 5g build-outs, over the next 12 months. we expect to see demand for our 5g platforms pick-up during the second half of this year. we continue to see design wins for both our 25 gig clearedge and 50 gig pam4 tri edge platforms in 5g fronthaul optical modules and we believe we are well positioned to benefit from next generation wireless network deployments. as users demand greater bandwidth, we expect the infrastructure segment to continue to grow and expect this to result in sustainable long-term growth for our signal integrity product group. in q3 of fiscal year '22, we expect revenue from our signal integrity product group to increase and achieve another record driven by growth from all the infrastructure segments.
moving on to our protection product group. in q2 of fiscal year '22, net revenues from our protection product group increased 9% sequentially and increased 49% year-over-year and represented 27% of total revenues. in q2, protection revenue from our consumer customers rebounded nicely over the prior quarter, led by growth at our north american and korean customers as their supply constraints improved. demand also increased across the broad based industrial markets led by stronger demand from north american and european automotive and industrial customers. many of today's automotive, iot and communication systems use advanced lithography chips that require higher performance protection. our latest protection platforms deliver technology that prevents damage to these highly sensitive chips. in addition, as part of the industry's ongoing push on esg, we are seeing an increased focus on the reduction of electronic wastage, which we believe will further accelerate the adoption of semtech protection products. we expect both these trends to continue to drive further adoption of semtech's protection platforms across all market segments and enable us to deliver double-digit growth with increasing gross margins over the next several years.
in q3 of fiscal year '22, we expect our protection revenues to increase again nicely led by continued strength from the broad based industrial markets.
turning to our wireless and sensing product group. in q2, revenues from our wireless and sensing product group increased 7% sequentially and 61% over the prior year and achieved another quarterly record and represented 34% of total revenues. in q2, our lora enabled platforms delivered another quarterly revenue record driven by the smart utility, smart city and industrial iot segments. the momentum from our lora platforms has really started to accelerate globally and we expect to see continued growth this year in line with our long-term 40% cagr forecast. we are also seeing a tremendous number of new lora based use cases globally that support future growth. recently announced initiatives include ldt, a south korean smart sensor network provider integrated lora into its smart fire prevention system that provides real-time analytics sensing connectivity and geolocation to protect commercial facilities, such as shopping malls and local markets. swiss post have deployed smart connected pens that leverage its nationwide lorawan network to help digitally transform the swiss postal service. offset, an iot solutions expert is collaborating with semtech to support a number of new smart utility iot initiatives targeted at the oil gas and communications industries.
and skylab, a supplier of wireless sensors and gps tracking and measuring systems will be using our lora edge platform to develop a solution for indoor and outdoor asset management of vehicles, vessels and containers. this is one of many asset tracking design wins based on our lora edge platform that are expected to convert to revenue in the next 12 to 18 months. these are just a few of the new use cases that highlight the flexibility, scalability and momentum of lora that is enabling a smarter, more connected and sustainable planet. in q2, our lora business metrics progressed very well against our fy '22 targets. the number of lora land network operators, grew to 156 and we are expecting 165 lora network operators by the end of fy '22. the cumulative number of lora end nodes deployed increased to 208 million and we expect this number to exceed 236 million cumulative end-nodes by the end of fy '22.
the number of lora gateways deployed increased to over 2.2 million and has already exceeded the goal we set for the full year. as a result, we are increasing our gateway target for the year to 2.5 5 million. the lora opportunity pipeline increased nicely in the quarter and now stands at over $850 million, which also exceeded the target we had set for the whole year. as a result, we are increasing our opportunity pipeline target for the end of the year to $900 million. we anticipate that approximately 40% of the opportunities, currently in the pipeline will convert to deployments over a 24-month timeline. our metrics demonstrate the growing adoption and deployment of lora with a long-range, low power and low cost of lora is being leveraged. we believe that this momentum in our metrics along with the increasing influence and efforts of the lora alliance, we will continue to enable lora to become the de facto standard for the fast emerging lpwan market.
in q2, our proximity sensing platforms achieved another quarterly record led by strength at our smartphone customers. semtech's proximity sensing platforms provide the industry's most advanced and highly integrated proximity sensing technology for mobile and wearable devices. the growing adoption of 5g phones and the use of high-powered radios is contributing to an increasing number of social health concerns, resulting in more stringent rf power regulations globally. this trend is expected to result in increasing demand for our proximity sensing platforms over the next few years. for q3 of fiscal year '22, we expect net revenues from our wireless and sensing product group to increase and deliver another record quarter led by another record from our lora business.
moving on to new products and design wins, in q2 of fiscal year '22, we released 11 new products and achieved 3,090 new design wins, which represented a 16% increase over the previous year.
now let me discuss our outlook for the 3rd quarter of fy '22. following very strong bookings in q2 that increased 75% over the previous year and record pos. we entered q3 with record backlog. we are currently estimating q3 net revenues to be between $188 million and $198 million. to attain the midpoint of our guidance range or approximately $193 million, we need a net term orders of approximately 5% at the beginning of q3. we expect our q3 non-gaap earnings to be between $0.68 and $0.76 per diluted share.
i will now hand the call back to the operator and sandy, emeka and i will be happy to answer any questions. operator?

at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions]. our first question is from tore svanberg with stifel. please proceed with your questions.
tore svanberg -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
yes. thank you and congratulations on the record results. first question is on your comment about data center and specifically pam4, i believe you said pam4 will double next year. could you maybe talk to some of the specific deployments there, mohan? and it also sounds like sequentially that's going to drive the signal integrity business. so again, i assume that's the beginning of some new deployments that you're benefiting from there.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes, that's right, tore. we've got quite a few things going on in the data center business, but specifically in the pam4 area. for us, the only products we have out at the moment are the short-reach products that can go into optical modules for mostly 200-gig, its 4x50 and some 400-gig applications.
we have, as i mentioned, a new series of products that are planned to come out over the next few quarters for longer reach. and i think when we have that broader portfolio, we're going to see even more momentum there. but the momentum on short reach alone is going to drive very, very significant growth for us next year, as i said, 100% growth and then beyond that, for sure. so we're very excited about the opportunity there. and not only tri-edge pam4 for our data center business, but also our 50-gigabit per second pam4 tri-edge platform for base station optical modules is also getting extremely good feedback from the marketplace. so we're very optimistic about that also.
tore svanberg -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
very good. and as a follow-up, your pon business has been on a tear. really, it's been one of your stronger businesses on a year-over-year basis. is there anything that you can share with us to give us conviction that there's still upgrade cycles happening there to sustain this momentum in 10-gig pon?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes, for sure. i mean pon, in general, first of all, globally, i think one of the nice things about pon is it's become a lot more of a global technology. for a while, it was very much china that was driving the business and the deployments. but what we've seen and while we've seen china tenders continue and driving good deployments, we're also starting to see north america and europe now starting to drive tenders out there, and that's going to drive further growth. and we're definitely seeing that kind of globalization across many different oems now building pon platforms. so pretty excited about it.
i think obviously, access bandwidth is critical. you can have all the bandwidth you want coming to the access point, but if you have a bottleneck there, then that defeats the whole purpose. and i think 10-gig pon is definitely seeing good growth, and will continue to. and i think we're likely to see higher bandwidth upon developments over the next few years. so very encouraged by the growth in pon.
tore svanberg -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
okay. just one last question on lora. so it sounds like the smart home smart neighborhood is starting to ramp. is that primarily north america? or are you seeing that ramp in other regions as well?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
we're seeing it ramp across the board, i would say. the majority of the strength is in north america. i would say that it's a number of different players. obviously, the amazon sidewalk initiative is yet to come. so that's still, i think, something that probably second half of next year, we're going to see that ramp. but definitely, we're seeing a whole bunch of other initiatives, including the helium rollout. we've seen kind of this emergence of this campus networks. now one of the things that's really transpired and really exciting for us is that lora which is predominantly a range-driven technology, low power long range driven technology, but we're seeing in that kind of half a mile to 5-mile range, lora really starting to get adopted as well, which is pretty exciting because it opens up a whole bunch of use cases that makes the market, essentially the lpwan market become much bigger, and i think we'll grow faster.
tore svanberg -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
thank you for that mohan and congratulations again.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question is from tristan gerra with robert w. baird. please proceed with your question.
tristan gerra -- robert w. baird -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. you talked about both pon and data center increasing sequentially. and i know you've mentioned -- you just mentioned that pon is now diversifying away from china. so it looks like you're still weathering the china slowdown better than the way some other companies have characterized it recently.
could you talk about what you're seeing there in that geography? and whether, if indeed, you're seeing a slowdown, it will have meant higher outlook for this quarter at the top line?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think, tristan, it's very segment-dependent on which segment you're focused on. we've definitely seen slowing down in china smartphones, for example, in the consumer business in general. i would say infrastructure is quite healthy still. i would say iot is still quite healthy. so it really does depend on which segment. and i think that's we're seeing that across the board. and that's the beauty of being a balanced business like we are and having diversification and having end market diversification, but also geographical diversification is that when one area is doing weak, other areas are strong. and so just having the diversification helps that.
so -- yeah, but to answer your question, i think it really is segment-specific. and we've seen more weakness in the china consumer business than we have in other areas.
tristan gerra -- robert w. baird -- analyst
great. and then could you talk about your expectation about pricing contributing to your top line over the next few quarters? you were mentioning early this year about your expectations for price increases in the second half, which also could benefit gross margin. and as those price increases, perhaps continuing and with the ones that you've already done, is that going to contribute next year to the growth in addition to whatever you're going to see in units?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
possibly, tristan. but i think most of our price increases have been really driven by increases in our supply chain costs. so we have focused very much on when we've had an increase in wafer costs or specifically cost for a specific product, whether it be fab or assembly and test-related trying to pass that on to our customer base. so -- and that is definitely helping us offset some of those supply chain cost increases by providing asp increases.
i don't think that we will necessarily continue to do that unless we are seeing more supply chain action, which is possible because supply chain cycle times are extremely long. when you have long cycle times like that, typically, one of the things that -- that drives is higher pricing generally. so at least until all the capex and all the investments are in place, and that typically takes several years, so it's possible we see it, but we're not counting on that.
tristan gerra -- robert w. baird -- analyst
great. thank you very much.

our next question is from harsh kumar with piper sandler. please proceed with your questions.
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
yeah, hey guys. first of all, congratulations. very solid results. mohan, i had two for you. you mentioned there was softness in the data center business last quarter that you just reported, and then you expect things to improve. i was curious in your opinion, what might have caused that softness. and then also, what are you seeing that gives you the confidence that things are improving in the data center? and then i have a follow-up.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
so i think it's -- from our standpoint, harsh, a lot of the shift in what's going on in the market. so 100-gig optical modules and maybe there's some excess inventory out there of product, but the newer pam4 deployments where they have no inventory, i think we're starting to see those ramp up quite fast. and we have pretty much those design wins in the bag. and so it's really design win driven. so i think we are fairly comfortable about where q4 is and also next year for our data center business.
it does tend to be lumpy. all the infrastructure businesses are a little bit lumpy. you'll get a quarter or two of deployments or capex spending, and then there will be some management of inventory, and then you'll see it come back again. but for sure, at least for 100-gig, pam4 200-gig, 400-gig and then 5g base stations and for 10-gig pon, it's going to be up and to the right. there's no question that those deployments are going to continue to grow year-on-year. it's just a question of timing, right?
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. understood, mohan, thank you. and then i had a question on pon. i seem to recall in one of your presentations that the 10-gig pon you guys are playing on both sides of the wire, whereas for 1-gig pon and 2.5, you were just on one side of the wire. so i was curious if that is an accurate assessment, which would imply, if that's correct, that your content went up quite a bit. and then as a side question to that is, i was curious you would be willing to give us how much pon is as a percentage of revenue?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
so everything you said is accurate, harsh. pon -- 10-gig pon, we are playing on both the central office end and the onu end, the olt end and the onu side. and obviously, the asps are higher on the olt side. so that's good. it also is, if you sell a broad chipset like that, the complete chipset, that gives you a very strong position with your customers. and so that's also a very good thing, i think. and so strategically, we're very comfortable with where we are. with regard to percentage, sandy, i don't know if you have that or if we can provide that. let me see.
sandy harrison -- vice president, investor relations
yes. so harsh, the pon's typically been somewhere in sort of the low to mid-teens. it's probably running at the upper end of that this year, year-to-date.
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
that's good enough for me. i'll get back in line. congrats guys. thank you.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
our next question is from craig ellis with b. riley securities. please proceed with your questions.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
yeah. thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the very strong quarter and outlook. mohan, i wanted to start just by getting some further color on what you're seeing with order activity and backlog growth. backlog is clearly very strong with just 3% turns coverage needed to meet guidance. so what are you seeing there? and are there particular areas of the business where you're seeing more significant order intake and backlog expansion?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. orders continue to be very strong. backlog is obviously very healthy given what we've just mentioned on turns there. so everything is looking quite good there. i would say, there are pockets of extremely very good strength and pon is clearly one of those. lora, obviously, is another area. our protection ipa business, which is very broad, very, very strong. so there are some nice pockets.
areas of weakness, i mentioned china, smartphone consumer, not totally unexpected coming toward the end of the year, and it's kind of been a funky couple of years here. so some of the typical seasonality. that's what we expect to see. so it's not totally unusual. but i would say, craig, that at the moment, everything is still very, very strong.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
that's real helpful. and then, i wanted to go from there and just talk a little bit about the industrial activity inside of protection. so great to see the 31% sequential growth. and i was wondering if you could point out some of the things within that very broad end market that are seeing particular strength? and how sustainable do you think that strength is as we look out into the first half of calendar '22? and what do you think is driving that strength?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so i do think it's sustainable. q4, we'd expect it to be a little bit soft. but i think as q1, certainly in the first half of next year, i'd expect it to be strong again. it's in multiple segments. so it's communications, it's automotive, it's broad-based interfaces, usb-c, hdmi. so it's a very broad set of interfaces being protected as well as different segments. automotive, particularly, i think, is strong, and communications there is quite strong.
now if you think about what's -- the kind of sustainability of it, this is really the mass market. it's not ten customers, it's thousands of customers. and so what we're really seeing is the broad market now starting to use advanced lithography processes and controllers and dsps. and as they're starting to use those advanced lithography devices, i think the -- it really kind of fits our strategy and our -- the adoption of our protection into those segments very well.
and so that's really what's driving it, craig, the adoption of these leading-edge geometries and the need for our kind of high-end protection, which is what we've been saying for a while, but we have -- obviously, in the consumer segment, we've proven that capability. but we've been waiting in a sense for the broader market to kind of come to us and now i think it's coming.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
yeah, nice to see the market coming to you, especially one that has real nice margin characteristics. i don't want to ignore emeka. emeka, great to see the real strong gross margin. i just wanted to see if there was any further color you could provide on some of the -- some of the particular pluses in the quarter since we were at the very high end of guidance and at least 50 basis points above what i was expecting.
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so thank you, craig. and it's ok, i do not feel like ignored at all. our gross margin story has definitely been a highlight for us. and it's actually very pleasing to see these numbers playing out given the expectations that we've had for a while. if you recall in the past, we've talked about the growth drivers, right, of lora-enabled, the 10-gig pon, the pam4 cdrs, broad-based protection devices. we talked about all of that coming with much higher gross margins than the corporate average. so it's nice to see that playing out. and that's essentially the story, right? our gross margin expansion story is pretty simple, it is just that of mix.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
that's great. thanks guys. appreciate it.
operator
our next question is from christopher rolland with susquehanna. please proceed with your question.
christopher rolland -- susquehanna -- analyst
thanks guys. i guess my questions are mostly around lora. so i guess for lora, in terms of like an innovation treadmill, what kind of improvements do you think we might be able to see with lora? and then with helium, for example, it's so backlogged right now. it seems like you guys would have a ton of pricing power, particularly for gateway chips. maybe talk about your pricing power for those chips today. and remind me what the average asp per base station is as well. thank you.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
let me start with that, chris. i think it varies. but i think for the lower end base station, the kind of home base stations, we're talking between $5 and $30, depending on which version and things like that. and you're right, the pricing power is definitely with us. but remember, our strategy is to deploy gateways everywhere in the world and get -- we want helium's distributed wireless network to be very successful and to be essentially connectivity to be out there in every country in the world in every neighborhood in the world and lora connectivity to be just not an issue for use cases. and that's been -- always been the goal that we've had. so that's why i comment on the number of gateways out there and the number of sensors that can be deployed because the real goal for us is to get sensors deployed and connected to those gateways. that can't happen if you don't have gateways.
and so now the beauty about the helium kind of decentralized network is it kind of allows really viral connectivity, if you like, to the network. and so we're very excited by it. but i think they're -- if i look at all the other networks around the world today, they're now starting to get really utilized the way we had envisioned them being utilized. and we've got roaming agreements. we've got companies using networks for private enterprises. we've got also public network stuff going on. it just really is starting to play out the way we had anticipated. so very excited by it, but yes, clearly, the helium network is -- momentum is very, very positive.
christopher rolland -- susquehanna -- analyst
yeah, i have been super impressed, mohan, and i agree with your -- the viral statement around helium. i have one miner, i love it. i have an order for three more out there. and that kind of brings up my second question here. and that is in terms of lora gateways, i guess, entering the year, if my numbers are right, i think you had maybe 1.3 million gateways and you're adding -- that's in your entire existence, and now you're adding 1.7 million this year, just massive growth on the gateway side.
so i guess my question is, how confident are you? or into the visibility in between, what is actually helium? and what are in these campus programs or neighborhood programs or industrial programs? how confident are you that these aren't helium orders like, for example, the three that i have on back order, for example? are you sure that if the helium network growth were to slow down, that it really wouldn't affect the growth for lora like we've been seeing?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
well, and i kind of answered that question, chris, because our focus is on the sensor connectivity. we just started an initiative, for example, to get a billion sensors connected to combat climate change as an example of that. and the sensor connectivity can be obviously the macro gateways, which are the bigger gateways that sit out on a tower can connect to many more sensors and have much more range. and so i think it's more for us use case driven. we do have fairly good visibility into where the gateways are going and what they're doing. but frankly, i think it doesn't matter that much. i think it's more a question of are they use cases? and are the use cases really starting to be utilized in a way that demonstrates the value of lora?
sidewalk is a good example of that. and sidewalk, obviously, we're anticipating at some point here next year that amazon will start to roll it out, and we'll start to get sensors connected to it and then there will be -- new use cases emerge. because the beauty about lora and the world of lorawan here and the lpwan market that's going on, there's is a lot of the use cases are just beginning, i mean, really just beginning. and people are starting to see, oh, i can use lora for this, and i can use it for satellite connectivity or i can use it for agriculture, i can use it for smart home deployments or i can use it for geolocation and tracking an asset.
and this type of -- kind of, as i said, viral use case offers the opportunity to really expand the market quickly and to make it very, very large, which is obviously our intent, right?
christopher rolland -- susquehanna -- analyst
yes. well, great growth, and thank you mohan.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question is from karl ackerman with cowen. please proceed with your questions.
karl ackerman -- cowen -- analyst
yes. two questions, please. thank you gentlemen. the first one is piggybacking on lora. it's great to see that lora is now integrated into aws and azure. but is the go-to-market still predominantly driven by your own sales force? i'm curious how do you see the go-to-market changing, if at all, now that you do have broader ecosystem support from the larger hyperscalers?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think, karl, the -- our sales force, obviously, has a critical role to play in the adoption of lora and the marketing of lora and the communication of how lora is succeeding in the market. but we have a lora alliance. so the alliance has got, as i mentioned before, 400 to 500 members, including microsoft and aws and cisco and ibm and many, many companies out there at all levels of the value chain. so you've got sensor companies, chip companies, gateway companies, software companies, system integrators. and so lora is just simply a technology, right? and it's just a technology platform here. but the use cases typically require several members of the ecosystem to participate and get together and figure out an end-to-end -- to figure out an end-to-end solution. and so i think it's really the power of the alliance and the kind of pervasive nature of what's happening with lora now that's driving the momentum. i don't know that it's -- if we added a sales guy or ten salespeople, that would necessarily have a massive additional benefit. i think it's more about getting the right system integrators in, getting the right use cases, so people can look at the use case and say, hey, that's interesting, i want to do that. getting the right sense of technologies out there, software, making sure there's no bottlenecks in the software.
i always talk about bottlenecks in the ecosystem, and those bottlenecks have moved. it used to be sensors, and it used to be hardware-related, now it's more software-related. and so the addition of microsoft azure and aws really, really does add a tremendous value because many companies would have struggled to build a back-end software platform for their use case. but having the ability to go to microsoft or to go to aws and partner with them, to get that access, i think, really changes the time-to-market aspect of it.
karl ackerman -- cowen -- analyst
yes, understood. that's helpful. my follow-up is more of a clarification. if pam4 is high teens as a percent of sales this year, does that mean nrz is equally as large this year? and is there a notable margin difference between the cdrs and optical ics supporting each technology? thank you.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes. nrz is larger. obviously, it's been around for a while, and i think that's the key point to make is that when you look at pam4, it's -- at least for us, it's a fairly new platform. tri-edge is just really been released to production, the short-reach use cases. and so we've got good design win momentum. and really the point being that as we see -- get the momentum, the growth in that business is fairly significant. and so we're expecting pam4, 200-gig pam4, 400-gig pam4 deployments next year to accelerate quite nicely.
karl ackerman -- cowen -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question is from quinn bolton with needham & co. please proceed with your question.
quinn bolton -- needham & co -- analyst
hey guys. congratulations on the nice results. maybe just a quick follow-up on that last question on the pam4. one, do you say high teens in terms of absolute millions of dollars? or is it a high-teen percentage of revenues, maybe i missed it? and then does it all -- is that only tri-edge? or does it also include the fiberedge pmds? and then i've got a couple of follow-ups.
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes, it's high teens in terms of millions of dollars, and that it does include fiberedge, but i would say the majority of the growth is coming from tri-edge.
quinn bolton -- needham & co -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then looking to just the overall supply chain, i know you mentioned some of your business is constrained, especially on the consumer side by component availability of other manufacturers. just wondering if you're seeing any supply constraints in your own perhaps more back-end and front-end supply chain. and i know a number of analog companies through the fall had experienced shutdowns or covid related effects out of southeast asia, wondering if that had any impact on your business this quarter?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
not really. i would say that it's kind of been pretty consistent for us over the last couple of quarters, same type of issues. obviously, some fabs are full, and their cycle times are quite long. i would say, in general, across the whole supply chain, cycle times have doubled over the last year or so. so we've gone from an average of 20 weeks to maybe 40 weeks cycle time. so that's significant. and so that's across the board, and that's an average. there are pockets where it's longer than that, and there are pockets where it's not such a big problem. but i would say, in general, supply chain is still a major challenge.
but we're ok. we -- obviously, we built inventory. we planned on building inventory. we are using that inventory to continuously make sure our customers are -- manufacturing lines are running and not -- we're not in the bottleneck. we do know, as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, that some of our customers are struggling to get all of the components to build a complete system. and so that has an impact on kind of a short-term demand impact. but i think in the medium term, that will clear up.
quinn bolton -- needham & co -- analyst
got it. and my last question, mohan. just any update on the lora micro services part of the business?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so the cloud services is going well. i think, obviously, lora edge is the platform there and bringing on board microsoft azure and now aws, i think we have partners that we can work with very closely and our customers, and we've started to now look at what elements of the cloud service geolocation performance needs to be changed to make sure we have an end-to-end solution.
but i think at the moment, no real significant breakthroughs there, but i would say good momentum. and i think you're going to hear a lot more about that next year.
quinn bolton -- needham & co -- analyst
great. thank you.

our next question is from rick schafer with oppenheimer. please proceed with your question.
rick schafer -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thanks. i'll add my congratulations, guys. a lot of good questions already. but just if i could sneak one more in on lora. i was hoping you could give a sense maybe of expected lora linearity next year. i mean, does it seem like seasonality is really relevant at this point for lora? so if you kind of look at just the run rate you're on now, it seems like 40% growth sort of makes a lot -- make sense, right, next year. so i was just curious if you could comment on that and give a sense maybe what type of backlog or just general visibility you have on that business today?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think it's pretty good, rick, i would say, for the first half, but a lot depends on the funnel and the -- how quickly that funnel moves to deployments. obviously, it's grown now to a large size, the funnel, and we're anticipating some of those tend to go into the full deployments. but the momentum is very good. and i think everything we had anticipated in terms of design-ins and design wins from these -- from the funnel. and i think in general, the number of use cases that are emerging and starting to get deployed without our help, i think, is very encouraging. so i think the 40% for next year is looking pretty good as well.
rick schafer -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thanks for that one. and then just a quick follow-up on gross margin. i mean obviously, looks fantastic. i mean it seems like mid-60s is sort of the new baseline. and i'm just curious there, as we look forward to not that far out, i mean looking at the kind of growth you guys are putting up, you're not that far out from your $1 billion top line run rate kind of goal. so i'm curious sort of where you think or where you see gross margin once we're at that $1 billion run rate? and then just a quick clarification on next year. i know you talked about asp. but i'm curious, do you see that as a tailwind for gross margin next year?
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so rick, this is emeka. so the gross margin like i said before in my prepared remarks, it's mostly being driven by the mix of revenue. as we're seeing a higher revenue contribution from our growth platforms, we are -- that is helping us to drive our gross margin expansion. we are definitely looking at where we have our target range for gross margin at $1 billion of revenue, it is going to be driven by how that revenue is coming in.
but in terms of mid-60s and stuff like that, that is a possibility, but we just have to wait before we start setting those expectations, we have to wait and see what's going on with the current supply chain environment, right? there you saw is -- if we continue to see price increases from the supply chain that you saw, there is so much that our customers will be able to absorb.
so that is something that we're keeping an eye on. but i share your sentiment that as we continue to see revenue contributions growing from the new product platforms that we've talked about that we should continuously see gross margins headed into the mid-60s and maybe beyond. but we're not going to sign up for those at this point.
rick schafer -- oppenheimer -- analyst
i understand. thank you emeka, thanks mohan.
operator
[operator instructions]. our next question is from harsh kumar with piper sandler. please proceed with your question.
harsh kumar -- piper sandler -- analyst
yeah, mohan, i had an interesting one. not specific to your company, but just more so on the industry. a lot of companies that have reported numbers, results in the last three months to six months have basically buck seasonality. there's been -- just because the demand has been so high, that it's kind of like up to the right. i noticed that you guys are guiding seasonal, particularly, it seems like from a consumer and a couple of other small things. but i'm curious if we are back to a demand-supply situation where seasonality is coming into play. or is it just, do you think something specific to some of your businesses that you have?
mohan maheswaran -- president and chief executive officer
well, the seasonality is tied to consumer, as you noticed, harsh. and i think that it's not a surprise. some of that, as i mentioned, i think in my prepared remarks is our customers not being able to get all the parts they need, i think. so there's a little bit of that playing into it. but i do think there's going to be some seasonality here.
you're right, though. i mean, the demand environment is very strong. people are constrained. and so, to some extent, you can play that game. we typically are shipping to consumption. that's what we're trying to do. we're not trying to do anything more than that. and we keep a very close eye on pos, and so that's kind of our thinking. if the channel is shipping into customers and demand continues to be strong, then q1 will be very strong.
rick schafer -- oppenheimer -- analyst

greetings. welcome to the semtech corporation, q3 fy '22 earnings call. [operator instructions]. a question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [operator instructions]. i will now turn the conference over to your host, vp of investor relations, sandy harrison. you may begin.
sandy harrison -- vice president, investor relations
great. thank you, carl, and welcome to semtech's conference call to discuss our third quarter fiscal year 2022 financial results. speakers for today's call will be mohan maheswaran, semtech's president and chief executive officer; and emeka chukwu, our chief financial officer. a press release announcing our unaudited results was issued after the market closed today and is available on our website at semtech.com.
today's call will include forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in these statements. for a more detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please review the safe harbor statement included in today's press release and in the other risk factors section of our most recent periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission.
as a reminder, comments made on today's call are current as of today only, and semtech undertakes no obligation to update the information from this call should facts or circumstances change. other references made to financials -- all the references made to financial results in mohan's and emeka's prepared remarks during this call will refer to non-gaap financial measures, unless otherwise noted. a discussion of why the management team considers such non-gaap financial measures useful, along with a detailed reconciliations of the non-gaap measures to the most comparable gaap financial measures are included in today's press release.
and with that, i will turn the call over to semtech's chief financial officer, emeka chukwu. emeka?
emeka chukwu -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, sandy. good afternoon, everyone. as is our practice, i will focus my comments on our non-gaap financial results, unless otherwise noted. in q3 fiscal year '22, the company delivered a very strong financial performance that included achieving a number of new financial records, including net sales of $194.9 million, that increased 5% sequentially and 27% year-over-year and was above the midpoint of our guidance.
continued momentum and record results by several of our key growth platforms contributed to the strong net sales performance. in q3, shipments into asia, north america and europe represented 78%, 12% and 10%, respectively. while this represented a shift to addresses for our distributors and customers, we estimate that approximately 35% of our shipments are consumed in china, 27% in the americas and the balance over the rest of the world.
total direct sales represented approximately 12% of net sales, and distribution net sales represented approximately 88%. our distributor pos represented another quarterly record, and the business remains balanced with approximately 41%, 32% and 27% of the total pos coming from the infrastructure, industrial and high-end consumer end markets, respectively.
in q3, bookings increased 16% year-over-year, and those bookings accounted for approximately 3% of our q3 shipments. the q3 gross margin increased 110 basis points sequentially to 63.8%, which represented the upper end of our guidance range and the new quarterly record, led by a more favorable product mix. going forward, we expect our gross margin to continue to benefit from the retail mix of sales from our key growth platforms that include lora-enabled, our 10g pon, our tri-edge pam4 cdrs and our broad-based industrial protection products.
for q4, we expect gross margin to continue to expand as we anticipate a more favorable mix due to a seasonally lower high-end consumer net sales. for planning and modeling purposes, we expect our gross margin to remain at current levels with an upward bias over the next several quarters, reflecting the benefit from the growth of our secular growth platforms.
in q3, operating expenses increased 2% to $67.5 million, driven by higher new product development expenses. for q4, we expect our operating expense to be in line to slightly above current levels. looking ahead to fiscal year '23, we expect our operating expense to begin to trend back toward our target model of half the rate of net sales growth.
in q3, operating profit increased 14% sequentially or nearly three times that of net sales and increased 51% on a year-over-year basis, led by the higher gross margin and represented a record operating profit. operating margin expanded by 210 basis points sequentially to 29.2% and represented solid progress toward our 32% to 36% long-term target model. as expected, we are seeing the strong operating leverage expected for the success of our growth platforms.
in q3, cash flow from operations was a record $66.5 million, up 26% sequentially and represented 34% of net sales as a result of the record operating profit and good management of working capital, while free cash flow increased 33% sequentially to 31% of net sales.
free cash flow generation in fiscal year 2022 has been strong despite the strategic actions to maintain higher levels of inventory. and we expect to end the year around the low end of our long-term free cash flow target of 25% to 30% of net sales, which will be a significant expansion from the prior year.
in q3, we repurchased approximately $30 million or 0.6% of our outstanding stock, resulting in $292 million remaining in our outstanding authorization, and we expect to continue to use our cash to opportunistically repurchase as our shares, make strategic investments and pay down the debt.
the q3 accounts receivable increased 2% sequentially to $74 million, while days of sales was flat with the prior quarter at 34 days and remains below our target range of 40 days to 45 days. in q3, net inventory in absolute dollar terms increased 2% sequentially, and days of inventory increased four days sequentially to 133 days.
we expect net inventory to remain above our target range of 90 days to 100 days to support the stronger demand and better supply chain environment. in summary, the success of our growth engines of lora-enabled, our tri-edge pam4, 10-gig pon, 5g wireless and broad-based protection platforms enabled us to deliver a record net sales, a record gross margin, record operating profit, record earnings per share and record cash flow in q3.
we expect the sustainable long-term growth from these key growth engines and the underlying secular drivers that continue to drive record financial performance for fiscal year '22 and provide a strong momentum as we move into fiscal year '23.
i will now hand the call over to mohan.

thank you, emeka. good afternoon, everyone. i will discuss our q3 fiscal year '22 performance by end market and by product group, and then provide our outlook for q4 of fiscal year '22. in q3, net revenue of $194.9 million grew 5% sequentially and 27% annually and represented a new quarterly record.
higher demand from the industrial and high-end consumer markets contributed to q3 growth. we posted record non-gaap gross margin of 63.8% and record non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $0.74. in q3, net revenue from the industrial end market increased 17% sequentially, led by record results from both our lora business and our broad-based protection business and represented 35% of total net revenues. the infrastructure market decreased 1% sequentially as record pon revenues and stronger base station revenues were offset by lower data center revenues and represented 34% of total net revenues. the high-end consumer market increased 2% sequentially and represented 31% of total revenues, with approximately 20% attributable to mobile devices and approximately 11% attributable to other consumer systems.
i will now discuss the performance of each of our product groups. in q3 of fiscal year '22, our signal integrity product group increased 3% sequentially and achieved a new revenue record, led by growth from the pon and base station infrastructure markets and represented 39% of total revenues.
in q3, revenue from our data center customers softened over the prior strong quarter. our tri-edge pam4 short-reach platforms continued to gain solid design win traction with key hyperscale customers. we expect this momentum to accelerate into fy '23 as the power and cost benefits of tri-edge become realized across shorter reach links in the data center market. the excellent performance of our short-reach tri-edge platforms has also led to increasing interest in our longer reach tri-edge pam4 platforms, planned for release over the next several quarters. in fy '22, we expect our data center pam4 revenues to end in the high teens and increase over 100% in fy '23.
as new tri-edge products are released to production, we believe our complete portfolio of tri-edge pam4 devices will enable very strong revenue growth over the next few years in 100-gig, 200-gig and 400-gig pam4 optical modules in the hyperscale data center market. in q3 of fy '22, revenue from the pon market achieved another record performance, led by record 10-gig pon revenues as we continue to benefit from the most comprehensive pon pmd portfolio available in the market today.
we expect our pon business, led by our 10-gig pon solutions, to continue to grow as global service providers accelerate their deployments of higher bandwidth access networks. in q3 of fy '22, demand from our wireless base station customers increased over the prior quarter. several 5g china tenders have been announced, and carriers in north america and europe are expected to begin 5g infrastructure build-outs over the next 12 months to 18 months.
we are expecting demand for our 5-gig platforms -- 5g platforms to accelerate in fy '23 due to a significant design in momentum for our 25-gig clearedge family. in addition, our industry-leading 50-gigabit per second pam4 tri-edge platform targeted at 50-gigabit per second front-haul modules is now being sampled for next-generation 5g wireless networks and receiving very positive feedback.
the secular themes driving the global demand for greater bandwidth are expected to remain strong, and we believe our strong position in our key infrastructure markets will provide the sustainable tailwinds needed to drive double-digit growth for our signal integrity product group over the next several years. in q4 of fiscal year '22, we expect revenue from our signal integrity product group to increase and achieve another record driven by growth from the data center market.
moving on to our protection product group. in q3 of fiscal year '22, net revenues from our protection product group increased 14% sequentially and 36% year-over-year and represented 29% of total revenues. in q3, revenue from our consumer protection platforms increased sequentially, as expected, driven by north american and asian consumer demand.
while consumer demand remains strong, many of our customers are supply chain limited, which is impacting their ability to build complete systems. we anticipate that this constraint will remain for at least two more quarters. in q3, demand for our protection devices used by the broad-based industrial markets grew 31% sequentially and 71% annually and achieved a new quarterly revenue record, led by growth from our automotive, communications and broad-based industrial customers.
our protection platforms deliver superior protection for systems using leading process geometry devices. we expect this secular trend to continue and contribute to the increased adoption of semtech's protection platforms across all technology sectors and help deliver double-digit growth with increasing gross margins over the next several years. in q4 of fiscal year '22, we expect our protection revenues to decrease sequentially due to typical seasonality.
turning to our wireless and sensing product group. in q3, revenues from our wireless and sensing product group grew 1% sequentially and 23% over the prior year and achieved another quarterly record and represented 32% of total revenues. in q3, our lora-enabled platforms delivered another record performance, led by growth from the smart utility, smart building, industrial iot and smart agriculture segments.
we are also seeing the early ramp of the smart home, smart neighborhood and smart campus segments, which are driving further growth for our lora business, as we had anticipated. as a result of this continued positive momentum, we now expect our lora-enabled revenue in fy '22 to exceed our 40% cagr target.
our vision for lora is to see it deployed everywhere where low-powered sensors are needed, which we believe will result in a positive impact on managing or mitigating the impact of climate change. in q3, we announced an initiative and goal to connect 1 billion lora-enabled sensors by 2026 that have a positive impact on climate change.
we continue to see many use cases globally that will contribute to this goal. some examples of these new use cases include, a collaboration with cloud energy, a leading iot solution provider in asia, to develop and deploy lorawan networks for rooftop, wireless, solar power systems. ryoden corporation, a lora solution and network provider, announced a new zero carbon solution, featuring a renesas microcontroller and our lora edge platform to connect a battery-less sensor directly to the lora cloud, enabling geolocation capabilities for the tracking of personal valuables, logistics assets, animals and healthcare assets. and iqnexus, an end-to-end iot solutions and integration provider for building automation, incorporated lora into its indoor air quality and environmental quality sensors, which reduce carbon dioxide emissions. these are just a few examples of the numerous lora use cases emerging to combat climate change.
in q3, microsoft announced it has joined the lora alliance and has accepted a seat on a lora alliance board. microsoft azure is widely considered a tier 1 enterprise cloud partner for many iot deployments, and we expect their participation, along with other top-tier cloud providers, like aws to further strengthen lora's presence in the lpwan market.
in q3, our lora business metrics continued to make solid progress against our fy '22 targets. the number of global lorawan network operators grew to 163, and we are expecting 165 lorawan network operators by the end of fy '22. the cumulative number of lora end nodes deployed increased to 225 million, and we expect this number to exceed 236 million cumulative end nodes by the end of fy '22.
the number of lora gateways deployed increased to over 2.7 million and has already exceeded the goal we set for the full year. we now expect to have 3 million gateways deployed by the end of fy '22. the lora opportunity pipeline increased to over $900 million and has also exceeded our fy '22 year-end target. we are increasing our pipeline target for fy '22 to $950 million. we anticipate that approximately 40% of the opportunities currently in the pipeline will convert to deployments on average over a 24-month time line. we believe the momentum of our metrics, along with the increasing influence of the lora alliance and its members will help enable lora to become the de facto standard for the fast-growing lpwan market.
in q3, demand for our proximity sensing platforms softened following last quarter's record revenues. our sensing platforms provide the industry's most advanced and highly integrated sar sensing technology for mobile and wearable devices. the increasing adoption of 5g phones and use of high-powered cellular and wifi radios is expected to result in more stringent rf power regulations globally.
this trend is expected to contribute to increased demand for our proximity sensing platforms over the next few years as we anticipate that several countries in asia will enforce stricter sar regulations over the next two years. for q4 of fiscal year '22, we expect net revenues from our wireless and sensing product group to decrease as record results expected from our lora business are expected to be offset by seasonally lower consumer revenue.
moving on to new products and design wins. in q3, we released 23 new products and achieved a record number of new design wins of 3,792. now let me discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter of fy '22. we entered q4 with record backlog and are currently estimating q4 net revenues to be between $184 million and $194 million.
to attain the midpoint of our guidance range or approximately $189 million, we needed net terms orders of approximately 3% at the beginning of q4. we expect our q4 non-gaap earnings to be between $0.65 and $0.73 per diluted share.
i will now hand the call back to the operator. and sandy, emeka and i will be happy to answer any questions. operator?
