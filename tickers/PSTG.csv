charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
hello, everyone. thank you for joining us on our q4 earnings call today. i hope that each of you, your loved ones and colleagues are all safe and healthy. pure ended fiscal 2021 with great strength in growth, setting revenue and sales records for the quarter and for the full fiscal year. our portfolio has never been stronger. with record sales in our pure as a service offering, flashblade, flasharray//c and portworx. the completeness of our product suite accelerated sales growth in our enterprise and cloud segments in each and every theater and in our major verticals. our q4 results are a confirmation of the strength of our long-term strategy and a leading indicator of our opportunity to accelerate growth.
i am pleased to share with you today these q4 successes, our long-term strategy is to deliver a modern data experience to customers. it was gratifying that so many of our existing customers chose to significantly deepen the relationship with pure as we become an ever more critical component in their own plans for digital transformation. we also saw net new customer acquisition growth over last quarter and continued strength in enterprise. in q4, we booked eight, eight-figure deals with eight large enterprise customers. a new record. it was just two years ago that we began significant investments in our enterprise go-to-market team.
our strength in that segment this past year is proof point of the successful execution of that strategy. our ongoing commitment to marrying technological innovation with our customer-centric business model is increasingly recognized by customers and the industry. with seven years ranked as a leader, gartner's recognition this year of pure's clear leadership across both ability to execute and vision in their magic quadrant for primary storage arrays is a great validation of our strategy. and we also improved our already leading excellence in customer experience as measured through our net promoter score. for calendar 2020, pure's third-party certified nps was 83.5, our sixth year in a leadership position and the highest score among vendors measured by medallia.
one of the most important components of our growth strategy is, of course, pure's leadership team. this quarter, we welcomed ajay singh, our new chief product officer. as cpo, ajay will be responsible for our five business units and our technology alliances, and will be a key contributor to our strategy to deliver modern data services. he brings, to pure, extensive expertise in software and services to accelerate our growth into our as-a-service model and cloud-native support. our growth in q4 is proof that our ability to deliver a modern data experience is resonating with our customers.
they see the benefits of advanced technology from a trusted storage leader that supports a wide range of structured and unstructured data at scale and across any workload. but the pure value proposition goes well beyond this. the pure vision is to deliver real-time access to resilient hybrid cloud-managed storage services via code to developers and operations managers. customers desire managed data services that are dynamic and provide a cloud experience with flexible on-demand consumption. needless to say, we continue to dramatically outpace our industry in both innovation and customer delight, and i'm excited to share four reasons why customers continue to lead with pure.
first, pure delivers the simplest storage platform to operate, period. we continue to innovate with what customers appreciate, namely: seamless upgrades; cloud management; pay-as-you-go consumption models; and both traditional and cloud-native data services. this strategy is resonating with customers as validated in a weekly bond analyst report for cloud spending and adoption. their survey showed that pure leads both hyperscalers and on-premise legacy vendors in customer spending intent with an off-the-charts net score of 63%. second, we continue to see strong customer adoption of our subscription services, which include our evergreen and pure-as-a-service offerings.
only pure delivers a true enterprise-class utility with flexible storage consumption, a cloud experience on-premise, an easy path to move data to the cloud at any time and aligns spend with actual consumption. this year, we've continued to advance our subscription services platform reducing complexity by eliminating additional licenses and support costs and introducing a service catalog with transparent pricing. this quarter, our subscription services grew over 30% from one year ago. new customers for our pure-as-a-service offering included one customer over $10 million as well as u.s. customer cloud at work, maca mining services in australia and german telecom provider, broadcom. and we saw customer adoption increase across every major area of the world.
given the significant customer benefits with our subscription services, we have created enhancements to our field compensation for these offers going forward. third, last quarter, we expanded our industry-leading data services capabilities for containerized cloud-native applications with the acquisition of portworx. cloud-native databases, analytics applications and ai frameworks such as cassandra, mongodb, postgres, kafka, elasticsearch, spark and tensorflow are the tools upon which customers build their modern data pipelines. pure has been successfully serving these applications at the highest performance levels with flashblade.
and now portworx helps us expand support for these applications on any infrastructure, on-prem or in-cloud at any scale. we saw significant growth of in-cloud deployments of portworx this quarter, with particular growth through our ibm partnership, given our best-in-class support for red hat, openshift and ibm cloud pak for data. the integration of portworx onto pure has been one of the best that i have ever experienced, and we are just beginning to leverage pure's go-to-market engine to drive portworx.
and earlier this month, we expanded our market leadership with major software updates to our flagship purity software on both flashblade and flasharray to deliver enhanced performance, comprehensive ransomware protection and security, and we broadened file capabilities to serve more markets and use cases. best of all, we enabled customers to adopt these new innovations without disruption, downtime, additional cost or the requirement to rebuy new capacity. sustainability is my fourth and final point.
from our founding, pure has focused on how our products can use less energy, require less cooling, need less maintenance and take up less space in the data centers and produce less waste. in the last eight years, we estimate that pure's flasharray offering alone has saved over four billion-kilowatt hours in energy use, avoiding the greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to over seven billion miles of automobile travel. it's eliminated 96% of data center rack space when compared to legacy solutions, which is approximately 19,000 racks or over 10,000 tons of legacy geared not deployed.
with evergreen upgrades, customers continuously upgrade rather than discard their older storage equipment. avoiding the rip-and-replace required by legacy vendors and reducing waste in landfills. pure's industry-leading storage density allows customers to save on data center space and power when compared to other flash storage vendors. now with flasharray//c, customers can fit one petabyte of effective storage into roughly one rack unit, the size of a pizza box. paying for only what one consumes is the right model for customers' bottom line and rightsizing energy use and physical infrastructure, ensures that customers don't pay to cool and power excess equipment.
i'm very pleased with both the internal investments we've made over the past fiscal year and our focus on operational discipline. we made a commitment early in the covid-19 pandemic that we would continue to make strategic investments in global talent, focusing on innovation, including our acquisition of portworx, customer support and scaling the company. we dramatically reduced travel, entertainment and other operating expenses, while increasing our investments in talent and critical growth initiatives in anticipation of increasing growth this year, while continuing to deliver operating income and generating positive operating cash flows.
our employees and our charitable foundation, pure good, also stepped up investments focused on covid-19 response, food and housing in our local communities and in our workforce development initiative. continuing our thoughtful approach to operating in this new normal, we recently announced to the company that we plan to use a hybrid approach when we return to the office with most employees able to work from home part time. we believe that the hybrid office model will deliver the best combination of individual and team productivity and allow us to continue to attract and retain the best employees in the industry. i have never felt more fortunate to be at pure.
our dedicated puritans are loyal customers and our partners and suppliers all displayed incredible perseverance, creativity and positivity during the past 12 months despite the personal challenges they each faced. the effect of the covid economy on pure's business has largely played out as we predicted over this past year. first, a short acceleration of business as customers shifted to work at home and online business, then a sharp pullback as they took stock both of their business prospects and new plans for digital transformation, followed by a gradual stabilization based on the new normal.
now we look forward to a return to more significant economic growth as we expect the effects of covid will begin to diminish during our fiscal q2. i have increasing confidence that this year will be far better than last. on a macro front, i'm hopeful about the promise of increasingly plentiful and effective vaccines being distributed throughout the world. i believe that in this fiscal year, our customers will accelerate their investment in digital transformation with renewed confidence of economic recovery. they will be increasingly confident in their ability to deploy new vendors, new systems and software into new use cases and pure will be high on their list.
thank you. and now i will turn the meeting over to kevan for details on our financials.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
thank you, charlie, and good afternoon. we are very pleased with the strength of our q4 performance, which was much stronger than we planned. flashblade and flasharray//c both achieved consecutive record sales, and we continue to see strong demand with our enterprise customers who recognize the value that we are delivering. we completed a record number of deals above $10 million and also achieved record sales during the quarter to our fortune 500 customers. sales of our subscription services continue to be strong, consistent with what we have been seeing throughout the year, including one of our top deals above $10 million being pure-as-a-service.
our sales growth, excluding cancelable orders, was slightly over 9% in q4 and compared to last year, driven by strength both in the u.s. and international markets. we are also very pleased with new customer acquisitions during the quarter as 471 new customers chose one or more of our solutions. now turning to specific q4 financial results. total revenue of approximately $503 million exceeded our expectations, growing 2% year-over-year. despite a strong compare as q4 last year was not impacted by covid headwinds. subscription services revenue grew approximately 32% year-over-year and represents approximately 30% of total revenue.
as a reminder, subscription services revenue includes evergreen subscriptions and our unified pure-as-a-service subscription, which includes cloud block store. total revenue, both in the united states and international saw a slight growth compared to a strong q4 last year. our remaining performance obligations, or rpo, which includes our committed and noncancelable future revenue grew approximately 24% year-over-year. non-gaap total gross margins in q4 was 69.4%, up 30 basis points sequentially compared to 72.1% last year. product gross margins were 69.1% compared to 73.3% last year.
as you might recall, last year's product gross margins benefited from unprecedented pricing dynamics of nand. subscription services gross margins were strong at 70.2% compared to 68.1% last year. non-gaap operating profit during the quarter was approximately $36.7 million compared to $60.9 million last year. we were pleased that as we were navigating covid related headwinds, we continue to invest in the business while only slightly increasing overall operating expenses. operating income for the year was $46 million as operating expenses for the year grew less than 3%. non-gaap net income during q4 was $38.8 million, and non-gaap net income per share was $0.13.
weighted average shares used for the q4 non-gaap net earnings per share calculation was approximately 297 million shares. we ended the quarter with over $1.25 billion in cash and approximately 3,800 employees. cash flow from operations was $69 million and free cash flows was $48 million in the quarter. during q4, we repurchased a little over one million shares for approximately $23.6 million, completing our $150 million planned share repurchase program. we have also announced a new share repurchase program of up to $200 million.
now turning to guidance where we will provide some color on how we're thinking about this year as well as q1. we do not plan on updating our annual view as we progress throughout the year. for fy '22, we expect that total revenue growth will be in the range of 14% to 15%, factoring in continued growth of our subscription service offerings that will be a significant contributor to our overall performance. capitalizing on the investments we made in fy '21, we expect to grow operating income to near $90 million this year.
now moving to our q1 outlook as visibility continues to improve, and with the strength of our enterprise business and momentum of our technology platform, we are forecasting total revenue will be $405 million, growing approximately 10% from last year. consistent with our q1 seasonality, we are forecasting an operating loss of $20 million for the quarter and expect to generate positive operating income during the remainder of the year.
in conclusion, we are very pleased to end the year on a high note as our q4 performance surpassed our expectations in the midst of continued covid headwinds. we have confidence in our investments in innovation, that we believe will drive accelerated revenue growth and continued high levels of customer satisfaction while increasing shareholder value. we are excited to build on our momentum this year, capitalizing on the tremendous opportunities that we have in front of us as we expect covid headwinds to lessen during our second quarter.
with that, i will turn it over to the operator, so we can get to your questions.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from aaron rakers of wells fargo. you may now ask your question.
jake -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi, this is jake [phonetic] on for aaron. first of all, congrats on a great quarter. i was wondering if you could start out by talking a little bit about deferred revenue growth and reminding me what sits outside of deferred in rpo?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. jake, thanks for the question. let me just start because i'd like to just start the overall conversation with the fact that we really did see an excellent quarter across the board and given the strength that we've had in subscription revenues that we commented upon, as you might expect, we're seeing good growth and even greater growth in deferred than we see in actual revenues, which bodes well for the future, gives us additional confidence overall going forward. so kevan?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yes, jake, let me just add on in terms of, obviously, rpo or remaining performance obligations. when you're seeing the growth sequentially is really being driven by the momentum we're seeing in our subscription services, principally around pure-as-a-service and the unified subscription with cbs. we're seeing some strength as well on deferred revenue, and that's really in part due to the momentum overall. we're seeing both with our sales of our subscription services as well as increased momentum with the sales of our integrated solutions and appliances as well.
jake -- wells fargo -- analyst
great, thanks for that and then on another note, i was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about portworx and what you're seeing in the competitive landscape there?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
you bet. right now, portworx actually is almost the only game in town from what we can see with respect to two areas. one is sds offering for container-based storage systems that operates both on-prem and in-the-cloud and the second is the kubernetes layer on top, which allows for the orchestration and management of data services and in fact, we've recently provided additional information around what we call px-backup or portworx backup that enables customers to automate by policy, the regular backup of the storage that they've created for their container-based systems.
so it -- and really, it's the only capability that combines those two elements and we're seeing very good traction. we're seeing good traction through our channels, and we're seeing good traction directly by customers and in particular, what is especially gratifying is the fact that the -- we have a very high uptake by enterprise customers, large banks and other areas as well.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yes. i would just add to that.
jake -- wells fargo -- analyst
great.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
it's really -- that i think it's been really gratifying to see the different types of customers that are adopting import works in kubernetes. on one hand, you have literally the largest wall street banks in the world transitioning all their applications to kubernetes and using portworx to build out very large shared container environment.
on the other hand, you have, for example, some of the largest gaming customers in the world that my kids spend probably too much time with, unfortunately, where every time we log on globally, they're building more and more points of presence to host those gaming sessions, totally in the cloud, all powered by portworx and so the diversity between large on-prem as well as totally cloud-native use cases is amazing.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
still early days, of course. so -- but we're seeing good growth.
jake -- wells fargo -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
our next question comes from jason ader with william blair. you may now ask your question.
jason ader -- william blair -- analyst
yeah, thank you. charlie, can you talk about i guess, just generally, enterprise demand, which are the strongest verticals for you right now? and then what -- i guess, what surprised you in the quarter overall?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. we are seeing, as we mentioned in our remarks, really good uptake by enterprise and as you know, it's a -- while we've sold in enterprise, most of our existence, we really didn't make a major focus on it from a sales standpoint until a couple of years ago and since that time, we've had two effects that we can really call out. one is that major strengthening of sales into existing enterprise customers taking on more and more of their overall portfolio that we can fill.
and secondly, a faster uptake by new enterprise customers, and in particular, as we mentioned, our customers in the eight figures, we've had several this year that were brand-new customers that contracted with us for eight figures, one of whom was a paas -- actually, two of them through the year were paas deals and so our reputation, i think, in enterprise has been very strong, and we can expect, we think, this to continue as conditions around covid improve.
jason ader -- william blair -- analyst
and just any comments on verticals? and then what surprised you in the quarter?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. frankly, the one vertical that -- where we had been struggling a bit is now coming through for us, and that is big banks. big banks were, if you might say, more conservative in their use of new technology and new -- well, especially new vendors and we've seen an opening up of that segment for us. we're also strong in service provider and healthcare, and those have been good for us this year as well.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
i mean obviously, the cloud business continues to...
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i mean, of course, we've talked about that before. again, 30% plus of our sales into cloud customers. we call it clouds four through n, four through 1,000 and that includes companies that provide -- only provide cloud service to their customers as well as the cloud service of more traditional companies such as epic. so we're in the epic cloud.
jason ader -- william blair -- analyst
and federal, any quick one on that?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, federal is still not an area of strength for us, to be honest. that's an area where we are making some changes and looking to make improvement.
jason ader -- william blair -- analyst
all right, thank you.
operator
your next question comes from alex kurtz of keybanc. you may now ask your question.
alex kurtz -- keybanc -- analyst
thanks and congrats on the good quarter, guys. just on rpo and thinking about what the right metrics are for measuring the business, given the move to pure-as-a-service and cloud block store, is that really how we should be thinking about the growth rate going forward. i'd just like to hear your thoughts on how you guys look at the growth of the business outside of reported revenue growth.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yes, alex, this is kevan. a couple of things that we look at in share. obviously, the bookings outpacing revenue is one metric that we look at and we were at 9% year-over-year growth on sales, which is outpacing revenue, really, in large part, given the continued momentum we're seeing in our subscription services.
if you break that down a bit more, when we're looking at the unbilled component of rpo and the strength there, that's primarily driven by our pure-as-a-service offering and then deferred revenue is really supported by the continued momentum we're seeing around our evergreen offering as well as the incremental momentum we're seeing in sales of our appliances, which includes the evergreen support as well and subscription. so that's kind of how we're thinking about it and seeing good strength and momentum across the board there.
alex kurtz -- keybanc -- analyst
charlie, would you add anything there? because if the future of the company is increasingly going to be pure-as-a-service, shouldn't rpo be kind of at the center of the discussion around what the growth rate of the business is?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
on a longer-term basis, there are going to be other metrics. rpo certainly one of them, such as acv and net new. we've talked about this in the past. we think we need to get to a certain critical mass before we can -- before we think it makes sense to start to identify those on a regular basis. but increasingly, as subscription becomes a larger and larger part of what we do, yes, we're going to need to release more information along those lines to investors.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yes and alex, we'll take a look at that as we go through this year. we do plan on having an analyst day this year, and we'll land on a date and obviously, we'll look at some other metrics. it will give you a good read in terms of our overall subscription business. because for me, it's far beyond just pure-as-a-service, which is great, but our evergreen and portworx are layered nicely into that as well, obviously.
alex kurtz -- keybanc -- analyst
yeah, thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of karl ackerman with cowen. you may now ask your question.
karl ackerman -- cowen -- analyst
yes, good afternoon gentlemen. kevan, could you discuss the linearity of opex leverage for fiscal '22? i ask because the $20 million loss in q1 appears a little bit larger-than-normal seasonality, but yet, the full year outlook for operating margin of $90 million, well, it implies the best operating margin on record. so i guess, maybe specifically, could you discuss the investments you are making in portworx that might explain the outlook for q1?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yes. i think -- yes, good question, karl and then i think the first thing i'd start out with is with q1, you typically have this seasonality. that is our seasonally lowest quarter in terms of revenue. that's pretty consistent and so we were benefited if you look at the compare in q1 of last year on a couple of different areas. one was really around the fact that we did do some realignment with our workforce and took a benefit in q1 last year. when i think about what we're looking at in q1, that might be a little bit different on the opex front. certainly, some strength around our sales of our subscription services. so we do have more comp coming through as a result over time because of the subscription services.
so we're dealing with that a little bit in q1. but to your point, seeing a lot of strength post q1 in terms of what we see in returning to operating profitability and to your point, really happy with the fact that we're looking at almost $90 million of profitability for the year and really, what we're doing is capitalizing on the investments we made really through this covid environment, and we saw some early indicators of that return in q4, expect that to carry forward as we continue through the rest of the year. so hopefully, that helps you out, karl.
karl ackerman -- cowen -- analyst
yes, it does, kevan. thank you. maybe a question for charlie. earlier today, seagate spoke about how data growth is going to double every three years. while it would appear that most of these data will continue to be stored on high capacity disk in the areal density improvement shown from hev road maps. your flasharray//c addresses very well. i think the demand for low cost, fast storage across multi-tenant environments. and so first, do you think flasharray//c will remain the largest driver for you over the next two or three years? second, now that flasharray//c appears to be more than 10% of revenue, is there a way to frame the tam or growth opportunity of your flashray offering? thank you.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. no, it's a great question. we do think -- we had regularly given out tam numbers before. we think flasharray//c fits within the tam numbers that we had identified previously. it just opens up more of that market to us from a serviceable portion. but flasharray//c continues to be, first of all, the fastest new product we've ever introduced.
secondly, the only product of its class that can compete from a purely a price standpoint with hybrid dick arrays and third and to your point, the price of qlc and the price of -- and what we're able to do with it foresee shows that flash continues to decrease on a per bit basis, faster than magnetic and what that means is that as those costs converge, we're going to see more and more of the magnetic market move over to flash. it opens up the opportunity for us, given our first-mover advantage in that secondary tier of storage with flasharray//c, we think we're in the best position to continue to take advantage of that.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yes and the only thing i would add to that is there was some great analyst commentary just this last quarter about how we're a couple of years off from that complete convergence, but that commentary misses the benefit of data reduction and so today, we actually deliver the value that folks think are years away of being able to replace disk in the data center completely with flash and i think it's the crystal larity of our founding and vision of pure 10 years ago to look at flash as something that would really be the dominant storage technology in the data center to deliver the all-flash data center. it seemed like a pipe dream 10 years ago, but those are the exact kind of deals we're doing today for customers, bringing together the strength of flasharray, flashblade and flasharray//c to go after every use case in the data center.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
and just to finish your question, which has to do with the flasharray//c versus everything else. it's a great new product, and we expect great things of it. i also expect great things from flashblade and from portworx. they're all in large growth segments of the market. it's certainly true that the secondary tier market has been immune to the economics of flash up until now and it's equal in size and opportunity to the primary tier market that we've already taken advantage of. so yes, we think it's going to be a great opportunity for us, but not the only one.
karl ackerman -- cowen -- analyst
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from rod hall of goldman sachs. you may now ask your question.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great, thank you. so i wanted to ask you, i wanted to go back to these eight large enterprise deals that you guys called out and see if maybe you could talk a little bit about the competitive situation there. was there any particular competitor you were displacing there? any particular use case that's resonating with people. i just wonder if you could dig into those deals a little bit more and help us understand how you won those, and then i've got a follow-up.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
absolutely. well, it was a mixture of new and existing customers, mostly existing customers. certainly, a mixture of portfolio of the verticals, big banks, cloud and traditional -- more traditional enterprise companies. i would say that on average, as i think across all eight of them, it shook out pretty similarly to our average competitive portfolio that is to say, mostly dell, but certainly, netapp, a very big win in -- up against netapp and primarily those two vendors, i would say.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay, great and then i wanted to follow-up on the supply shortages that are out there and expectations that nand pricing is going to go up later in the year. i wonder if you maybe can wrap those two questions into one answer. do you expect supply shortages to be a problem? and are you factoring that into your thinking and how you're factoring it in? and then what does nand do to your economics later in the year? thanks.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
you bet. so as you may recall, we are -- we have a very strong supply chain. we were unaffected, and of course, our supply chain team was very busy but we -- our customers were completely unaffected at the beginning of last year when covid hit we have some of the best lead times in the business overall. as we look going forward, yes, we do expect nand pricing to stabilize, if not to get a bit stronger, that is a bit higher in the next couple of quarters.
we think demand has picked up and supplies are a bit constrained, but we don't expect any shortages. there have also been reports, of course, of other semiconductor shortages, we're on top of that, we don't expect to see any, although certainly, lead times are starting to lengthen, but we're taking appropriate action there overall. there was another part of the question was -- i think that was it. so we...
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
i mean, on nand, the margin impact, just remind us if you would expect any kind of...
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
we don't expect much of a change in margins due to -- nand is fairly well-behaved from the way we look at things. right now, and therefore, we don't really expect much change in margin due to nand pricing.
operator
your next question comes from tim long of barclays. you may now ask your question.
tim long -- barclays -- analyst
thank you. just two, if i could, just following on those -- the big deals. could you just talk a little bit about -- obviously, it was a great quarter to talk a little bit about the pipeline for the large deals looks? and anything on the complexion there? and then second, can you -- charlie, can you touch a little bit on the commercial vertical? obviously, cloud and enterprise were called strong. so maybe just walk us through what's going on there. i'm sure it's a lot of macro, but kind of the outlook for some recovery in that vertical?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
let me take that second part, and then i'll hand it over to kevan. so we continue to see weakness in commercial, although i would say we saw serial strengthening of that. or sequential, i should say. strengthening of commercial. but frankly, it's still suffering, and it's one of the areas that as covid subsides, we hope to see improve. there are some early signs that, that might be the case. but clearly, the mid-market has suffered much more than the large enterprise overall on average. our expectation, what we've built into our planning is that we should see because of the -- both the summer months and hopefully, some effect of the vaccine.
we should see a dissipation of the covid effects in the middle or somewhere in our q2 and that's our forecast sort of is based on a lessening of covid effect both in the commercial market as well as in enterprise generally. but yes, no, commercial mid-market is still suffering, but we're seeing some light at the end of the tunnel, and we're hoping that as covid subsides, we're going to see that improve.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
and then just adding a little bit of light in terms of -- around our guide for q1 in annual in correlation with the big deals that we were really pleased to see in q4. look, i mean, we've got plenty of opportunities that we're looking at and working with customers on that we're hopeful. we'll continue to pace as we progress through next year, including these large deals we saw in q4 and building on that, but when we think about the opportunity set, it's really broader as we think about next year.
subscription services continues to have great momentum, and that's building for us and then obviously, that helps out with a little bit more certainty in terms of how that rolls out into revenue. so that's great for us to see. as we see build of our opportunities, we see some nice build out further beyond q1, which is nice in terms of our guide for the annual year. so we've got some good confidence on that. but it's broad-based and not completely focused, if you will, on the big deals, which we're always pleased to get.
tim long -- barclays -- analyst
thank you.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yeah.

your next question comes from erik suppiger of jmp securities. you may now ask your question.
erik suppiger -- jmp securities -- analyst
yes. i'll proceed in the question. first off, i'd just be interested to hear, as you look out to the pandemic dissipating, how do you think that would materialize? what will change for you? is it more just being able to engage personally with the customer? or where do you think the most notable changes will take place?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. we thought about this a lot. i think the most noticeable change will actually be customers being willing to start to reenter the office and why is that? well, we depend a lot on -- as a company on two things. one is commercial, as we talked about, but the second one is customers willing to take on new products or put products into new use cases and we're largely still an on-prem vendor and their willingness to do so is enhanced tremendously when they can go into the office.
you might imagine that using a new product in a new workload is something that customers are -- can be concerned about and when they're able to go into the office and address things, if something goes wrong, they feel much more comfortable being able to do that. so our dependence on both commercial and net new logos depends on customers feeling more comfortable to go into the office. so that's really what we're going to be looking at. now it doesn't require 90% of their team to be able to go in the office, just their technology team to be -- to feel comfortable going to the office, trying new things. so that's what we will be looking at.
erik suppiger -- jmp securities -- analyst
okay, that's very helpful. you don't break the south, but can you talk a little bit about what portion of your customer base buys across the different product categories, flashblade, flasharray and maybe paas? or do you look at your cross-sell metrics? anything you can share on that front?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
we do look at cross-sell metrics and it's quite interesting. it's -- if we look at flashblade, for instance, it's roughly 50% of our sales will go into an existing flasharray customer, an existing customer and half will go into a brand-new customer as well. i would say portworx is a bit too early. flasharray//c tends to be a majority new customer -- sorry, existing customer, but we do have brand-new customers for flasharray//c as well. so it's a good balance. if i had to put an overall percentage on it would be about 50-50, but it depends on the product.
erik suppiger -- jmp securities -- analyst
what about the -- pure-as-a-service?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
that's very interesting. we've had a very high percentage of net new customers on pure-as-a-service. it really has allowed us to enter new customers with a unique value proposition where we might not have been given a chance before.
erik suppiger -- jmp securities -- analyst
okay, very good. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from pinjalim bora of jpmorgan. you may now ask your question.
pinjalim bora -- jpmorgan -- analyst
great, hey. thank you guys and congrats on the quarter. charlie, given that this is the first fiscal year for dominick to producing pressure on the sales or and its processes. could you talk about any material changes that you're thinking or you have already put in place going into the new fiscal year in terms of comp changes or incentive structure changes.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, absolutely. well, we've consolidated our overlay sales operations now into a single overlay and that's going to allow us to really treat which is going to be a highly technical sales and se operation and that really allows us to balance, if you will, new products, while at the same time, transitioning the more mature new products into the core sales, the mainstream sales operation. so that's been a significant change.
of course, we've made -- as we do every year, we've made changes to the compensation program, not -- and i want to be clear, not major changes, but balancing all of our -- balancing all of the products and the intentions that we have for this year, making sure that we have incentives, as we talked about before, as i talked about in my prepared remarks for pure-as-a-service, but also for portworx going forward.
i think dominick's understanding of how to sell an enterprise and how to sell, in particular, software and service offerings has really modified the way we've thought about that and, therefore, allowed us to change and in many ways, simplify our compensation program to really focus on the elements that are important, while at the same time, making everything else mainstream and to make sure that our sales force really has the the training, the knowledge and the skills to sell our entire portfolio.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
and i'd just add, just in terms of, charlie, on the field compensation and what dom and yourself are doing it, really extends to evergreen gold subscription. we're really trying to make sure that the field is promoting that, given the value proposition there. pure-as-a-service, cloud block store, and portworx as well as flashblade. so we've continued to highlight flashblade. we've gotten wonderful momentum with flashblade in that offering and use cases, and that will continue as we look out to next year.
pinjalim bora -- jpmorgan -- analyst
understood. helpful and just a follow-up, maybe charlie or kevan, any one of you can take this, but when i look at the guidance, seems pretty solid, but when i look at the range, maybe it's a little bit wider than usual. so trying to understand how would you peg the environment going forward? would you say it is back to normal? is there -- i mean, the shape of the year, would it be more in the second half ramp versus the first half? help us understand that.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yes snd i'll start with that tactically and let charlie add on to it, but i think you're thinking about that right, right? so we're looking at probably in the q2 time frame, really to start to see noticeable diminishing effects, if you will, of covid. and we've built that into how we're thinking about the entire year and so that is playing into it. so obviously, second half, we are looking for some incremental momentum in terms of how we're thinking about our annual outlook. charlie, do you have anything else you want to add on that?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. no, i think that's correct. the only -- the uncertainty we face is, was it the beginning of q2, is it the end of q2? and what does the end of -- what is the fall of the year look like from a covid standpoint? but our belief is that it will continue to improve throughout the year second half -- and obviously, the comparison -- this coming year are going to be wonky as well, given covid last year. but that being said, we feel fairly good about the guide that we've -- about the forecast that we have.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yes. i'd just add on a little bit more in terms of, obviously, the momentum that we've seen this year and expect to continue next year in terms of outperformance on our subscription services. that gives us a little bit more predictability in terms of how things will fall. we've got really solid growth drivers, as we've talked about with flashblade and flasharray//c. we do expect continued momentum with enterprise and as charlie mentioned, it's really looking at the commercial and mid-market recovery, really second half, post covid, if you will.
pinjalim bora -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. thank you very much.
operator
your next question comes from simon leopold with raymond james. you may now ask your question.
simon leopold -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. charlie, i think my question really goes back to your comment about the trend being a little bit wonky in that we've got a relatively -- or very easy comparison to the pandemic. so i'm wondering if you could give us some idea of what you see as the maybe normalized growth rate on a year-over-year basis, if there is some way to adjust for what the effect of the pandemic has been and what you think your growth should be?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. well, definitely safely within the double-digit range. certainly, as you might recall, this time last year, we were projecting a 20% growth rate. i have no reason to believe why that wouldn't have been the growth rate going forward. but as it is, we're going to be facing at least four to five months of this calendar year, still with a strong covid effect, and it's hard to say exactly how long that will be. so i hope that gives you some semblance of where we would expect to be.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yes. yes, i would add on to that for the quarter for q1 of last year. that would be a strong compare. obviously, when covid set in for us, that was later in the quarter and so we had a strong start to last quarter as well as the fact that we had some tailwinds as folks were working through some technical debt to respond to covid. so i'd actually view q1 last year as a strong compare, but it's a fair statement for the full year.
simon leopold -- raymond james -- analyst
great and then in line of sort of the idea that there's recovery and some return to normal, what is your thinking in terms of your operating expense budget where you might be introducing or reintroducing travel expenses and things like that. have you made some assumption for the timing and impact? and is that incorporated into this operating income for the full year that you've considered? or do you think that happens later?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
it's -- you're thinking about this exactly right. we're going to feather that in. it's incorporated into our guide. clearly, we've taken, this past year, we've taken t&e and put it into headcount, if you want to put it that way, into investment. as we go forward -- travel is not going to start-up like a light switch. it's going to take time to build up. customers will have their own pace by which they will want to physically meet and get together.
so we're going to be cautious. i don't even want travel and entertainment to get up to the same level it was pre covid. but at the same time, our expectation is that expenses will grow slower than revenue and that's on a total basis. so by definition, since we've pre invested, if you will, into headcount, it will mean an even slower growth in the area of travel and entertainment.
operator
and your next question comes from katy huberty of morgan stanley. you may now ask your question.
katy huberty -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you for the question. the $10 million subscription deal was particularly impressive in the quarter. can you just talk about what you think is driving underlying adoption of pure-as-a-service. is covid a factor as companies focused on cash preservation? or is this much more of a sustained shift in how customers are thinking about buying product on-prem? and then i have a follow-up.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you for the question. the $10 million subscription deal was particularly impressive in the quarter. can you just talk about what you think is driving underlying adoption of pure-as-a-service. is covid a factor as companies focused on cash preservation? or is this much more of a sustained shift in how customers are thinking about buying product on-prem? and then i have a follow-up.
katy huberty -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that makes sense.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
i would also just add to that real quick, katy, that we really view this as a product innovation strategy as much as a business model and it's one that i think when you look at what we're offering compared to the kind of financing options, many of our competitors offer, it really allows us to differentiate our experience with customers. we're delivering a cloud-like experience that bridges on-prem and actual deployment in the cloud that's unified subscription and another interesting thing we did this last quarter was open up the services catalog. so we are providing transparent pricing, where a customer can go in and see exactly what storage costs and subscribe to it, and we've seen the first transactions come through that in an automated fashion.
katy huberty -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great and charlie, i want to come back to an earlier question, somebody asked about large deal pipeline. can you just talk about the broader pipeline exiting january, what that looked like versus october? and have you already started to see improved conversion and close rates even in the commercial market?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
we've seen in the commercial market, as i've mentioned, is improving somewhat, but still far below where we had exited last year, for instance. we're seeing better conversions on the enterprise side of things and so that's -- gives us hope and in general, i'd say, certainly compared to a year ago, increased amount of enterprise and large enterprise, much larger fraction of large deal activity. i hope that gives you some color.
operator
your next question comes from amit daryanani of evercore. you may now ask your question.
irvin liu -- evercore -- analyst
hi, this is irvin liu dialing in for amit. i jumped on the call a bit late. so forgive me if this was addressed. can you help us better understand some of the assumptions that are embedded in your 14% to 15% revenue growth outlook for fiscal '22? just any thoughts on product versus support revenue trajectories would be helpful. just trying to parse this out. thanks.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yes. i'll start, and then i'll let charlie jump in. but obviously, what we've been chatting about is terrific momentum with subscription services that we've seen really throughout the entire year. we fully expect to build on that as we look out to next year and that's really being driven by our evergreen subscription by pure-as-a-service, unified subscription with cloud block store and portworx. so again, i'd say business as usual with continued momentum there. i think on the product side, what you've seen is a modest improvement in q4 in terms of where we're landing from that perspective.
we expect to build on that. you'll see some improvement in terms of how we look at that for q1 and then obviously, we would expect to get back to growth on product revenue as well as we go throughout the year in terms of how we're thinking about it. the growth drivers really will continue to be enterprise as well as flashblade, flasharray//c, and then we fully expect, to charlie's point, after or as covid diminishes to get further recovery from our commercial business and building upon our strength that we saw in q4 on net new logo. charlie, would you add anything else there?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think, kevan, you handled most of it. i would just say that we do expect product growth that is traditional capex product growth to increase, albeit we expect subscription growth to outpace the capital equipment growth on a going-forward basis.
operator
this concludes the question-and-answer session. at this time, i will turn the call back over to charlie giancarlo for closing remarks.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you. in closing, i'd like to thank you all, and thank all of our employees, our customers and our partners for all of their support through this past year. despite it all, pure has accomplished a great deal, both in terms of the innovation in our products as well as our market penetration and even with all of the uncertainty around the exact timing of the recovery from this pandemic, we're confident in our vision, our strategy and our team's ability to grow and to scale pure. i want to thank you all for joining us today. goodbye.

operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen. thank you for standing by and welcome to the pure storage first quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings release conference call. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. at the conclusion of our prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions]. as a reminder, this call is being recorded.
i would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, mr. sanjot khurana. please go ahead.
sanjot khurana -- vice president of investor relations
thank you and good afternoon. welcome to the pure storage first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call. my name is sanjot khurana, vice president of investor relations at pure storage. joining me today are our ceo, charlie giancarlo; our cfo, kevan krysler; and our vice president and chief architect, rob lee.

with that, i will turn the call over to our ceo, charlie giancarlo.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. i hope you and your loved ones are healthy and looking forward to better days ahead as summer begins, vaccination rates increase and the beginning of the end of covid restrictions in many parts of the world comes into view. our hearts go out to our friends in india and other countries still suffering from the scourge and we pray that they will soon recover.
pure delivered very strong results in q1. we drove double-digit growth against a strong comparison with q1 of last year. i'm also happy to report that our strong quarter was broad-based, with balanced contributions across every aspect of our business. we continue to see enterprise expansion validating our investment in world-class enterprise products, services and our go-to-market teams over the past two years. in this quarter, we also saw our commercial segment strengthen its contribution, particularly in customer acquisitions, where we increased net new customers year-over-year.
our us and our international teams, both achieved double-digit year-over-year growth this quarter and our new products again saw a significant annual growth. our industry-leading subscription business saw fantastic growth, up 35% over the same quarter last year. pure's unique evergreen and as-a-service models, continue to resonate strongly with customers and differentiate us from the rest of the industry. competitors are attempting to recreate our capabilities through financing, marketing and professional services, but cannot change their legacy systems to match our non-disruptive upgrades, api management or remote operations and support. pure has doubled the number of partners selling pure as-a-service year-over-year and our channel partner bookings are growing nicely. and, we recently announced new incentives and offerings to enhance subscription sales through our channel partners to build on this momentum.
our operating profit exceeded expectations this quarter, reflecting our revenue over performance, paired with prudent expense management. the strong growth this quarter was achieved during continued covid restrictions and is based mostly on improvements in our operations and our customers' increasing confidence in our brand.
we have been reasonably accurate in our predictions of our business environment since the pandemic started. i feel confident that as vaccination rates increased globally and our markets return to some semblance of normal office culture, that our business momentum will increase even further. this month we kicked off our annual accelerate digital event and so far, we have connected with more than 17,000 attendees, a new record for attendance, 60% higher than last year. the significant annual increase in customer, prospect and partner participation at our accelerate conference is an indicator of how strongly our modern data experience strategy is resonating in the market. we reiterated our vision of pure's modern data experience and showed how leading organizations like aegis sciences, nasa and roblox are using pure's data platform to modernize their infrastructure, modernize their operations and modernize their business applications.
we announced updates to the pure1 digital experience, our cloud-based management platform for all of pure's products and services and we released the latest version of portworx enterprise. we also provided greater details on our bare metal as-a-service solution with equinix and our newest purity software enhancements. all of these new capabilities and more will continue to be featured in workshops throughout the entire month-long accelerate event. customers have shown excitement for our promise of leading-edge automated infrastructure that is continually improving without disruption.
pure's modern data experience delivers modern infrastructure that enables modern operations, supporting the needs of modern business applications. we believe that these three steps are fundamental in every company's digital transformation journey and are made possible by pure's modern data experience. the first component of our modern data experience is enabling our customers to modernize their infrastructure. our modern data infrastructure provides easy to deploy, reliable services, manageable by it and developers alike, through apis and code. we provide common services, interfaces and management across on-prem and cloud and with pure as-a-service, we provide customers a single unified contract across clouds. customers can operate, both existing business-critical applications and next-generation cloud-native applications, in a hybrid cloud environment.
our founding vision of the all-flash data center is being further realized with pure's flasharray//c, the first all-qlc flash array that pushes flash to a new tier of workloads, where our competitors are stuck competing with disk. flasharray//c saw double-digit growth this quarter and continues to be our fastest growing new product ever. just last week, pure's flasharray family was recognized as a gartner peer insights customers' choice.
you don't need to be in technology to know that data insecurity is not only a nuisance, but matter of national security. in the last few years, we brought industry-leading data protection to our entire portfolio, allowing enterprises to protect their data from ransomware with the ability to restore from protected copies within hours of a breach. customers like be the match, which is operated by the national bone marrow donor program have chosen pure flasharray//x and flashblade platforms with safe mode data protection and rapid restore capabilities, to protect their mission-critical data in the event of a breach. meadville medical center in pennsylvania is another customer who subscribes to pure as-a-service, with safe mode, so that if they ever need a safe mode snapshot to recover their data, they know that they can be back online within hours. we launched a new safe mode dashboard in pure1 this quarter, which provides a consolidated view of the ransomware protection of all pure arrays in a customers' fleet, delivering peace of mind, that an organization's data franchise is protected by this extra layer of ransomware protection.
pure's unique evergreen capability is the cornerstone of a modern infrastructure, with the ability to continually update technology and services without disruption to a customer's environment. in fact, 98% of our arrays that were deployed over five years ago are not only still in use, but have been modernized in many cases to our most recent models. our systems like most cloud services, are upgraded to the most modern technology, consistently non-disruptively and transparently to the application. our purity software, evergreen model and pure1 management system uniquely position pure to deliver a true as-a-service modern infrastructure experience to our customers.
the second component of our modern data experience is modernizing operations. after all, the value of modern infrastructure is deeply diminished if you operate it with yesterday's manual processes. modern ops mean standardizing service offerings and making them available to the organization via a service catalog and apis. doing that delivers devops, data science teams and application developers, the storage as code experience they have come to expect. pure as-a-service is a key element of our strategy for modern ops.
pure as-a-service continues to be the industry's storage as-a-service benchmark and we're very pleased with its growth this quarter. launched in 2018, it unifies block, file and object storage across all tiers and performance and private and public clouds into a unified data storage subscription and is the foundation of a true hybrid cloud experience. customers such as the city of denver use pure as-a-service to automate data management. they use pure to monitor and deliver performance upgrades and even variable capacity for seasonal events like elections. with the flexibility of pure's cloud block store, for both aws and azure, as an option in their pure as-a-service subscription, we are seeing strong interest from companies who want to simplify their data architecture with a proven solution, while reaping the benefits of both, private and hyperscaler clouds. pure as-a-service is differentiated not only by the inherent agility of the evergreen architecture, but also by the as-a-service user experience we deliver via pure1, our meta ai engine and our proactive support experience.
pure1 has now broadened its predictive fault analysis and resolution, using telemetry gathered from across pure's ecosystem, including bare metal, vms and containers. our expanded ai-driven workload planner can now suggest the right service tier for pure as-a-service subscriptions or infrastructure purchases. the pure1 service catalog was expanded this quarter, so customers can easily add, upgrade, suspend, resume, limit and renew pure as-a-service capabilities as needed. these saas tools work together to give customers the insight and intelligence they need to confidently make storage subscription decisions.
the investments we've made to modernize infrastructure and operations supports our customers' desire to develop truly modern applications, which is the third pillar of the modern data experience. modernizing applications leverages cloud-native architectures, specifically containers and kubernetes, to take advantage of more efficient computing, new programing models, hybrid cloud architectures and new capabilities, like real-time analytics and data streaming. the latest version of portworx enterprise announced that accelerate gives customers an automated kubernetes native storage experience for container-based applications, wherever they live. portworx enterprise now delivers deeper integration across the pure family, fully enabling both flasharray and flashblade for enterprise scale and resiliency in production environments. it utilizes pure1 for enhanced observability and proactive support and complete provisioning automation on all pure systems. customers are using portworx to enable containerized workloads to run seamlessly across the cloud, including pure storage arrays, bare metal infrastructure and even third-party storage solutions. just three quarters since acquisition, we have fully combined portworx and pure products into the integrated, simple and evergreen platform that pure is known for.
as the number and range of modern applications increases and the volume of unstructured data increases, organizations are reducing the complexity of their data architecture with fast object storage, where pure's flashblade remains the market leader. at nearly $1 billion in cumulative sales, it is the preferred choice for customers needing a unified fast, file and object platform for their modern business applications. in fact, flashblade is a leader in gigaom's new radar for high-performance object storage, validating pure as the pioneer in the fast object space.
overall, our product and market leadership is expanding. we continue to deliver the industry's most advanced platforms, greatest reliability and total cost of ownership with the most innovative service models. altogether, we are well on our way to delivering a complete modern data experience to customers worldwide.
i'll now turn the call over to our cfo, kevan krysler for a deeper look at the numbers. kevan?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
thank you, charlie and good afternoon. we are very pleased with the broad-based strength of our q1 results and continued momentum.
we delivered double-digit revenue growth despite both a tough compare, as well as continued uncertainty of covid-19 and its influence on markets across the globe. our sales growth, excluding cancelable orders also reflected strength, growing 13% compared to last year. our remaining performance obligations or rpo, which includes our committed and non-cancelable future revenue is slightly over $1.1 billion, growing sequentially 24% year-over-year.
in particular, what was most impressive about our performance this quarter was the strength across our entire business. double-digit sales growth from our key geos; strong contribution from our channel partners; performance across our entire product and solution portfolio including flasharray//c and growth from both our existing and new customers, including our commercial business. we were very pleased with the strength we saw in new customer acquisition, which grew 15% year-over-year, also driven in part, by our commercial business.
now turning to specific financial results for the quarter. total revenue grew 12% to approximately $413 million. international revenue grew 14%, while revenue in the united states grew 12% compared to last year. again, consistent with what we saw throughout last year, sales of our subscription services continue to reflect momentum. subscription services revenue grew approximately 35% year-over-year, and represents approximately 39% of total revenue. non-gaap total gross margins continue to reflect the differentiated value of our software and solutions, improving sequentially to 70.5% in the quarter and continues to be on the high-end of our long-term expectations. non-gaap product gross margins were 70.2% and non-gaap subscription services margins were 71.1%. subscription services margins improved both sequentially and year-over-year. product gross margins improved slightly sequentially and were 73.3% in q1 of last year. product gross margins this quarter reflect both accelerated growth of our flasharray//c and increasing supply chain costs required to secure product for our customers.
we achieved slightly positive non-gaap operating profit during the quarter, which outperformed our expectation. contributing factors include, revenue outperformance, lower expenses due to the covid environment, including less travel and physical marketing events, as well as lower-than-planned hiring.
we ended the quarter with over $1.23 billion in cash, and approximately 3,800 employees. cash flow from operations was $21 million and capital expenditures were $28 million during the quarter. capital expenditures during the quarter included a higher mix invested in our pure as-a-service infrastructure. we returned approximately $30 million of capital to repurchase slightly over 1.38 million shares as part of our $200 million share repurchase program.
now turning to guidance. as previously mentioned, we are very pleased with our steadily increasing momentum over the last two quarters, while continuing to navigate the various challenges created by covid-19. we expect the challenges created by covid-19 will continue to recede, as we progress throughout the year and that our momentum will continue. q2 revenue is expected to be approximately $470 million, representing double-digit growth of 16%. we also expect non-gaap operating profit will be approximately $15 million.
as i mentioned last quarter, we will be guiding one quarter at a time and will not be updating our annual view, but we will provide some additional color on how we are thinking about the impact of our q1 over-achievement for both revenue and operating income. we expect that revenue over-achievement will be accretive to our annual view, primarily due to increasing supply chain related costs that we anticipate, we expect that approximately half of our operating income overachievement during the quarter, will be accretive to our annual view. we are excited to build upon our broad-based momentum in q1, by continuing to create best-in-class outcomes, services and experiences for our partners and customers.
with that, i will turn it over to the operator, so we can get to your questions.
",":
operator
thank you, ladies and gentlemen. [operator instructions]. your first question comes from the line of karl ackerman with cowen.
karl ackerman -- cowen and company -- analyst
yes, thank you. good afternoon. two questions if i may. with regard to your current outlook, kevan, i was hoping maybe you could tell us regarding exabyte growth. i guess what could you tell us regarding exabyte growth per box, from your hardware business. i ask because in the context of the nand market, that is seeing bit growth increase at a roughly 30% clip. the all-flash array revenue is flattish on a year-over-year basis, but component pricing seems to have bottomed and i'm wondering whether maybe some of the deflationary pressures from on-prem enterprise spend still recovering abates going into the second half of the year. and then if you could speak to anything regarding the capacity points per array, as we think about that growth in exabytes in the second half of the year as well.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. karl, this is charlie. let me start on that. well, kevan, i think pulls together some of the stats on that. overall, i would say that our overall flat -- there has been overall growth in our flasharray product line, counting both flasharray//x and flasharray//c and we're really pleased to see that growth for that product line continue. and i have to say that that i remain very bullish that we'll continue to see growth in that product line, in addition of course to flashblade and portworx, all of which are seeing strong growth overall. and then if you count in along with that, the growth that we're seeing in subscriptions and paas, in particular, which does not show up immediately on the top line, because of the accounting for subscription basis. we are seeing good growth overall.
and i'll just comment for a moment on the supply chain side on the nand. first is, you're correct. we probably will not see, although we entered the year, that is the calendar year with some deflationary pressure initially, through the remainder of the year, you're exactly correct, it's unlikely to see any downward pricing in nand and actually likely to see some upward pricing on the raw nand as we go forward and that'll be overall industry affecting. and of course because most of our sales are very competitive in nature, we also saw a slight increase in asps and i would expect asps to hold reasonably steady plus or minus through the year overall. so i think you're correct. we're not going to see a lot of deflationary pressure this year. yeah. and i agree. charlie and i think one of the thing i would add is, the inflationary pressure is just broader than nand as well. so we're seeing it across the supply chain, but again that's been considered in terms of how we're thinking about our q2 guide and that's why in the prepared remarks, i commented that about half of our over-achievement for operating profit would be viewed as incremental to our annual guide. and then finally on the exabyte, we'll definitely ship more exabytes this year than we did last year for sure. in terms of average, i think we're cautiously optimistic that the average will go up, but spending tends to -- and i'm expecting that overall spending for data storage this year will also increase for the market as a whole. so i hope that provides you some indication.
karl ackerman -- cowen and company -- analyst
that does, i appreciate that gentlemen. for my follow-up, in your prepared remarks, you spoke about how pure cloud block store is now ga at aws and azure, and so i'm curious whether you'll be breaking out this business like one of your primary peers and maybe jumping the gun a little bit, but any thoughts on when this may reach $100 million annual run rate? thank you.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. karl, let me just hit the first point on cloud block store and how that combines really nicely with our unified subscription of pure as-a-service and that's really why i think we're seeing a lot of continued demand and momentum with pure as-a-service and we're quite excited about cloud block store on azure.
and rob, do you have some comments on that? it'd be great to share some thoughts on cloud block store with azure.
robert lee -- vice president and chief architect
yeah, absolutely. we're super excited just to see the continued growth in the overall cloud portfolio. cloud block store key component for the modern -- the traditional applications and now expanding from aws to azure, we see that is adding just a ton of value to the unified subscription. as an example, one of the large fsi customer this quarter who is undergoing a tremendous growth in their business, struggling to keep up on their legacy gear, brought pure in under the unified subscription and was able to get immediate performance, capacity and elasticity benefits on-prem as well as utilize cloud block store on azure to move their disaster recovery environment over to the cloud. and so i think that flexibility and the elasticity we're able to deliver just goes to speak to the benefits of the software subscription, the software approach and just the overall unified subscription through which we deliver the cloud products.
karl ackerman -- cowen and company -- analyst

your next question comes from sidney ho of deutsche bank.
sidney ho -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. my first question is on the gross margin. clearly, you guys are doing very well there, over 70% and continue to be higher than the high end of your target range, should we expect gross margin to stay at these higher levels, considering subscription services revenue will likely grow faster than product revenue? i think you guys talked about some inflationary pressure there or really does it depend on what type of service is driving the growth or are there other considerations to think about?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
no, i think that's a great question and i think the inflationary pressure we're seeing, really more lends itself to product gross margins. but again, we are very pleased with what we saw coming out of the quarter, really with strong gross margins throughout, both on the product and subscription side and to your point, above kind of a high-end of our expectations. and now as we progress through the year, on the product gross margin side, we would expect to see some pressure on product gross margins due to what we're seeing on the supply chain, but again we've accounted for that in terms of our q2 guide and in my prepared remarks around the annual view.
sidney ho -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. maybe a follow-up question is on the enterprise side of things. you guys have been highlighting the strength in the enterprise business last quarter, this quarter, but the data points in general in the market hasn't been -- i would say it's kind of mixed -- some semiconductor companies would say it's still kind of weak, maybe just starting to get better. can you talk about why you are seeing things differently and if the overall market does start to improve in the second half, do you think your enterprise business will also accelerate along with the market, just of a higher starting point?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
the answer to both is, yes. the reason why we're seeing such good overall expansion of our enterprise businesses is because of the investments we made as a company. remember, just two or three years ago, we were largely a commercial company with some deployments in enterprise. we made major investments both in products as well as our go-to-market team to really become a brand that would be respected by a broader set and really by the enterprise customer environment at large. and i think we've achieved that from a brand perspective, but we're still early in many ways in our expansion into enterprise. so i expect that expansion, which is not secular specific to the investments that we made to continue. so really for us, it's about penetration into what was for us a new market and i think you're comparing us perhaps to companies that had a mature market in enterprise and therefore are not -- probably are still waiting to see the secular growth in the enterprise segment. secular growth in enterprise can only help us, as we continue to expand in that space.
sidney ho -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay, great. thank you.

operator
thanks. your next question comes from jason ader of william blair.
jason ader -- william blair & co. -- analyst
yeah, thank you. hey charlie, we've definitely heard in the last let's say 12 to 18 months, there has been an inflection point in demand for micro services and kubernetes technology and i was just wondering, obviously you guys saw that and that's why you bought portworx, but how is this manifesting i guess in terms of activity, pipeline, demand for portworx and then maybe can you give us a sense of when you think it's going to start to be more material for your business?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. as you know, it is a subscription-based business and therefore it's a ratable -- it takes a while for ratable products to make a big difference to the topline. but, i have to say that, both revenue growth is -- we're talking in and around doubling of revenue growth and we've seen a much even larger expansion of pipeline. so i'm going out a bit on the limb here, but it's going very well. and the strategy of aligning and having single management and single layer, that is the kubernetes layer. for customers to be able to manage both, their traditional applications as well as their modern application, so-called cloud native applications. you are in under one umbrella, supported by everything from a start-up environment or a new development environment with a small number -- with a small amount of storage under the original portworx sds layer and then expanding into a full multi-petabyte production environment, using a highly reliable arrays, either flasharray or flashblade and to have that all done non-disruptively, it's a very powerful promise that we're able to deliver to our customers. so, so far so good. we're seeing a lot of interest. we're seeing, as i say, very fast expanding demand. but as we mentioned in our last call or two, it's probably going to be a year or two before it really becomes truly noticeable on a top line that's growing even outside of portworx.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yeah. and charlie, maybe just add on to that, we're quite pleased with the integration that's going on there, right. we've got new version of portworx enterprise that we're quite excited about. and the synergy that we're now seeing with our existing pure customers is pretty strong as well. and i don't know if you or rob wanted to give a little color on that.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'll talk a little bit about it. just eight months roughly, after the close of the transaction, we've integrated all of our products now with more to come. what we've seen in customers and we've indicated this, but there is a repeating. about half the customers are pure customers, about half, that is the buyers are people that we've been talking to for years. and the other half of the buyers are new buyers for us, sometimes in the same account, sometimes new accounts, but on the development side. and it's a one-two punch of us being able to leverage what we already do and learn about a new area that makes the acquisition a really compelling one, i think.
robert lee -- vice president and chief architect
i'll just jump in there. part of what makes that one-two punch particularly powerful is, and this is a fast-growing space. this is a significant and secular transition and how applications are built, frankly, this is how most modern applications are being built today. and so we've really taken the strategy of investing in the full suite of data management capabilities to be able to help a customer deploy, build, deploy and get to production in multiple environments, whether that's on-prem, in the cloud, hybrid cloud or multi-cloud and across the whole spectrum of development life cycle, whether they're just getting started, getting the staging or going to global production scale. and so early days, but really exciting.

your next question comes from the line of rod hall of goldman sachs.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah, thanks for the question guys. i guess i wanted to come back to the question of cost, not so much nand, because i think that's fairly -- it seems like it's relatively predictable. but i'm wondering, charlie, what are you guys seeing in other cost lines like freight and things like that, we hear a lot of people talking about various different upward pressure on cost into their businesses. and then as a kind of add-on to that, what do you think your pricing power is, if you were to continue to see upward pressure on cost across the board? thanks.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. great questions. look, we're seeing -- there is pricing pressure on the supply side across the board. i'd say it's more acute on some of the component area. nand is seeing some, but it's true on all of the different components. freight, a bit, i can't say that that's been a tremendous driver for us, but i'm going to take your guidance and i'll look at it. but the costs are going up. at the same time, as you probably know, rod, a lot of our -- most of our sales are competitive in nature and so our pricing is determined much more by the competitive environment in a particular deal than it is by our costs. and so there will be some balancing with asps, i'm sure. exactly how much that is, we can't be 100% confident, but as kevan mentioned, we've incorporated our best guess into the guide. so we feel fairly good about it. there may be some effect on our margins. i don't expect it to be severe, because again, we operate 100% of the time in a generally a competitive environment.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
and then, rod. maybe i'll just add on a little bit more to that. so specific to what we saw in q1 on the asp front, we actually did see some improvement on asps and i attribute that really to two factors. i think we're doing a really nice job of continuing to sell the value of our solutions, but i also think the general inflationary issues we're seeing around the supply chain is playing into that. and so we'll just have to see how that plays out for the remainder of the year. but i think broader as well, when we get back to the supply chain issues, locally, where we've got very strong relationships with our suppliers and so we're very confident in terms of working with those suppliers, in terms of making sure we can meet our customers' needs. and we're just being very cautious and monitoring very actively. i think our supply chain team is doing a tremendous job, navigating us through this, no different than what they did in the covid environment. so we're quite pleased with how things are progressing, but i think the themes are, general inflationary concerns across the board, especially with some of the smaller componentry and then we did see some improvement in asps.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
i do want to just underline that, really our suppliers have been wonderful to work with. it's a tough environment out there, they are under a lot of pressure, but, a, we have good relationships with them, but, b, they've worked with us really well and i couldn't be more pleased with the suppliers that we work with.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. do you guys mind if i sneak another one in. i know it's a long answer, but --
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
not at all. please.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. the other is just on -- your product revenue was clearly negatively impacted through covid. i'm assuming because you've got exposures to some of these industries that were affected, that i don't remember exactly what you said about that. i'm just curious, what you think your exposure to the reopening benefited industries are, travel, leisure, all that kind of stuff, what sort of industrial exposure you think you have to reopening? thanks.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, rob. in the past, when we talked about the covid exposure, it had more to do with the fact that as a relatively new vendor and one that was focused on growth, it was -- customers not being able to be in the office and their lesser willingness to try new things, whether that's new products, new vendors or new used cases for existing products. and so the way we look at this is that as we return to an environment where customers are more willing to try new things, including maybe a new vendor, but it may just be one of our new products or maybe one of our existing products in a used case where they currently use competitors' products or it's a new use case entirely. they're going to be much more willing to do something new and different. and so that's what we're looking forward to. it was less about us being exposed to highly exposed segments and much more about reluctance to engage in new activities by our customers.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. all right. thanks a lot, charlie. appreciate it.

your next call comes from the line of wamsi mohan of bank of america.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, yes. thank you. sorry to get back on this inflationary topic, but can you be more specific on whether -- how much of that potentially is logistics versus procurement versus increased pricing from your suppliers and do you see that impacting revenue at all? it sounded like you guys alluded to sort of the cost impact of -- not all the upside flowing through in the back half, but what about revenue? and i have a follow-up.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, wamsi. well, wamsi, look, in the context of it being a -- there being a lot of uncertainty in the supply chain, that being said, we feel reasonably confident about q2, we feel reasonably good about q2. it's very difficult to talk about q3 and q4 with high levels of confidence, but we have a high degree of confidence in both, our own operations team that have really performed from a customer standpoint flawlessly throughout covid and up until this day and with our suppliers who we work with very closely. we think it's been -- there are situations where every day, where components that one thought were available suddenly become unavailable, also component availability changes every week. and then one is looking for those components elsewhere. so it's both, a supply issue as well as a cost issue, as we identified costs are going up largely on the supply side, i think less so on the logistics side at least for us. and as i said, it's a bit of an uncertain world. but that being said, we feel reasonably confident on q2 that it won't affect revenue on q2 and i would just want to put that caveat there, reasonably confident and q3 and q4, we're just going to keep -- we'll update you every quarter as to how we feel about this.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yeah. maybe i can go into a little bit more detail in terms of what we saw specifically in q1. so we actually did see improvement in asps as i mentioned previously. that was more favorable in terms of what we are doing on discounting. and again, i think that's both, what we saw with the supply chain, but i also think our field is doing a really nice job in selling the value of our products. and frankly, what we saw with product gross margin this quarter, i viewed as very favorable, again on the high-end of our expectations, despite kind of navigating through what we're seeing on the supply chain side. and then, obviously, we had some really great traction, as we mentioned with flasharray//c and given that that's a newer product for us. we had some gross margin pressure with flasharray//c as well, which when you then look at the total gross margin profile is very positive for us. so hopefully, that is helpful for you.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah, no, it is, thank you for that. and then if i could follow up. we're seeing an increased proliferation in competitive offerings of as-a-service, on-prem as-a-service, dell with apex now and linux [phonetic] has been around with hp. i think charlie, in your opening comments you referred to some competitive offerings that were largely financing, not necessarily technology enhancements. i was wondering how you would characterize the competitive landscape through the lens of these offerings. thank you.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, thanks. thanks, wamsi. so largely as you described it, i'll put some additional detail behind that. as you can tell from both the prepared remarks, i know that some of you perhaps have been attending our accelerate conference as well, what you see us delivering is a true as-a-service experience from a technology perspective, the way the customers interact with it, the way that they're able to manipulate it through code and api. the fact that it is constant and continually improving without disruption are very similar to any type of saas offering. these are all service qualities, whereas most of our competitors are very much -- are focused on financial constructs to make it look like a service and a big telltale from my point of view, is that, when we provide pure as-a-service, we are actually selling to our customer, an sla, it's not an array, it doesn't have a product name, we are providing them a service level agreement that actually has teeth to the agreement. we have to deliver the service level that we otherwise are financial penalties to us.
our competitors tend to provide an objective with no teeth whatsoever and there are named products in it. so it really is a financing construct that they put together. for us, the fact that it's subscription, basically is the fact that what we're offering is a service and so naturally it becomes -- naturally becomes a subscription.
the last thing i'll mention is that, it exists both on-prem and across the cloud with cbs. the subscription, it doesn't matter where the customer puts their data and they manage it all through the same management system. so really is a pan-cloud true technical service and therefore of course a unified subscription, very different than just the financial construct.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks charlie.

your next question comes from amit daryanani with evercore.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. i have two as well. i guess, first off, if i take your july quarter guide, the first half of the year, we're going to do 14.5% growth, give or take. and your compares actually get fairly easy in the back half and very simplistically, my tendency would be to say, simpler -- easier compares would suggest growth accelerates in the back half versus the first half. i would love to understand so what are the factors we should consider, as we go into the back half, because the compares would suggest we should see an acceleration. just what factors should we think about in the back half would be helpful.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yeah, i'll start it more tactically and charlie, feel free to jump on in. and obviously we are expecting some acceleration in second half, with our -- where we landed for q1 in our guide for q2 and then looking at what that plays out to for second half. we get some ramp on that and obviously just to highlight as well, q4 is generally our seasonally highest quarter in terms of sales, which is beneficial. but early signs of flasharray//c, i think that's going to parlay itself throughout the year.
and i think in particular, what was exciting across the board for us is what we saw from a broad-based perspective. i mean we saw really kind of everything driving with strength, whether that's enterprise. commercial, this is the first time we were really seeing some strengths on commercial and i think it's important to highlight that, we are very pleased to see that strength coming through this quarter, despite still being in a covid environment. so that was great to see. obviously, pure as-a-service and what we're seeing across the board with portworx. so it's really this balanced strength that we've seen in q1 that we really do think that momentum, which really started in q4 will continue throughout the year,
but charlie, anything else you'd want to add to that?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i would say that, as we look at the year, q1 was still the quarter we've just had, a 100% under covid rules. we're still -- while we might be kind of seeing maybe some green-shoots come up mostly around the promise of people getting back to the office, we're yet to see any real pickup due to that phenomenon where we believe we may see that in q2 and then we'll be in a better position, once we have our next quarter's earnings of being able to say what the rest of the year might look like. but given that all the experience we've had to-date this year have been a 100% under covid rules, a little bit hard to speculate as to the second half of the year.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
fair enough. hopefully we don't have a third wave and exploration sustains for you folks. if i could follow up on the commercial segment, i know you talked about seeing better momentum over there. can you just touch about what is driving the momentum here? is it just a better engagement with the channel or the sales force is doing something different? and then are the commercial customers now engaging with the different product set with pure versus what your traditional enterprise customers have done.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'd say there are a number of phenomenon that we're seeing at work. there is no question, i think we might have mentioned this in the prepared remarks that we're seeing increased, what we call partner-sourced deals and a large part of that is commercial. so we believe that that is going to only continue, we're really seeing a good pickup by the partners overall.
second, we do think there is a bit of a resurgence of commercial, that number of them have gotten their feet underneath them, if you will in this covid environment and are back in the market. we think that's just beginning by the way, i don't think that's a big phenomena. but i think that was a large part of it. and i do think that flasharray//c is in fact are selling not just into the enterprise, but into the commercial market as well. and so i think that also opens up a bit of that. so i think it's a little bit of three of those things, but i think a lot more to come.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yeah. and i'd just add pure as-a-service too, charlie.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, that's right. i think the thought -- many may think that pure as-a-service largely appeals to large enterprise customers, but we have a set of programs for pure as-a-service, specifically in the commercial market, it's doing very well there.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
perfect. thank you very much.

your next question comes from simon leopold of raymond james.
simon leopold -- raymond james financial inc. -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. i'm going to ask maybe a little bit of an odd one, but my perception on this call was that charlie, you sounded more upbeat on the flasharray//c and my recollection is that on the prior call, you sounded more upbeat on flashblade and i could be reading too much into it, but i guess i want to get a sense of whether that was intentional and maybe how you think about sort of the new product cycles here, is something shifted in your thinking or how do we kind of separate these two trends. thank you.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, no, we just like to share the wealth and sometimes we'll spend a bit more time on one than the other. so you shouldn't take any. and i was getting tired of hearing myself talk, so i didn't want to bore you all to death with adding on even more. no, both products we're very excited about, they both fill different niches. the flashblade product, very highly scalable product, a scale out product capable of supporting multiple simultaneous workloads at unbelievable speed, really good for scale out environments for ai, machine learning, analytics and rapid recovery, all in one platform, all at the same time. flasharray//c, now with file, a great what's called scale-up platform, now competitive with from a pricing level, with hybrid disk for that secondary tier. so, no, we're very proud of both platforms. from quarter-to-quarter, you may hear us spend a little bit more time with different products, including portworx and flasharray//x. so you may hear us just spend different amounts of time each quarter for color on each product.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
and simon, i'll just add that this was a quarter where we had strength across our business and we had a plethora of options to choose from in terms of what we wanted to emphasize. and so the first thing is, we just had strength across the board and then obviously c, we're very impressed with what's going on with c. and i also say that flashblade acquired new unstructured data scale-up customers at a much faster rate this quarter than what we saw in the previous year-over-year quarter. so good stuff happening all the way around and not meaning to ignore anyone in particular.
simon leopold -- raymond james financial inc. -- analyst
great. no, i appreciate it. and then follow-up is hopefully pretty easy. but where are you in your thinking on your own organization maybe returning to sort of pre-covid expense levels, in the sense of reintroducing travel and items like that? how should we think about your own internal planning for those kinds of activity? thanks.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. you can imagine that we are putting a lot of work and focus on that. as we've discussed last quarter, we plan on adding to the bottom line of this year and years ahead. so as we start to reintroduce some of those other expenses, obviously we'll slow down other expenses, we do expect to grow into this, but i think the annual guide we provided last quarter for modest bottom line growth and kevan's addition to that commentary on this call, you should expect us to continue down that path. so we expect overall that the percentage of our expenses to total will come down, so that we add more to the bottom line.

your next question comes from tim long of barclays.
tim long -- barclays -- analyst
thank you. two if i could as well. first, can you talk a little bit about kind of deal sizes and win rates and kind of some of those metrics? and if there's anything that's just kind of different when we're looking at the commercial side and the larger enterprise in those metrics view or any trends worth highlighting.
and then second, i just wanted to dig into flasharray//c a little bit more. it sounded pretty good in the quarter, double digit, but overall was double-digit, so given there's such a huge tam when we're thinking about this as we go through the year and into next year, what's going to accelerate the growth rate there? is it new used cases or pieces of your customer base that you got to penetrate further? so what is it that kind of allows that product to really take on that much larger tam? thank you.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. thanks. win rates have stayed -- this is something we analyze all the time. win rates have stayed roughly steady. it's very much in line. whenever our win rates get a bit too high, we are worried we're not in enough fights, and we did expand the number of fights that we are in this quarter and win rates have held pretty steady. and no big changes vis-a-vis any one of our competitors. so the win rate ones remains, pretty much at historical rates.
kevan, do you have any comment on deal size? i don't have that off hand. i think it's roughly the same, but i don't have any.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yeah. overall deal size, we are very pleased with what we saw in deal size. now obviously, q1 of last year, we were fortunate to get some really large deals, in part due to folks working on mission-critical and addressing their needs on that front in terms of work from home. so i would say that the significant larger deals were a little bit less this quarter, but i was really pleased with the balance we saw, multitude of deals over $1 million. so nothing to highlight in terms of significance. other than it was broad based across the board and in terms of what we saw and then lesser larger deals that we saw.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
c growth was, you're right, double-digit is a very wide range, but c growth, we also gave you commentary that c has been and continues to be our fastest new product from a growth perspective. so you can assume that it's a higher number -- significantly higher number than our average -- than our growth overall as a company. it does open up that second tier market for us, both on the block side, but also somewhat on the file side and as we add more and more features we think it's going to add even more market opportunity for us on the file side. so it's still while -- on the block side it's a mature product, on the file side it's still early days. and so i think we're going to see continued expansion of our opportunity there.

your next question comes from matt sheerin of stifel.
matthew sheerin -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
yes, thank you. i just wanted to ask regarding your commentary about the growth in the channel partners and the contribution to new customers, as well as the commercial market, what's behind that? i know that you put some new channel programs in place in the last couple of years, but what accounted for that traction and do you see that roster expanding further, particularly given the rollout of azure with it's very strong support base in the channel?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, matt. we do. i think there is several reasons for it. one is, we're a 100% partner model, meaning that we don't go direct. so one of the things that partners really like about us is that, they know that we're fair and that we'll work with them and that when the going gets tough in a competitive environment, we're not going to just take it away from them. so that loyalty is reciprocated by the partners themselves. i think we've continued to make it easier and easier for the partners to sell our product. first of all, the product itself is very straightforward, very simple, requires relatively little busy work by the partners to set up and to be able to operate and to be able to service and of course it's highly, highly reliable.
and that also makes for a better customer experience, which partners care about the customer experience, because that's what gets the partner more business from that same customer. so i think the values of the company itself that we represent high nps, high reliability. the fact that we don't stray to a direct model when the going gets tough. and you're right, we've worked a lot and we'll continue to work on our partner programs, especially aggressive growth programs, in specialized expertise programs, with our partners to enable them to evolve as companies and enable them to provide a better experience overall for our customers.

it's a great question shannon and i'll start off. look, our first big milestone that we're looking at is 50% of our revenue. it would be the big next milestone for us. and look, at the end of the day, though it's still customer first in terms of what they prefer with flexibility, so we won't force a particular model on them in terms of how they want to consume our technology and drive their outcomes. but i do think 50% is a good target for us to have longer term, in terms of recurring revenue, especially with what we're seeing with the momentum around evergreen and pure as-a-service with our unified subscription coming on board, as we've talked about with cloud block store, both aws and azure really will complement that. and then following that and we've talked about that as well, which is portworx and our solutions around modern apps.
anything else you want to add, charlie?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, i think that covers it.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
okay.
shannon cross -- cross research, llc -- analyst
curious what long term sort of refers to, i mean are you talking a couple of years out or --
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
definitely, that will be a couple of years out and how we're looking at that and then we'll give some more details on that in our analyst day, which we're contemplating in the month of september.
shannon cross -- cross research, llc -- analyst
great, thank you.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
thank you, shannon.
operator
your next question comes from the line of kathryn huberty with morgan stanley.
kathryn huberty -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you. charlie, can you talk about some of the metrics that underscore your confidence in the second quarter? for instance, what did pipeline growth look like, where is backlog versus normal seasonality, what sort of linearity did you see in the quarter. just some of those metrics and leading indicators that drive the confidence. and then i have a follow-up.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. thank you, katy. great to speak to you. so, we saw a number of things. one is, good linearity, but frankly improving through the quarter. so definitely seeing signs, as i said, green shoots and improvement as we went through the quarter. we don't give specific details on pipeline, but pipeline that supports the q2 guide that we've provided, based on the kind of metrics and analysis that we've done in the past and a hard look at that. we're not basing it tremendously on any kind of hope for dramatic improvement in the whole covid situation in q2. we think it's fairly balanced, from the standpoint of not a bit -- a lot of wishes or hopes, for change to the positive. so we think it's sort of a prudent and balanced guide. good support from things that are near term, near-term deals, near-term pipeline. so nothing magic i would say in the guide. we believe we can get there with business as what we've seen over the last couple of quarters.
kathryn huberty -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, that's helpful. and then just a follow-up. kevan, as i think about nand price inflation, in the past, the industry and pure in particular has been able to pass through the higher costs, such that it's somewhat neutral to profit dollars, maybe some pressure on gross margin percentage, but it is typically fairly neutral. is there a reason that you would expect it to play out differently this time or is it just a function that this is just getting started, and there is a lot of moving pieces within different cost buckets and so you want to be conservative and assume that some of the upside you saw in the first quarter gets offset by this dynamic, as you move through the year?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
katy, it's really much more of the latter that you articulated. and really if this was just a nand that we are looking at, i think we would follow that thesis perfectly in terms of how we think about nand pricing, to be able to pass that off. but look, i think the issues we're seeing around the supply chain are much broader and there's really broader general inflationary concerns that we've talked about at the component level, i mean the smallest components are driving our supply chain team with a lot of work and we do have inflation there. now the interesting thing in q1 is, we were successful generally around increasing our asps and i do think in part, that's due to the inflation that we were seeing. the question is, can we maintain that with the broader supply chain constraints that we're seeing and that remains to be seen. obviously, we're confident in terms of our q2 outlook and but that is the reason why we were only talking about taking half of our over-achievement for operating profit for the annual view.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
and if i might just insert, because i don't want there to be a confusion, katy. i know you're aware of this. but it's not as if we pass higher cost along, we've never raised prices. but what does happen is, because our deals are competitive, we're competing every day against competition and when their -- when their costs are higher like ours, all the vendors become more cautious in terms of their discounting. and that's why the asps tend to float a little bit with costs, but it's never a quite one-for-one and timing this quarter versus next quarter, how long is people's supply contracts are in place for and so forth, plays a role. so there's always a little bit of movement because of timing.
kathryn huberty -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that makes perfect sense. thank you.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
thank you, katy.

operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen. thank you for standing by, and welcome to the pure storage second quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings release conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, mr. sanjot khurana. mr. khurana, please go ahead.
sanjot khurana -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, and good afternoon. welcome to the pure storage second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call. my name is sanjot khurana, vice president of investor relations at pure storage. joining me today are our ceo, charlie giancarlo; our cfo, kevan krysler; and our cto, rob lee.
before we begin, i would like to remind you all that during this call management will make some forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. these include statements regarding: the covid-19 pandemic and related disruptions, our growth and sales prospects, competitive, industry and technology trends, our strategy and its advantages, our current and future product offerings, and our business and operations. any forward-looking statements that we make are based on facts and assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them. our actual results may differ materially from the results forecasted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. a discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties relating to our business is contained in our filings with the sec, and we refer you to these public filings.
during this call, we will discuss non-gaap measures in talking about the company's performance, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap measures are provided in our earnings press release and slides. additionally, when we refer to sales in our prepared remarks, we mean total bookings exclude cancelable orders. this call is being broadcast live on the pure storage investor relations website and is being recorded for playback purposes. an archive of the webcast will be available on the ir website and is a property of pure storage.
with that, i'll turn the call over to our ceo, charlie giancarlo.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
hello everyone, and thank you for joining us today. pure had an outstanding q2. as a growing, share-taking company, we expect every quarter to be record breaking, but this quarter was extraordinary. sales, revenue and profitability were well above expectations. revenue growth this quarter exceeded 23%, and we had the highest q2 operating profit in our history. i was especially pleased with the growth of both our new and existing products, the balance of performance geographically, and our continuing penetration of cloud and large enterprise. these are all key parts of our long-term strategy that we've shared over the past several years. these results also show that our strategy of investing into the pandemic, and specifically investing in our enterprise sales capability and expanding our product line, was the right one.
as we discussed in past calls, we predicted that pure's growth would accelerate as businesses adjusted to the covid environment. we believe that our growth will be even stronger as businesses return to an in-office environment. we estimated that this would start this past q2, and we are obviously very pleased with the results.
looking ahead, we expect that businesses will continue to adjust to the effects of the pandemic while driving digital transformation. we believe that the delta variant has slowed a return to the office environment only temporarily, and that large scale global vaccinations will do much to enable a full return to normal by spring of next year. as we indicated last quarter, we believe that the current environment enables us to return to our historical double digit growth rates, with increasing profitability.
our leadership and innovation of the data storage and management market continues to grow. our strategy is focused on delivering a unified cloud operating and procurement model, across all data storage use-cases and environments, enabling modern cloud-native applications built on containers, and driving the modernization of today's infrastructure with a focus on the all-flash future that modern applications will demand.
let's take a quick look at the results. this past quarter provided many areas of outstanding performance, highlighted by the highest total sales for any second quarter in the history of the company, growing more than 30% year-over-year, continued strength and momentum in subscription services revenue, up 31% year-over-year with strong growth in pure as-a-service, which almost doubled revenues compared to the prior year, and, our success in large enterprise continues to grow, comprising over 50% of our sales, with our top 10 customers spending more than $100 million in total.
as i mentioned, both our new and existing products achieved new sales milestones. frankly, the superlatives from this quarter are too numerous to fully enumerate, but here are a few highlights. growth of our subscription businesses were very strong this past quarter with sales of both pure as-a-service and portworx approximately tripling year-over-year. all subscription sales taken together, including portworx, pure as-a-service and evergreen increased almost 50% year-over-year in q2, and is approaching one-half of pure's total sales. these results show both the continued attractiveness of our evergreen model, and the market's excitement for our new subscription offerings.
it has been nearly a year since we announced the acquisition of portworx. every quarter as part of pure, portworx has beaten their targets. this past quarter, portworx sales tripled year-over-year and continued to gain many new customers both large and small. financial services and service providers are particularly interested in the ability to easily scale container based workflows with portworx. flasharray//c continues to deliver tremendous growth, with sales tripling over last year. it remains the fastest growing new product in pure's history and is enabling customers to transition to an all-flash data center. cloud customers in particular are making use of flasharray//c to improve their reliability, to reduce their environmental footprint and to lower their operational costs.
for instance, a recent eight-figure win with a top 10 hyper-scaler which will begin to ship this q3 was won against traditional magnetic disk based on our high performance, small space and power footprint and superior total cost of ownership. safemode is another compelling reason why ever more customers are turning to pure. this high performance ransomware protection solution for both flasharray and flashblade takes less than a millisecond to create an immutable copy of data for fast recovery. and customers can send these snapshots to a variety of destination such as flasharray//c, flashblade or aws, microsoft azure and nfs shares. only six months after introduction, over 500 customers have enabled safemode.
these examples demonstrate the success of our strategy to provide organizations with the modern data services they need to modernize their data infrastructure, to take advantage of modern applications, and to manage their data and infrastructure through code in a multi-cloud environment. our focus on these goals has been rewarded with new and expanding customer relationships. for example, one of our enterprise customers, a global fortune 500 financial services firm, recently chose a pure as-a-service subscription to fuel the expansion of their core operating applications in a virtual hub. while increasing the performance, flexibility and scale of this global platform, they were able to reduce their physical footprint by nearly 80%, contributing significantly to their environmental sustainability goals. they estimate that this will reduce their total cost of ownership by nearly 70% while providing significant performance increases.
and with growing global concerns about ransomware attacks, a uk-based securities firm with sub-millisecond performance requirements found performance, simplicity and safety in pure's recovery capabilities. using flasharray's safemode with our flashblade flashrecover solution on an evergreen gold subscription, they now have the data protection and unified fast file and object platform they need to scale safely.
our strategy since our founding is to focus on doing the right things for our customers and on doing things right. our environmental goals dovetail with our customer-first values. part of ensuring that our products and services have the lowest total cost of ownership means designing products that use less energy, require less cooling, need less maintenance, take up less space and produce less waste. with our customers' increasing focus on their own environmental footprint, we will be providing more quantitative measures and sustainability programs going forward. pure storage is advantaged by the major trends in our industry. we enable companies around the world to shift to a cloud-operating model for their private and hybrid cloud infrastructure. we lead in driving the all-flash data center. and we have the most advanced services and tools to automate data management for our modern cloud-native applications.
as we entered the year, we stated that our customers would accelerate their investment in digital transformation with renewed confidence in economic recovery this year. this was clearly evident in our performance in the first half and especially this past q2. in the current environment, we are confident that the momentum of our first half will continue into q3 as evidenced by our q3 guide and raised annual outlook. i want to thank our employees and our partners who have worked tirelessly to support our customers with great products and great service, throughout the uncertainty of covid-19, and who have created our sustainable momentum. everyone at pure deserves to feel proud of the advancements we have made through this difficult period.
one last note that i would like to add before i turn the call over to our cfo, kevan krysler. i am very pleased to announce that rob lee, who many of you know, has just been promoted and will serve as pure's chief technology officer. congratulations, rob. john colgrove, aka, coz, who in addition to his title as founder also served as cto, will now take the title of chief visionary officer. rob will continue to report to him and coz will continue to serve pure full time. congratulations, rob and coz.
kevan, over to you.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
thank you charlie and good afternoon. we could not be more pleased with the strength of our business, our execution in q2 financial results. we saw strong sales execution across the globe which is reflected in our sales growth of 32%, excluding cancelable orders. similar to what we saw last quarter, our entire portfolio, including our subscription services, contributed to our performance. our core business of flasharray//x gained significant strength across our enterprise, commercial and public sector customers, flasharray//c sales more than tripled year-over-year, and flashblade sales established a new record high for q2.
our revenue growth was 23% this quarter and product revenue had its highest year-over-year growth rate compared to the previous seven quarters. remaining performance obligations or rpo, which includes our committed and non-cancelable future revenue was $1.2 billion, growing 25%. rpo growth reflects the continued strength of our subscription services, including record sales this quarter of our unified subscription, pure as-a-service. we acquired 380 new customers representing 10% year-over-year growth and we saw particular strength with new enterprise customers this quarter.
now turning to specific financial results for the quarter. total revenue grew 23% to approximately $497 million. revenue in the united states grew 25% and international revenue grew 18% compared to last year. subscription services revenue grew approximately 31% year-over-year, and represents approximately 35% of total revenue. product revenue was very strong during the quarter growing 19%. the differentiated value of our software and solutions continue to be reflected in our non-gaap total gross margins of 70.5% this quarter. non-gaap product gross margins continue to be on the high end of our long-term expectations at 70.3%. we expect that product margins will fluctuate depending on product mix as our newer offerings continue to scale.
non-gaap subscription services margins were 70.7%. revenue and gross margin outperformance and improving sales efficiency contributed to delivering strong non-gaap operating profits of $46.6 million. continued reduced travel due to the on-going covid environment and slower-than-planned hiring also contributed to lower operating expenses during the quarter. we ended the quarter with over $1.29 billion in cash and approximately 3,900 employees. cash flow from operations achieved a record high this quarter of $123 million, resulting from improved linearity and strong collections as well as increasing operating leverage. capital expenditures were $28 million during the quarter. we returned approximately $44 million of capital to repurchase slightly over 2.3 million shares as part of our $200 million share repurchase program.
now turning to guidance. we are very pleased with our sustained momentum and improving operational efficiencies. we expect q3 revenue to be approximately $530 million, growing almost 30%. our revenue guide for q3 includes revenue we expect to recognize in connection with the sale of flasharray//c to one of the top 10 hyper-scalers. we also expect non-gaap operating profit will be approximately $40 million. i have mentioned in previous quarters that we would not be updating our annual view. however, given the strong performance of our business over the last several quarters, including our strong financial outlook for q3, we have also updated our annual view. we now expect that revenue for the year will surpass $2 billion, growing approximately 21% to $2.04 billion. we also expect that operating income will be approximately $150 million. this is an exciting time at pure. our strategy, innovation and service is compelling for our customers and we are executing with a focus on accelerating revenue growth and increasing profitability. thank you to all of our employees and partners. i am also really looking forward to having you join us at our virtual analyst day on september 28.
with that, i will turn it over to the operator so we can get to your questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] and your first question comes from line of pinjalim with jpmorgan.
pinjalim bora -- jpmorgan -- analyst
great. hey thank you guys and good afternoon. congrats on the quarter. it seems like a super solid quarter here. probably one of the highest beats i think if i was just looking at it going backward. charlie maybe at a high level, did anything surprise you in the quarter when we were doing checks? a lot of partners can have highlighted that pure continues to be -- continues to see relatively short lead times, while competitors tend to struggle with the longer lead times. do you think that is helping you to gain share? anything that surprised you in the quarter would love to know?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks pinjalim. i think the reason why we continue to gain share and why the quarter was so good is that we've been preparing a portfolio of products that are really second to none. and while that was being done during the beginning of the covid crisis, of course, there's a lot of disruption in our customer base. but as the customers have become accustomed to operating within the covid environment, that portfolio and our focus on developing a set of enterprise capabilities, both in sales support as well as with our products, it's finally all coming together and hitting stride. and so no, we expect this to be the beginning, if you will, of very evident growth for the company as we go forward.
pinjalim bora -- jpmorgan -- analyst
strong comments. thank you for that. one follow-up for kevan. it seems like you were able to maintain the gross margin sequentially, if i did my math correctly, quickly. despite the inflationary pressures that have been creeping up. is it fair to say that you saw kind of a better pricing environment maybe as the component price inflation presumably made the competitors do less discounting in the field?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
well, hey, pinjalim. one is, i think the -- your math is right. so absolutely, we held on gross margins. and i really think that's a testament to a couple of things. i think our operations team continues to do an outstanding job. our suppliers are continuing to work very closely with us. and yes, to answer your question, specifically, discounting did hold and i really attribute a lot of that to our sales team, and the discipline and execution in terms of why we saw the gross margin performance that we saw.
operator
your next question comes from line of aaron rakers of wells fargo.
aaron rakers -- wells fargo -- analyst
yes. thanks for taking the question. also congrats on the solid results and guide. throughout today's call, you referenced the fact that you've now got a top 10 hyperscale customer, it sounds like for the flasharray//c product. i guess the question on that is that, is that tied to their cloud offerings or is that for internal usage? and do you expect this to kind of be the beginning of more potential hyperscale customer traction for the company going forward? and i have a follow-up.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, it's a part of their overall operations. so i think the answer is affirmative from the question that you asked. and, we do feel that this is sustainable both in the sense of continuing with this customer, as well as we think it's the beginning of seeing other similarly situated hyperscale customers starting to look at flash as a real alternative. as you may know, most of the hyperscalars, the vast majority of what they store, they store on disk. they may have a little bit of flash in their servers, but for the most part, all storage is on disk. and we think this is the beginning of breaking that structure. we finally have the kind of price performance that can really compete within the disk market.
aaron rakers -- wells fargo -- analyst
very helpful. i wanted to -- the follow-up question is on actually the subscription revenue. you referenced the subscription revenue is up 31%. and then i think you mentioned that on a combined basis, pure as-a-service, portworx and i believe evergreen was up close to 50% year-over-year, if i correctly got that. so, i guess, i'm curious of what is other -- what is in that other subscription services line that maybe wasn't growing as fast as the three combined that you mentioned?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
hey, aaron, this is kevan. and this is just a clarification. i think the 50% reference is really toward sales and bookings and then obviously the revenue and there's a lag with the revenue. so, two different metrics here that we're referring to.
aaron rakers -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay, so just to be clear, evergreen, portworx and pure as-a-service basically are the majority, if not all of the services line in the p&l?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
that's correct.
aaron rakers -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay. thank you very much.
operator
your next question comes from the line of sidney ho with deutsche bank.
jeff rand -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi, this is jeff rand on for sidney. i just wanted to kind of follow-up on the flasharray//c into the hyperscalers, can you give us an idea of how close the pricing has gotten compared to hdds? or is this more about the need for better performance by the cloud providers?
rob lee -- chief technology officer
this is rob. i will jump in, and take that one first. so, when we look at flasharray//c relative to the hybrid disk systems its competing with, generally speaking, we're seeing flasharray//c being very price competitive, and actually price have been -- up to 30% price advantage in some cases. but i think what we're seeing, especially with this large hyperscaler deal is that, price is one element of the equation but all of the other attributes and benefits we are able to bring from flash, such as the performance, such as power, cooling savings, footprint savings, those are all very meaningful across the board. but at the hyperscale, they become super, super meaningful, right? and so, as we look at, for example, this customer, flasharray//c was the only product that can meet their needs, without them having to go build new data centers.
jeff rand -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great, thank you. and then just as my follow up, you didn't mention anything on supply chain in your prepared remarks, can you give us an update on that, if you're missing out on any revenue new to supply chain constraints?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, no, again, i think we're doing a great job with our operations team, in partnership with our suppliers. obviously, the environment, from our perspective hasn't changed much from what we saw last quarter. we just continue to be focused on it. and obviously, you see the results in our print. and so this will be an area that we will continue to focus on through second half. we'll manage that. but again, a testament to our sales team to continue selling the value, especially the software value associated with our solutions.
operator
your next question comes from one of wamsi mohan of bank of america.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america -- analyst
yes, thank you. your guidance for next quarter calls for close to 30% growth. but all that can be explained from sort of that acceleration from 22% to 30% can be explained really to easier compares. on the one hand, you're seeing, very good traction, charlie you spoke about share gains. you essentially are reiterating sort of this better outlook for the full-year as well. just trying to reconcile why wouldn't you see a further organic acceleration on top? i'm not saying 30% -- 30% is really good, but why aren't we seeing a further acceleration, especially when you think about the comments around the backdrop of delta being maybe somewhat transitory?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
wamsi, i'm not sure i would follow your math in terms of 30% being entirely explained by the easier compare last year, it does represent a significant growth rate not just over last year, but frankly over the -- if we take -- and as a company we are looking at not just at year-over-year growth rate but year over two year growth rate because of obviously the anomalous compares with last year, and it's a substantial gain even over a two year compare rate. so, we think it's a suitably appropriate guide for this coming quarter, given the entire environment. and it is of course a raise, both from our annual look forward as well as to what was consensus. so, we do feel that it's an appropriate raise.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
we are very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of the q3 outlook and the idea that, we're driving almost 30% growth next year, with the opportunity we highlighted on flasharray//c. so, i think the guide that we've come out with q3 is actually quite strong. we're very pleased with that.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, great. if i could, i think i heard you kevan maybe say that, some of the operating margin improvement, the operating profit dollar improvement was a function of not able to hire as fast as maybe you would have liked to. can you just elaborate a little bit on that? how much behind are you versus target in terms of hiring? how should we think about the trajectory of that for the next few quarters? thank you.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yes, absolutely. and again, what i really was pleased with the quarter was not only the top-line growth that we're driving, but the operating leverage that's coming with it. and really that's coming really from the sales organization. we are seeing really strong productivity and sales efficiency and discipline, and we're seeing that come through primarily on the operating leverage that we saw for q2 and frankly the increased outlook for the remainder of the year. and so, when i think about the increasing operating leverage, i would look at first what we're doing in terms of outperforming on sales, as well as the gross margin performance, execution of the sales team. and then, yes, we've got a little bit of tailwind from the covid environment. as i look at q2, i would kind of view that between 1 point to 2 points of the 9 points that we saw this quarter. so not a significant tailwind, but there is a bit of a tailwind that we saw for q2. and, yes, we're managing that quite well. obviously on the sales side, even though we're got some more hiring to do on the sales side. they are just doing such a great job in terms of productivity. participation rates are tremendous. we're seeing a great growth in participation rates, both on individual contributors, as well as the first line managers. so, like what we see there.
operator
your next question comes from on for steven enders of keybanc..
george -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi, this is george on for steven. thanks for taking the question and reiterate my congrats on the quarter. i just wanted to ask if you could give us an update on your ability to close new logos. and then in the past, you've mentioned out covid as a bit of a constraint from that, but then we've seen things sort of open up and then the delta variant coming back. so, just an update on where you stand from that perspective. thank you.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. we do feel that, people working at home, offices not really being open is a bit of a constraint on net new logo growth. despite that, of course we were pleased with the 10% growth we saw year-over-year, but in past years, of course, we saw more. we believe that as things opened up more, obviously that's been delayed a bit because of the delta variant, but as things opened up more late this year, early next, we expect that to actually just improve our net new logo gains. but, in the meantime, our continuation to penetrate deeper and deeper into existing accounts, to penetrate deeper and deeper into the enterprise, and i might point out as well that our net new logo gains in enterprise was actually quite a bit strong. so as you might imagine, the commercial logo gains swamp because there were so many more commercial accounts. in terms of net new logos, net new logos tend to be dominated by commercial, but actually our gain of enterprise net new logos this past quarter was actually quite healthy.
george -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you. that's very helpful. a quick follow-up. obviously, it's a nice bottom line outperformance this quarter. can you give us an update on how you're thinking about driving growth versus operating leverage over the long term? thank you.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, we feel like at this point in time, given our product portfolio and given the productivity that we're seeing from the sales force, we're going to be able to deliver both. we're going to be able to deliver both continued double digit growth as well as continued improvements quarter by quarter in our operating profit margins. so, yes, no, we're quite confident in that.
operator
our next question comes from the line of simon leopold of raymond james.
simon leopold -- raymond james -- analyst
thank you for taking the question. i first wanted to sort of check on how you're thinking about the longer term growth trajectory? because in the past, charlie, you've mentioned growth exceeding 20% and now you put up 23% and you're guiding for 29%, which maybe there's some easy comp to it. but if you could just sort of update us on how you feel about the overall trajectory relative to your prior comments about exceeding 20%?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. no, we've made that commentary in the past because we feel quite comfortable that we will be exceeding 20% for the foreseeable future. i think we're going to stick to that point right now, which is exceeding 20%. i do think that we have room to grow beyond that again, as covid wanes. but predicting that right now is probably not a fool's errand for all of us. but we do feel comfortable that in this type of covid environment that we can continue to grow at over 20%.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
and simon, we'll provide some more color on that as well on our virtual analyst day. so we look forward in terms of our longer term growth rate. so look forward to having those conversations as well.
simon leopold -- raymond james -- analyst
great. and then just as a follow-up. you were helpful in terms of talking about bucketing revenue recurring, but maybe another way to segment your contribution. if you could talk a little bit about what portion of revenue and what's the trajectory for revenue that you would consider off premise? so what you're doing with hybrid cloud and things like the cloud block storage with azure, what you're doing with aws? could you help us get a better assessment of how that fits into the model?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, very much. so first of all, we've stated in the past that, cloud revenues has been about 30% plus. we haven't really calculated it for this quarter to be talking about. but it's trending generally the same. of course, cloud is an area that we're very focused on and it's an area that we hope can actually continue to increase for us, especially as more and more customers and workloads go to either saas environments, cloud environments and as the consumer cloud continues to scale. and we feel as you're seeing with the flasharray//c that over time we -- because our belief in the all-flash data center, the last bastion of mostly disk data center right now is actually in the cloud. and so it represents a great opportunity for us.

your next question comes from the line of shannon cross of cross research.
shannon cross -- cross research -- analyst
just a couple of questions. the first, strength in cash flow, free cash flow. obviously, you're buying back stock. curious how you're thinking about acquisitions and other uses, you were about a year off when you announced portworx. then i have a follow-up.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, thank you, shannon, we continue to be investigating opportunities for m&a. we believe that m&a that really enhances our ability to provide a cloud operating model for our customers is the right way for us to be focused. and there isn't a quarter or even a week that goes by where we're not investigating potential combinations for the company. so m&a continues to be an active area of investigation for us.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
and i just -- i do want to comment on the strong operating cash flows, which i think were tremendous for the company. and again, i think there were kind of three areas that i would attribute that to this quarter. one was really that the great linearity that the sales team drove this quarter, which really improves collection efforts. and we saw that come through with the record operating cash flows that we saw this quarter. and the other thing, obviously, is the continued focus as a company we have on operating leverage, and we're seeing some good benefits from that as well.
shannon cross -- cross research -- analyst
okay, thanks. and then i'm just curious, given the inflationary environment, how are you thinking about component costs longer term and also just, some of the increased headcount, etc, costs that you're seeing? i know you're managing things well, and part of the pricing environment remains fairly positive. but how are you thinking about this, given what we're at least seeing coming from an inflationary perspective? thank you.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, it's a great question. let me start, kevan, you might have more. i would really separate it into the two items that you mentioned. one is component costs, which we have seen an increase, on average, about probably about 10% this year in increased component costs. but of course, we live in a -- on a longer term deflationary environment on component costs. so, we really view that as a temporary phenomenon having to do with supply chain shortages, and that should come back in the next year or so, to where to the standard long-term price reduction curve that exists in that environment. on the flip side, absolutely, there's going to be -- and we're already starting to see the signs of an inflationary environment around wages. our forecast and guides take that into account, but certainly, what you speak of is becoming evident.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
and one of the things i would just make sure to highlight too, back to the component cost is, look our approach to sourcing raw nand really continues to be an advantage for us, really, when we look at some of other folks who are leveraging sourced ssds and leveraging our software capabilities to enable nand management is really beneficial for us in this time as well. so i think that's an important comment.
operator
your next question comes from line of karl ackerman with cowen and company.
karl ackerman -- cowen and company -- analyst
yes, good afternoon, gentlemen. with portworx tripling revenue year-over-year, is it now accretive to operating income? and then second, you're exiting the fiscal year in the low double digit ebit range that's in line with record quarterly results exiting 2019. that's certainly, really good. the question is, while some skeptics may suggest that's the -- maybe the best you can do, can you discuss the operational improvement since the beginning of 2020 that would argue operating profit improvement is sustainable and able to grow? thank you.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. well, thanks for the question karl, that's been on people's minds. focusing on operational improvement, productivity enhancement across the board of the company has been something we've been very focused on over the last several years. covid obviously set us back a bit, because obviously we plan to grow into productivity, and with covid, we decided to continue to invest in areas that were we felt very important to our long-term growth, in particular, investing in our ability to penetrate large enterprise, which by the way, is part of productivity improvement; and two, was to invest in broad scale portfolio of products, again to help us to be able to penetrate and achieve much greater wallet share in our customer base. it was only a few years ago where we could only address maybe 10% of their storage needs, and today it's much wider than that.
so, as we look forward over the next several quarters with the anticipation for the top line change that we've already discussed, we know quite strongly what our productivity gains are going to be in the different parts of our organization. and these are productivity gains that we're going to be able to continue to maintain inside the company. again, last year was the anomaly, as it was for many companies, but in different ways. for us, it meant that our continued investment that we wouldn't see the productivity or the sales return on that until the economy started to improve. and now we're starting to see that.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yes, let me just add onto that a little bit, if you don't mind. look, i think we've made -- none of this is surprise for us in terms of the increasing operating leverage. we're driving for this -- all due to the points that charlie is making. and you actually see the great strides at go-to-markets making in terms of their costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue. i think that's going to continue. i think we'll see over time, we'll get some benefits on r&d as well. and obviously on our gross margins, continue to be strong. we've seen that on the product gross margin side, and also believe we can get more scale and improvement on subscription gross margins over time, as our unified subscription pure as-a-service scales. so, i absolutely believe there is upward trajectory to our operating leverage.
operator
your next question comes from a line of rod hall of goldman sachs.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. thanks for the question. i guess i wanted to start charlie with this flasharray//c sale to the hyperscaler. i'm really intrigued by that as an opportunity. and i wonder if, maybe you can give us any more color on what that use case looks like, and are there other hyperscalers in your pipeline with very similar use cases? just how big is that opportunity for you and what does that pipeline look like with those types of customers? and then i've got a follow-up.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so first of all, the individual opportunity itself is a very large opportunity. it's not a one-off, it's something that will continue as we go forward, as we understand it. it is a -- you can think of it as a general purpose implementation for one of their key application environments inside the organization. so, i really can't go much further than that. but it's not something that is unusual or extraordinary in a hyperscale environment. so, it is something that's easily transferable to other hyperscalers. it's not the -- by the way, it's not the first of the top 10 hyperscalers that we've sold flasharray//c into. it's just one that is significant for a single quarter and we do believe that this is something that we can continue to expand to other hyperscalers as well.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
and just to be clear too, in terms of the strength we're seeing in our q3 guide. look, when we exclude this great opportunity that we're seeing with flasharray//c in a top 10 hyperscaler, we're still in our comfortable 20%, plus 20% year-over-year growth rate, excluding that opportunity. so i think that's important to note as well in terms of the strength, is across the business and is across the portfolio. we're really excited about the flasharray//c opportunity, but it's really incremental to the strength we're seeing.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay, great. that's helpful. thanks for that. and then i was also interested in this comment you made on wage inflation. i guess it's tough to know kind of how that might play out over the next 18, 24 months. so just curious if you guys have any thoughts on what sort of inflation we'd be talking about? are we talking about few percentage points you think you might incur? or any kind of thoughts on quantification there?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
i don't want to go over -- i don't want to overestimate what it might be. but our thinking is it's going to be a few percentage points.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay, great, thanks a lot. appreciate it.
operator
your next question comes from the line of amit daryanani with evercore.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. i guess, i have two. first one, looking at the subscription growth metrics of 31%, which is obviously fairly impressive. and i think investors are going to just struggle with that number a bit. so i am wondering, is there a way to think about how much of this growth is coming from existing customers versus new customers? and then could you also quantify the size of some of the components that are well in the subscription line?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yes. we're not going to get into a whole lot of detail on that. now, obviously on virtual financial analyst day, we'll provide some color that hopefully you'll find helpful in terms of our subscription momentum. and look, nothing's changed significantly. we've got great momentum on our unified subscription with pure as-a-service that we've highlighted. portworx, still very important from us from a strategic perspective, but the performance is excellent. and obviously, our evergreen is our bread and butter, it's our baseline, largest piece, continues to be so for the -- in terms of what we're looking at for this year. so we'll get to more details on that as we look out to the analyst day. but that would be all for now.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
fair enough. and then if i could just follow-up, if i'm looking at the growth guide that you're providing for october quarter and the full year, the implication is obviously that october will be up 29%, 30% year-over-year. you've touched on that a bit. but then i think your implications for january quarter, it's going to decelerate to like 19%, 20%. i mean that's sort of a really good number, but i would love to understand why the deceleration, are you seeing a bit of a pull in or are you just being conservative at the implied jan quarter numbers? that'd be helpful.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
well, i think it's important that we've been talking about the large hyperscaler, with the top 10 hyperscaler on the flasharray//c that's putting some more strength on our q3 guide. but look, sequentially, it's -- even sequentially q3 to q4, i'm pleased with what we're seeing year-over-year close to 20% for the annual outlook exceeding 20%. so overall, quite pleased with it. don't really view it as a decel, especially when i think about our larger opportunity that we're digesting or expect to digest in q3 with the flasharray//c opportunity.
operator
and your next question comes from the line of kathy huberty with morgan stanley.
kathy huberty -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes, thank you. kevan, just a comeback to the third quarter contribution from the hyperscaler account, was that -- was the revenue contribution from that customer baked into the original for your revenue outlook? and are you expecting any contribution from that customer that would be material in the fourth quarter?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
that's a great question. look, when we were looking at the annual guide at the beginning, no, it's fair to say that we wouldn't have contemplated. so it's part of our beat, both from an annual perspective and how we're looking at it for q3. and we're not expecting a significant amount to come through in q4. we'd expect the larger piece in q3.
kathy huberty -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, thank you. and then just a follow-up, maybe for charlie, if we step away from the slower hiring in 2q, which i assume is more a function of the tight labor market, how are you thinking about hiring in the coming quarters to support the stronger demand you're seeing, and the intention to sustain growth rates north of 20% for the foreseeable future?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
it's a great question, kathy. obviously, we want to sustain the strength and momentum of our sales capability. so, a high degree of focus on sales teams, both us and internationally, and then continuing to develop -- further develop our infrastructure to being able to support sales. so, i would say largely, the areas of it, other areas that supports sales growth, but the large -- the largest focus is going to be on sustaining sales momentum.
kathy huberty -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, great. thank you. congrats on the quarter. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from line of the nehal chokshi with northland capital.
nehal chokshi -- northland capital -- analyst
thank you and congrats on the really strong ingredients. some beat [phonetic] and the 7% above concensus guide for q3 and the implied guide for q4. that's awesome. congratulations.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
appreciate it.
nehal chokshi -- northland capital -- analyst
yes. so just to be clear, this top 10 hyper-scaler revenue contribution for q3, very clear now, what was going to -- how much did it contribute during q2 though?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
we didn't have an impact for q2, nehal.
nehal chokshi -- northland capital -- analyst
no impact for q2. okay. great. and then you said that paas doubled in revenue year-over-year, but what about paas bookings?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
so paas bookings almost tripled, almost tripled year-over-year. yes.
nehal chokshi -- northland capital -- analyst
wow. okay. that's very impressive then. and then finally, you haven't had your long-term model listed in your presentation for a couple of quarters now. presumably, that's because you look to update at the upcoming investor day. is that correct?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
that's correct.
nehal chokshi -- northland capital -- analyst
okay, great, thank you very much.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
appreciate it.
operator
your next question comes from line of matt cabral with credit suisse.
matt cabral -- credit suisse -- analyst
yes, thank you very much. i want to dig a little bit more into the cloud block store. i think it's five, coming up in six months since you guys went ga on azure. just curious what the ramp has been there so far? and there's any way to compare and contrast what the ramp on azure has looked like compared to what you saw on aws the first time around?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, absolutely. well as we've said, in the past cloud block store, fundamental part of our overall pure as-a-service subscription. and no doubt, it was very critical in driving part of that growth of the pure as-a-service, as many customers already determine which of the hyperscalers they want to use. and it's been instrumental in several of our pure as-a-service deals, some with some very large, certainly fortune 50 companies that had set their sights on azure. so, from that standpoint, very strong. and then, with respect to actual deployment on cloud blocks, actually i'm going to let rob take that because he's the one that's been most tied into it.
rob lee -- chief technology officer
yes. so, on the deployments, azure has come on really strong, right? so we've seen -- we see customers now deploying across aws and azure, i would say demand for azure tends to be a little bit stronger. but if we step back from it, i think we look at cloud block store and portworx as a combination, really as forming the backbone of our cloud portfolio and we're seeing strength across the board there, really both from customers that are deploying in cloud day one with both portworx and cloud blocks are now available in multiple cloud providers, but as well customers that are starting with pure-as-a-service with the unified subscription on-premise, and then later on growing and transitioning into azure or aws over time. and so, we see both of those motions and i think that's just validates our strategy as well as thesis that customers continue to value the flexibility and uniformity that we're able to deliver across the prem, hybrid, cloud and multi-cloud environments.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
i will say, just to finalize our thoughts on cloud block store that, it is a fundamental part of the unified subscription. we rarely see -- although we do see some customers that will just go to cloud block store without having arrays on-prem. but far more customers are using it as a way for them to be able to transition from on-prem into the cloud. and therefore the -- it starts off as a unified subscription. and then they start to migrate whether it's for disaster recovery or other capabilities, they have test into their cloud environment using cloud block store. so it tends to be, first of all, an attractive element to the unified subscription. but secondly, taken advantage of subsequent to the engagement on the pure as-a-service.
matt cabral -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. that's really helpful. and then just a quick follow-up, you called out enterprise momentum several times in the prepared remarks and a couple of times in the q&a. but just wondering, if you can you spend a little bit more on just biggest contributors or drivers to that strength. and i'm curious if there is any way to think about how much of that momentum is just bigger footprint within existing customers versus getting into some net new wins versus the competitive landscape, and maybe those being a little bit bigger than they were in the past?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. it's actually all of the above. first of all, having a broader portfolio gets you more respect within an enterprise customer, whether that's a new customer or an existing customer. we had enterprise customers four years ago when i first joined and their first response to me is, pure you're great, but we can only use you for this specialized environment. why can't you build products that cover the rest of our storage footprint? and so having a broad portfolio is necessary to be a good partner to an enterprise customer. it also allows you to compete for larger deals inside those customers. and then for a number of customers, this was certainly true with a lot of banking customers. until we can reach a certain scale and address a certain percentage of their footprint, they actually didn't even want to talk to us, because they want to have, what are very significant relationships.
so really -- so then going back to the beginning of your question, it's been because of the investment that we've made into enterprise capabilities, both sales, as well as support. it's been investment in the breadth -- the broadening of the product line, and it's been about maturing our own organization in terms of how to work with enterprise customers. so, all of those have contributed to our ability to -- and our success that we've seen in expanding our enterprise business.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
just to add onto that, i think one of the areas that we haven't talked too much about today, in the portfolio is flashblade. and i think that's a great example of where we've invested in broadening the portfolio, broadening our enterprise capabilities and feature sets. and that's reflective in the strength we saw, flashblade did extremely well in terms of large deals. and just getting back to charlie's point, having the breadth of enterprise capabilities in the portfolio, whether it's flasharray//c, which we talked quite a bit about, flasharray//x or flashblade. having all of that together really just helps us go and prosecute these opportunities.
operator
and your last question comes from the line of matt sheerin with stifel.
matt sheerin -- stifel -- analyst
yes. thank you for sort of squeezing me in. charlie, in your opening remarks you talked about seeing somewhat of a slowdown in return to office on-prem as customers -- and certainly we've heard that from other companies as well. your guidance for the quarter is strong even without that hyperscaler deal. so could you give us more color on what you're hearing from customers and partners about timing of projects? and in your visibility, is it better or perhaps weaker because of that?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, i think our visibility into their build-outs has been excellent. it really has. so they share a very -- they share openly with us. obviously, planning of build outs take some time, so they do want to share openly. i would say that the returns -- we've been -- remember, there's only about a couple of months when there was people returning to the office and then it got slowed down right away. so most of the improvement we're seeing is from the improvement of working in a covid environment, not because things freed up tremendously over the summer. so our guide just -- as i mentioned before, just reflects the way the world is as we see it today, not based on any further opening up. we do think that when the world does open up, we'll see even better performance to be clear.
i would say that, if anything, on a very small basis what we did see was some projects move out, not because of covid, it was all because of customers' ability to get other products for their build-out with servers, networking, sheet metals, power supplies, whatever it might be, we definitely saw expected timelines push out a bit on -- in some customer environments. so -- but all that i think bodes well for us in the future as things improve.
matt sheerin -- stifel -- analyst
okay. thank you. and you talked a lot about the strengths you're seeing from the enterprise customer base. again, last quarter you called out commercial as finally picking up. is that continuing to hold up? are you seeing any other signs there?
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
it did hold up, but it didn't improve any more than it did last time. so that's what we're waiting for. as covid improves, we think commercial will pick up even more. but it did hold up certainly through this last quarter and we expect it to hold up through this quarter.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yes. i think the commercial business did really well. i mean, obviously coming off such a fantastic quarter last quarter and then holding on to that strength, i think is pretty impressive. so we were impressed with both enterprise and commercial.
operator
and this concludes the question-and-answer session. at this time, i'll turn the call back over to charlie giancarlo for closing remarks.
charles giancarlo -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, operator. well, q2 has really been a fantastic quarter for pure as our strategy and our execution have become evident this quarter. pure is being chosen because we deliver a leading and highly differentiated technology with also best-in-class customer experience. it's a very exciting time at pure and we're in a great innovation cycle with our portfolio and our sales momentum and our execution has never been stronger. i do want to recognize again, the hard work of all of our employees at pure, and the strong collaboration that we've had from our business partners, everyone's singularly focused on delivering strong results for our customers. thank you all and have a good evening.

operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen. thank you for standing by, and welcome to the pure storage fourth quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings release conference call. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. at the conclusion of our prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.
[operator instructions] as a reminder, this call is being recorded. i would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, mr. sanjot khurana. mr.
khurana, please go ahead.
sanjot khurana -- head of investor relations and corporate treasurer
thank you, and good afternoon. welcome to the pure storage fourth quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call. my name is sanjot khurana, vice president of investor relations and treasurer at pure storage. joining me today are our ceo, charlie giancarlo; our cfo, kevan krysler; and our cto, rob lee.
before we begin, i would like to remind you that during this call, management will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. these include statements regarding the covid-19 pandemic and related disruptions, our growth and sales prospects, competitive industry and technology trends, our strategy and its advantages, our current and future product offerings, and our business and operations. any forward-looking statements that we make are based on facts and assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them. our actual results may differ materially from the results forecasted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance.
a discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties relating to our business is contained in our filings with the sec, and we refer you to these public filings. during this call, we will discuss non-gaap measures in talking about the company's performance, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap measures are provided in our earnings press release and slides. additionally, when we refer to sales in our prepared remarks, we mean total bookings, excluding cancelable orders. this call is being broadcast live on the pure storage investor relations website and is being recorded for playback purposes.
an archive of the webcast will be available on the ir website and is the property of pure storage. with that, i'll turn the call over to our ceo, charlie giancarlo. 
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
hello, everyone, and welcome to our call. i hope you are healthy and faring well given the many challenges of the current environment. i'm very pleased to report that pure delivered a fantastic q4, capping off a great fiscal year. our quarterly revenue grew 41% over last year's strong q4.
this past quarter, we again enjoyed strong growth, especially in the americas, our largest theater and we grew across enterprise, commercial and public sectors. i'm especially pleased with our growth in both net new logos and subscription annual recurring revenue, indicating great progress against our long-term strategy. full year revenue growth was 29% and the annual growth of our subscription revenue was 37%. revenue growth and operational leverage drove strong profit and cash flow growth in fiscal '22.
as we stated in our financial analyst day presentation in september, our total addressable market of more than $60 billion across both storage and storage as a service continues to provide expansion opportunities for pure. we believe that our strong performance is clear evidence of pure's increasing strength. three things are necessary for sustainable growth, which we have steadily developed within pure: first, sustainable growth requires highly differentiated technology with sustainable competitive advantage. pure's focus on developing purity software and our direct flash technology to maximize the many advantages of solid-state storage is unique in our industry and has taken many years to develop.
second, sustainable growth requires a broad portfolio that addresses a full range of customer needs, a portfolio that we have steadily developed over the last several years. third, sustainable growth requires the ability to support customers in all major market segments, commercial, enterprise, public sector, and cloud. pure now has all three of these elements to drive our growth for many years to come. pure's highly differentiated technology enjoys a strong sustainable competitive advantage.
many of pure's advantages stem from core software architecture decisions that are practically impossible to retrofit into pre-existing software. among our advantages are the simplicity in the design and use of our products, the ability to realize the best price performance from raw flash, and the ability to perform nondisruptive upgrades for both hardware and software, which deliver a cloud-like experience. while some competitors make claims of nondisruptive upgrades in their marketing, they consistently fail to deliver. furthermore, pure's proprietary hardware provides higher performance, reliability, and longer lifetime while requiring less space, power, and cooling than competitors' commodity-based systems.
competitors would need entirely new designs and years of new software development to replicate pure's advantages. pure's growing portfolio of industry-leading storage and data management products has propelled the growth of our enterprise business to greater heights. customers appreciate the simplicity of our portfolio which supports the majority of their traditional workloads with just two hardware architectures sharing a common software architecture. and their cloud-native workloads with portworx all integrated through pure1 and all available as a service.
they appreciate our ability to provide common interfaces and apis between on-prem and the cloud. they have embraced our ability to support their development of cloud-native applications with portworx. they're excited by our vision to provide automated data management with pure fusion and portworx data services. and they are overjoyed as we consistently deliver nondisruptive upgrades year after year and soon decade after decade with our evergreen design, a model that has been claimed competitively but never replicated.
the effect of our portfolio is evident not only in our continuing penetration into large enterprise, but also in our recently announced collaboration with meta. meta chose pure when it needed a storage partner to deliver powerful and scalable storage capabilities for their ai research supercluster. with flasharray and flashblade, their ai supercomputer has unparalleled performance and benefits from a broad range of our technology's advantages, underpinned by pure's foundation of simplicity, reliability, and sustainability. we announced a record number of new products and services this past fiscal year, including purity upgrades for ransomware and disaster recovery, additions to our flasharray//c-series, flashstack as-a-service, pure fusion, portworx data services, and major enhancements to our pure1 digital experience.
this past december, we announced flasharray//xl, which delivers 5.5 petabytes of capacity in up to 80% less space and power than competitive all-flash solutions and it's off to a great start. our product pipeline for fy '23 is no less ambitious, and i am incredibly excited about the year ahead. our vision and technology to deliver a cloud operating model to our customers' multicloud data environment, spanning their private cloud and public cloud providers continues to resonate and grow. this vision is based on the concepts of first, providing common frameworks and apis to both on-prem and hyperscaler environments; second, enabling fully automated data management to it organizations through policy; and third, the abstraction of these it created data classes for developers access through api.
we are seeing strong interest in this transformational model built on pure fusion, portworx, and delivered by pure1. we have enjoyed great success with our strategy of delivering a simple set of evergreen data platforms that enables customers to focus more on leveraging their data than on managing their storage environment. customers have rewarded us with market share gains and recognized us with the highest third-party certified net promoter score in almost all industries of 85.2 for the calendar year 2021. from our primary focus on the commercial market just five years ago, we have expanded our skills and infrastructure to support all major markets.
today, our enterprise business model is fully capable of supporting the largest global organizations, both public and private, with a portfolio of products, subscription services, support, and professional services. we do this with the help of a growing set of capable partners. we're now adding an ability to serve large hyperscalers and msps. we are proud to partner with the world's largest global system integrators and managed service providers to make pure a preferred part of their solutions.
we recently announced a global partnership with kyndryl, combining the power of pure's offerings and kyndryl's expertise to deliver industry-leading solutions to customers' most complex challenges. our joint customers are already benefiting from this partnership. one of the world's leading shipping and logistics companies chose pure as-a-service to build a secure data infrastructure for its new logistics offering for its clients. being part of a major digital transformation to improve shipping and logistics worldwide, has special poignancy as we face supply chain challenges that continue to affect all companies.
i feel confident that we have one of the most robust supply chains in the business. pure has invested in strong relationships with our supply partners and flexible multisource global operations over many years and we benefit from the architectural advantages of our integrated hardware designs. while there have been numerous supply chain challenges over the last year, and we are certainly not invulnerable to disruption in the future, we have navigated and managed them well and continue to meet our customers' demands. earlier, i had mentioned that pure solutions are able to provide customers higher performance and reliability with significantly less space power and cooling than competitive all-flash products, in many cases, utilizing up to 80% less power in space.
lower energy use by our products will significantly reduce the environmental footprint of our customers' data centers. third-party reviewed competitive comparisons will be one part of our full environmental, social and governance, or esg report, which we will publish later this month. in our first ever esg report, we will identify our environmental achievements and future goals for improvement in our operations and downstream use of our products, as well as our current state and future plans on talent recruitment and retention and diversity, equity, and inclusion. and finally, our governance and business practices.
i would like to comment on three additional topics of broad current interest. first, the so-called great resignation, then inflation, and then our response to the russian invasion of ukraine. as is widely reported, employee attrition is elevated across all industries and especially in technology. however, the flip side of this coin is that there has never been a time in my memory when so much great talent was available all at one time.
and we saw a strong traction in hiring during q4. our continuing success, large market opportunity and high employee satisfaction scores have made pure a talent magnet. inflation is also real, and there is no countervailing benefit. i believe this will be with us for some time, and we have assessed impacts to employee compensation and other operating expenses, which we have considered in our guidance.
we are carefully monitoring the situation in ukraine. and i am dismayed by the wanton disregard for both national sovereignty and human life currently on display. our hearts go out to the people of ukraine and all those affected by the conflict. we have ceased all shipments in support services in russia and belarus, which represents a small amount of business for the foreseeable future.
we are providing support as appropriate to our employees and their families. in closing, i would like to thank our customers, partners, and especially our employees for their trust and support of pure this past year. through all of the challenges over the last several years, pure has thrived. we have innovated, we've grown.
we've battled competitors, large and small, and we've taken market share. most importantly, we have delighted ever more customers by delivering solutions beyond their expectations. this simple formula will continue to fuel our growth for years to come. over to you, kevan.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
thank you, charlie, and good afternoon. we saw outstanding execution and performance across our entire company, achieving record revenue, operating income and cash flows. demand continued to be very strong across our portfolio of solutions, services, and geographies, especially in the u.s. and canada.
although supply chain challenges continue to persist, we executed for our customers, delivering our solutions and minimizing delays. growth of our subscription business is robust as we continue to create value-based outcomes for our customers. subscription annual recurring revenue, or arr, grew 31% to nearly $850 million. also, our subscription net dollar retention or ndr at the end of the year exceeded 120% compared to our long-term target of 115% as a result of expansion growth from existing customers.
remaining performance obligations, or rpo, which includes our committed and noncancelable future revenue, was over $1.4 billion, growing at 29%. we acquired 470 new customers, reflecting increasing strength. new customer acquisitions were balanced across geographies, market segments, and our solutions portfolio. our total customer count now exceeds 10,000 customers, which also includes over 50% of the u.s.
fortune 500 companies. now turning to financial results for the quarter. total revenue for the quarter grew 41% to approximately $709 million. revenue in the united states grew 51% and international revenue grew 20% year over year.
subscription services revenue grew approximately 42%. for the full fiscal year, total revenue grew 29% to nearly $2.2 billion. our fiscal year includes 53 weeks contributing both additional revenue and costs. excluding the revenue contribution arising from the additional week, total revenue for the quarter grew approximately 37% and 28% for the year.
total non-gaap gross margins were nearly 69% this quarter. non-gaap product gross margins of 67% were slightly impacted by higher supply chain-related costs. we were very pleased with how we actively managed our supply chain challenges in partnership with our suppliers. our integrated software and hardware designs continue to be very valuable as we manage these challenges.
as we continue to sell the value of our solutions, we expect product gross margins to be in the high 60s, consistent with our long-range expectations. non-gaap subscription services gross margins were solid at 73% this quarter. we achieved record non-gaap operating profit of nearly $119 million and non-gaap operating margins of 16.8% this quarter while also continuing to make investments to drive growth. increased operating costs included higher compensation due to our strong performance, increased hiring, and an additional week of operating expenses of approximately $17 million.
non-gaap operating profits for the year also achieved a record high of $235 million and 10.8% non-gaap operating margins. as we have highlighted in previous quarters, the covid environment was a tailwind to our operating profits contributing approximately 2 to 3 points of benefit to our fiscal 2022 operating margin, slower than planned hiring, significantly reduced travel and the reduction of physical marketing events were the largest drivers. now let's turn over to the balance sheet and cash flows. we ended the quarter with over $1.4 billion in cash and approximately 4,200 employees.
our strong overall financial performance was also reflected in our cash flow from operations of $138 million this quarter. capital expenditures were approximately $21 million. for the year, we more than doubled our cash flow from operations to more than $400 million and generated more than $300 million of free cash flows. with our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, we paid off our outstanding credit revolver balance of $250 million after the close of our fourth quarter.
we continue to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases. we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares during the quarter and approximately 8.5 million shares during the fiscal year. our $200 million share repurchase program has been completed and we have also announced a new share repurchase program of $250 million. now turning to guidance, which is based on a 52-week fiscal year.
our performance in fiscal 2022 set new records for revenue, operating profit, and cash flows. our strong revenue growth this year benefited from a substantial sale of flasharray//c to meta, includes an extra week in the fiscal year, and reflects an easier compare to fiscal 2021, which was impacted by covid-related headwinds. we see broad-based demand strength continuing this year for our solutions and subscription offerings and expect our pure as-a-service offering to grow at a much faster rate than our overall company growth rate. as we consider these factors, we expect revenue in fiscal 2023 will be approximately $2.6 billion, growing 19% to 20%.
revenue in q1 will be approximately $520 million, growing 26%. operating profit substantially expanded this year as a result of strong operating discipline and operating leverage. as we have previously highlighted, operating profits also benefited from slower-than-anticipated hiring, less travel, and fewer physical marketing events due to the covid environment. while we do not expect the majority of these covid-related benefits to recur next year as business operations become more normalized, we anticipate operating margins to expand modestly through continued operating discipline and leverage.
we remain committed to investing in innovation for growth, while also contemplating higher inflation next year. with these considerations, we expect to achieve non-gaap operating margins of approximately 11.5% and non-gaap operating profits of $300 million for the year. non-gaap operating profit in q1 is expected to be $16 million. in closing, i am very pleased with our execution and performance.
our consistent commitment to innovation and creating best-in-class experiences for our customers are really the driving forces of our success as we have seen. and i want to thank our entire pure team and our channel partners for their outstanding execution this year. with that, i will turn it over to the operator so we can get to your questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] in the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. [operator instructions] we'll pause for just a moment to compile the q&a roster. and your first -- our first question comes from the line of amit daryanani from evercore.
your line is now open.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you and congratulations on a great set of numbers here. my question really is you officially announced meta as a customer and they had this white paper that sort of outlined their storage [inaudible] on the super ai cluster that they have. can you talk about sort of the breadth of this engagement? and i think you all know the revenue contribution from back in october, but maybe to talk broadly, what led them to choose pure storage versus building their own? and then what does it mean from a revenue perspective, if this cluster gets to one exabyte that they've talked about in their white paper?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
amit, charlie giancarlo here. thank you for opening up the questioning. so meta, i think, is a great example of the power of our portfolio because we had started working with meta, formerly facebook, actually some years ago using the flashblade platform on some of their ai initiatives. but as they look to scale out that ai initiative, what they really needed behind it was a data lake, something that could hold data at the right performance, although not necessarily to directly feed the gpus.
but that would provide high performance, but frankly, at a price that would compete with disk. and in addition, they had other constraints in their environment, space, power, and cooling being an important element. frankly, not only did they look at their own technology internally, but they looked at outside vendors as well. and at the end of the day, we were -- our flasharray//c product which forms that data lake behind the ai cluster was the only product that could satisfy all of the requirements on it.
but it really shows the power of portfolio that is, i think, driving our growth across enterprise and around the world. and we do believe that it's what's going to allow us to continue to expand our overall footprint. let me turn it over a little bit to rob lee here to perhaps give you a little bit more behind the super cluster and then kevan, on the revenue.
rob lee -- chief technology officer
yeah, amit, just to add on to what charlie said. again, i just highlight this is a great example of use case benefiting from the entire portfolio. as charlie mentioned, we started working with meta, formerly facebook, over five years ago, first supporting, i would say, their ai research environment, directly supporting data scientists, doing ad hoc kind of ai model training against the flashblade. and as that environment grew and continues to grow, they built around at a larger production ai supercluster environment, which meta has come out and described.
and now in that environment, what they look to pure to provide with flasharray//c is really what we have described as more of a general data storage, bulk data storage capability, right, something that provides a huge capacity, certainly high performance. and then meeting the balance of needs that charlie called out in terms of a very efficient power, cooling, and footprint associated with it. and so i think a couple of things of note here. one is, well: a, great validation of our technology and advantages, but b, i think it's a great sign that look, the transition from disk to flash is absolutely happening.
we see it in the enterprise. we're now starting to see it in the hyperscale environment. and we believe to a degree, this is not only happening, but it's inevitable.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
and i'll just close, amit, with some -- share some thoughts in terms of the revenue contribution. but without getting into specifics, obviously. certainly, from a revenue outlook, we've built some revenue in for meta. and i would say it's in line with our overall company growth rates for next year.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
perfect. that's really helpful. and if i could just follow up quickly on your commodity, i think, has been a big discussion, especially what's happening to nand pricing. i'd love to understand what are you seeing from a nand pricing perspective? and then what are you embedding really in the fiscal year guide relative to commodity prices?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
yeah. we're expecting that the constraints, let's say, in the nand production over the next couple of quarters is going to put upward pressure on nand pricing. we do expect that to flow through and eventually come back down in pricing later in the year. we're not expecting huge swings to be direct, but slight upward pressure in the early part of the year and then downward pressure later in the year.
that's our expectation. of course, events have a way of changing expectations pretty quickly these days. so -- but that's what we're currently going with.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of meta marshall from morgan stanley. your line is now open.
meta marshall -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks. wanted to see -- clearly, you guys stated you were seeing traction across a lot of different customer types. but just any details on kind of the magnitude of the beat, particularly as we look at the guide and we get to more of a seasonal kind of downtick there.
just any context for just where all of the upside came from? and then you noted that you were saying maybe that all of the covid savings or covid tailwinds don't come back or on the opex side, but just what you're expecting in terms of how much of that 200, 300 basis points would come back in fiscal '23?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
meta, first of all, welcome to pure. thank you for joining us. look forward to be working with you over the next -- for the foreseeable future. on your question, as mentioned, we really saw, from a product line perspective, broad-based strength and particular strength in the u.s.
i'd have to call out -- i'd have to say both commercial and enterprise were strong. commercial over -- we've been commenting on these two markets consistently quarter by quarter. commercial has been slower to come back during this latter covid period, but we really are starting to see some real strength in commercial building, especially over this last quarter. but our ability to be penetrating deeper and deeper into enterprise, both new customers, but in particular, penetrating more deeply in existing customers has been very strong, and it was really broad-based in the americas.
good strength internationally as well. but i'd say, this past quarter, the americas really -- has really shown it's -- the power of the it environment in the u.s. has been very strong.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yeah, i'd agree with that, charlie. i think the u.s., meta just had an outstanding quarter for us. in addition to what charlie was saying, i think what we're seeing in the u.s. is really leveraging our expanded product portfolio and technology and solutions.
with flashblade, we're really seeing some good traction on that front. so it's a shout-out to our sellers and channel in terms of the performance there. i think your next question was in terms of contribution with the covid tailwinds. i think it's probably fair to say around 2 points, meta, in terms of how we're thinking about that.
meta marshall -- morgan stanley -- analyst
perfect. thanks and congrats on the quarter.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of jason ader from william blair. your line is now open.
jason ader -- william blair -- analyst
thank you. hey, guys. i guess -- i thought it was a typo when i saw the number for the quarter, the revenue. i mean that's just a monster beat.
i guess relative to the guidance, can you guys help us just understand how much of the upside came from meta and how much came from other sources?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
jason, no confidence, a typo, really. look, jason, i don't think we could have or would have guided a quarter that was this strong. it was certainly a very strong quarter. but i think it really has to do with starting -- the company starting to hit on all cylinders as we identified a strong portfolio now.
the brand are very strong now across the board in terms of major markets. our ability to sell and support them now widely respected and simple fact that we can cover more of the use cases that they have with, without a doubt, the industry-leading products. and i think we're just hitting on more and more cylinders. in terms on -- kevan, do you want to cover the guide?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
well, yeah, and i'll just tack a little bit more on to that, right? so it's really interesting for us, right, because the linearity we saw was actually really strong all the way throughout the quarter, end to end, which was really impressive for us. again, the u.s. and canada, frankly, outdelivered for us. and it was across the board, as charlie said.
enterprise, strong; commercial, strong; public sector, strong. the other thing that was interesting is we did stress test a lot in terms of, hey, were we seeing a lot of pull-forward activity due to supply chain. and frankly, we didn't see anything abnormal to that front. so yeah, really strong for us.
jason ader -- william blair -- analyst
was meta a 10% customer for the year?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
no, i believe they were not.
jason ader -- william blair -- analyst
they were not. ok. and then one quick follow-up. on the -- i may have missed this if you talked about this, so i apologize, but the -- one of your competitors talked about constraints on low-level components, not on nand, but on low-level components in their arrays, which created some challenges in terms of shipments and overall in their guidance.
is that something that you guys saw? i think they talked about it happening kind of mid-december. and just curious as to whether you guys were impacted by that?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
yeah, absolutely. that's a big challenge across the industry. we've -- obviously, we sync up with other companies, other manufacturers and those low-level parts have been a consistent problem throughout the industry. so every -- almost every day, there's a new challenge that challenges the supply chain team.
so yes, no, it's a -- just to give you a sort of a broader view of the supply chain, i anticipate a question that might be coming up. we had indicated last quarter that we thought it would bottom out in q4. and it probably has, but it hasn't really improved. it's still bouncing along the bottom, i'd say.
and you never know another day when there's a new challenge that comes up, i think we've managed it well, but it's -- we're still waiting to see signs that we're on the upswing.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
it's almost becoming a new normal for us because obviously, this is the same, very similar challenges we were working through last quarter that we're very successful in partnership with our suppliers and delivering for our customers. but i'll tell you, i think the real benefits we're seeing is the value of our integrated hardware and software solutions that we over and over again keep talking about, and it just keeps getting validated as we're working through these challenges that charlie outlined.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of rod hall from goldman sachs. your line is now open.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah, thanks, guys. i want to ask the first question with regards to opex and opex leverage. i was just kind of looking at arista's opex, their sales, and marketing to sales costs about 8% and you guys are about 30%, and that's fair because you distribute to a bunch of enterprises and hyperscale is pretty new to you, but that's the sort of sales and marketing ratio that a company that distributes more to hyperscale is capable of. and i just wonder, do you think over time if hyperscale mix increases, the marginal opex related to that in either such a small number of customers, charlie, could start to approach that lower number.
i'm just wondering how you think about that hyperscale mixing into that sales and marketing costs. and then i've got a follow-up.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
right. absolutely. no, that is the right example, right? i mean if you look at arista's numbers, they operate on somewhat lower gross margin and higher operating margin due to lower sales and marketing. and that's the business model for selling into hyperscalers.
as we go down that path, the model for us will be mixed. that is to say that there'll be an enterprise business model that will have a higher gross margin, but higher sales and marketing expense and a cloud business model likely to have lower gross margin, but lower sales and marketing expense. those are the trade-offs that are made. my view is both of which should improve over time to give us higher operating margin.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
well, in our subscription businesses as well.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
and the subscription -- well, i mean, at higher gross margin as well.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
right. yeah. that's why i thought. thanks for all -- that's helpful.
and then my follow-up was the meta revenue up, down, or flat in q4 on q3?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
far down. i mean we just had a little bit of revenue coming in from our hyperscalers. so the majority of that revenue we saw in q3.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
and we should remember that generally, that is the way with large -- whether hyperscalers or service providers, it can be quite lumpy on a -- for an individual player.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that makes sense. and when you guys think about that revenue then, you talked about the growth of it being kind of in line with the company growth. i didn't know what you meant by that. are you saying sort of prorate the revenue you got in the second half like multiply it by two and grow that at the company rate? or are you saying look at the absolute total of revenue in the year?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yeah, keep it pretty simple, right? so when you take the outlook for next year and our growth rate, applying that on top of it, it's a general good framework to start out with.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
but the question is on top of what?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
what we did this year, what we did this year.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. just the absolute number, not prorated or anything.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
that's exactly right.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok, great. thanks, guys. appreciate it.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of pinjalim bora from j.p. morgan. your line is now open.
pinjalim bora -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thank you for taking my questions. congrats on an absolutely great quarter. it seems like -- charlie, listening to your vision in the prepared remarks, it sounded like portworx will play a bigger role in the future.
first, is that right? and then what are you seeing or hearing from customers with respect to the need for persistent storage and containers and kind of the maturity of container-based environments. and do you expect portworx to be an important component of the growth equation in 2022?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
well, first of all, we absolutely expect portworx and our continuing development of portworx and portworx data services to be foundational for us, for the future in next generation, what they call cloud-native development based on kubernetes and containers. it's a very different environment than traditional storage, traditional data environment and therefore required a new way and a new set of -- new software to be able to support that. and we have the industry-leading product in portworx. we're getting very extraordinarily good traction with portworx across a wide range and growing range of customers.
now that being said, i would not call containers or kubernetes mature by any means. we're still -- that is the industry and customers are still very early in their development of container-based applications, but it is a -- when i say that, it's because most of their new developments are in -- are on containers using kubernetes, but they have -- a very few of them have gone into production. and it will take, obviously, over time, years for those production workloads to reach full scale. but you always want to be on the leading edge of these very fundamental and foundational changes.
rob, do you want to add?
rob lee -- chief technology officer
yeah, no, absolutely. just to add to that, pinjalim, you asked the question about the growth and realization around stateful versus stateless containers. i think it's a great example of the maturity curve that charlie is talking about. and i think as the technology around containers matures and the adoption increases in the enterprise, we're seeing a couple of things.
one is a realization that state matters and being able to store data, get it back and have all the enterprise resilience around it, it really does matter, as well as the enterprise data management workflows that go around it, whether that's a backup, disaster recovery, security or migration needs. and that's where we really see customers across the board, recognizing that portworx is really the only solution out there that's able to solve the entire set of data challenges and needs around the container environment, whether that's the container storage infrastructure, the data management workflows or now with portworx data services, providing the data service and application tool capabilities with the integrated and curated database deployments. so net-net, definitely earlier in the maturity curve, but we're seeing great adoption and great growth within portworx, and we think that's going to be an increasingly important part of our strategy going forward.
pinjalim bora -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. thank you. and kevan, just a follow-up on the rpo growth. it's a fantastic number, 29% at $1.4 billion scale is pretty impressive.
are you seeing any kind of an elongation of contract duration that might be positively impacting that growth rate? or would you say it's more apples-to-apples in terms of contract duration year over year?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
hey, thanks for the question. and i think it's pretty consistent from a duration standpoint. and then again, i do point the analysts' face to our subscription arr because i really do think that's a really good measure of the health of our subscription businesses and obviously, ndr, which we published is greater than 120% exiting the year.
pinjalim bora -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. thank you. 
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yep.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of aaron rakers from wells fargo. your line is now open.
aaron rakers -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yeah, thanks. thanks for taking the questions. and i'll ask two as well since nobody stuck to the one. so i guess the first question i have is that in terms of the hyperscale cloud opportunity, we've talked a lot about meta.
but as we look out over the next 12 months, do you think we come out of that timeframe, saying, hey, it's more than just meta? have you had engagements with other cloud hyperscale customers on their own ai projects? do you expect that customer base to expand as you look forward?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
well, we're putting work and effort into it. so i certainly expect it to expand as we move forward. the exact timing of these things. this is -- as i'm sure you're familiar, i mean, these are like engineering designs.
it's like engineering, it's like selling into a new rack design for each hyperscalers, which itself takes several years for the hyperscaler. so a, it's a little bit difficult to predict the exact timing, but we do have conversations ongoing. it's certainly my expectation. but i can't say that it's near term.
it's -- but 12 months is a long time. i hope to have an update there. it's definitely a strategic importance to the company overall. rob, do you want to add? i'm sorry, go ahead.
rob lee -- chief technology officer
no, i think you hit it, charlie.
aaron rakers -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
and then as a follow-up, i know it's probably too early to kind of update analyst day kind of comments that you provided back in september. but just thinking about the growth that you had outlined that mid-teens cagr of revenue for fiscal '22 through '25. maybe you can help us rate it like -- did that assume that you were going to see some of these hyperscale cloud opportunities come to fruition? or was that not necessarily baked into that expectation at that point?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
i think it basically it didn't assume like a huge -- some type of hockey stick growth from the hyperscale environment. it assumed a moderate -- at the time, we obviously had already talked about a hyperscaler, which was meta, obviously, -- so we assumed we'd get some from that, but i can't say we assumed a lot of it.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think that's fair, charlie. in addition to that, we are assuming obviously acceleration with our subscription businesses overall as well, which is part of our long-range expectations in model.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of simon leopold from raymond james. your line is now open.
simon leopold -- raymond james -- analyst
i hate to sort of focus on the negative with all the things you -- metrics you've beaten on, but i want to make sure i understand what occurred in your gross margin, specifically, product gross margin in your january quarter in that, i was under the impression that october was depressed because of the customer mix. and i don't think you have the same customer mix with the meta shift down. so i want to maybe unpack this a little bit and then see if we can get an understanding of what affects, what elements are continuing in the april quarter, as well as the fiscal '23 outlook on product gross margin? thank you.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yeah, it's a great question, simon, and i'll take it. this is kevan. first of all, we're quite pleased with the product gross margins, but i do understand the question. and we certainly did see some impact with higher costs at the component level that charlie talked about, as well as indirect costs, including logistics that were impacting us, and we saw a little bit of that coming through this quarter.
but look, we're continuing to benefit from selling the value of the integrated hardware and software architecture that i've alluded to and charlie's alluded to and expect our asps to really be healthy, especially as our competitors who really sell in a cost plus start increasing the pricing, and we've seen that in the marketplace. and so in my prepared remarks, i talked about the fact that we continue to expect product margins to be in the high 60s, and that's again, consistent with our long-term expectations and understanding the challenges we're working through on the supply chain. so thanks for the question.
simon leopold -- raymond james -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of wamsi mohan from bank of america. your line is now open.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes, thank you. if i could just follow up on the prior question on product gross margins. if we go back to two quarters ago, we're talking about 330 basis points of margin compression. and clearly, the supply chain environment is quite challenged.
so as you think about this high 60s gross margin going into next year, is the underlying assumption that we're not going to see supply chain improvement? or is there embedded in there some -- a full year of hyperscale revenue that could play some depressing role in the gross margin mix at least?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
yeah. wamsi, i think it's -- you're asking a complex question. let me give it a start. first of all, we do think that we had some timing-related issues associated with the gross margin in q4.
it was not the hyperscaler related. when you have rapidly changing prices as we saw in our costs rather, as we saw in q4, you can't always adjust for them right away through asps. but we see very strong asps because of the value of our product. we expect that the -- unless we have new challenges, which we are -- which we're unaware in q1 and q2, we're expecting these temporary gross margin -- product gross margin costs to effectively pass through.
and we've been guiding for high 60s in our gross margin for many years. that's -- and so that's not a change from the past.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
you know, maybe i can add just a little bit more to that in terms of your specific questions. so to be clear, we did not build in degrading product gross margins due to hyperscaler transactions. so i want to be clear on that. we do expect supply chain challenges to continue.
but to charlie's point, we sell on value, always have. the value of our software both purity and pure1, the integrated architecture of the hardware and software. and that's what we've been doing even before, obviously, the supply chain challenges. and that's really the validation point that charlie is alluding to on the asps and why we believe our asps will respond accordingly and why we continue to believe that our product gross margins will be at our long-term expectations in the high 60s.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and if i have a follow-up. when we think about this hyperscaler revenue, i think, charlie, you mentioned that you first engaged with meta maybe five years ago.
obviously, it took a while to sort of get to a healthy revenue level there with that customer in this past fiscal year. so why should -- now that the proof of concept is sort of behind you, a lot of the technology like heavy lifting is sort of behind you, why should we expect growth rate to be in line with your aggregate growth rate when it's coming off a much smaller base and sort of it seems like a lot of the heavy lifting and proof of concept is sort of behind you, why shouldn't we expect a much faster growth on that piece of the business?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
well, wamsi, from your lips to god's ears. of course, it's certainly something that we hope to see. but of course, every new sale depends upon a new engineering engagement in a new data center or rack design with each customer, right? i will point out that while it took -- your chronology is correct. we sold them flashblade, and we have been selling them flashblade for ai uses over the last five years.
but the reason why we got the -- really i would say, generational and/or hockey stick type of order with flasharray//c had more to do with the fact that we -- that pure finally cracked the price performance level of disk, of midrange disk in such a way that it became compelling for a more traditional use case, which was a data lake type of use case. that's only just beginning. that level of price performance is just beginning. so it's a new, if you will, concept for the hyperscalers, and they're just getting used to it now.
and of course, now they have to design to it and so forth. so it's really a question of timing and the hyperscalers now starting to realize the opportunity for a new technology. i will identify one additional thing, which is that the benefit of our flasharray//c or qlc in delivering against the traditional use case is not limited to the price performance. we're able to deliver now just incredible performance relative to the environmental footprint of the storage involved, environmental in the case of power and cooling, environmental in terms of space and environmental in terms of landfill footprint.
if you waste footprint at the end of the day, much far less waste. so we think these are going to make a larger -- are going to be of larger importance to both enterprise and hyperscalers going forward.
rob lee -- chief technology officer
and wamsi, this is rob, if i could just add in. i think specific to your question, which was, hey, we've built this relationship with meta. how do we see the growth there? and why isn't that perhaps inflecting faster? i'll just go back to remind you that just like each hyperscaler firm and environment is different. each environment within a particular firm is different as well.
and so each one of those -- going back to charlie's comments, each one of those necessitating an engineering-driven almost design win process. now certainly being a partner for meta in one part of their environment and making them successful there helps us versus being in a new account. but just like we're having discussions with other hyperscaler firms, it's early days there. this is a longer process, much more of an engineering-driven design process in sale.
and so it's just going to take some time.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of sidney ho from deutsche bank. your line is now open.
sidney ho -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. congrats on a great quarter. my question is on the demand side. clearly, your peers talk about constraints impacting the growth that -- you guys did a great job managing the supply chain and upsided your own expectations.
do you think some customers are adopting your solutions because they couldn't get the hard-drive-based product? what -- so the question is, what do you think the sustainability of these wins once supply constraint frees? and then kind of related to that, do you think your as-a-service offering is benefiting from these constraints? and even if you have -- if you are, do you have enough capacity to serve this upside?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
i think, sydney, so on average, i would say, we don't see a significant amount of business that -- there are a few anecdotal cases where we did get business because of supply constraints, but they are few and far in between. i think this is very fundamental demand based on the expansion of our portfolio and our -- and the number, and the segments that we're able to go after right now. and so we do believe it's sustainable for the three reasons that i identified in my opening remarks, which is that we now have a much broader product line than we had just a few years ago. we sell into more segments.
and our technology is different -- it has sustainable differentiation, difficult for the competitors to be able to -- easy to claim but difficult to actually deliver. so i think for those reasons, we're on the early stages of sustainable demand growth.
sidney ho -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok, thanks. and then my follow-up question is, i want to ask about this rule of 40. clearly, fiscal '22 was a good year. i think it was up 44%.
i guess, you benefited from some of the reduced expenses from covid. how do you think about the rule of 40 this year? revenue growth is about 20%. so i guess, indirectly asking about your free cash flow of margins.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
it's a great question. and yes, we kind of outdid ourselves this year, didn't we, in terms of the rule of 40. it was outstanding. and any metric we look at including the rule of 40 framework.
but look, our fy '22 performance in of itself really doesn't change our long-term view that we've shared about sustainable improvement within the rule of 40 framework. and look, when we look at our fy '23 outlook, it's tracking well with the long-term expectations that we set and discussed on financial analyst day with you guys a couple of months back.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of nehal chokshi from northland capital markets. your line is now open.
nehal chokshi -- northland capital markets -- analyst
yeah, thank you. and stunning results, especially in the context that you accelerated a 41% year-over-year product revenue growth with virtually no help from meta, so spectacular. so the question actually is, is that you're guiding to 20% year-over-year growth in the april quarter, and you talked about that the driver here is a renaissance of it spending within the americas. why should this continue to [inaudible] into the april quarter and beyond?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yeah, i'll start, and i'll let charlie kind of hit it from a macro standpoint. but when we chatted about this in a fair amount, right? we're seeing strong demand across our portfolio, which obviously has been expanded. but we're seeing good success across our entire portfolio, including our subscription businesses. key markets, key geographies, or peak business no matter what we're looking at, we're seeing strength.
so that's a plus for us in terms of the demand signal that we're seeing. but i also think when you think about our fy '23 outlook for revenue growth, just a few reminders for you, right, in terms of fy '23 compare. obviously, we had the large opportunity with meta that was helping us out in fy '22. we have an extra week of revenue in '22.
and again, without taking anything away from our outstanding performance in fy '22, our growth rate was simply an easier compare because obviously, fiscal '21 had some covid-related headwinds that we're working through. so and then when i complement later on, the pure as-a-service growth with cloud block store that we expect that growth to significantly outpace our company revenue growth rate for next year. and as a reminder, with pure as-a-service, revenue is recognized over time. so obviously, there's an impact there.
but hopefully, that's helpful for you.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of tim long from barclays. your line is now open.
tim long -- barclays -- analyst
thank you. just one follow-up and a question and a follow-up. just i'll kill the hyperscale one more time here. i think from one of the answers, just curious if when you think about some of the other large customers since you were in facebook for a while, you had at least somewhat of an advantage.
was one of the answers implying that for the other large hyperscalers, you don't have that same level of relationship coming in? therefore, it's a little more challenging. and then the second question is if you could just talk a little bit about kind of deal size and particularly cross-selling across -- more broadly across the products, i think you talked about flasharray//ex doing really well and obviously c has done well. so can you just give us some color around cross-sell and how that's impacting repeat sales and deal sizes? thank you.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
you bet. thanks, tim. so regarding the hyperscaler, we're not necessarily strangers to our hyperscalers, but if we are in them, we tend to be in their it organization, lessen their production organization. and it's a different -- as you may know, those are different relationships.
we do get -- we have high marks in their it organizations, but it's still different. and as i said, remember, it is an engineering design win that has to go in more like a chip sale, if you will, than like a traditional enterprise system sale, so they take a while. highly integrated with their teams, and we are at earlier stages, no doubt, we were already engaged in a production environment in facebook. so that's certainly part of it.
in terms of the broader portfolio, what's really interesting here is just having the broader portfolio convinces customers to take us into more of their environment and greater amounts of their wallet spend. and so regardless -- and i don't mean to diminish, if you will, the portfolio sale that does take place. but even without a portfolio sale, it's opening up new opportunities for us. a significant portion now of our deals are portfolio sales.
that is more than one product going in at the same time in the transaction that takes place. so that's growing nicely as well. but it's really convince customers that we're a vendor that, frankly, any time that they're looking to put in a new storage capability or replacing the existing storage capability that they have to consider us.
tim long -- barclays -- analyst
ok. thank you.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. your last question comes from the line of krish sankar from cowen and company. your line is now open.
krish sankar -- cowen and company -- analyst
yeah, hi. thanks for taking my question. and charlie and kevin, thank you very much, and congrats on the great results. i have two quick questions.
one is on the profitability. what gives you the confidence in the profitability for the whole year? i understand you spoke about opex going up because of inflation and covid costs of working, but like your inventory is also at the all-time low. so i'm just trying to figure out, is there -- what is the level of confidence on profitability? and then i had like a big picture question for charlie. thank you.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
hey, welcome, krish. i know you're new to the community as well in pure. so welcome to you. and yes, let's spend a little bit of time on profitability.
and i think we spent a fair amount of time walking through our thoughts on the gross margin side for product. we haven't spent much time on the subscription gross margin, which as you saw, was quite solid for us both for the quarter and for the year. and we think that trajectory will continue. and look, i just -- when you look at the operating leverage and discipline that we achieved this year.
in addition to the covid tailwinds and primarily within go-to-market sales and marketing, although all areas really benefited this year. but we're just going to continue that momentum simply, right? so we're going to continue to invest in growth, which is an absolute priority for us. but with that discipline and growing our global workforce, we think we can continue on our journey of increased profitability and feel quite comfortable with our modest operating margin expansion.
krish sankar -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. thank you for that, and thanks very much for the kind words. and then just as a quick follow-up for charlie. you spoke about it spending.
i'm just kind of curious like -- there are some views that it spending growth was strong last year and might grow this year, but maybe the second derivative turns negative. so i'm kind of curious from your viewpoint, was there any budget flush in q4 and things normalized this year? or is it -- how to think about it spending as a whole relative to q4 and into fy '23 for you?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
yes. we had a very strong linearity throughout the quarter. so there was no specific budget flush, either through december, which would typically be when most companies have their fiscal year, or to the end of our fiscal year, which was end of january, beginning of february. so no, i can't say budget flush was much of a consideration at all.
it was really -- i'll go back and say, that was really based on the overall strength of our business and competitiveness of our portfolio. looking forward, obviously, we have better insight into the first half of the year than the second. and as we look at both industry and economic watchers, as well as other companies in the it space. we seem to see a theme of believing that this first half or at least more confidence in the first half than the second half.
so i think that's probably more of what goes into the thinking.
operator
thank you. this concludes the question-and-answer session. at this time, i will turn the call over back to charlie giancarlo for closing remarks.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
i want to thank you all for joining us today and especially meta and krish, who are with us for the first time. certainly, here at pure, we're looking forward to not only this quarter but to our sales kickoff, which starts next week, and i'm going to welcome all of our sellers. it's going to be virtual, hopefully for the last time, this time around. but we are broadcasting to you for the first time legally maskless from our mountain view headquarters, and we're hoping that's a sign of things to come.
thank you all very much again for joining us and look forward to talking to you next quarter.

charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. pure once again delivered very strong results this quarter in the midst of a highly dynamic environment. we drove 50% year-over-year revenue growth with exceptional performance in both u.s. and international markets.
enterprise expansion continues, experiencing strong growth year over year. the pure brand is now both highly recognized and highly respected in enterprise customers worldwide and is considered a must-have in any storage consideration. we were especially delighted this quarter that a large telecom customer expanded their relationship with pure, selecting our flasharray product line for their 5g deployments. our industry-leading subscription services business grew 35% over the same quarter last year.
pure's unique evergreen and pure-as-a-service models continue to resonate strongly with customers and differentiate us from the rest of the industry. next week at our annual accelerate conference in los angeles, we will announce further expansions of our evergreen portfolio. customers such as [inaudible], which provides predictive behavioral analytics, will share stories of how multigenerational evergreen upgrades have provided huge benefits including lowered operational costs and complexity, increased uptime, and lower energy consumption, yielding greater environmental sustainability. on this very topic, we released our first-ever environmental, social, and governance, or esg report this past quarter.
on particular note, we were proud to show that our products make a significant and immediate reduction of data center energy usage. pure positively improves our customers' environmental footprint by requiring substantially less power, space, and cooling and by producing less waste than both legacy solutions and current competitive systems. customers that deploy pure are able to reduce direct energy usage in their data storage systems by up to 80%. they are also able to reduce their data center's contribution to e-waste.
more than 97% of pure arrays purchased 6 years ago are still in service benefiting from our industry-leading evergreen program, which actively reduces e-waste while also saving customers' time, money, and effort. in our esg report, we commit to extend our leadership by further reducing our scope 3 emissions by 66% per petabyte by 2030. operating profit was very strong this quarter, continuing the trend of past quarters and benefiting from the combination of increased scale and prudent expense management. our investment in research and development remains strong, demonstrating our commitment to innovation and belief that data storage and management is high technology and requires the same level of investment as other critical technologies.
too many competitors in our industry actively promote and invest in storage as a commodity. for both enterprise customers and developing modern private and hybrid cloud solutions as well as cloud service providers, pure delivers the flexibility, simplicity, and agility required by today's operations and applications environments. a key milestone we achieved last month was releasing both pure fusion and portworx data services for general availability. pure fusion provides an end-to-end storages code platform for organizations that want to create a cloud operating model to automate and deliver data services to their organizations.
portworx data services deliver single click deployments of multiple data services for search, event streaming, no sql databases, and more. together, these two products allow customers to create a cloud operating model, automating data management tasks and delivering customized data services to developers and applications, through a simple unified control plane. with these products, customers will be able to modernize their data center operations, avoiding existing highly manual and costly operations for both traditional and cloud-native workloads. flasharray, flasharray//c, and flashblade all saw strong growth during the quarter, setting multiple individual records.
unstructured file and object data makes up the majority of data worldwide, and flashblade has taken the lead in penetrating the file and object workloads that require high performance such as eda, advanced analytics and ai, and rapid recovery. however, the vast majority of unstructured data continues to exist primarily on lower-cost disk-based storage systems. please join us next week at our accelerate conference for a game-changing announcement on flashblade. we continue our progress toward creating the all-flash data center, expanding into higher performance tier zero workloads with flasharray//xl while also expanding our leadership in qlc.
with our unique directflash technology, we're using qlc to close the price gap with magnetic storage. using the latest developments in solid-state storage to overtake the lower-cost magnetic market requires sophisticated software and years of experience. we believe we have a multiyear advantage in delivering this price-performing qlc technology, and we'll showcase this next week. this past quarter, i had the opportunity to meet with many of our customers, partners, and team members in europe and the middle east for the first time in over two years.
it was wonderful to strengthen existing relationships and build new ones. and it's impossible to overstate the pleasure and the effectiveness of resuming face-to-face meetings. these meetings made clear that our customers' confidence in pure is high, that our brand is strong and getting stronger and that we are clearly differentiating ourselves in the market. simply put, our messages are being embraced, that data storage is high technology, not a commodity as our competitors promote, that customers can build the cloud operating model for themselves and that evergreen is a better way to buy and operate their infrastructure.
we are also aware of current industry and customer concerns. of course, one of these concerns is supply chain. this remains a challenge across industries and around the world. pure's focus on a simplified, consistent and efficient architecture across our product line has served us and our customers well as fewer components means lower cost, lower waste, and less supplier risk.
our architecture and world-class hardware design team means that we can quickly address component supply disruptions with design modifications. and as we've stated before, we have invested for years in strong relationships with our supply partners and flexible, multi-sourced global operations. i'm very proud of the way our extended team have worked together to continue meeting customer demand with minimal disruption. another area of concern is inflation and its effect on the economy and on demand.
we believe inflation will be present for some time and will also cause both stock market rebalancing as well as monetary and fiscal responses. and this will certainly have economic effects in our market. however, we believe its influence on it customer behavior will be muted in aggregate and even less for pure. first, enterprises have now made digital transformation top on their list for the success of their organizations.
next, we believe pure has entered a second phase of growth, enabled by an expanding portfolio of highly differentiated and leading products as well as sales and business models spanning commercial, enterprise and cloud customers. another area of concern is cost inflation, coupled with the so-called great resignation. we have seen higher-than-average levels of attrition over the last year, but lower than what has been reported for the industry as a whole. while we do expect somewhat higher labor costs this year, we expect labor cost increases to moderate going forward.
recently reported slowdowns of hiring in the tech space will soften the demand for technology professionals, which will, in turn, reduce attrition and wage inflation. we believe that this marks the beginning of a return to the old normal. pure is a great place to work as validated by both external recognition and our own internal surveys, which has enabled us to recruit and retain top talent. our brand and our strong talent acquisition team are attracting top performance across industries, and we are hiring to our planned targets.
the final item i'd like to touch upon is the european economy given the effects of general inflation and russia's invasion of ukraine. inflation, especially in energy, is projected to dampen european economies in the near term. while this may somewhat reduce overall investment capacity of european-based businesses, european customers have indicated that investment in it is required to make up for the loss of other business modalities, as noted earlier. furthermore, higher energy costs are already increasing demand for it equipment that is energy efficient, something that pure excels in.
we believe that this represents another opportunity for pure to pick up more market share. the bottom line is that technology is now the no. 1 driving force of enterprise strategy and business transformation. and pure is the innovation and customer experience leader in one of the largest segments of technology investment.
we believe that we are now positioned to see secular growth, less affected by this economic cycle than our competitors. our full views of the impact of all these events are taken into consideration in our guidance. overall, we have never been more optimistic about pure's opportunity and growth prospects. despite pandemic, war, and market turmoil, pure has thrived and grown.
we have only gotten stronger over these last several years, and we expect to delight ever more customers in the years ahead. i'll now turn the call over to our cfo, kevan krysler, for a deeper look at the numbers.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
thank you, charlie, and good afternoon. robust demand across our portfolio, outstanding execution, and high resilience continue to be the constant, contributing to our sustaining momentum and our very strong performance this quarter. we again saw solid demand across our portfolio of solutions, services, and geographies. we saw impressive growth in our key international geographies as well as the u.s.
we continue to minimize delays and deliver for our customers as the backdrop of a challenging supply chain environment has not improved. we also achieved increased profitability in cash flows during the quarter, resulting from our revenue growth and continued operational discipline despite broad-based inflationary pressures. the strength of our subscription business continues as subscription annual recurring revenue, or arr, grew 29% to $900 million, remaining performance obligations, or rpo grew to $1.43 billion. our rpo balance when compared to q1 of last year reflects a reduction of approximately $32 million relating to product shipments for an outstanding commitment with one of our global system integrators.
excluding these product shipments, our rpo also grew 29% year over year. we continue to be very focused on growth of our new customer business, which has improved as we increase our travel. our total customer count reflects the acquisition of approximately 360 new customers this quarter and includes approximately 54% of the u.s. fortune 500 customers.
total revenue for the quarter was exceptional, growing over 50% to over $620 million. approximately $60 million of our product revenue upside this quarter was with several of our larger enterprise customers in the u.s. that we had originally forecasted to close in the second half of our fiscal year. our customers were pleased we were able to deliver our solutions against the earlier schedule, which is a testament to the agility and resilience of our technology and supply chain.
revenue growth when excluding these transactions was still a very strong 36%. revenue in the u.s. grew 57% and international revenue grew 33% year over year. subscription services revenue grew approximately 35% year over year and represented approximately 35% of total revenue.
non-gaap total gross margins were solid at 70.6% this quarter. as we have continued to highlight, we believe our integrated software and hardware designs continue to be a key differentiator that our customers appreciate and value. high performance, simplicity, sustainability, and resilience of our solutions are key factors contributing to our product gross margins of 70% this quarter. non-gaap subscription services gross margins also continue to be strong at 71.5% this quarter.
we were very pleased with achieving non-gaap operating profit of over $85 million and non-gaap operating margins of 13.8% this quarter. the strength of our operating profit and margin during the quarter was further improved by transactions that occurred during the quarter but were forecasted to close later in the year that i mentioned earlier. now let's turn to the balance sheet and cash flows. we ended the quarter with over $1.29 billion in cash and approximately 4,400 employees.
cash flow from operations was over $220 million this quarter. high collections benefited both from robust sales in both q4 and q1. higher profitability was also a contributing factor. capital expenditures were approximately $33 million during the quarter.
as mentioned last quarter, our outstanding credit revolver balance of $250 million was paid at the beginning of this fiscal quarter. we returned approximately $66 million of capital to repurchase slightly over 2.1 million shares during the quarter. we have approximately $184 million remaining from our $250 million share repurchase program. now turning to guidance.
clearly, we are executing well against our strategy of driving strong revenue growth and continued improvement in profitability. we expect continued demand strength in q2 with estimated revenue to be approximately $635 million, growing approximately 28%. we expect non-gaap operating profit to be approximately $75 million in q2, representing approximately 11.8% non-gaap operating margin. given our q1 performance and outlook for q2, as well as consideration of the current macro environment, we are raising our annual guidance for the full fiscal year.
we now expect that revenue for fy '23 will be $2.66 billion, growing approximately 22%. non-gaap operating profit is estimated to be approximately $320 million, representing approximately 12% non-gaap operating margin. revenue and estimated profits from transactions that were projected to close later in the year, but closed during q1 were included in our original annual guidance. in closing, our team and partners continue to deliver as the results this quarter were exceptional.
our sustained commitment to innovation provides our customers with solutions that are highly performing and reliable. on integrated software and hardware that require fewer components consume substantially less energy and space and produce less waste than other flash storage alternatives in the market. strong demand for our market-leading solutions and excellent execution, in particular to our supply chain, providing our leading storage and data management solutions to our customers when and where they need it, will help us deliver 22% annual revenue growth, along with 12% non-gaap operating margins. with that, i will turn it over to the operator so we can get to your questions.
operator?
",":
operator
[operator instructions] the first question is from the line of simon leopold with raymond james. you may proceed.
simon leopold -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. i wanted to first to help -- get a little help on, charlie, your comments around the macro. it sounds like you're acknowledging the environment is more difficult, yet you sound quite upbeat. i'd like a better understanding of what's really informing your view of how pure should be more resilient than its peers? and essentially, what are your customers telling you that give you the kind of confidence that you're essentially giving us yet acknowledgment that the macro is more challenging.
what -- how do we put these things together? and just as a very quick follow-up, if you guys could give us a little bit of insight regarding the recent announcement you made with a partnership with snowflake. i'd like to hear about that as well.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
very good. thank you, simon. i hope you're well. so simon, our -- what we're seeing is strong momentum in the market overall.
all of our products, customers buying more, the fact that we have a stronger and broader portfolio now being brought into a much greater set of opportunities in large existing customers and a stronger brand that's allowing us to penetrate net new logos and to penetrate with larger opportunities in larger companies as a net new logo. so we're actually seeing strength. and just to address your question, i would say that our -- the way we're looking at the macro is a little bit different. i would say we have not yet seen affects -- the macro affecting us or the customers that we speak to, but we are not blind to the fact that the macro and the possibility of economic slowdown can affect us going forward.
so i would say what we're currently seeing -- what i'm currently seeing in the market through last quarter, continues to be strong demand by it customers and then a greater acceptance for pure overall, just the strengthening, if you will, of our brand and our value proposition -- and the breadth of our value proposition to our customers. and i'm going to let rob answer the question on snowflake.
rob lee -- chief technology officer
yes, simon. this is rob. so to answer your question on snowflake, look, we're super excited about the joint hybrid cloud analytics solution that we announced earlier this month. this is the first step in a strategic partnership that we're forging with snowflake.
and we think that this joint solution is going to be a great fit really for customers who would benefit from the power of cloud-based data warehousing, but would also benefit from holding either tighter control or -- over their data or want to manage and operate that data in their on-premise environment. we see early customer demand for these types of solutions for security reasons, customers that need to hold and manage the data more tightly for security compliance as well as customers who are generating a lot of data in the on-premise environment, that may want to share that data across multiple tool sets. and so like i said, early days, but we're seeing good signs of early interest, and we think this is just a great joint solution to bring the two technologies together for customers.
simon leopold -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
the next question is from the line of pinjalim bora with j.p. morgan. you may proceed.
pinjalim bora -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thank you very much for taking the questions. charlie, kevan, and everyone else, it seems like a really solid quarter. i had to look at the number twice, again, i guess, for the second quarter in a row.
but charlie, i wanted to ask you on supply chain. pure obviously has done an incredible job in managing the supply chain until now, and it seems like you're not getting affected at all. however, we do see casualties all over in the field. so -- are you -- as this kind of elongates or prolongs, i should say, for a longer time, are you seeing any streams developing which investors should be aware of that might impact pure over the six to 12 months if this kind of environment prolongs on the supply chain side?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
thank you, pinjalim. it's a great question. let me characterize the supply chain environment now. we generally -- and if you were to ask our supply -- our operations team or engineering, they would tell you that the situation has not gotten better.
it's changed in character perhaps a bit, but we still see surprises on decommits. obviously, things like shanghai shutting down means a lot of background work to rebalance and to find new sources of supply for various subassemblies and so forth. so it's a constant stream of challenges that are being thrown at us from a supply chain perspective. i would say that we've minimized to the point of almost nonexistent, the effect on our customers.
but it's certainly affecting us a lot. our teams are very, very busy, and i want to take my hat off to them because there's a lot of work that goes into this. but as kevan mentioned, as did i in our prepared remarks, we have fewer parts that we need to worry about. that gives us more optionality.
we have -- because we design our own hardware rather than most of our competitors are using commodity parts, they have less choice, less flexibility. so it gives us greater flexibility and our goal is to make sure we have a minimum effect on our customers. and we were fortunate to actually be able to accelerate some of the shipments this quarter, as kevan noted. but i knock on wood as i talk about these things because the supply chain remains challenging.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
two other things i'd add to that is high confidence with the risk that charlie alluded to. i'd say the -- the other thing i'd add to it is our supply partners are doing a terrific job as well. and the three factors combined, i think, really drives the sustainability confidence that we have around the supply chain even acknowledging the risks that we've alluded to. the other thing i'd point out is nand is not subject to the same types of challenges and constraints that we see across -- really around the ic side and semiconductor side.
and so obviously, that's the biggest part of our bom and materials, and that's an important call-out as well.
pinjalim bora -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
understood. and a quick follow-up for kevan. i had to really squint to find [inaudible] the press release. but i want to ask you on the subscription revenue side, it seems it was in line to consensus.
when i look at the sequential growth, it seems like it's not that much. and then when i look at subscription arr, net new growth seems like it's decelerated a bit. was this mainly kind of a capex-led quarter versus unified subscription led?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
i think that's right. that's a good way to be thinking about it. i mean we had a lot of volume coming through on the capex side. but look, the subscription business continues to be strong.
arr growing 29%. i would be expecting variability quarter to quarter. we're very focused on accelerating growth with our partner ecosystem, a lot of great energy out there and looking forward to accelerate and talking to our partners around pure as-a-service. we've got some key milestones that we've identified around general availability for pure fusion and imported data services.
and really, this takes us on a roadmap that we've talked about that charlie has laid out around really establishing a cloud operating model for every customer no matter where their workloads are being run. i'd say stay tuned, too. we're very excited with some new announcements of evergreen at accelerate as well.
pinjalim bora -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. congrats again, and thank you for taking the questions.

the next question is from the line of aaron rakers with wells fargo. you may proceed.
aaron rakers -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yeah. thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on the great results. i guess the first question i wanted to ask is that when i look at your gross margin at 70% on the product line, it would really imply that you've not seen any incremental deployments with one of your large hyperscale cloud customers. so i guess first question is, is that a fair assessment? and i guess, on the heels of that, how are you thinking about that hyperscale customer, meta, fully deploying their ai project through the course of this year, how that factored into the expectations?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
yes. thanks, aaron. so you're correct. we've not seen this quarter substantial revenues from the nature of the hyperscaler that you spoke about before.
we do -- but we've also been making good progress on both the discounting front as our -- as the market has stabilized, if you will, from a pricing standpoint as well as the ability to extract more value from our products overall. so i would say that we've been able to manage the gross margin, i think, very well. and i'll let kevan answer the question. well, actually, i'll take this one.
as we discussed when we first started speaking about the meta win, and that was before they permitted the use of their name, we indicated that these types of sales tend to be somewhat episodic as they build out their data centers on specific quarters. and this is one of the light quarters, but we continue working with them. we're certainly optimistic on future orders, but it will be on their time frames.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yes. and i think to be clear, that was expected, right?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
very much expected. we're not expecting the sales this quarter. that's correct. right.
aaron rakers -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yes. that's very helpful. and i guess i'm just curious, given the momentum that you not only saw this last quarter, but you've seen these last couple of quarters, how has the competitive landscape reacted? what have you seen? i know that dell emc saw a little bit of growth, 9% growth this last quarter in your storage business. i'm just curious, have you seen any changes on the competitive landscape at all?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
yes. it's relatively minor to be honest with you. we tend to be competing against the same set of products in the same type of environments with the same set of customers. obviously, as we expand our sales force, we're competing across a greater set of customers, a larger set of customers, which is a good thing.
we get in more fights and more at bats. and our win rates are very good. so i would say -- and our brand is certainly helping. the fact that we're now -- i think customers believe that we have to be in any competitive bake-off that they may be performing.
so i would say that -- and i'll let rob contribute here, but i haven't seen anything terribly substantial from the competitors in this space.
rob lee -- chief technology officer
yes, aaron, i'll just add. i think the biggest takeaway is that, from my view, we really remain standouts as we look at the competitive set in terms of having really differentiated technology as well as, as charlie talked about in his prepared remarks, our thesis in investing in innovation to further expand those -- that differentiated technology. if you look at what we're doing with qlc to go after disk and hybrid. if you look at what we're doing with flasharray and extending that family into xl, to go after higher performance, with pure fusion, now ga and with portworx data services, and not to mention significantly more to come next week.
i think this is just an area where we see a great opportunity set out there for us, a lot of runway ahead of us to go grab more market share. and i think the biggest standout is that we don't see any of the competitive announcements materially changing that landscape.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
actually, aaron, let me also answer it with one additional comment, which is we're just playing a different game than our competitors. our competitors play a commodity game. they've been marketing their products. they've been marketing storage as a commodity.
the customers should only care about price and nothing else. and we're playing a high technology game. we invest in it like it's high technology. it's an entirely different business strategy, and it's going to be very difficult, i think, for them to respond.
aaron rakers -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thank you.

the next question is from the line of amit daryanani with evercore. you may proceed.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
yep. thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a great quarter. i guess my first one is really, charlie, you sort of talked in your prepared comments about pure has entered a second phase of growth in its journey. i'm hoping you could talk a little bit about what does that mean for pure? because when looking at the new customer additions, for example, that definitely inflected higher pretty materially.
but what is the second phase of growth mean for the company? are you seeing engagements with bigger enterprises? or are you seeing a quicker land and expand? just maybe help frame what does this mean? and does that potentially inflect growth higher as you go forward?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
yes. what we mean by second phase is if we look back, our first phase of growth was building an award-winning product in a unique environment where really for many years, it was the only product of its type, and therefore, allowed us very, very rapid early growth. and as our competitors started to respond, they were able to use their larger sales forces and their greater portfolio to compete with us more effectively and so our growth slowed a bit. we've responded over the last several years as our longtime investors know, with continued investment in r&d and in particular, an investment in broadening out our sales focus and capabilities, sales, and support such that we could support enterprise customers with a larger portfolio.
and now we're seeing the fruits of that bear out. and so the second phase of growth is the fact that we can penetrate more into larger customers with an expanded and superior portfolio, and that's going to give us a runway, a pretty long runway to continue what i believe is going to be a second phase of growth. and we're now -- we now have the scale, if you will, to compete with any of our competitors and deploy our unfair advantage of leadership products. so that's how i phrased the second phase of growth.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. and then if i could just follow up really quick. the upside in growth -- in revenues, i'm sorry, that we saw in the quarter, right? and i think, kevan, the way you laid it out, it was sounding like $60 million of that, call it, was from pulling from the back half and $40 million was more organic. i'm curious is the outgrowth that pure is seeing more a reflection of the fact that you are resonating better with customers on the engagement charlie is that what you talked about? or is it very simply the fact that you probably have better supply ability and so you're getting incremental market share because you are the one with better supply versus your peers.
i'm curious do you think better supply is playing a part in this outgrowth? or is it more fundamentally driven?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
well, look, i mean -- this is kevan. i'll start with that, and i'll let charlie add to it. i'm not sure it makes sense to decouple supply versus the power of our portfolio and our technology. i mean when you look at the architecture of our technology and how we're leveraging software and how we -- from an architecture standpoint, require less components, simpler in terms of architecture.
that's obviously helping us a lot on the supply side. but then that's also what really resonates for customers, right? it's performance, it's resilient. it's simple to use. and the -- our esg report, we've got some just kind of stunning stats in terms of what we're doing in terms of sustainability and in energy reduction with the architecture that we're leveraging with our portfolio.
so i would actually say that the two go together from my perspective. charlie, any other thoughts?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
that says it all, kevan. really do. mic drop.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
perfect. thank you.

the next question is from the line of rod hall with goldman sachs. you may proceed.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah. hey, guys. thanks for the question. i wanted to go back to the $60 million and just try to understand how we should be thinking about that? in other words, are we -- should we be thinking about it as backlog that you had good execution against supply so you were able to kind of go ahead and deliver it? or more a customer coming back to you and going, ""hey, we were thinking about doing this in h2.
we really want to accelerate that."" i'm just kind of trying to figure out how we should come and sensically think about that $60 million? and then i have a quick follow-up.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
rod, it's a great question. it was very much the latter. we -- obviously, we have visibility with these large enterprise customers in terms of our plan. in terms of our discussions, they came back to us requesting earlier delivery.
i could appreciate those requests given the environment, but it's really the latter to your point, rod.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. great, charlie. and then on portworx, i noticed all these -- the portworx ga announcements mid-month. and i feel like that's a pretty exciting part of the services portfolio.
i'm just curious what you think the funnel looks like there? what kind of interest have you had expressed? kind of how does that affect arr as we move through the next few quarters?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
well, as we spoke about in the past, portworx is still a relatively new product and because it is, as you point out, it's ratable and goes into arr. we are seeing very good growth in that product line overall. as i mentioned in my opening remarks, i've spent a lot of time this past quarter -- or actually over the last quarter and this quarter, in europe and the middle east, a lot of excitement by customers and our sales teams and partners in the product. so i think it has -- what we're -- we believe it has a really strong future as we go forward.
obviously, it will take a little bit of time before it really starts making a tangible difference, a reportable difference, if you will, in our arr.
rod hall -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. ok. thanks a lot, charlie. appreciate it.
operator
the next question comes from the line of jason ader with william blair. you may proceed.
jason ader -- william blair -- analyst
yes. thank you. i guess i want to understand, kevan, on the comment on macro and how you -- when you thought about the guidance for the year, you baked in macro? does that mean that you changed any of your assumptions on close rates or deal sizes or geographies or customer behavior?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yes. it's a great question, jason. and then i think the simple answer is no. there were no significant changes to our assumptions.
look, the first thing we evaluated pretty carefully was demand signals. and as charlie mentioned, demand continues to be quite strong. obviously, a lot of noise out there from a macro perspective that we're digesting and understanding what, if any, impact that will have for us in second half. but when i really break it down and look and compare against our initial guide for the year, we're outperforming.
we saw that from a demand standpoint in q1. we see that in terms of our guide for q2 and then obviously increasing our annual guide for the year. so i think it's business as usual with the outperformance that we're seeing in q1 and q2.
jason ader -- william blair -- analyst
ok. great. and then, charlie, for you, just in the last couple of quarters have been off the charts. and i understand that there's been some kind of, let's call it, near-term spikiness to the business, and you're going to have some deceleration as you move through the year here.
but is the storage market just that much better right now than it's been in a while? or is it just that you guys are taking just gobs of share?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
it's an interesting question, jason. obviously, the numbers speak for themselves. we're clearly taking share. the market is very benign at the moment.
it's a strong market despite everything that's going on. prices at asps have stayed strong. that's always helpful. so i think it's been a benign market, and we're taking share.
it's probably the best way to put it.
jason ader -- william blair -- analyst
and is there a lot of pent-up demand still from the pandemic that's helping? in other words, should we be moderating our expectations for 2020 -- for fiscal 2024 because of pent-up demand sort of will be -- that tailwind will be gone in 2024.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
honestly, we've not really been seeing -- even over the last year, pent-up demand playing a role here. it's usually new developments, new infrastructure, expansions -- fundamental expansions, not pent-up demand. so i would say pent-up demand, at least for us, has not been playing a big role. remember, we don't get refreshes of equipment.
our evergreen means that the equipment is always upgraded on a regular basis. and when customers need additional capacity, they pay for that, but they don't pay for any replacement of existing capacity. so we don't get the same benefit that maybe some of our competitors get by pent-up demand because we don't have replacements. we have evergreen.
and so i would say, again, that pent-up demand has not really been a factor for us. this is all basically new demand or expansion of existing environments.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yes. it is interesting too, jason, when you look at seasonality, pre-covid for us, and growth rates and you normalize for the $60 million that we alluded to. i'll tell you that the seasonality is matching kind of the pre-covid days in terms of first half, second half growth rates. so that's another data point for thoughts as well.
jason ader -- william blair -- analyst
thank you, guys. good luck.
operator
the next question is from the line of meta marshall with morgan stanley. you may proceed.
meta marshall -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks. maybe taking it away from macro, but a little bit more micro into your -- you guys do have about 30% exposure to cloud customers. and so just want to get a sense just as we're seeing some kind of changes in the technology, hiring environment, whether that's trickled down to anything you're seeing from that customer set? and then just maybe diving into the $40 million kind of an additional upside that you guys saw in the quarter.
just any indications of whether that's from more like of your commercial or enterprise customers?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
so overall, i would say we've seen just strong demand and growth across the entire set of customer segments that commercial enterprise what we characterized as cloud in the past. these were all strong segments for us. i don't think, other than the continuing exceptional growth of enterprise, i wouldn't say there's been a dramatic change in the overall character of the revenues coming in. and i'll let kevan answer the question on the accelerated shipments.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yes. and i would call out actually that international had a fantastic quarter along with u.s. and so to charlie's point on broad-based performance, we saw that from a geography standpoint, i was really pleased with what we saw in the international side, which really, when you normalize for the $60 million in the u.s., it's really tracking with the u.s. growth rates.
and as charlie talked about commercial, we saw some good strength there. public sector was a highlight for us as well in terms of how we look at it. so again, when we look at the $40 million of outperformance, i would, again, talk about the power of the portfolio we have. enterprise is absolutely a workhorse for us, but we're seeing it across the board.
meta marshall -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks.
operator
the next question is from the line of sidney ho with deutsche bank. you may proceed.
sidney ho -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the quarter. i want to go back to the full year guidance. obviously, you raised it by a little bit, but that would imply second half will be up about 10% year over year, but maybe 15% of your account for the revenue pulling you talked about. can you walk us through your thought process there? are you just being prudent in your guidance? or are there more revenue being pulled in from second half into second quarter? and the follow-up to that is if i look at the operating profit, you also raised it.
but you're seeing high revenue in the second half, but the operating profit dollar is roughly flat in the first half of the year. just can you walk us through maybe that dynamics as well.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yes. that sounds great, sidney. let me start with revenue growth. and look, we're very pleased with the raise of our annual guide to 22%.
i think that's very strong. obviously, an outlier in terms of what we're seeing, especially in this environment. so not backing away from that annual growth rate, which i think is very strong. you're seeing strong growth in the first half, and you're seeing some moderation in the second half.
some of that is seasonality. the $60 million that we alluded to that really was contemplated and forecasted for second half. but when normalizing for this seasonality, the expected growth rate in the back half is still in the high teens, which is quite strong. and then again, as i talked with jason about when you look at our growth rates, first half, second half from a seasonality standpoint, we're kind of getting back to what we saw in the pre-covid days, which is great.
a couple of other thoughts. as we progress through the year, we're also working with strong comps. i mean, we had a fantastic year last year, and that's only growing. we also had an extra week in the fourth quarter.
so that's a consideration as well. and we are being thoughtful about the macro environment as well. but without a doubt, we're pleased with our revenue growth outlook for the year. now if i move to operating profits, which was really the second piece of your question, we feel really good about the current view and increasing profitability.
this is our execution against our strategy that charlie laid out, which is absolutely prioritizing innovation and growth while at the same time improving profitability, and that's what you're seeing here. so we're quite pleased with the operating profits in the quarter. expect 12% operating margin for the year. and obviously, our profit overachievement this quarter was helped by the transactions that were moved into q1.
we're also doing very well on hiring in q1. we've made great progress in hiring talent, and we continue to invest thoughtfully and we'll continue to be focused on operating discipline and operating leverage as we monitor the effects of inflation at time that is on. so hopefully, that answers your question.
sidney ho -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yes. that's helpful. maybe one quick follow-up. if i look at the product gross margin for q1, it's definitely improved more than we expected.
but was nand pricing a headwind in the quarter as you expected that may be able to raise prices to offset that? but the real question is, how are you thinking about gross margin for both products and subscription services for q2 and the rest of the year?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yes. we might be a broken record on the product gross margins. look, i still think longer term, i'm very happy with product gross margins being in the high 60s. i think once again, we've overachieved and i'm very pleased.
i think the sales team is doing a tremendous job selling the value of our solution, and we're seeing that in the average selling prices as we navigated q1. so i think that's a large driver on it. in terms of subscription gross margins, what we've been tracking is pretty consistent in the low 70s, and that's a good kind of corridor that i like in terms of subscription gross margins.
sidney ho -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok. great. thank you.
operator
the next question is from the line of nehal chokshi with northland capital markets. you may proceed.
nehal chokshi -- northland capital markets -- analyst
yes. thank you, and a fantastic quarter of execution. i take a tick on this. but subscription year-over-year growth did decelerate to 35% year-over-year growth from 42% in the prior quarter.
why did that happen? and then also why subscription arr growing slower than the revenue line? i think you did mention that there is some lumpiness. and so if you go into why there's that lumpiness that would be helpful as well.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean, look, i think when you look at the subscription revenue growth, i mean, that's really a late indicator. i mean that's revenue coming off the balance sheet over time. i think when i really look at the health of our subscription business, i'm looking at our subscription arr balance as well as how we're doing from an rpo standpoint, which grew 29%.
and look, i'm very pleased with that. that's very strong growth. we're set up well. we've got a lot of good things happening in terms of our accelerated announcements on evergreen.
and so -- and obviously, you're going to get a little bit of variability on subscription arr as well as rpo growth. but again, if i'm looking at the revenue and rolling off the balance sheet to the top line, i think that's really not a strong indicator in terms of the health of the subscription business. now the other thing, nehal, that i would highlight to you is when you're comparing quarter to quarter and you've got to build in the extra week in q4, which would have a bearing on that as well.
nehal chokshi -- northland capital markets -- analyst
yes. ok. all right. understood on that.
that's a good point. and then charlie, in an earlier question, you had made a point of saying pure storage is doing a technology sale versus competitors doing a commodity sale. can you expand on what do you actually really mean by that?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
you bet. i'll take it back to r&d. we invest heavily in r&d, which means that we consistently build a product that leads the market. our competitors -- generally our largest competitors spend less than 5% on r&d.
i used to run a very large r&d shop. you can barely keep the lights on at 5% r&d. they can't keep up with us from a technology development perspective. and if we're correct that data storage and management is high technology and requires continuing development of advanced capability.
it's going to be very difficult for them to change their business models to accommodate that higher r&d, not just from a financial standpoint, but from the standpoint of managing a top tier -- top-class r&d staff. you get a reputation. and so we -- as i said, we play a very different game. and customers have been used to buying storage as a commodity, used to substandard support and capability, and assuming that all of them were alike, they're learning very quickly that pure is very different than the other vendors that we require far less labor, that we're highly automated, that we require less space power and cooling and that they have a superior experience overall with our product, and that's being now increasingly appreciated.
rob lee -- chief technology officer
i think the results of that are pretty apparent if you look across the portfolio, but if you look at flasharray//c, we've been shipping that product for two and a half years now, going after hybrid and disk completely unmatched out in the market. you look at flashblade. what we're doing for some of the high-value use cases out there, whether it's analytics and ai, whether it's technical computing, chip design, simulation, modernizing data protection, rapid recovery. and if you look at portworx and the entire suite of products that we have there, that just gives you some small hints of really the results that this focus on r&d and innovation is driving, much less what we have to discuss next week at accelerate.
nehal chokshi -- northland capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you, both. very helpful.

the next question is from the line of wamsi mohan with bank of america. please go ahead.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes. thank you. i was wondering -- i apologize if this has already been answered, jumping across calls here. but can you talk about the second half guide? i mean, you're attributing about $60 million to pull forward, but also effectively lowering the second half implied guide by the same amount.
so are you actually saying that the demand environment has not changed because i mean, there's all the companies are saying that the demand remains robust. there are supply chain issues, but demand remains robust. so i just want to clarify if you're saying that the macro environment is not actually impacting demand thus far? and what's the methodology where you're effectively calculating the $60 million pull forward? i know you have obviously visibility into the deals in your pipeline. can you talk about how broad-based that was in terms of -- was it just an isolated like a few customers where you saw this pull forward? was it much more broader? and if you could address profit seasonality as well in the second half relative to the first half?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
yes, you bet. so we can only report on what we are actually seeing and what we're actually seeing is demand remains robust. at the same time, we're certainly taking note of the increase in inflation. the public debate around a slowdown in the economy, possible -- even some discussion about possible recession.
and so we -- our outlook has to be a bit more -- i have to keep that in mind and not get ahead of ourselves. and so i think that our forecast reflects exactly that thinking. but for -- through the last quarter, demand remains strong without -- and even at the end of -- at the end of april, even though at that time, there were warning clouds on the horizon with respect to economies. certainly, energy in the -- prices in europe, etc.
at the same time, we were hearing from our it customers that their budgets and their focus on investment in it was remaining strong.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yes. and then just to answer your question in terms of the $60 million, that would have been a couple of large customers, so it was limited. obviously, for these large enterprise customers, we're working with them very closely with their demand planning. so i would put it in more of the isolated bucket, very easy for us to quantify, very binary in terms of understanding in our demand planning with the customer that, that was second half.
so that's a shift in seasonality. and that's how i view it. it's simply a shift in seasonality. it has nothing to do in my mind with demand drop-off as one might have alluded to in the second half.
demand looks strong. revenue, as i mentioned, i went through a fair amount of detail, wamsi, in terms of revenue first half, second half as well as operating profit first half and second half, and we can take you through that in more detail as well.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. thank you so much.

the next question is from the line of tim long with barclays. you may proceed.
tim long -- barclays -- analyst
thank you. yes. two, if i could, as well. first, charlie, you mentioned something about a win with a large telco for flasharray for 5g.
could you talk a little bit about kind of application there? and just give us a little color on this as a potential new vertical. how important can this be as the wireless world moves to more of a data-centric architecture? and secondly, just one more on the op margin, just 22% revenue growth, but only moving overall op margin a little over 100 basis points for the year. so can you talk about what's limiting that? is that just return to office and t&e -- or is there any other reason we're not seeing as much leverage on a really strong revenue growth here?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
thanks, tim. i'll let kevan handle the second part. as far as 5g, what an exciting opportunity and an exciting -- and call-out we were able to make for this quarter. it's one of the top telcos in the world.
they're not the only ones we're talking to about 5g, but it was great to get one of the first large orders associated with 5g deployments. the fact that we're smaller, we're denser, more power efficient and generally more performance than other products in the market have certainly helped in this environment. we think it's -- as i mentioned, we are talking to quite a few other telcos about 5g deployments. i'm optimistic about this space.
and i'm going to invite rob who worked on this opportunity to tell us a little bit more about this specific deployment.
rob lee -- chief technology officer
yes. so i think this is a testament really to the quality of our products and the reliability and performance, all the attributes that charlie just mentioned and really the suitability of those attributes to 5g deployments. in many ways, it's a great validation that just like the hyperscale environments, which we've spoken to you previously about. in these large telecom environments, really share a lot of the same requirements.
they're highly available, highly performance demanding, very mission-critical environment, highly automated as well. and i think those are all attributes where pure's products and services are uniquely well-positioned to go and serve. and so i think we're super pleased with the win. i think i'd also mention that in this particular environment, we were chosen to replace what was initially a custom design built around open-source software as customer had really tried to build out part of the environment themselves and then turn back to us to -- when they couldn't achieve the reliability performance and really the ease of management and automation required of these very demanding environments.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
and i'll just hit the operating profit question again. and really, this just comes back down to our strategy really around prioritizing innovation and growth that's paying off. we're seeing it. we've been seeing it for several quarters.
and at the same time, we're increasing our profitability. now we're balancing that. we had some great hiring, as i mentioned. i think we quarter over quarter, hired over 170 folks and new talent worldwide, which we're really pleased with.
we are navigating some higher wage costs as to be expected, and all that's being balanced and incorporated while we're increasing profitability for the year. so hopefully, that's a helpful context.
tim long -- barclays -- analyst
thank you.
operator
the next question is from the line of eric martinuzzi with lake street. you may proceed.
eric martinuzzi -- lake streetadvisors -- analyst
yes. i was just curious, i wanted to go a layer deeper on the product gross margins. curious to see if there's any let up. obviously, you're putting up good gross margins in a tough supply chain environment.
but expedited shipping fees, anything there where you're seeing relief or forecasting relief?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
i would say not at the moment. we had hoped back in q3 and q4 that the supply chain constraints would start to ease by q1 or q2. unfortunately, we've not seen that. one situation after another just continues to extend.
it changes the nature of the supply chain problems, but it extends the supply chain problems. to be clear, we've not seen it get worse, but we've not seen it get better either. and it's across the board, as you're pointing out, everything from logistics shipping, but the ones that -- we can absorb all of that, the ones that always concern us is components and availability of components because that can get you to shut -- or border closures, right? those are the ones we're most concerned about. but it's still across the board.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
it's across the board. and where the advantage again comes to us is really around the fact that we have less parts that we have to navigate in terms of exposure. and that's really paying off for us, both on the inflationary side as well as supply constraints and how we've been able to navigate against that headwind.
eric martinuzzi -- lake streetadvisors -- analyst
got it. thanks for taking my question.
operator
this concludes the question-and-answer session. at this time, i will turn the call back over to charlie giancarlo for closing remarks.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
thank you, operator. our strategy to deliver a simple and evergreen data platform, enabling our customers and companies around the world to turn their data and innovation. it continues to deliver exceptional results across our business. we're growing share in our market segments as customers turn to our leadership in digital transformation and that's critical to their future, and this promises to sustain us for quite a few quarters and hopefully years ahead.
i want to thank once again our customers, our partners for their trust, our suppliers for their collaboration and to all of our employees for their innovation and their hard work. and i thank -- i'd like to thank all of our listeners today and look forward to seeing you next week at accelerate. thank you.

charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. once again, we are very pleased with pure's continued success as demonstrated by this quarter's strong results. pure's q2 revenue grew by 30% year over year with our subscription arr up 31%. our growth was balanced between the u.s.
and our international markets, highlighting the broad and durable appeal of our portfolio and pure's continuing ability to deliver simple, sustainable data storage and management solutions that every organization needs. data is the modern linchpin of business transformation and pure is the innovation and customer experience leader in one of the largest segments of technology investment. building on our momentum, we introduced a number of major advancements in our portfolio during our annual accelerate conference in q2, generating strong excitement from current and potential customers. we unveiled flashblade s, our next generation flashblade, a significant step forward in performance, density and capacity, providing a modular architecture for increased efficiency and flexibility.
flashblade s significantly expands the use cases for this product line, including a wide price performance range of file and object workloads, such as computational analytics and ai, image search and recognition, electronic design automation, media special effects, high-performance computing and data protection. flashblade s was designed with full evergreen capabilities, enabling the system to be continuously upgraded without disruption. with its launch in mid-q2, flashblade s comprised 20% of all q2 flashblade orders and customer feedback on the first installed units is excellent. in q2, our evergreen subscription portfolio was extended with the addition of evergreen flex, a new fleet level evergreen offering.
evergreen flex provides customers additional flexibility as they optimize their data infrastructure. it provides utilization pricing across a customer's entire storage environment with the ability for customers to purchase inexpensive storage hardware and consume capacity on a pay-as-you-go model. evergreen flex joins evergreen forever and evergreen one, formerly known as pure as-a-service and is available across our pure portfolio. we also released our pure fusion service for general availability this past quarter.
pure fusion enables customers, managed service providers and cloud service providers to implement a cloud operating model for data storage management and offerings. the industry sometimes refers to this as infrastructure-as-code. customers can use pure fusion to orchestrate and manage their entire fleet of pure storage, reducing cost and complexity and also offer storage services to their customers or developers through apis, dramatically increasing developer productivity and corporate agility. while pure fusion is still in its early days, it has generated great interest from our largest enterprise and msp customers.
pure fusion is yet another example of how pure continues to drive the data storage and management industry forward. pure's portworx software was chosen by gigaom radar reports for the third consecutive year as the leader for enterprise kubernetes storage and cloud native kubernetes data storage. their in-depth analysis awarded us the highest scores among all market segments, deployment models and evaluation metrics. portworx's ability to empower developers to deliver superior outcomes on every cloud, both public and private, is the reason that a large global credit card company dramatically expanded their use of portworx this quarter to support their hybrid cloud data strategy.
portworx data services released just three months ago has likewise generated great interest, including many pocs and its first sales in q2. customers valued its simple one-stop shop for modern database operations, its rapid time to deploy and scale database as a service for developers and ability to avoid cloud lock-in due to its multi-cloud compatibility. as i have said before, pure believes data storage and management is high tech, a fundamental component of critical infrastructure and we invest in it accordingly. we are reaping the rewards of delivering leading products and services in a massive market that was written off as a commodity by legacy competitors.
in this uncertain macro environment, customers are especially looking for solutions that speed their digital transformation roadmaps while reducing their overhead and total cost of ownership. i have just returned from two weeks of customer and partner visits in australia and japan, including hosting a very successful tokyo accelerate event. in our asia-pacific theater as elsewhere, customers are simply blown away by the superior performance, reliability and simplicity of our products, and they rave about their entire experience with pure. one customer who installed pure to replace a competitor's all-flash product reported a tenfold improvement in performance, while also significantly reducing their labor and energy expenses.
and now for the first time, i increasingly hear from international customers that they actively consider pure specifically for our ability to drive down energy usage and e-waste. the demand for solutions that reduce customers' environmental footprint is now top of mind in a majority of international enterprises that we speak to. we added more than 350 new customers this past quarter. in addition to sustained growth of new customers in enterprise and commercial segments, we also saw very strong interest from public sector customers this quarter.
many of them cited sustainability and energy reduction goals as equal to their performance, price and reliability targets. one example is san luis obispo county's it department, which reduced their data center storage footprint by 75% and power consumption by 59%, while substantially increasing their storage capacity. by replacing a competitor's all-flash systems with pure, they also reduced their time dedicated to storage administration with pure1 and enabled safe mode to protect their data infrastructure against cyber threats. now i will discuss the business environment as we see it today.
i am pleased with our ability to deliver on our strategy of strong growth while increasing operating profit, all while navigating the external inflationary and supply chain environments without raising list prices. our customers are continuing to expand their data storage with pure and we continue to expand our customer base. we do however see signs of increased diligence of purchases by enterprise customers, resulting in some lengthening of sales cycle. overall, i remain confident in our ability to take market share and to grow faster than the market.
as reported last quarter, our hiring remains strong. our attrition rates are below the rest of our industry peers and are reduced from the highs experienced this past spring. as companies around the world adjust to a post-covid normal, we believe that investment in critical data infrastructure will remain central to their growth plans and that the dedication of our talented technology, sales, customer success and other core teams will enable pure to outperform the market. next week, we are officially kicking off our new hybrid work policy, which will have full teams come together in the office on specified days to collaborate, enhance creativity and increase employee engagement.
many of our development teams are already at over 50% in-office occupancy. like everyone else at pure, i am excited about our new silicon valley campus that we will be moving into this coming spring. i'd now like to hand the mic over to our cfo, kevan krysler, for a detailed review of our numbers.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
thank you, charlie, and good afternoon. we delivered strong financial results once again this quarter. our ongoing commitment to innovation, including our recent introduction of flashblade s and our expanded evergreen subscription business models have enabled us to deliver highly differentiated solutions that our customers are leveraging to accelerate their strategic objectives. the power of our technology and software enables our customers to grow and increase productivity.
our customers also deeply appreciate our ability and commitment to deliver our products with short lead times, not increase prices and substantially lower their energy requirements. these factors, among others, are why we believe demand for our solution portfolio continues to be strong despite a turbulent macro environment. our u.s. business continues to deliver strong revenue growth, growing 31% with particular strength this quarter in both commercial and public sector.
revenue growth of 29% from our international business was also strong, even with fx headwinds due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar. we continue to be pleased with meaningful contributions from new business. our total customer count reflects the acquisition of more than 350 new customers this quarter and 56% of the u.s.
fortune 500 customers. performance of our evergreen subscription businesses and portworx were solid as subscription annual recurring revenue, or arr, grew 31% to $955 million. remaining performance obligations or rpo grew 25% to $1.5 billion. similar to the remarks we made last quarter our rpo growth compared to q2 of last year reflects a reduction of approximately $32 million relating to product shipments for an outstanding commitment with one of our global system integrators.
excluding these product shipments, rpo grew 28% year over year. our headcount has increased to 4,600 employees as our investments in talent continue to be disciplined and focused around our key business objectives. now turning to specific financial results and discussion. total revenue for the quarter grew 30% to approximately $647 million.
product revenue grew 28% and subscription services revenue grew approximately 35%. subscription services revenue represented approximately 36% of total revenue. we continue to drive solid gross margin at 70.4% this quarter. high performance, reliability, simplicity and sustainability of our solutions are factors contributing to both our strong product gross margins of 69% this quarter and subscription services gross margins of nearly 73% this quarter.
importantly, we were also able to deliver these gross margins without passing price increases on to our customers. we achieved favorable operating profits of $106 million and operating margins of 16.4% this quarter. now let's turn to the balance sheet and cash flows. we ended the quarter with over $1.36 billion in cash.
cash flow from operations was over $159 million, resulting from the combination of strong sales, collections and increasing profitability. capital expenditures were approximately $25 million during the quarter. we returned over $60 million of capital to repurchase approximately 2.4 million shares during the quarter. we have approximately $123 million remaining from our $250 million share repurchase program.
now turning to guidance. we are pleased to have established a track record of strong performance in the dynamic and challenging environments. demand signals for our solutions are solid and our visibility of opportunities is healthy. we estimate revenue in q3 to be approximately $670 million, growing approximately 19% year over year and we expect operating profit to be approximately $85 million in q3, representing approximately 12.7% operating margin.
we are also raising our annual guidance for the full fiscal year. we now expect that revenue for fy '23 will be $2.75 billion, growing approximately 26% year over year. operating profit is estimated to be approximately $390 million, representing approximately 14% operating margin. also, as a reminder from our remarks last quarter, approximately $60 million of product revenue in the first quarter of this year was forecasted to close in the second half of our fiscal year.
this impacts seasonality when comparing growth rates in our first half compared to our back half of this year. our q3 and updated annual guidance contemplates, based on our visibility, macro environment conditions, including factors such as demand signals, foreign currency and inflation. with time being such a critical asset for our customers, we continue to expect to deliver our solutions with short lead times despite supply chain challenges that have reduced slightly, but still exist. in closing, our data storage and management technologies and software are critical to accelerating our customers' digital transformation objectives.
customers continue to depend on us to innovate, to be flexible, to meet their needs quickly, to not raise prices and to reduce their energy consumption any waste. with that, i will turn it over to the operator so we can get to your questions. operator?
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question is from aaron rakers with wells fargo. your line is now open.
aaron rakers -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yeah, thank you very much, and congratulations on the solid results. you guys raised the guidance for the full year, strong guidance in the fiscal third quarter, but clearly, there is a little bit of kind of commentary around the macro. i think, charlie, you had mentioned that you did see some signs of lengthening maybe sales cycles, etc. so i am curious if you could kind of expand a little bit upon what you are exactly seeing from a demand profile in your pipeline? have you seen kind of coming out of this quarter any kind of extension in deal cycles? just any kind of incremental clarity you can provide on how you factored in the macro environment currently looking into this quarter? can you hear, charlie? i can hear you now, charlie.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
you could. ok. sorry, i guess we are having technical trouble. so let me start over again.
i was talking to myself apparently for a while. we are very pleased obviously with the financial results we had this quarter and frankly, demand signals continue to be quite healthy. so we wanted to make sure we were very measured in the way that we were reflecting what we are seeing. while we are seeing a little bit of, let's say, second looks by companies, finance, perhaps stepping in for a second look at a deal and that is lengthening some of the enterprise sales cycles, but it's not changed the closing of the deals later in the process.
and as i said, demand and pipeline looks very healthy. the way we look at this is we are market share takers in what is a very large market, slight perturbations in the growth of this market shouldn't affect dramatically our ability to transform pipeline into sales and continue to grow our pipeline. so we feel like we are very well-positioned. we have a very broad portfolio.
our differentiation is only increasing right now. we are still the only player that can now take on hard disk at the secondary tier level, which is continues to be a strong area of growth for us. and now, honestly, our ability to provide a more sustainable product is in greater demand on a worldwide basis. so we are very bullish from the standpoint of being able to weather some amount of economic uncertainty.
aaron rakers -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yeah, very good. and then as a quick follow-up, i wanted to touch maybe on some of the points you brought up there, portfolio differentiation and just portfolio expansion. the flashblade s product, you started off your prepared remarks just highlighting -- it sounds like out of the gate very strong traction, 20% of your flashblade volumes. where are you seeing exactly the most momentum from that product? and has that seen -- have you seen any cannibalistic effect of your existing product portfolio or is this what i am trying to, i guess, get at is how expansion -- how much expansion of your existing tam does that bring to the table for pure?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yeah. well, it is the next generation product. so i don't know that cannibalization is the right word. it's our next generation product in several quarters, it should be full replacement for the existing, the generation 1 flashblade product.
but it's a very significant expansion of the price performance range that the former that the gen 1 product provided. so it scales both up and down better in both capacity, as well as in performance. and in fact, it's capable of multiple levels of performance in the same implementation. so we really see it as dramatically expanding what our share of the original tam deal brought out.
and it really represents a broadening of the family of flashblade.
aaron rakers -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
very good. thank you.
operator
thank you, aaron. our next question comes from simon leopold from raymond james.
simon leopold -- raymond james -- analyst
i wanted to see if maybe you could help us characterize how your customer base might be evolving? and what i am getting at here is you have talked in the past about moving up market and doing more business with larger enterprises and larger deals that i imagine could offset some weakening from smaller businesses. is there some metrics you could share with us to help us understand the change in the profile of your customers?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
well, i think we continue to expand on all fronts. there is no -- this quarter, commercial, what we call commercial and public sector were the stars of the quarter, but we continue to expand into enterprise and large enterprise, which was a process that we started a little over three years ago. my expectations is that we will continue to optimize each of those market segments and our business model to support each of those market segments as we go forward. but my expectations, over the longer term, is that the percentage of enterprise in our sales will continue to increase, simply because we started out as a commercial player and enterprise was something that we had to grow into.
and our brand is continuing to build among those enterprise players. so on a longer-term basis, i'd expect the percentage of our sales in enterprise and frankly, cloud to continue to increase, not because of any lack of success in commercial and public sector, just because of the size of those markets in general.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yeah. and simon, i think -- this is kevan. i'd add on just a little bit more in terms of the traction we're getting with new business and new customers. and we saw some meaningful contribution to revenue from new customers across all customer segments this quarter, which was definitely a plus.
simon leopold -- raymond james -- analyst
and just as a quick follow-up. your architecture, which is basically leveraging raw nand rather than buying solid-state drives. could you talk about whether you're seeing some benefit from maybe lower prices in the marketplace for that raw nand because of weakness in verticals like pcs or smartphones, how much sort of shifting of production capacity and trends are you seeing even though there may be different products, is there any flexibility or fungibility of the manufacturing that is benefiting you.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
well, simon, this is something that's been a hallmark for pure since almost the very beginning since -- ever since we started building our own digital flash modules, which is that we have a wide variety of suppliers for the raw nand. we're able to leverage different levels of quality of that raw nand without affecting the quality that we deliver to our customers. and that gives us a large degree of freedom in terms of the costs that we pay for the nand, as well as choice of supply. and it also tends to allow us to be able to take advantage of price declines on the nand market faster than the rest of the competition.
so yeah, it's given -- lastly, what i'll mention is that it's also given this sort of tremendous energy advantage because we make better use of the flash, which allows us to produce products that require far less power than the competition. but i'm going to invite our cto, rob, to chime in.
rob lee -- chief technology officer
yeah, simon, just to add a couple of things there. like charlie said, the direct flash technology definitely opens up a much broader menu of nand options for us to go and evaluate and incorporate into the products. we do drive a significant amount of efficiency, more efficiency than others would be able to achieve through ssds out of our direct flash technology. the other thing i would point out is that now with the intro flashblade s as we've gone over the years and standardized our technology on the same direct flash modules across the entire platform, we're going to realize some pretty significant benefits from this.
one is certainly, the kind of scale and leverage that we have in terms of the development of the technology, but then number two, this is also going to allow us to move a bit more nimbly and intentionally, even more so than we do today as we navigate future nand parts and generation. so net-net, it's a significant advantage for us all around.
simon leopold -- raymond james -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
thanks, simon. our next question comes from shannon cross from credit suisse. shannon, please go ahead.
shannon cross -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you very much. charlie, can you take a step back and talk about your thoughts regarding margin? and you obviously have a very leverageable model where revenue growth sort of flows through very quickly and drive a higher operating margin. but i'm wondering how you think about investments in the business to continue to drive the strong revenue growth versus trying to increase your cash flow or over time, see the operating margin go up as it is because clearly, you have a good product that's well received that i don't know if you could invest even more, maybe you could either accelerate or at least continue the rapid revenue growth? and then i have a follow-up. thank you.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, shannon. we're actually always looking at this in terms of pricing and growth. frankly, we believe we provide a very high-value product, and we do get a return.
we think we get a premium of 10% or more, in general -- in the market for the product and the value that we deliver in our product. i would say that we're generally fairly happy with the margins in the product margin in the range where we've been over the last multiple quarters. we think it gives us a lot of flexibility to be able to win deals, especially new customers. we do invest in winning new customers without a doubt.
existing customers over time really understand the total cost of ownership that we deliver and our -- and i think we received the value accordingly. so i think we have the right balance of investment versus margin at this point. kevan, do you want to add?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yeah, shannon, i think i'll add just a couple of things, right? so when we think about the full year from an investment standpoint, i mean we're talking about 20% in terms of additional operating expense investment. and when we entered the year, we were very much committed to disciplined investment, as well as addressing some of the inflationary impacts we were seeing. and those business objectives really haven't changed. now our talent team has done a wonderful job this quarter.
we had some great success in hiring talent. we're not where we'd like to be, frankly, with our quota sellers, our quota-carrying sellers. and so that will be an area of focus for us in terms of hiring for the remainder of the year in investment. so we are expecting to see some higher investment levels really within our sales organization in the second half.
and there is always some seasonality with our opex, especially in the fourth quarter as a result of our sales reps starting to earn their accelerators. so hopefully, that's helpful context for you.
shannon cross -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. yeah, thank you. and i'm sorry if i missed it, i don't think i did. can you give us an update on the meta relationships and opportunities with other hyperscalers? thanks.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
sure. meta relationship continues. we did -- it wasn't terribly significant this quarter, although there were some shipments, and we continue to make progress slow and steady with other hyperscalers. obviously, you'll be the first to hear when -- assuming that we actually are able to solidify something solid.
shannon cross -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thanks, shannon. our next question comes from tim long from barclays. tim, please go ahead.
tim long -- barclays -- analyst
thank you. two questions, if i could. first, on the subscription services side, another strong quarter and it sounds like some of the new platforms are really working. maybe just -- just give us a sense as you kind of transition some of the solutions toward more subscription.
what are the pushbacks and what are the customers like about that? and then secondly, i did want to follow-up before you had a pretty nice win with a large telco customer. i think, for 5g. so just update us on that larger deal and also similar to the last question, are there any other large opportunities that seems like it could be a nice large new tam for you guys to go after? thank you.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
absolutely. well, the numbers, i think on the subscription side, pretty much speak for themselves. i'd say the largest hurdle that we have with customers is just that it's a very new way to buy. and it may very well be that other parts of their data center build, they build with capex.
so it's a bit different from that standpoint. so i would say it is largely that it's new and different is the largest hurdle. in terms of the terms of the service capability, no -- one additional one actually is the channel. it's also a new way for the channel to sell.
and of course, the economics like any company going through a capex to opex transition, it takes time for them to adjust how they pay their sellers and for their sellers to adjust as well. so i would say, in general, it's just the newness of the opex model versus capex, both with customers and the channel that is probably the biggest hurdle. but we are seeing steady as you can see, steady growth and steady interest in it.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
two additional things i'd add to that, tim, and maybe charlie or rob, you can jump in. but the expansion of evergreen with flex, i think that's going to be a big opportunity for us early days at this point. but then even more so with flashblade s and the additional features now with evergreen that we've enabled, i think, it's going to be pretty powerful as well. and i don't know if you want to add some commentary on that.
rob lee -- chief technology officer
yeah, absolutely, this is rob. let me answer that. so i think one of the biggest impacts that we have with s, charlie talked about in his prepared remarks, significant step forward in performance capacity density, lowering of power consumption. that's all true.
one of the biggest other impacts that we haven't covered yet is the additional flexibility that we've introduced to the platform. by separating the compute and the storage elements, not only have we allowed customers to configure that really family of products at this point for different performance and capacity levels on day one, but we've also now opened up the customer as they evolve to grow independently performance or capacity as they need and that flexibility now allows us to introduce the full benefits of evergreen forever to flashblade. and so we look at that as definitely going to be a tailwind as we look forward. on the 5g question, that -- as you may know, we've already made shipments against that account they are being deployed.
the commentary that we're receiving back from the customer is excellent. so i expect more of the same in the future. but it does tend to be ordered in -- ordered episodically as they build out.
tim long -- barclays -- analyst
all right. thank you.
operator
thank you, tim. our next question comes from krish sankar from cowen and company. krish, please go ahead.
krish sankar -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. and charlie and kevan, congrats on executing really well in a very tough environment. so kudos you and your team.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
thanks, krish.
krish sankar -- cowen and company -- analyst
my first -- thanks for that. charlie, my first question is to the then you can talk about it. how should we think about enterprise demand beyond the january quarter? i know it's still early, but the main concern with investors seems to be that storage could be the next shoe to drop. so i'm kind of wondering what you're hearing from your customer base about their it spend budget for next year and another falloff for kevan on operating margins.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
well, that's a tough question. i'll pull out my crystal ball. what we're generally hearing is from the enterprise customers is general optimism around the it budget, meaning that they also see the questions around the economy, questions around recession. and i don't think we can answer this question uniformly around the world.
i think europe and in particular, the uk is different from asia-pac and different from the u.s. but in the u.s., i think general optimism that with digital transformation and the need for companies to really be able to compete in the new world that they have to continue investing in their it environment. data is the core of that being able to leverage their data. and so data infrastructure is important.
so we're seeing general optimism there. i think europe is going through somewhat different challenges with energy pricing and inflation. and that could be affected a bit more. and then asia-pac is a tale of many different countries.
but i'm expecting asia-pac absent some kind of geopolitical issue to continue to be a strong growth engine for us.
krish sankar -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. very helpful. and then a follow-up for kevan, on the operating margin, and our congrats on raising the off margin guidance from 12% to 14%. i'm just kind of curious to figure out what are the key drivers for it? i'm just trying to understand the sustainability of an operating margin.
and kevan, if you can extend this question a little further. if hypothetically speaking, revenues are up 10% next year. how will op margins look? and conversely, if revenues were down 10% next year, how will op margin look.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, krish. i mean -- let's first talk about the performance around op margins, which yes, we're very pleased with. and again, when we think about our strategy and business objectives, it's really about growing our top line and balancing that with increasing profitability in a sustainable way.
and we're doing that, and we feel very comfortable with that. this year is a fine example of being able to grow both our top line while seeing some expansion in terms of our operating margin. and we believe that's sustainable as we look out beyond this year. and we've got a track record of that, and it's not without investing heavily.
i view a 20% increase in investment this year, very healthy, and we're really driving that across our innovation with our engineers. i've talked a little bit about our sellers. we've got more work to do to invest in our selling organization, and we look forward to doing that in the second half. and then on scale and infrastructure, we're doing a nice job continuing to invest in that area.
and so without getting into details beyond this year, i would just say that i have a lot of confidence that it's sustainable.
krish sankar -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks a lot, kevan.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
thanks, krish.
operator
thank you, krish. our next question comes from nehal chokshi from northland capital markets. nehal, please go ahead.
nehal chokshi -- northland capital markets -- analyst
yeah. thank you. great quarter and really very impressive guidance given the trends that everybody is citing. i'm not going to beat that dead horse, clearly a very strong pipeline that you have.
a couple of quick things. so dollar-based net revenue retention rate on your arr, you did give some color a couple of quarters ago that was a 120% plus. has there been any material change on that?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
high level, no material change, and we update that, nehal, once a year.
nehal chokshi -- northland capital markets -- analyst
ok. great. and then i do want to double click on the sales hiring environment. it does seem like things are improving, but your sales hiring has not improved in material way yet.
why is that? and why do you expect that to be able to improve going forward?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
well, i think our sales hiring has improved, but we're continuing to scale. and we are a bit behind. no doubt, we're a bit behind where we'd like to be or behind plan. but we caught up quite a bit in q1 to where plan had been.
so we're narrowing that delta, if you will, between where we are in plan. i do agree with you. i think the environment is getting a bit better on the sales hiring side.
nehal chokshi -- northland capital markets -- analyst
ok. and then finally, just a follow-up to that is that clearly, you've been putting up very strong results that imply that your sales productivity has been improving massively. is there room for further sales productivity improvements here?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
short answer is absolutely. i think we still have a ways to go to become best-in-class there, and we have plans in place to that we think are the elements that will allow us to continue to improve sales productivity.
nehal chokshi -- northland capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you. congratulations.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
thanks, nehal.

david vogt -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks, guys, for taking my question. if we just could go back to the [technical difficulty]. can you guys hear me?

yeah, yeah, we can hear you. go ahead, david. he can't hear us though. hello.
while we move on to the next question, and if he comes back on we will.
david vogt -- ubs -- analyst
wait. hey, guys, i'm here.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
ok. good. yeah, we can hear you, david. go ahead.
david vogt -- ubs -- analyst
yeah. so just want to go back to the macro and the conversation around elongated sales cycles. when you talk to customers, are you seeing any -- again, it just out. [technical difficulty]
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
please go ahead, david. yeah, let's move on to amit, if we can.
operator
our next question comes from amit daryanani from evercore. amit, please go ahead.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. i guess the first question i have is, you beat july quarter were about $12 million versus what you folks initially said, but you're raising the full year by like $90 million or so. so you're clearly thinking of the back half expectations up a fair bit beyond just the beat? and despite only all the macro commentary you had, i'd love to sort of understand what are the levers of the upside you are seeing? is it better share gains? is it more of the hyperscale or meta ramps that are happening or it's something else? i'd love to sort of understand what's enabled you to raise your numbers well above and beyond what you've been [inaudible]?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
yeah. i'll start, and i'm going to invite kevan to join in. we do a very bottoms up fundamental analysis of everything from everything from pipeline to deal to the field forecasts and so forth, and it's really based on that. so if i were to up-level it toward more of the macro, i would say, yes, it's continued share gains.
and as i might have mentioned earlier in this call, we are still roughly a $2.5 billion $2.75 billion knock on wood, a vendor in a $50 billion market. our opportunity is based on gaining share and less on the overall size of the market at any particular time. so kevan, do you want to.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, i think i'd add a little bit here. so we continue to have relatively good visibility beyond just one quarter out. i think our sales leadership team has done a really nice job focusing on demand gen and pipeline beyond one quarter.
the sales team has really got a good pulse on the business right now around our pipeline, our opportunities ability to convert what that looks like. that, in combination with our track record, both with our existing customers and be able to expand within our existing customers, as well as the continued traction we're seeing with the new business, this is just really how the second half shapes out based on what we saw exiting q2 and looking out to q3 and the rest of the year. so hopefully, that's helpful for you.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
that is super helpful. and i know there is a bunch of moving parts over here. kevan, i guess, from your perspective, i think the question that folks will probably have it. in the back half of the year, you're sort of implying low double-digit kind of top line growth versus the 40% in the first half.
i know there are a few moving parts to compare to that decile. but maybe just help contextualize what's driving the deceleration in the back half versus the first half?
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yeah. it's a great question. and obviously, we've had a fantastic first half and leading to raising our annual guidance to 26% year over year. but you're right, as we think about growth in the second half, there is a few things to be thinking about and a few factors to keep in mind here.
one is that the second half is impacted by seasonality of that deal we mentioned previously around $60 million. there is actually a couple of deals that we delivered in q1, really contemplated for second half. and so that's going to impact second half growth by approximately six points. so that's important to consider.
i think the next factor to consider is our comps are getting much tougher in the second half due to the substantial growth and the additional week we had last year. now just a reminder, in terms of our growth last year in q3 and q4, were 37% and 41%, respectively, which was just outstanding. and then lastly, as we mentioned, we're navigating some incremental headwinds as we think about the elongation of the sales cycle, but we've contemplated that in our guide. so that with fx, i feel pretty good in terms of how we're looking in terms of second half growth.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
perfect. thank you. congrats on a great quarter.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
appreciate it.
operator
thank you, amit. our next question comes from meta marshall from morgan stanley. meta, please go ahead.
meta marshall -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks. charlie, you mentioned it again on the call, but i just wanted to get a sense of on the power consumption advantages that you guys have are just kind of green energy angle where or what type of customer type is that having the most success with? you mentioned europe last quarter? is it having any increase prevalence or acceptance with cloud customers? and then maybe second, you guys have clearly talked about a little bit of elongation of deal cycle. just wondering if there is any different in deal types, whether you're seeing customers want to move more toward evergreen or kind of pay as you grow versus kind of whatever purchasing model they were looking at before? have we seen any changes in what type of purchasing they are looking to make.
thanks.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
yeah. great. thanks, meta. on the energy side, there are several different customer types that are focused on energy.
one i would say our large reporting companies that are now needing to report on their own esg environment, and that's been pushed down into their data center operations, which tends to be a very large part of their energy utilization. the second, i would say, is countries now with energy in security. so that covers a lot of europe right now. it's not just the price of energy that's causing them to take a look at their energy bills and so forth.
it's now also the availability of energy, making them quite nervous about how much energy their entire environment takes up. but certainly, a big part of that, again, is in their data center. and then third, i'd say is it's government. government worldwide, governments worldwide now are very focused on energy reduction, and so we're seeing a lot of it there.
in japan, it was palpable, and it also fits if you will, the japanese ethic for smaller, more compact, more efficient, more reliable capabilities, which we fit really quite perfectly. so i'd say the energy sensitivity is large and growing, probably not surprising to this audience, larger internationally currently than it is in the u.s. but growing in the u.s. as well.
on the deal cycle standpoint, we started to see it earlier, i would say starting around mid-quarter, we started to see it and then it increased through the quarter. the deal cycles were just taking another week or two weeks. generally, all of those deals closed. so it wasn't a demand issue.
and so far, the approvals are still going through, but there definitely was on average, a lengthening of the deal process.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yeah. and i would say -- this is kevan. i would add a couple of things. i think the elongation i would really point that more to the enterprise, larger enterprise segment.
we didn't see a lot of that, frankly, on the commercial and public sector side. so i think that's an important clarification. i think the other thing you had asked, which we absolutely are seeing and we are well-positioned for is our customers looking for more flexibility in how they structure their deals. and i would say absolutely.
and i think our timing of evergreen flex bringing another option for customers and how they might want to consume our technology and solutions is really resonating. but we are having a fair amount of conversations with our customers around flexibility.
meta marshall -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks.
operator
thanks, meta. our next question comes from wamsi mohan from bank of america. wamsi, please go ahead.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. thank you, and congrats on the solid results. if we look at your guidance here, it sort of implies product revenue grow about 20% or a little bit higher. and when we look at your long-term model, that really implies software or subscription growing at 30% plus and becoming more than 50% of revenues.
so as we look into next year and further out, should we be thinking that product meaningfully decelerates, or is a 20% product revenue growth sustainable from share gains? and i have a follow-up.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
yeah. my opinion, wamsi, is that product growth will continue. again, we are still a relatively small player in a very large market. and so share gains continue to be a major growth item for us or growth sector plus there is the option or the opportunity to start selling more into the hyperscale environment, whether the top 10 hyperscalers.
and if each one of those that gets cracked really would be a meaningful revenue accelerant. so on the product side. so no, we are looking at both as meaningful growth factors for us.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. thanks, charlie. and then if we think about your operating margin performance in the quarter, relative to your expectation, you got a $12 million top line beat, but you had a multiple add on your operating income dollar delta on your beat. and i'm just wondering if there was anything that you would call out specifically around the operating margin performance.
and as we look at the back half of the year, i know the revenue growth is decelerating, but generally speaking, like when you think about the margin profile there, anything you can help us to bridge the sequential margins, that would be helpful. thank you.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, wamsi. i think the primary factor -- i probably want to highlight around our investments for the second half. and then overall, when we think about our operating expenses for the year and the growth is really around continuing to invest in our sellers.
and we have mentioned that before. but that is an area where, for q2, arguably, i would have liked to have been further along in terms of where we are with our investment profile on the sales side with our sellers. but we will make that up. i feel confident on that and we will see that through our investments as you look at the second half.
wamsi mohan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. thanks.
operator
thank you, wamsi. our next question comes from matt sheerin from stifel. matt, please go ahead.
matt sheerin -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yeah. thank you. i have a follow-up, charlie, on your comments regarding customer expansion in addition to the new logo adds. can you comment on the progress you are seeing an increasing spend within existing customers, particularly large enterprises due to the expanding products and services within your portfolio and the opportunity for that going forward?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
absolutely. that is another major growth vector for us is simply the number of large enterprise logos that we have. i think it kind of hides a big opportunity for us in that. our wallet share on average in those large enterprises is still relatively small.
i mean obviously, there are a handful of them where we are the majority of their spend in the storage area. but for the vast majority of those enterprise logos, we still have a lot of opportunity ahead of us. and frankly, with our customers to know us they still love us. their experience with pure is very, very good.
and because of that, we get, i think exceptional opportunities every time another one of their storage properties comes up for renewal. so it is a major area of growth for us and i expect that to continue to pay dividends for quite some time.
matt sheerin -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. thank you. and just for my follow-up, could you just comment on the supply environment. i mean you really haven't called that out as an issue relative to your competitors.
i know you have got a smaller footprint in terms of components, and you have managed that very well. but any sort of hiccups or incremental pluses or minuses or negatives there?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
i would say that in general and on average, the situation has ameliorated somewhat. that is -- it's not quite, it hasn't gotten worse. and in fact, if anything, it's gotten a little better, but it's very uneven. in other words, there are some components that have become much more widely available, shorter lead times, but many others that are still on allocation and we still get de-commits every now and then.
so the number of de-commits are down. things are a little bit easier, but it's still -- i wouldn't say that we are out of the woods yet. that being said, we expect it to continue to improve.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yeah. and i think it's all about our confidence in our track record of delivering timely to our customers, which is so critical for them as they are kind of working through accelerating what they need to do from a digital transformation standpoint and we don't see that changing. and again, the challenges we are having would be outside, obviously, of nand and dram to be clear as well.
matt sheerin -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
got it. ok. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from jason ader from william blair. jason, please go ahead.
sebastien naji -- william blair -- analyst
hey. good morning -- or good afternoon. this is sebastien on for jason. i just wanted to ask a little bit more about the evergreen flex offering.
what is sort of the target customer for that offering? and what has been the initial reaction from the channel or from customers that are looking to adopt it?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks. so evergreen flex is really targeted at those customers that we are open and interested in a subscription model that is a pay-as-you-go model, but whose internal financial philosophy was really based on capex. so you can think of, in some cases, managed service providers.
you can think of a large enterprise where i had mentioned on an earlier question that there -- the model for the rest of their data center is capex. and they just couldn't make the full jump over to an opex model or at least not yet. and this gives them the ability -- gives them several things. one is it gives them the ability to buy on capex, but to really reserve a lot of their spending for when they actually start using the product.
the second and this one is more subtle and more important to many customers. flex is really calculated on a full fleet environment across their entire environment rather than on an array by an array in capability. and what that means is it gives them greater economics, more efficiency, and it gives them much greater flexibility, ergo the flex, as they build out their data infrastructure. rob, do you want to add?
rob lee -- chief technology officer
yeah. i just wanted to jump in and add here for a second. we introduced flex at the same time that we rebranded and we renamed some of our other subscription offerings to bring them all under the evergreen umbrella. and that would be evergreen forever, flex and then evergreen one, formerly known as pure-as-a-service.
and one of the reasons that we did this is it really is a spectrum of ways that customers can get the benefits of the evergreen architecture and the services we are able to deliver there. and just to put this in perspective, right. we look at this as a spectrum all the way from one end where you have got, as charlie mentioned, a more capex-oriented customer, more traditional hardware sale that's seeing the benefits of evergreen through the forever program, where those assets are being constantly modernized, hardware and software non-disruptively, they get access to future evolution and growth without worry there. on the other end of the spectrum, you have got customers that are fully bought into the cloud operating model, want to effectively turn the keys over to pure to go and run and manage and say, hey, we just want to interact based on a performance sla, capacity basis with full consumption level flexibility.
and then in the middle, you have customers that are more in the camp that charlie was discussing where either as a stepping stone to get to the full cloud operating model, they see the benefits of flex owning title to the hardware upfront, but seeing the benefits that flex can offer in terms of flexibility to grow, evolve, as well as redeploy assets across their fleet. and so what we really see with this enhanced and more, i would say, consolidated evergreen family is introducing a variety of ways for customers to realize the benefits of the core architecture wherever they are on that journey to the cloud operating model.
sebastien naji -- william blair -- analyst
got it. that's really helpful. maybe just a quick follow-up on that point, i guess now that you have the sort of middle offering, is this going to be a big driver you think of new customer additions, or was this something that existing customers were asking for and it's going to be a big driver of expansions within those accounts? can you help me think about how you are thinking about those aspects?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
yeah. i really think it's both that certainly for existing customers that -- and we have reported this in the past that we are looking at evergreen one, but at the end, fell back to capex because of their unfamiliarity with that buying model. we think evergreen flexes now gives them that opportunity to get into a capacity-oriented subscription model. and secondly, no doubt, for customers that -- or for prospects that want to try pure, but want to do so on an as-you-go basis, i think it can open up new opportunities for us.
sebastien naji -- william blair -- analyst
great. very helpful. thank you.
operator
thank you, sebastien. our next question comes from tom blakey from keybanc capital markets. tom, please go ahead.
tom blakey -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
couple of questions here. i think just listening to rob talk about the change in products. i mean going forward, is it fair to say that the strength that we are seeing in product and obviously early in share gains, charlie, will be coming from more of a subscription-based sale. maybe this kind of software model last question here, just the precursor, holding back product growth, so strengthen long-term deferred here in the quarter.
so going forward, we can expect some mechanisms there, just going out maybe in the fiscal '24. is that something we can expect in terms of the product revenue growth? and i have a follow-up on the service side.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
well, we definitely believe that subscription should outpace product growth. that's been our -- that's our long-range plan and certainly what we believe. but i would also remind everybody on the call that, in fact, our evergreen subscription, the entire range of it, even the evergreen forever, which is attached to a capex sale does in fact, over time reduce the capex sale. and that's because we never have to replace an existing, so customer never has to replace an existing system.
so many -- the storage industry, a significant portion of their sales is just selling a new system to replace an old system. we always see that in our subscription line. we don't see that in a -- you don't see that in a product sale line. you see that in growth in subscription.
so it's a different way to sell product. we only sell it once. the customer never has to buy it a second time.
tom blakey -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. great. i thought the upfront portion of the subscription sales was recognized in product, not all-in. and then so --
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
you are right. it's subscription. so when we do an evergreen one transaction, the entire value would be reflected as a subscription. evergreen flex, the hardware portion obviously would be in product, but the consumption piece would be in subscription.
and then for evergreen, evergreen forever, all of the evergreen forever attached for that subscription is reflected as subscription revenue. hopefully, that's helpful for you.
tom blakey -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
very clear, kevan. thank you. and then second question, i guess related more to the services side. we know this is where the data services and workloads and basically your overall software portfolio is there.
any commentary you can give in terms of maybe you are getting a little more steep here? any like type of up-sell callouts you can call maybe an attach rate of software to new enterprise deals now? any type of like help you can give that can give us comfort in terms of continued strong growth here on the services line as it relates to software would be helpful. thank you.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
absolutely. well, we are seeing a large fraction, probably more than 50% of the software sales are going to existing customers, but a significant amount are going to new customers as well. and i would say that also, even within existing customers, it may be a new buyer within that customer account. i would say that a large fraction are into enterprise customers more so than on the commercial side and a small, but increasing amount coming from channel source.
tom blakey -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
all right. thanks, kevan. thank you.
operator
thanks, tom. our last question comes from rod hall from goldman sachs. rob, please go ahead.
bala reddy -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for squeezing me in. this is bala on for rod. congrats on a good quarter.
i double click on the guidance, really strong guidance for the second half. implied q4 guidance, it looks like it's up meaningfully from what you are thinking before. i am just wondering if there is any large deal. i know you mentioned that telco deal got back and then meta ramp, i know you said meta could be lumpy and then it didn't do much business this quarter.
so could one of those large deals be helping in q4, that's why there is in guidance? and i have a follow-up.
kevan krysler -- chief financial officer
yeah. thank you. a couple of things. meta hasn't changed in terms of our remarks earlier.
i think when we were coming into the year and our view on meta. so that hasn't changed meaningfully. and then in terms of how we are thinking about the second half, we will walk through that a fair amount in terms of how we are thinking about it. our approach hasn't changed.
we continue to evaluate and analyze our pipeline and opportunities. we are staying very close with the sales leadership team who have a very good pulse on the business. i wouldn't call out anything specific as we think about implied q4 on any particular deals. it's just where we are falling out based on the visibility we have over the next two quarters or the remainder of the year.
bala reddy -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. thanks, kevan. follow-up, product gross margins at 69%, still very strong, but down slightly, only slightly from last quarter. i understand flashblade new product, flashblade s, that could carry lower margins.
so maybe it's that. but i am just wondering, given your commentary about not planning to increase the list prices for your products. i am just wondering what are you seeing in terms of competition, are you seeing any increase in intensity at all?
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
look, we are having some great success in terms of the opportunities we are in and winning those opportunities. i have said and been very consistent with my remarks on product gross margin that the high-60s is our sweet spot, and we continue to be in our sweet spot of product gross margins. frankly, when i start getting into the 70s, it's a bit hot in terms of sustainability and what we can do with our customers. so i actually like where we are in terms of our product gross margin profile, if that's helpful.
bala reddy -- goldman sachs -- analyst
all right. thank you.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
ok. thank you.
operator
all right. thank you, bala. this concludes the question-and-answer session. at this time, i will turn the call back over to charlie for closing remarks.
charlie giancarlo -- chief executive officer
well, as i hope we have been able to convey, we believe pure storage is well-positioned to grow both in the near and in the long-term. we have this unique combination of product portfolio and operational rigor to continue to lead our industry, and we continue to improve our game every quarter. we enable organizations everywhere to build a cloud operating model for their private and hybrid cloud infrastructure. we lead in solutions for the all-flash data center.
we have the most advanced services and tools to automate data management for both traditional and modern cloud native applications. and we are definitely the clear sustainability and energy reduction leader now. i am deeply appreciative to all of our employees for their innovation and their diligence to our partners and suppliers for their ongoing partnership to our customers for entrusting pure storage with their mission-critical data storage and management needs and to all of you that follow us so closely each and every quarter. thank you all very much and have a wonderful rest of your day.
