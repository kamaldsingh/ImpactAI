mac schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, kay, and good afternoon, everyone. we are pleased with our results for the second quarter of 2019, which exceeded our expectations, and we are therefore increasing our guidance for the full year. we are executing well, and we continue to benefit from puerto rico's economic recovery, our innovation strategies and our latin america focus. beginning on slide 4, i'll cover some of the quarter's financial highlights and provide you with an update on recent developments. total revenue was $123 million, an increase of 8% compared to 2018. we are seeing growth across all segments. we're benefiting from some pricing actions, our deployment of value-added solutions, new managed services, hardware and software sales and the completion of some longer-term projects this quarter.
adjusted ebitda was $58 million or 7% growth over the prior year, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.51, an increase of 11% compared to last year. we generated significant operating cash flow and returned approximately $35 million year-to-date to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. moving on to our exciting progress in latin america, beginning on slide 5. first, we are pleased to announce an agreement to acquire placetopay, a colombian-based gateway and payment service provider. their services are focused on enabling customers with a digital presence accept different forms of payment and include customers in different industries. we believe placetopay is the second-largest local player and competes with other regional companies.
we anticipate this gateway to become our primary digital offering for the region as well as strengthen our presence in colombia. we anticipate this transaction to close by the end of the year, but we are waiting for regulatory approval. next, we are also pleased with the recent expansion of our regional agreement with citibank for our collection payment platform to include mexico and guatemala. the platform is currently operational in colombia. and while the first clients under this expanded agreement will likely begin in q4 this year, we would anticipate this to provide a modest impact on 2020 growth. over the next several years, we would expect this to grow with citibank's introduction of their one receivable product to more of their clients across the region.
lastly, earlier this quarter, we announced our 5-year processing agreement with santander chile, the largest bank in the country as they move to open their merchant acquiring market. we expect this new agreement will contribute to our latin america revenue and ebitda growth in 2020 and beyond. these new agreements as well as the acquisition are consistent with our latin america growth strategy. we are focused on localizing our products so that we can be agile when the markets open. we intend to pursue profitable business models as these markets evolve, and we intend to provide multiproduct solutions to multiple clients in each country that we do business in. as we have indicated previously, we intend to go deep in the markets that we are currently operating in. moving on to progress in puerto rico on slide 6. first, revenue growth in puerto rico and the caribbean grew approximately 9% driven by organic transaction growth of approximately 5% and pricing actions.
in addition, we had a positive impact from contract wins now producing revenue in our business solutions segment and revenue related to hardware and software sales as well as the completion of several projects. second, regarding innovation, we are seeing the positive impact of our ath movil and ath movil business products, which are anticipated to contribute almost 1% of our revenue growth in 2019. third, on a more macro view, the federal government approved an additional $1.4 billion in relief funding in june that included approximately $600 million for ebt support, which will be available in august. also, the promesa board certified a new fiscal plan on may 9 with a slight increase in the projection for total disaster relief funding to $83 billion.
we continue to believe that the federal funds anticipated to flow into puerto rico will positively impact the economy as well as provide a window of opportunity for changes in the public sector. although there is currently some ambiguity in the administration of the puerto rican government, changes that create more transparency and control will hopefully build confidence for investors and the federal government, which could increase the federal fund flow and private investment on the island over the long term.
in the short term, the events that have transpired over the last few weeks could have an effect on the timing of disaster relief funds as fema notified the government of puerto rico that they would have to receive approval to draw funds -- to draw on funds related to the hurricane. in summary, we are pleased with the strong financial results, and i particularly want to thank my colleagues for advancing our strategic initiatives this quarter in latam and puerto rico. we look forward to sharing our further progress with you in the coming quarters.
with that, i will now turn the call over to joaquin.
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
thank you, mac, and good afternoon, everyone. i'll now provide a review of our second quarter 2019 results. turning to slide 8, you will see the consolidated second quarter results for evertec. total revenue for the second quarter was $122.5 million, up 8% to $113.3 million from the prior year. our sales volume for the quarter was down slightly versus prior year primarily due to prior year's volume benefiting from ebt relief funding that ended last quarter. additionally, we had a lower average ticket this quarter, offset by higher net spread driven by pricing actions. we've also benefited from new fees on ath movil and ath movil business, increased core banking transactions and increase in network services related to new managed services.
and lastly, revenue increased due to hardware and software sales and completed projects of approximately $2.5 million. total revenue for the 6 months year-to-date was $241.4 million and up 8% year-over-year. adjusted ebitda for the quarter was $57.8 million, an increase of 7% from $53.8 million in the prior year. adjusted ebitda margin was 47.2%, and this represents a 30 basis point decrease in our adjusted ebitda margin compared to the prior year. the year-over-year decrease in margin primarily reflects the impact of the elevated average ticket last year that drove a higher-than-normal margin as well as the mix of revenues this year that was skewed to business solutions segment this quarter, which has a lower margin contribution.
additionally, we continue to have higher costs related to our investments in technology platforms, and fx negatively impacted us approximately $1 million this quarter. year-to-date, adjusted ebitda was $115.4 million, an increase of 7% from $107.7 million in the prior year. adjusted net income in the quarter was $37.2 million, an increase of 8% as compared to the prior year primarily reflecting the higher adjusted ebitda, offset by increased interest and operating depreciation and amortization. our adjusted net income effective tax rate in the quarter was 11%, and we now anticipate our full year tax rate to be approximately 12%. adjusted eps was $0.51 for the quarter and grew 11% compared to the prior year and benefited from our share repurchases today. year-to-date, adjusted net income was $74.3 million, up 7%. and adjusted earnings per common share was $1.01, up 9% from $0.93 in the prior year.
moving on to slide 9. i'll now cover our segment results starting with the merchant acquiring segment. in the second quarter, merchant acquiring net revenue increased 3% year-over-year to approximately $26.8 million. the revenue increase was driven primarily by pricing actions impacting both our spread and our nontransactional revenue, offset by a 1% decline in volumes related to prior year having the benefit of ebt relief funding. average ticket declined approximately 8% versus the prior year but was in line with our expectations as spend continues to move toward more normalized levels. adjusted ebitda for the segment was $12.3 million, down 3%.
adjusted ebitda margin was 45.7%, down approximately 300 basis points as compared to last year, reflecting the impact on margin of the lower average ticket this quarter. we anticipate a similar margin over the next few quarters. for the 6-month period, merchant acquiring increased 7% to $52.8 million primarily due to the same reasons i referenced in the quarter. adjusted ebitda year-to-date for the segment was $24.2 million, up 3%. and adjusted ebitda margin was 45.9%, a 170 basis point decrease as compared to last year. on slide 10, you will see the results of the payment services, puerto rico and the caribbean segment. revenue for the segment in the second quarter was $30.5 million, up approximately 9% as compared to last year.
transaction volumes grew approximately 5%, and we continue to benefit from new transaction fees for services such as ath movil and ath movil business that we implemented last year. adjusted ebitda for the segment was $20.3 million, increasing 11% as compared to last year. adjusted ebitda margin was 66.7%, up approximately 120 basis points as compared to last year primarily due to new transaction fees. year-to-date, revenue for the segment was $62.5 million, up approximately 13% as compared to last year. year-to-date, adjusted ebitda was $41.6 million, and adjusted ebitda margin was 66.5%, up approximately 190 basis points as compared to last year for the same reasons previously mentioned. for the full year, we now anticipate this segment to be in the high single-digits revenue growth and continue to deliver consistent margins.
on slide 11, you will see the results for our payment services, latam segment. revenue for the segment in the second quarter was $21.1 million, up approximately 10% as compared to last year. this growth was driven by intercompany license and service revenue and organic revenue growth of approximately 5%, partially offset by the anticipated $300,000 of client attrition. revenue will continue to be uneven due to license sale implementations and consulting services that did not occur in the same quarter last year.
we continue to focus on our strategy of shifting from a licensing model to a processing model, which will eventually result in a more recurring and growing revenue base. and the santander agreement we announced earlier this quarter is an example of executing on this goal. adjusted ebitda for the segment was $7.8 million, and adjusted ebitda margin was 36.8%, up significantly as compared to last year driven by the intercompany services and license sales to puerto rico, partially offset by fx. year-to-date, revenue for the segment was $41.9 million, up approximately 6% as compared to last year. total revenue growth for the full year in the latam segment is now anticipated to be mid-single digits and considers lower client attrition of $2 million to $3 million. year-to-date adjusted ebitda for the segment was $16 million, and adjusted ebitda margin was 38.2%. for the full year, we now anticipate the adjusted ebitda margin to be in the mid-30s due to impact from intercompany services and license revenue.
on slide 12, you will find the results for the business solutions segment. business solutions revenue for the second quarter was up approximately 12% to $55.2 million. revenue growth in this segment was driven by new services for both banco popular and the government of puerto rico as well as hardware and software sales and other projects completed in the quarter, representing revenue of approximately $2.5 million and primarily resulting from the integration for banco popular's reliable acquisition. for the quarter, adjusted ebitda was $24.3 million, and adjusted ebitda margin was 44%, down approximately 310 basis points as compared to last year.
the decrease in the adjusted ebitda margin was primarily driven by lower-margin hardware sales and increased expenses related to infrastructure that negatively impacted the quarter. year-to-date business solutions revenue was $106.5 million, up 10%, and adjusted ebitda for the segment was $47.3 million with a 44.4% margin. we continue to anticipate revenue growth of mid-single digits and anticipate margins to remain at this level. moving on to slide 13, you will see a summary of corporate and other. our second quarter adjusted ebitda was a negative $6.8 million, an increase of 32% over prior year. corporate and other includes the negative impact of approximately $1.3 million related to intercompany eliminations that did not take place in the prior year.
excluding this impact, corporate and other adjusted ebitda would be $5.5 million, reflecting an increase of approximately $300,000 largely due to lower spend in the prior year related to the lower post-hurricane activities. as a percentage of total revenue, corporate and other was 5.6% and approximately 100 basis point above the prior year primarily due to the negative impact of the intercompany eliminations. we continue to anticipate corporate and other to be approximately 6% as a percentage of total revenue on a full year basis. year-to-date, our corporate and other expense was $13.7 million or 5.7% as a percentage of total revenue. moving on to our year-to-date cash flow overview on slide 14.
our beginning cash balance was approximately $87 million, including restricted cash of approximately $17 million. net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $76 million or a $1 million decrease as compared to prior year, and this includes the impact of settlement timing and other working capital differences. capital expenditures year-to-date were approximately $36 million. an update of critical technology infrastructure and development related to some of the new contracts announced were the primary drivers in our year-to-date spending. given the recent new contracts and the year-to-date capital expenditures, we're increasing our capex expectations for the full year to be in a range of $50 million to $55 million. next, we paid approximately $7 million in scheduled debt payments, $6 million in withholding taxes on share-based compensation and $1 million of other debt paid down resulting in a total net debt decrease of approximately $14 million. we've also paid cash dividends of approximately $7 million, and we repurchased approximately $28 million of common stock for a total of $35 million returned to our shareholders.
we have approximately $34 million available for future use under the company's share repurchase program through december 31, 2020, and we recently announced another $0.05 dividend to be paid on september 7, 2019, to shareholders of record as of august 6. our ending cash balance as of june 30 was $78 million, and this included approximately $14 million of restricted cash. moving to slide 15, you will find a summary of our debt as of june 30, 2019. our quarter-ending net debt position was approximately $474 million, comprised of the $64 million of unrestricted cash and approximately $538 million of total short-term borrowings and long-term debt.
our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5.2%. our net debt-to-trailing 12-month adjusted ebitda was approximately 2.2x, reflecting the credit agreement terms, which limit the cash applied to the net debt calculation to $60 million. as of june 30, total liquidity was $181 million. this balance excludes restricted cash and includes the available borrowing capacity under our revolver. moving to slide 16, i will now provide an update on our 2019 guidance. we are increasing our revenue range to $477 million to $482 million, representing growth of 5% to 6% over the last year. the increase in the revenue range reflects our q2 results and a modestly improved outlook for the remainder of the year and considers some uncertainty related to the recent developments in puerto rico and current political ambiguity.
as a reminder, several of our current business solution contracts with the government require annual renewals. regarding overall margin, we anticipate that our adjusted ebitda margin will be approximately 47% for the year. this estimate includes the higher margin results to date and a more normal margin expectation in the back half of the year. moving on to our operating depreciation, which came in slightly above our earlier forecast. it is now anticipated to be approximately $34 million primarily due to the timing of completed projects. our adjusted earnings per common share outlook has been increased to $1.92 to $1.98, which represents a range of 4% to 8% as compared to $1.84 in 2018. this change reflects the q2 results as well as the benefit on share count resulting from the share repurchases made year-to-date and incorporates a lower effective tax rate, now expected to be closer to 12% as a result of the revenue mix shift in puerto rico to lower tax businesses.
now turning to 2020. while we are not prepared to give guidance, i would like to comment on the pending acquisition, recent agreements and other considerations. first, placetopay is a small tuck-in acquisition, and we'll provide further details after we have regulatory approval. nonetheless, we're excited about the prospects of this deal and the additional presence it gives us in some of our main markets. second, the agreements with citibank, citibanamex and santander chile are all anticipated to contribute to our latam growth in 2020. and as we get further along on implementation and complete our pilots, we will share further insight. third, while we have benefited in 2019 from further delays in client attrition in latam, we anticipate attrition in 2020 will be between $3 million to $5 million.
fourth, we will continue our transition from a licensing to a processing model in 2020, which will provide some unevenness in our organic revenue growth in latam throughout the year. lastly, in puerto rico, we will continue to monitor the flow of federal funds and the potential positive impact to the economy from rebuilding and investment. in summary, it was a strong quarter for evertec. we are executing well against our longer-term initiatives, and i look forward to updating you on our progress.
we will now open the call for questions. operator, please go ahead and open the line.

[operator instructions] the first question comes from bob napoli with william blair. please go ahead.
bob napoli
thank you. i was hoping to get -- i think in your presentation -- the santander chile, i think it says you expect to be profitable with that in 2020. i just wanted -- was hoping to get maybe just some tam, what you think the opportunity is for that business. and then i have a follow-up question.
mac schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so let me just give a little bit of color on the market, bob, so that people understand what's going on in chile and sort of the deal that we struck. so right now in chile, transbank owns all of the merchant contracts. so when you look at a lot of people entering different countries, like when global payments or evo or elavon entered spain, they actually bought a book of merchant contracts, immediately had revenue because they own the contracts, and they immediately had earnings. chile is a bit different because all the merchant contracts are owned by transbank. so there are 2 types of deals you can do in chile. you could do -- try do a jv with a bank. and what's going to happen with that type of jv is there's a significant investment involved, but you're going to have to add revenue $1 at a time as you board new merchants. so you're not actually buying a portfolio. you're investing in a jv, and it's going to be a slow ramp as that bank picks up their share and takes the merchants away from transbank.
our deal is a bit different. it's a processing deal. so our deal is that we are actually providing transbank with switching and authorizations -- or i'm sorry, santander. santander switching and authorization services, fraud management, merchant management. so we are actually the processor, and we actually have minimums in the contract because we know that it's going to take time for some of these banks to pick up market share and there may be, in some cases, a price force. so our strategy in chile is very much similar to what we have in puerto rico in that we have a good processing business. i mean we have a nice processing segment here. that's the same thing. so our intent in chile is we have minimums on the contract with santander, and we plan over time to offer multiple products to these banks, like we do with santander today and other clients. and we also hope to have other processing arrangements with other banks and other merchant acquirers in the market.
bob napoli
can you -- i mean can you give any feel for like what kind of revenue? would that ramp up and the size of the revenue potential from santander and...
mac schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
i can when we give guidance for 2020. we're not prepared -- so right now just -- not to be coy, but we're very focused on getting this implemented. we've been working on this for some time. we started negotiations well before you actually saw this contract signed. so we are focused on piloting before the end of the year and actually being in the market early next year. so our focus right now is getting santander up and running, to making sure we hit the banks, making sure we have the features so that they can grow their portfolio.
and then i think as we get more confident on that time line and we have those milestones, then as we give you 2020 guidance, we'll have more clarity on that, the impact because we just don't want to get ahead of ourselves. but as you know, we're incredibly excited. it's a -- if you look at the gdp of chile, it's 3x what puerto rico is. we already have a good business there. we have over 200 employees. santander has been a customer for a while, and now we are partnering with the biggest bank in the market to actually open up the market. so i think it's a great milestone reputationally, but it's also going to add revenue and ebitda to that segment that will be helpful next year.
bob napoli
and just what can you tell us about placetopay and the colombia market, the gateway that you're acquiring? and what do you think the opportunity is or the tam is for that business over time?
mac schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so colombia has been -- i mean we've been in the colombia market longer than we have chile. and we're very pleased with our team there and what they have been working on, but the market has not opened as quickly as we had hoped, and we've talked about that a little bit i think in the past. what this acquisition does for us is twofold: one is it gives us an even stronger presence and role in that -- in country. so as we do believe over time that market will open, we'll be even more considered a partner of choice given our in-country presence.
the second thing it does is it's very similar to paygroup. 4 years ago, when we were trying to cross-sell and win business in the region, we didn't have the product set that would really win the businesses of big banks. the paygroup acquisition, as you've seen, has helped us win santander chile processing business, helped us expand our relationship with citibank. the placetopay acquisition now will give us a gateway product and an e-commerce product that will strengthen our portfolio of offerings throughout the region as well. so it's complementary on both fronts, the in-country presence in colombia and also the suite of products that we can now offer to all of our customers.
bob napoli
great thank you i appreciate it.
mac schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, bob.

the next question comes from vasu govil with kbw. please go ahead.
vasu govil -- kbw -- analyst
hi thanks for taking my question and congratulations to you all. this was a good quarter, making a lot of progress in latin america.
mac schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
vasu govil -- kbw -- analyst
so i guess the question i had for you, mac, was as you think about the pipeline of clients across latin america, it doesn't seem like there is an increase in pace of decision-making there following this deal in chile. and could we expect more deals to be coming in the relative near term? or was this sort of more of a one-off situation based on what was happening in chile, and so we'll just have to wait and see as to how the region develops.
mac schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
so i mean we talked about it a little bit on the call, the year-end call where we set guidance for the year. i'm more optimistic on some of the opportunities in these markets more than i have been the previous 3 to 4 years that i served at this company. i mean we saw early on the movement with prisma. and now prisma is owned by advent. we knew that santander was leaving. it was public information, and we know that other banks in chile are looking for opportunities. so i would say we think the trend will continue to accelerate. it's country by country. chile people are, again, continuing to look for alternatives now that the market is moving, but i'm hopeful over the coming years that this will be a trend throughout the region.
and again, it's not just one country that we see this trend. it's multiple countries where i would say for the past couple of years, there's been a lot of noise and desire and intent and speculation. but i would say within the last year, if you look at the prisma trade and now this transaction, you're actually seeing the movement and the opportunities taking place. so i can't predict it. i can't give you a time line of when opportunities will open in each market. but the markets where we have investments, we're engaged in trying to uncover those opportunities.
vasu govil -- kbw -- analyst
that's great. and i guess just 2 very quick ones. one, i think oriental bank made an acquisition with scotiabank in puerto rico, and i know oriental was a client of yours or partner of yours. so does that have any implications for you guys? and the second quick one i had was that we've seen a lot of press articles that there was a pullback in economic activity following all the protests that have been happening related to the political situation. was that reflected in your july sales volumes in any way? or was it just a second quarter trend?
mac schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
so what i'd say on scotia and oriental, they're both actually customers. so i don't see in the immediate future any significant change, but both of those are customers of ours. they're both members of the ath network, and we do business with both. so i don't see any immediate impact in that -- and that change. on the -- i mean you saw the headlines in the news that there definitely was some economic impact because in old san juan, the cruise ships didn't come in. so there was some economic impact. i'll let joaquin, if he'll speak a little bit more to that.
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean directionally, vasu, as we said on the call, we were down year-over-year on sales volume. that trend we're seeing in july as well. obviously, what mac said is right. there is some economic impact in the july numbers. we're still monitoring as to how much of impact that really is, but nothing that we would expect to continue forward as the government stabilizes.
vasu govil -- kbw -- analyst
great thank you very much.
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
the next question comes from george mihalos with cowen. please go ahead.
george mihalos -- cowen -- analyst
hey good afternoon guys. just wanted to -- the merchant acquiring business, where i think you said it was pricing that drove the positive growth, can you just square for us again why the ebitda margin declined given the pricing benefit? what are kind of the puts and takes that impacted the quarter there?
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
sure. so i would say if you look at it different -- and take from a volume perspective, we're down year-over-year. and that's mainly ebt, so we had some ebt funding last year that we don't have this year. we've also been seeing the -- a declining average ticket. that's something that impacts spread, and that's something that we've been expecting. even in the prior year, we saw a very elevated average ticket, and we've now said a couple of quarters that we were seeing that come back to normal. so that has a direct impact to our spread. our pricing initiatives are offsetting some of that effect from a negative volume and a declining average ticket, and the net is negative to overall margin, but our overall spread is positive.
george mihalos -- cowen -- analyst
okay. and i would assume that you would expect some improvement throughout the course of the year.
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
in terms of our margin.
george mihalos -- cowen -- analyst
yes.
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
well, we're still expecting our average ticket in june to come down slightly. it is still above pre-hurricane levels, and we are expecting similar ebitda margins to what we saw in q2 for the remainder of the year.
george mihalos -- cowen -- analyst
okay, ok. that's helpful. and then the attrition on the latam side, which again, continues to kind of be pushed out. mac, again do you feel that there are increased opportunities to maybe hold on to some of that business?
mac schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i mean the longer it goes, the less likely. we were able a couple of quarters ago to announce that we were able to retain a little bit of business. we will continue to try. we're not hopeful about it. we're more hopeful on the new business. but i mean we will continue to do the best job we can to continue to improve our services, see if we can sell them other services and keep them but right now, it's -- we still believe that it's more likely that they will leave than not.
george mihalos -- cowen -- analyst
okay great, thank you.
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
thanks, george.
operator
the next question comes from james friedman with susquehanna. please go ahead.
james friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
hi and thank you, tim, mac and kay. it's jamie at susquehanna. mac, i just want to revisit a couple of the comments you made in your prepared remarks. let me start with the managed services. what's that about? if you could give us some use cases about how that works and how significant that is to the company's opportunity?
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
jamie, so it's joaquin. so those managed services specifically relate in this case to some government contracts that we had announced in the previous year that we have won with the puerto rico government. in some cases, they relate to either disaster recovery services, a management of infrastructure and applications, air communications, etc. and some of those contracts -- actually most of those contracts usually take some time from signing through implementation. and it takes some time for us to begin to actually see revenue reflected, and we're beginning to see that now. so this is related to some contracts that we announced a couple of quarters ago.
mac schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
hi. jamie, this is mac. thanks. i do want to thank you for picking up the stock. what i would say is what -- after the hurricane, we did have several examples of how we were able to recover very, very quickly. and the government and some other customers took notice of these types of managed services contracts. really, our ability to sell those and close those picked up after we demonstrated our resiliency after the hurricane.
james friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
and mac or joaquin, you also said in your prepared remarks, you talked about long-term project completions. is that something that's like finite and over? or will that be continuing through the second half and into next year?
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
so it's somewhere in the middle, is how i can say, jamie. these are projects that have 2 pieces to it. they have an implementation phase, and they have a more recurring phase. what you're seeing and what we're calling out in this case are projects that we've been working on for in some cases, a year or more. and we've ended implementation phase, and we recognized a portion of revenue related to that implementation which will not recur. but now we will be able to see some smaller recurring fees over time.
james friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
okay. and then maybe my last question is about the citibank regional agreement for collections. i'm just wondering how does that work? is that consumer credit collections or business collections or all of the above? if you can give us any idea about how that process is.
mac schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so it's managed out of their cash management group and their treasury group. and they've got a product called one receivable, and we are sort of the engine of that. and it allows some of their large customers to post their bills online to get those bills paid from their different vendors or partners and then for them to be able to concentrate that cash into accounts and effectively manage their capital. so we're pretty excited about it, and we originally rolled it out in colombia. now we've got these 2 countries, and we hope to roll it out throughout the region. so -- and it's really core to citibank's payment strategy and treasury management strategy in latin america.
james friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
okay great good number here guys. thank you.
mac schuessler -- president and chief executive officer

the next question is from john davis with raymond james. please go ahead.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
hey good afternoon guys. mac, i wanted to maybe touch on the chile opportunity beyond santander. so i think you mentioned potential opportunity to get some other processing relationships. is there an opportunity for some of the smaller banks for you to actually do the front-end acquiring, thinking maybe some of these smaller banks don't have the resources to build out their funding capabilities. so you could do similar what you do in puerto rico, where you process for some banks but you also do the front-end acquiring for other banks. is that an option longer term in chile?
mac schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean it's really interesting because i think the investment community has really historically followed merchant acquiring businesses and fallen love with them because you do own the pricing. you do get the organic growth, and that's sort of where i had a lot of background myself in global payments. if you look at evertec as a company, we have 2 segments in puerto rico around payments: one is the processing business, and one is the merchant acquiring. and the processing business in puerto rico for us, puerto rico actually has higher margins. so it can be a very good margin business, and our view in each of these markets is they're relatively small. i mean if you look at chile compared to spain, it's a much smaller market.
so the way that we think we build a profitable business is by being multiclient, multiproduct. and that's what we've done in puerto rico, and that's what we plan to do in chile. and in chile, we already have many of these financial institutions and retailers as customers on the collection product that we just discussed that we're rolling out with citibank in latin america. we've also rolled out our risk management product to some of these and in a cloud-based format. so this is just an evolution of extending that relationship with santander chile, so that we're now doing their acquiring process, which is even a bigger piece of their technology spend. and we plan to do that with other partners.
the contract, like i said, has minimums. it does -- i mean we're very, very focused on getting santander up and getting it right, but it does allow us, over the course of the contract, to go after other banks or financial institutions or new entrants who want to get into the processing or merchant acquiring business. so that's our strategy. again, we think that, that makes more sense in a country like chile. instead of just having an exclusive merchant acquiring joint venture, which a, is going to take time to actually make money; b, you're betting on one financial institution, so you better be right because you're not buying a book; and c, again this may be -- the way that many win business is a pricing war, which we won't be subject to. so that's the way we chose to enter the market, and that's what we plan to replicate in the other markets. again, if there's another market different, where there's a big merchant acquiring portfolio for sale, then maybe that would be our entry strategy. but this is our strategy for chile, and we're pretty excited about it.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, and then maybe just touch on the colombian market for a second. i think obviously you guys did the acquisition a couple of years back. it's kind of been very quiet. i think everyone -- you mentioned earlier, it's frustrating and slow for that market to open. is there anything behind the timing of this deal? was this just opportunistic? or do you think we're actually getting closer to the colombian market opening. just kind of any commentary there.
mac schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
no. i don't see -- so we talked about again -- when we launched the year that we saw -- we knew chile was open. i mean -- and we knew prisma was trading. there's not an indicative signal where someone has publicly stated there's going to be a change in the market. there's still a lot of speculation in the market. there's still a lot of interest by banks to see what alternatives there are. so again, there's nothing imminent. what i would tell you is we're positioning ourselves in colombia much as we were positioned in chile, and that's to have a good, solid business that has stable revenue.
we're already making money. we have an executive team that can interact with the banks, and we can roll out products through that business. we did say earlier that we are looking at localizing our products there, but the -- any big movements like santander is a little bit tbd. and i do want to remind you on the placetopay, we say this every time. but on placetopay, we're not closed. we got to get the regulatory approval, as always.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
and joaquin, i'm not going to let you off the hook here. so any change in the aid expectations and guide? or -- i know you're not going to give me a -- quantify the impact from the protest. but have the protest have an impact on the way you think about the pace of aid coming in? and i think being able to raise guidance this much pretty much signals that there was very little aid expectations in your numbers. but just maybe talk high level or qualitatively about how you think about the protest, the impact on aid, not just this year but kind of as we go forward into 2020.
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
sure. so as you look at the -- our guidance that we just put out and what that reflects for the second half, we reflected a modest improvement in our original expectations. but of course, everything that's happened and the fact that fema said that now we have to go through an additional hurdle for aid is something that we need to consider. in terms of the total aid coming to puerto rico, i don't think we have -- we don't have a change in our expectation at this point. we -- what we're seeing and what's being reflected in our actuals is what we're expecting through the end of the year. but obviously, we continue to be cautious.
we continue to monitor the disbursements, which continue to be slow and continue to be delayed. but we're comfortable with the guidance that we have for the full year. in terms of the protests, as mac mentioned, really there's some cruise ships that have been coming to the island. obviously, old san juan was impacted because people were protesting there, and they couldn't spend and some of the larger strip mall were closed for a couple of days. and so it's very specific. nothing that we think is a trend, and nothing that we would call out as something that's going to have a long-term impact in our numbers.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
okay all right thanks guys.
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
the next question is from jim schneider with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
jim schneider -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for taking my question. mac, now that we're a little bit closer to getting some clarity on the relief funds and their timing, can we maybe just kind of walk through any more details around what your assumptions were as you enter the year? and what they are now? and kind of any quantification would be helpful and kind of directionally, whether they moved up or down.
mac schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'll hand that to joaquin.
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
sorry, can you repeat that? i didn't catch that.
jim schneider -- goldman sachs -- analyst
in terms of relief funding and the timing of it and the magnitude of it, now that there's more clarity on that front, can you maybe clarify what your assumption was with respect to your guidance heading into the year? what it is now? and directionally whether it's kind of better or worse?
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
i think as i just said in the previous question, we had always guided to a modest level of aid since the beginning, given that we knew the complexity around the funding and the controls and the delays that we're seeing here in the island. i don't think -- that hasn't changed in reality except for an additional funding for ebt that was approved a couple of months ago. there's an additional $600 million related to ebt that will get dispersed starting in august. if you compare that to the ebt funding, relief funding from the previous year, which was $1.2 billion, this is half of the amount and it's going to impact half of the year. so the impact to our merchant acquiring segment is not very significant, but it's something positive that will definitely flow through our numbers. and that should offset any other potential delay that we might see in aid. and all that is considered in the guidance as it stands.
jim schneider -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's helpful. thanks. and then maybe just as a follow-up, you referenced several pricing actions kind of benefiting the segment, and you talked about them before. but can you maybe comment further on whether there's an additional pricing action and room for that kind of on a go-forward basis that would either kind of potentially benefit you as we head into 2020?
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
i mean we're always looking for different ways in which to continue growing both our top end and our margin. in this case, given the impact to volume from having ebt in the previous year, we thought it was a -- and we hadn't done pricing action in some time, it was a good moment for us to take advantage of that lever. i don't think it's something that i would tell you right now we're going to do for 2020. we will discuss that as we get closer to giving guidance on 2020, but we're always looking at different aspects of the business, both from a pricing perspective, new transaction fees or new services to complement the current services.
mac schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
right. what i would just say, i would compliment joaquin. i think he's done a very good job of making sure we're analyzing the profitability in certain segments, making sure that we take a look at are we making the return we want based on the risk profile, repricing them as they're appropriate, taking a look at some of the value-added services, like our pcics, are they within market, raising them where there's an opportunity. so again, i would give him a lot of credit for being much more disciplined about that, which has benefited the year.
jim schneider -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great thank you very much.
operator
[operator instructions] the next question comes from james faucette with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
priscilla russo -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, this is priscilla on for james. just 2 quick questions. how do you think about developing your e-commerce offerings overall? it's still growing radically in latin america, but it's still quite small. so how do you think about it when you're prioritizing point of sale versus online?
mac schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean that's a great question. so what i would tell you is we're seeing not only a shift to online but even to mobile, which is even a quick transition. in puerto rico, we've done very good job capturing the mobile market with our ath movil product and making sure that we have the ability to use your mobile phone, and we'll continue to focus on that segment.
but i think one of the openings or one of the opportunities we had to make is to have a better gateway, so that we could provide better services to merchants and give them a better alternative for processing their online payments. and that was part of the rationale for placetopay. we do see the shift. it hasn't occurred to the same rate that it has as you see in the u.s., but we do think with ath in our network, we have captured a significant amount of growth by using that as a digital product. and the placetopay acquisition is an investment in trying to improve our gateway offering.
priscilla russo -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. and then can you give us an update on pvot and any feedback that you've received from merchants about the product so far? and where do you think you are in terms of development, especially as you try to expand it to other markets?
mac schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so we don't have an update for this call specifically on pvot. what i'll tell you is we do, as we've said before, we have a road map. we have a restaurant application that we'll be piloting in a couple of months, and that will be rolling out by the end of the year. so we're very focused on what is the development pipeline, so that we continue to add new features, new segments, and we continue to be pleased with the acceptance that we're seeing in the market.
priscilla russo -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great thank you.
mac schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
the next question is a follow-up from bob napoli with william blair. please go ahead.
bob napoli
thank you. just want to get a little more color on the trends in ath movil and the mobile business as well. the -- and i think -- you said it adds 1% to revenue growth for this year and just trying to get a feel for the trends and what you think that could add to revenue over the next few years.
mac schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so i'll take it, and then i'll hand it to joaquin. as you know, bob, as we spent time together, we have really focused on making sure that we are innovating, we're investing in new products, new services, testing new technologies. and we are pretty excited to be able to show now how that's impacted the business, and that's why we want to show you that ath movil plus ath movil business. so ath movil, both products is now contributing 1% of our growth this year. so we expect it to continue to provide growth opportunities in 2020, and some of the other products we're investing too as well. i don't know, joaquin, if you want to add anything else.
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
well, the only thing i would just comment on, bob, just to remind everyone is some of the monetization of these fees began second half of last year. so we're seeing that grow over in the first half of the current year, right, get really reflected in terms of growth. that laps in july. having said that, we do continue to also look in terms of innovation for different uses of both ath movil and ath movil business and different features that we continue to add to eventually either continue to generate a high number of transactions, which we continue to see today and new fees as well. but that's something that will happen over time.
bob napoli
and then just last question, the -- you raised your capex forecast for this year and just wondered what the addition was for.
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
so it's mainly -- we did some big hardware refresh that were due, and we took advantage of good pricing to make those and some of these contracts that we just mentioned, like santander, citibank, required development, required infrastructure. and obviously as we push to get this into production as soon as possible, we're having to invest in ourselves for that type of growth, which is actually part of our capital allocation strategy in terms of investing for growth, both through m&a and through capex.
bob napoli
great, thank you. i appreciate it.
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
thanks bob.

morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, kay and good afternoon, everyone. we are pleased with our results for the third quarter which were at the high end of our expectations. we are executing well and we continue to benefit from puerto rico's economic recovery, our innovation strategies and our latin american focus. beginning on slide 4, i'll cover some of the quarter's financial highlights and provide you with an update on recent developments.
total revenue was $119 million, an increase of 6% compared to 2018, as we saw growth across all segments, we benefited from some pricing actions, our deployment of value-added solutions, new managed services and the completion of projects for popular. adjusted ebitda was $55 million or 6% growth over the prior year and adjusted earnings per share was $0.47, an increase of 4% compared to last year, we generated significant operating cash flow and have returned approximately $39 million year-to-date to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
moving on to our progress in latin america, beginning on slide 5. first, we are pleased with our progress implementing our collection product for citi as they now have several new clients operating on our platform and a growing pipeline. additionally, we continue to make progress implementing payment systems for santander chile. and continuing to anticipate an early 2020 announcement of our first transaction. regarding the recent unrest in chile, our business remains strong and has been mostly unaffected. although we are monitoring the situation closely. also, we continue to see strong interest in our products and we have recently signed a license agreement with a brazilian company, c6 bank for our risk product. c6 bank is a recently launched digital bank in brazil with over 200,000 accounts already.
this new contract validates that our products are expanding their reach from traditional clients to new and emerging digital providers in the region. lastly, we continue to anticipate receiving approval from the fed and closing by year-end on our pending acquisition of placetopay, a colombian based gateway and payment service provider. now moving onto our progress in puerto rico on slide 6. first, revenue growth in puerto rico and the caribbean was approximately 7% driven by organic transaction growth of approximately 5% as well as pricing actions.
in addition, we continue to benefit from contract wins now producing revenue in our business solutions segment as well as completed projects for banco popular related to the conversion of their reliable acquisition. regarding innovation, we have successfully completed our pilot -- pvot with restaurants and recently showcased the product at the annual restaurant industry convention in puerto rico, generating interest from a variety of clients and prospects.
we will continue to focus on adding new features to the product based on client feedback. from a more macro view, we benefited from the start of additional ebt relief funding in august and expect those funds to continue for the next 12 months. we were also pleased to see that fema has again granted the government of puerto rico the authority to validate the disbursements requested by local agencies. another positive note in the business environment in puerto rico was the recently released unemployment figure, which has declined to 7.6%, its lowest point in recent memory. regarding the government's financial health, the oversight board recently filed a debt adjustment proposal with the courts which should modify over $35 billion in obligations and potentially reduce that debt to almost a third of the amount outstanding.
although there continues to be ambiguity on the timing of further federal funds and the resolution of the debt situation. the longer-term positive impact will be contingent on these factors, as well as the continued rebuilding and structural reforms on the island. lastly, i want to comment on recent events that reflect evertec's culture and values, while puerto rico was spared during the recent hurricane season, our neighbors in the bahamas were devastated by hurricane dorian. we truly understand their challenges ahead and donated $100,000 to their relief efforts.
additionally, as part of our commitment to education, this quarter we awarded a 135 scholarships to outstanding students in puerto rico and latin america, our support to education, over the last five years has totaled over $500,000. we have also recently launched an initiative to increase women applicants to our scholarship program and partnership with various female leaders from the stem industry in puerto rico. evertec values diversity and inclusion and believes that supporting tomorrow's leaders will yield tremendous impact for the communities we serve.
we look forward to sharing our further progress with you as we wrap up 2019 and look ahead to 2020. with that, i will now turn the call over to joaquin.
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, mac, and good afternoon, everyone. i'll now provide a review of our third quarter 2019 results. turning to slide 8, you will see the consolidated third quarter results for evertec. total revenue for the third quarter was $118.8 million, up 6% compared to $112 million in the prior year. we continue to benefit from a higher net spread driven by pricing actions. we've also benefited from fees on ath movil and ath movil business, increased core banking transactions and increasing network services as well as $2 million related to completed projects.
total revenue for the nine months year-to-date was $360.2 million and up 7% year-over-year. adjusted ebitda for the quarter was $55.5 million, an increase of 6% from $52.1 million in the prior year. adjusted ebitda margin was 46.7% and this represents a 20 basis point increase compared to the prior year. the year-over-year increase in margin primarily reflects higher revenues and high margin projects completed in the quarter, partially offset by the impact of the elevated average ticket last year that drove a higher than normal margin as well as a delay in government revenue as the government turnover experienced earlier this quarter resulting in contracts, not being renewed timely while we continue to provide services. fx also negatively impacted us by approximately $1 million this quarter. year-to-date, adjusted ebitda was $170.9 million, an increase of 7% from $159.8 million in the prior year. adjusted net income in the quarter was $34.6 million, an increase of 3% as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting the higher adjusted ebitda offset by increased operating depreciation and amortization.
our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 13.7% reflecting a discrete foreign tax impact in this quarter. we continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be close to 12%. adjusted eps was $0.47 for the quarter and grew 4% compared to the prior year and benefited from our share repurchases to-date.
year-to-date adjusted net income was $108.8 million up 6% and adjusted earnings per common share was $1.48 up 7% from $1.38 in the prior year. moving on to slide 9. i'll now cover our segment results, starting with merchant acquiring. in the third quarter, merchant acquiring net revenue increased 8% year-over-year to approximately $26.4 million. the revenue increase was driven primarily by pricing actions impacting both our spread and our non-transactional revenue offset by approximately a 1% decrease in sales volume
average ticket declined approximately 8% versus the prior year and was in line with our expectations as spend continues to move toward more normalized levels. adjusted ebitda for the segment was $11.2 million, up 2%. adjusted ebitda margin was 42.4%, down approximately 230 basis points as compared to last year, reflecting the impact on margin of the lower average ticket this quarter.
for the nine month period. merchant acquiring increased 7% to $79.2 million, primarily due to the same reasons i referenced in the quarter. adjusted ebitda year-to-date for the segment was $35.4 million up 3%. and adjusted ebitda margin was 44.7%, a 190 basis point decrease as compared to last year.
on slide 10, you will see the results for the payment services puerto rico and the caribbean segment. revenue for this segment in the third quarter was $30.4 million up approximately 5% as compared to last year. transaction volumes grew approximately 5% and we continue to benefit from transaction fees on services such as ath movil and ath movil business partially offset by a delay in a government contract renewal of approximately two months. adjusted ebitda for the segment was $18.4 million decreasing 5% as compared to last year. adjusted ebitda margin was 60.4% down approximately 600 basis points as compared to last year, primarily due to increased expenses from price that are under way this quarter and the impact of the delayed government contract renewal. year-to-date revenue for the segment was $92.9 million up approximately 10% as compared to last year, year-to-date adjusted ebitda was $60 million. and adjusted ebitda margin was 64.5%, down approximately 70 basis points as compared to last year.
on slide 11, you will see the results for our payment services latam segment. revenue for the segment in the third quarter was $20.6 million up approximately 9% as compared to last year. this growth was driven by intercompany license and service revenue as well as organic revenue growth of approximately 1% reflecting the anticipated $400,000 of client attrition and the timing of license revenue in the previous year. we continue to see demand for license sales in some regions as evidenced by the c6 bank agreement in brazil. our focus on priority continues to be on shifting from a licensing model to a processing model which will eventually result in a more recurring and growing revenue base.
that said, we're pleased with this new license agreement, which will benefit us as it is implemented in early 2020. adjusted ebitda for the segment was $7.6 million. and adjusted ebitda margin was 36.8% up approximately 220 basis points as compared to last year, driven by the intercompany services and license sales to puerto rico, partially offset by fx. year-to-date revenue for the segment was $62.5 million up approximately 7% as compared to last year. year-to-date adjusted ebidta for the segment was $23.6 million and adjusted ebitda margin was 37.8%.
on slide 12, you will find the results of the business solutions segment. business solutions revenue for the third quarter was up approximately 8% to $52.9 million, revenue growth in this segment was driven by new services as well as other projects completed in the quarter, representing revenue of $2 million primarily resulting from the integration of banco popular's reliable acquisition. for the quarter, adjusted ebitda was $25.1 million and adjusted ebitda margin was 47.4% up approximately 280 basis points as compared to last year. the increase in the adjusted ebitda margin was primarily driven by the completed projects in third [phonetic] quarter.
year-to-date business solutions revenue was $159.5 million up 9% and adjusted ebitda for the segment was $72.4 million with a 45.4% margin. moving on to slide 13, you will see a summary of corporate and other. our third quarter adjusted ebitda was a negative $6.8 million, an increase of 6% over prior year and 5.7% as a percentage of total revenue, which was even with the prior year.
corporate and other includes the negative impact of approximately $1.6 million related to intercompany eliminations that did not take place in the prior year. excluding this impact, corporate and other adjusted ebitda would be $5.2 million, reflecting a decrease of approximately $1.2 million, largely due to higher spend in the prior year related to the timing of projects.
year-to-date, our corporate and other expense was $20.5 million or 5.7% as a percentage of total revenue. moving on to our year-to-date cash flow overview on slide 14. our beginning cash balance was approximately $87 million including restricted cash of approximately $17 million. net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $136 million an $8 million increase as compared to prior year and this includes the impact of settlement timing and other working capital differences. on a positive note regarding our government receivables. these are continuing to improve and are now at the lowest historical level at approximately $6.5 million and we have continued to be paid on schedule.
capital expenditures year-to-date were approximately $50 million. an update of critical technology infrastructure and development related to some of the new contracts announced were the primary drivers in our year-to-date spent. we're now anticipating our capex for the full year to be at the high end of our previous range of $50 million to $55 million.
next, we paid approximately $11 million in scheduled debt payments, $6 million in withholding taxes on share-based compensation and $1 million of other debt pay-downs resulting in a total net debt decrease of approximately $18 million. we also paid cash dividends of approximately $11 million and we repurchased approximately $28 million of common stock for a total of $39 million return to our shareholders.
we have approximately $34 million available for future use under the company's share repurchase program through december 31, 2020. and we recently announced another $0.05 dividend to be paid on december 6, 2019 to shareholders of record as of november 4. our ending cash balance as of september 30th was $116 million and this included approximately $13 million of restricted cash.
moving to slide 15, you will find a summary of our debt as of september 30, 2019. our quarter ending net debt position was approximately $432 million comprised of the $103 million of unrestricted cash and approximately $535 million of total short-term borrowings and long-term debt. our weighted average interest rate was approximately 5%. our net debt to trailing 12 month adjusted ebitda was 2.1 times, reflecting the credit agreement terms, which limits the cash applied to the total net debt calculation to $60 million. as of september 30, total liquidity was $219 million. this balance excludes restricted cash and includes the available borrowing capacity under our revolver.
moving to slide 16. i will now provide an update on our 2019 guidance adjusted primarily due to our q3 results, we are increasing the lower end of our revenue range to $479 million to $482 million, representing growth of 5% to 6% over last year, compared with $477 million to $482 million previously estimated. regarding overall margin, we continue to anticipate that our adjusted ebitda margin will be approximately 47% for the year, our adjusted earnings per common share outlook have been increased on the lower end to $1.95 to $1.98, which represent a range of 6% to 8% as compared to $1.84 in 2018.
now turning to 2020. while we're not prepared to give guidance, i would like to comment on several considerations. first, we're pleased with our new agreements in latam as well as the pending placetopay acquisition, which are all anticipated to contribute to our latam growth in 2020.
we will continue our transition from a licensing to a processing model in 2020 which will provide some unevenness in our organic revenue growth in latam throughout the year. additionally, we have benefited from delays in client attrition, which will now total approximately $2 million in 2019.
we anticipate a headwind of between $4 million to $5 million in 2020. second, in puerto rico, we will continue to monitor the flow of federal funds and the potential positive impact to the economy and our focus on innovation will continue to benefit us in 2020. the cpi index for september was announced october 10 and was 1.7% and should positively impact a majority of our business solutions revenue. lastly, while we are improving and investing in our relationship with popular, we're currently negotiating in connection with a disagreement related to certain pricing terms under the msa. we're both actively working to find a mutually agreeable resolution and while i'm unable to give any further details as this is an ongoing discussion, i thought it was important to provide this update at this time.
we look forward to updating you with our full outlook next quarter. in summary, it was a good quarter for evertec. we're executing well against our longer-term initiatives that will continue to benefit us in 2020 and beyond. i now completed one full-year of earnings calls and investor meetings and i continue to be challenged and energized by what is ahead for evertec and as always, i look forward to updating you. we will now open the call for questions.

i guess, i'm a little confused on the popular pricing disagreement and the potential materiality of that agreement, i mean that contract has been in place for a long time. it -- what is, can you give me a little help and color on what that means. or could mean?.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so from time to time, bob, we have these types of disagreements with the bank and we've always been able to work through and resolve those. so this is not something that we haven't experienced in the past.
this type of dispute. so we're working through with the bank, we can't give a lot more color than we've given on the call as we do every third quarter. we try and give you some of the -- the puts and takes into -- to the following year into 2020. so just like we can't give you more on what citi or santander are going to contribute.
this is not something we can give you any more detail on, but we are actively working working through it with the bank to find out a resolution.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
okay and as we think it's the santander. i am not -- i know you said, you can't do anything or give us any guidance for 2020. but as you think about that relationship over the long term, what type of revenue do you think is possible to generate out -- out of that, say, over five years from today.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
yes, so i'll speak for a second and then i'll let joaquin speak. as we've said on previous calls, this is a processing deal. so as soon as we're up and running and we're still targeting early next year, we will immediately book revenue with a margin, and as they grow and they continue to take share that that will grow over time.
we do have minimums. so their is certainty, but if it grows beyond what we put as a minimums, this business will continue to grow. as we add additional products to these [technical issues] today and as we sell those to other customers. it could become a meaningful business for our chilean operation.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
okay, thank you. and last question, just on the neo banks or the relationship with the brazilian bank. and so is this an effort at banking as a service type of technology effort for fintechs, is this a broad effort taken.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
so what we're seeing, bob, and so in brazil, we are seeing a lot of digital banks come up, in mexico we're seeing a lot of fintech, the new fintech law. and the point we want to make is this is a licensing business -- a licensing deal, which we were moving to processing. so but we're still selling licenses in brazil. the reason we want to point this out was not because of the size of the revenue opportunity but to demonstrate that the evertec of today is now being selected by some of these new fintechs and these digital banks, they're going to be using our risk product primarily so, that's what the -- that's what we want to point this out, it's not just the traditional banks and the traditional players, but the new entrants, who are looking for the best technology are selecting us as well.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
i'm sorry, i mean, you say, it's a risk product, is it something that you expect to expand into other products and services?
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
i hope, i sell them a lot more products, but the risk product is the one that we -- when we bought the -- when we bought tegrant [phonetic] is the one that had a lot of traction we've discussed it. santander chile has it and we're deploying it internally as well. so our hope would be that we can continue to sell them other products and sell this to other banks in the region.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
thank you very much, appreciate it.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, bob.

our next question comes from james friedman from susquehanna. please go ahead with your question.
james friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
hi congratulations on the results. it's jamie, susquehanna. i just got -- got a couple upfront. first, so you, you talked about the pricing actions, you can see that in increased yield, if you could talk to maybe some examples of where that is showing up, that would be helpful that's the first one. and then in terms of the completion, joaquin of the $2 million, i think was the number you used, projects on the business solutions side, could you just remind us where that number has like where it is now relative to where it started from and i think you made some comments on what to expect for next year. so that's the two, first on pricing and next on the projects. thank you.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
so jamie, this is mac. i will -- thanks for the congrats. i'll hand it to joaquin to go through that.
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer and treasurer
hi jamie, so in terms of pricing that's primarily in our merchant acquiring segment. we mentioned earlier in the year that as we were going to see a slowdown in sales volume given our tough compare in the previous year with all the fed funding coming through. we were going to put some pricing actions in place. and so it's mainly in the merchant acquiring segment. i mean, as it relates to the $2 million and it's mainly in our business solutions segment and that's related to as we said the completion of projects from banco popular mainly driven by their acquisition of reliable and our integration of those systems and we reached a milestone during the quarter, that allowed us to recognize that portion of revenue that we mentioned.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
i don't think that answers the question or if you had a follow-up as well.
james friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
yeah, i mean, so, and then in that same narrative joaquin, you had called out, i may be confusing topics here, but with your early remarks on 2020. i thought you had said $4 million to $5 million impact to 2020 is that [speech overlap]
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yes. so that is, yes, so that $4 million to $5 million is related to the account attrition that we have been seeing in latin america, we closed out those -- those accounts, a few years ago and given the time-lapse its taken those clients to roll off, we continue to see a tail and we expect that originally 3 to 5 [phonetic] this current year. those have gotten delayed which we benefited from and during the year, but now we have a tail going to 2020, which we call that will be $4 million to $5 million.
james friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
got it.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
and that number just for additional information is based on communications with the clients and their expectations as to when they expect to actually roll off.
james friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
understood, ok. i'll jump back into the queue. thank you.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, jamie.

our next question comes from vasu govil from kbw. please go ahead with your question.
vasu govil -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my question. i guess first question, there has been a fair amount of consolidation going on on the island. how do you see that impacting evertec in the near-term or the longer term, i mean do you see that as creating more cross-sell opportunity for you or is there a risk on pricing as these relationships get larger. can you talk about that a little bit.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so right now, if you look at the deals for everybody, oriental is taking over scotia, and first bank is taking over santander , all of those are clients today and they're members of ath and we have business with them across different segments. so in the short term, we don't see really any material impact because of the share that we have today and that we already have existing relationships.
vasu govil -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
understood. and then just going back to the popular comment, i understand you said this is something that's happened before, but i don't remember you guys ever calling out -- calling it out before. so i just wanted to understand what's different this time. and if you could give us a little bit more history on what's typically happened in the past, what kind of pricing negotiations, you've had to do historically.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so -- not necessarily specific to pricing, we've had many disputes with the bank, where we happen to sit down and negotiate and come up with some type of resolution. our relationship this large and this complicated that's invariable and we've always been able to resolve those. on the -- on this specific issue, we're bringing it up right now, because as we go into 2020 as q3 call, we always try and give you the puts and takes. and unfortunately, sometimes there's ambiguity to them like the santander deal, the citi deal, even the place to pay revenue and similar to this, we can't comment on the scope but just that we have these types of disagreements, we've historically resolved them and we're working on a specific one as well.
vasu govil -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
got it. and just the very last one from me, on the government contract that you guys announced. can you provide any more color on the magnitude of that contract. and if you have visibility into when that might get signed .
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer and treasurer
i'm sorry, the government contracts that we, that we mentioned, have all been already signed. as we went into our q2 call. we actually mentioned that we obviously given the turmoil and the turnover in the government, and we had some contracts up for renewal, that situation caused some delay that we're calling out impacted us in the payment puerto rico segment, on our business solutions segment. but we have now executed on all contracts. so we don't expect anything additional going forward.
vasu govil -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
understood. thank you very much.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, vasu.

our next question comes from george mihalos from cowen, please go ahead with your question.
george mihalos -- cowen -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, guys. thanks. thanks for taking my questions. looking at the payment services in puerto rico and caribbean the -- the pressure on the ebitda margin this quarter. it's sounds like there is, there are some puts and takes on onetimers over there. how should we think about that going into fourth quarter. now that you have the government contract signed, should we continue to think that there'll be elevated project expenses though as we go from 3q to 4q?
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer and treasurer
so yes, i mean our expectation would be to get to a more normalized ebitda margin as it relates to our payment puerto rico segment, as you mentioned, george. we did have [indecipherable] going in there. we also had a platform going into production, where we had to incur specific expenses as part of our stabilization efforts to keep that up and running as it's a new system that's running. we still expect to see some of that kind of rolling to q4. but we do expect to get to one up something more similar to what we saw in q1 and q2.
george mihalos -- cowen -- analyst
okay, that's helpful and then just a quick follow-up, brazil was a geography that we haven't heard much about. i know the strategic reasons why you haven't gone there from a processing standpoint or from an acquiring standpoint. but mac are there real -- are there additional opportunities there or is this kind of more of a one-off type opportunity.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
no. so what i'd tell you about brazil. i mean it's one of the fast growing payment markets in the region. but it's highly, highly competitive, you got stone, you got pagseguro, you got the traditional players. so what we found and what paygroup had found their niche was is really providing licensed software to those businesses in brazil given that sort of we are focused on spanish-speaking smaller countries, where the other guys are less focused. it's not a priority for us.
we're not localizing the products, we're not building the processing model in brazil, but where we can sell the license, where we can pick up business, we will continue to do so, we do have sort of an active pipeline. but primarily license business, license contracts.
george mihalos -- cowen -- analyst
okay, thank you.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, george.
operator
our next question comes from john davis from raymond james, please go with your question.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, guys. maybe just to start with bigger picture questions here. so as we sit through three quarters of '19, you have exceeded expectations and raised your guidance here a couple of times, despite i would say, lack of upsides on funding. so maybe just talk about what's gone right, what exceeded your expectations so far. and then i have got a follow-up after that.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
yes, so i'll speak to that at the highest level and then let joaquin give his thoughts as well. we said at the beginning of the year, we were very focused on innovation. we are very focused on being opportunistic as markets open. we've been very, very pleased with the opportunities that have unfolded in latin america. the acquisition of paygroup has given us the rolodex, the product set to help open up the chilean market to help create a regional product with citibank. and so we think the combination of our positioning and the market timing has gone very, very well this year.
so we've been incredibly pleased with that. i think, specifically in puerto rico, i've been very pleased with our innovation and our continued track record of rolling out functionality within ath movil, moving out to ath and then we'll -- to ath business and then the things that we're doing on the pos with pvot and some of the other innovations, where we're trying to compete more aggressively. and the other piece of puerto rico, this was done well is making sure that we look at our customers, particularly in the merchant portfolio and look at make -- make sure we're pricing them appropriately and looking for opportunities to maintain our growth trajectory and our margins, by taking pricing actions, where we think that those will be effective.
so those are the things that i've been really pleased with this year. and that i think have gone well. and clearly and i'll throw that there is a reliable conversion with the bank to i think we've had some great success with the bank. i don't know if people know this but if you look at 2014 versus 2019, the incidents that our operational incidents with the bank have gone down 70%. if you look at the reliable conversion. we've had one of the best conversions that we've had with the new business that they bought and this was one of the larger conversion. so i think the execution, we've been very pleased with. and then the timing of the latam business opportunities. joaquin?
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer and treasurer
no. i think you hit on every point. i mean, we've executed in latam, we've been able to find some very important contracts that show what we've been able to do with the products that we've acquired in puerto rico. i would say, obviously the delaying funding continues to be, it will create uncertainty for us. but we've been able to execute through that with some of the pricing actions and executing on some of the projects that we've been able to mention as part of these calls that we've been putting into production and that are reflected in our financials.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
okay and then just as we kind of move to 2020 and i appreciate the color on the puts and takes, but it sounds like on the positive side, you have santander, you have the cpi price increase and then continued innovation with pvot, ath movil and then potentially from on the headwind side, you have potentially whatever those pricing dispute is with the bank and what are we thinking about from a absolute level of -- what do think from an absolute level of spending in puerto rico, housing economies look today versus what you've got the end of the year, how do you think about it going into next year?
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer and treasurer
i mean, it's something that we continue to monitor. and john, the unemployment rate, which we mentioned on the call is at a -- the lowest level, it's been in recent memory. we continue to draw indicators versus pre-hurricane levels and they seem to be in a good place, obviously fed funds continue to be a significant factor in terms of what we can expect for 2020. we didn't see much of that fund flow into 2019.
we are hopeful and expecting that we will see some of that start to move into 2020. if you read the news, hud has been looking to put somebody down in puerto rico or one person to controls are on the funding and hopefully that creates some traction in terms of funds flow and but -- again, we need to monitor it closely to have a better visibility and as we go into our q4 call, we will have more details to share with you guys.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. so sufficing to say, you probably feel better today about the next 12 months than you did when you sat here a year ago and gave initial color on 2019, is that fair to say.
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. and then last one for me. obviously leverage is down approaching 2 turns, didn't buyback much stock in the quarter. maybe talk a little bit on the m&a pipeline, what you guys are thinking, what the leverage comfort range is? how low, will you let leverage get and just kind of any commentary there would be helpful.
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer and treasurer
so what i would start saying is our strategy hasn't changed. we continue to execute our strategy in terms of looking for or deploying capital for growth. and yes our leverage ratio is down, as we said in the beginning of the year. we want to be between 2 times and 3 times, so we're still kind of in that range.
we continue to be actively looking -- m&a, as i said is our, one of the main items in our strategy. and so we continue to look and as we find opportunity that makes sense. we will execute on those. this quarter was a slower one compared to our previous quarters, but we continue to be consistent in how we plan on deploying capital.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, thanks, guys.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from james faucette from morgan stanley. please go ahead with your question.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, thank you so much. i want to follow up on that last question, you've highlighted the activity in brazil and just the amount of investment and activity in the latin american market. it seems to be fairly important right now. i'm wondering, how that's impacting your ability to identify potential m&a targets or partnerships even and what the, like how -- if at any that activity is having on your view and objectives for the rest of latin america.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
so i'll kind of give you my view. and then let joaquin, give you his. what we're finding now is given that we have the products that we're localizing and we said at the beginning of the year in the countries we're localizing them in, this is really opening up more organic opportunities. and so we're investing more capex in latin america around those organic opportunities, which we didn't have five years ago, two reasons, one is the markets weren't opening and the second as we really didn't have the products to provide in the event that they did. so you will -- you have seen more investment in organic growth. we are still looking actively at m&a. we're looking at placetopay is a good example of a product that will help strengthen our position in colombia and more importantly, it will help us complement the products that we don't have by giving us a nice gateway that not only we can use in south america but potentially back in puerto rico.
so we're still focused on those both when we look at the opportunities in the region. but i would say, our previous acquisitions have made the organic opportunities come more alive.
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer and treasurer
well, the only thing i would add is and -- i'm not sure if you're also talking about a capital going into brazil and so many different countries from that side. some of the countries, we're looking at and that we're concentrating on chile, colombia, uruguay, we have a presence in and we have people on the ground there. we know that the -- the landscape. and so we feel that that continues to give us an advantage in terms of identifying targets on what, how and where we want to deploy that capital.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. that's really helpful. and then i want to ask specifically about merchant acquiring revenue growth, you called out some pricing benefits, but i'm wondering if that was in any particular segment of merchants and and do you expect additional pricing actions. just trying to think through kind of what the puts and takes and drivers of that merchant acquiring revenue growth might look like.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
we haven't really broken down our pricing actions in terms of segments there.
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah or parts of the portfolio, but what i can tell you, it's within our merchant acquiring segment and we've looked on both transactional fees as well as non-transactional fee and as we've said before and it's been some time since we've actually used pricing levers for -- for in terms of growth and it's something that we are very careful about doing. we analyze our portfolios. and we look for relationships, where we think we have or we need to execute on pricing actions to make the relationship profitable and while we haven't let -- given that level of breakdown.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and sometimes as we do is just provide additional services around pci. so sometimes it's not just increasing pricing or changing price, i mean, joaquin, has done a great job at reevaluating the portfolio and look at where we -- he thought we had margins that we, that -- now that we find, we need to increase, but it's also been rolling out some additional functionality and features.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then last question from me is you've had a few quarters of benefit -- benefit from monetizing ath movil. can you talk about where you are in those monetization efforts and how much there is to go before you kind of feel like you're at a steady state and can treat that business a bit more organically. if you will.
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah. so we started monetizing ath movil in q3 of last year. so actually we just lapse that in this quarter and we continue to see growth on movil -- our ath movil p2p app as well as our ath movil business app. we're very focused on continuing to get merchants that use our p2p app for doing business into our merchant or our business side of the application and that should also continue or give us other alternatives to continue growing that that type of service.
but at the same time, our focus on innovation is on looking for additional features and ways in which we continue to monetize not just the same service, what additional features within ath movil. so that's how we're looking at it into the future.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, thank you so much.

operator
good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to evertec second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
at this time, i would like to turn the call over to kay sharpton, vice president of investor relations. please go ahead.
kay sharpton -- vice president, investor relations
thank you and good afternoon. with me today are mac schuessler, our president and chief executive officer; and joaquin castrillo, our chief financial officer.
before we begin, i'd like to remind everyone that this call may contain forward-looking statements and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and the company's most recent periodic sec report. during today's call management will provide certain information that will constitute non-gaap financial measures under sec rules, such as adjusted ebitda, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share. reconciliations to gaap measures and certain additional information are also included in today's earnings release and related supplemental slides, which are available in the investor relations section of our company website at www.evertecinc.com.
i'll now hand the call over to mac.
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, kay, and good afternoon, everyone. while we were impacted by the pandemic, we were encouraged to see improvement throughout the quarter in our transaction based business results. we have continued to execute on both product innovations and our priorities in latin america.
beginning on slide 4, total revenue was $118 million, a decrease of 4% compared to 2019. adjusted ebitda was $50 million, a 13% decrease as compared to the prior year. and adjusted earnings per share was $0.38, a decrease of 25% compared to last year. despite the headwinds, we generate significant operating cash flow year-to-date of $87 million, $11 million above prior year due to our results and effective cash management. we returned approximately $14 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. additionally, our liquidity as of june 30th was $234 million.
moving onto our business update on slide 5 for puerto rico. as the puerto rico government started to reduce restrictions beginning in early may there was continued improvement in sales volume and transaction volumes with significant uplift after june 16th. most businesses were allowed to reopen at that time, including entertainment venues, with some restrictions such as required masks and limitations on the maximum capacity. our merchant acquiring revenue increased from our trough in april to more than a 20% increase year-over-year in june. likely due to pent up consumer demand and the benefits from federal programs such as cares and other funding from the government of puerto rico.
we continue to focus on serving our clients' needs on the innovation and on executing new opportunities. for example, in the second quarter, we worked with the department of labor to distribute unemployment benefits that were awarded as part of the cares act. additionally, we engage in a new contract with the department of education, in which we recently provided new computers in support to public education teachers. our innovation related to the ath network continues to benefit us, as we saw a significant uptick in our digital payment channels. for example, our ath mobile p2p transactions in june were up over 50% compared to last year and our ath movil business revenue increased more than 400% over last year. we are encouraged to see consumers embracing these digital solutions as this trend has the potential to continue to drive additional growth of the payment market in puerto rico.
lastly, we are excited about our recently launched contactless functionality through qr codes with over 400 businesses now using this feature. this solution allows the consumer to use their ath movil app for a contactless payment transaction at the point of sale.
on slide 6, you can see an example of the transaction. the user takes a picture with their phone of the qr code and that initiates a payment. the feedback has been highly positive from both the businesses in the pilot, as well as the consumers. most of the fastfood restaurants on the island have implemented this payment option and we will continue to expand these convenient solution to more of our merchants over the coming months.
on slide 7, i'll review our latin american business. regarding the environment, we are seeing different responses to the covid-19 pandemic in varying levels of restrictions and reopening. for example in santiago, chile there was an initial limited reopening and then as cases of covid-19 began to rise, again lockdowns and restrictive measures were reestablish. costa rica and panama have also returned to restrictions due to a rise in new cases.
mexico is allowing construction and tourism to reopen even though cases have continue to rise. in brazil cases continue to rise and the response measures vary between states. despite the ongoing impact of covid-19 in the geographies we serve, we remain focused on executing our latam growth initiatives. as it relates to santander chile and citibanamex, we continue to make progress with each client throughout the quarter and are targeting to launch both programs before the end of 2020. while our results for the quarter were impacted by the effects of the pandemic, both in puerto rico and latin america, we believe our unwavering investment in our employees, customers and communities during this time of crisis strengthens our relationship with each of our stakeholders over the long run.
with that i will now turn the call over to joaquin.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
thank you mac, and good afternoon everybody. turning to slide 9, you will see the consolidated second quarter results for evertec. total revenue for the second quarter was $117.9 million, down 4% compared to $122.5 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting the impact of covid-19. our revenue improved every month throughout the quarter, as businesses reopened in puerto rico and we benefited from growth in our digital payment solutions, as well as from new services delivered. we also had a headwind from one-time revenue of $2.5 million in the prior year. total revenue for the six months was $239.9 million and down 1% year-over-year. adjusted ebitda for the quarter was $50.2 million, a decrease of 13% from $57.8 million in the prior year. adjusted ebitda margin was 42.6% and this represents a 460 basis point decrease compared to the prior year. the decrease in margin primarily reflects the decline in transactional revenue. the increased mix of business to lower-margin revenue and increased costs in part driven by covid-19.
the adjustments in the quarter for adjusted ebitda included our normal adjustment for non-cash equity and share-based compensation and also included a $2.8 million charge related to transactional fees. year-to-date adjusted ebitda was $106.5 million, a decrease of 8% from $115.4 million in the prior year. adjusted net income for the quarter was $27.8 million, a decrease of 25% as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting the lower adjusted ebitda, as well as increased operating depreciation and amortization, partially offset by lower cash interest expense.
lower cash interest was partially due to a 25 basis point improvement in our interest rate, as a result of our debt multiple dropping below the two-time threshold last quarter. our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.2%, reflecting the impact of covid-19 on the mix of business as well as a discrete tax item and other taxable items in foreign jurisdictions.
excluding the unusual items in the quarter, we would expect to continue to see our tax rate for the back half of the year and higher than last year, to a range of 17% to 19%, assuming some continuation of revenue mix shifts related to covid-19. adjusted eps was $0.38 for the quarter and decreased 25% compared to the prior year. year-to-date adjusted net income was $61.3 million, down 17% and adjusted earnings per common share was $0.84, a decrease of 17% from $1.01 in the prior year.
moving on to slide 10, i'll now cover our segment results, starting with merchant acquiring. in the second quarter, merchant acquiring net revenue decreased 8% year-over-year to approximately $24.8 million, driven by the impact of lower sales volumes and non-transactional revenue as a result of covid. the revenue improved each month from a low of negative 33% in april to growth of over 20% in june, driven primarily by the continued opening of the economy and the pent-up consumer demand, as well as extra funding from both local and federal programs, as a result of covid.
the merchant mix during the quarter shifted from an unusually high share of supermarket and pharmacies to a more normal mix with most businesses being opened by the end of june, although with some limitations related to social distancing measures. we also benefited from a higher average ticket and higher spread in the quarter. most recently on july 16th, the governor returned to some more restrictive measures, which resulted in a decline from the highs we experienced in june to a more modest increase as compared to last year, over the past two weeks.
given the uncertainty around covid and the potential impacts to consumer spending behavior, it remains difficult to forecast the impact for our future results. adjusted ebitda for the segment was $13.4 million, up 9%. adjusted ebitda margin was 54%, up approximately 830 basis points as compared to last year, reflecting the impact of lower operating expenses resulting from the lower transaction volume and the higher average ticket. we would likely see these elevated margins decline as average ticket begins to revise.
for the six months period, merchant acquiring revenue decreased 5% to $49.9 million, primarily due to the same reasons i referenced for the quarter. adjusted ebitda year-to-date for the segment was $24.7 million, up 2% and adjusted ebitda margin was 49.4%, a 360 basis point increase as compared to last year.
on slide 11, you will see the results for the payment services, puerto rico and the caribbean segment. revenue for the segments in the second quarter was $27.5 million, down approximately 10% as compared to to last year, primarily due to lower transaction volume, mainly for the same covid-19 reasons, that impacted our merchant segment. transaction volumes improved throughout the quarter ending at negative 6% for the month of june from a low of negative 43% in april. we experienced a similar decline and improvement for the atm transaction volumes, although these have not come back as strong. these were partially offset by ath movil and ath movil business transaction growth, as well as new transactional volumes and incremental revenue recognized from new services, such as the healthcare benefit card we mentioned earlier this year.
adjusted ebitda for the segment was $13.3 million, decreasing 35% as compared to last year. adjusted ebitda margin was 48.3%, down over 18.3 percentage points as compared to last year, primarily due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses related to ebt post implementation costs, as well as increased operating expenses related to covid. a reminder, this segment has mostly fixed costs related to technology infrastructure. year-to-date revenue for the segment was $57.3 million, down approximately 8% as compared to last year. year-to-date adjusted ebitda was $29.4 million, down approximately 29% and adjusted ebitda margin was 51.2%, down approximately 15.4 percentage points as compared to last year for the same reasons previously mentioned.
on slide 12, you will see the results for our payment services, latam segment. revenue for this segment in the second quarter was $19.8 million, down approximately 6% as compared to last year. this decline was driven in part by covid-19 impact from transactional revenue, specific customer initiatives, as well as the negative effect of anticipated attrition of approximately $1 million. fx impacted us negatively by approximately $1.2 million, as the chilean peso, the brazilian real and the colombian peso, all declined between 20% and 40% when compared to the prior year. these negative impacts were partially offset by the acquisition of placetopay as well as progress on projects throughout the quarter.
adjusted ebitda for the segment was $6.1 million and adjusted ebitda margin was 30.7%, down approximately 610 basis points as compared to last year, driven by lower revenue described previously. for the full year, we continue to anticipate client attrition in 2020 will be between $3 million to $4 million. and based on current trends in foreign currency, we will likely continue to see a negative impact on a year-over-year basis. year-to-date revenue for the segment was $41.4 million, down approximately 1% as compared to last year. year-to-date adjusted ebitda for the segment was $14.3 million and adjusted ebitda margin was 34.6%.
on slide 13, you will find the results for the business solutions segment. business solutions revenue for the second quarter was up approximately 1% to $55.5 million. revenue increase in the quarter was primarily due to new services for popular as well as the government of puerto rico, partially offset by one-time project revenue and hardware, software sales that benefited last year by approximately $2.5 million.
for the quarter, adjusted ebitda was $24 million and adjusted ebitda margin was 43.3%, down approximately 70 basis points as compared to last year. the adjusted ebitda margin decrease was primarily driven by higher operating expenses related to covid-19. year-to-date, business solutions revenue was $111.4 million, up 5% and adjusted ebitda for the segment was $51.5 million with a 46.2% margin.
moving on to slide 14, you will see a summary of corporate and other. our second quarter adjusted ebitda was a negative $6.6 million, a decrease of 4% compared to prior year, as we control expenses such as travel and professional fees as well as lower incentive compensation accrual. our adjusted ebitda as a percentage of total revenue at 5.6% was approximately flat with the prior year. year-to-date, our corporate and other was $13.3 million or 5.6% as a percentage of total revenue and favorable approximately 20 basis points when compared to last year.
moving on to our year-to-date cash flow overview on slide 15. our beginning cash balance was approximately $131 million including restricted cash of approximately $20 million. net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $87 million, an $11 million increase as compared to prior year and this includes the impact of an improvement in our collections of accounts receivable and to a lesser extent benefit from tax payment deferrals and waivers in some countries related to covid-19 that we were able to take advantage of.
capital expenditures year-to-date were approximately $18 million. we continue to anticipate approximately $45 million for the full year and some acceleration of capex in the third quarter. we paid approximately $24 million in long-term debt payments. $3 million in withholding taxes on share based compensation and $2 million of other debt pay downs. well as of quarter end, we continue to have $15 million drawn on our revolver, resulting in a total net debt decrease of approximately $30 million.
subsequent to the end of the quarter, given the increased confidence in our cash and liquidity position, we repaid the full revolver balance. year-to-date we paid cash dividends of $7 million. although we did not repurchase any stock in the quarter, total repurchases of common stock year-to-date were approximately $7 million. we have approximately $23 million available for future use under the company's share repurchase program. we recently announced another $0.05 dividend to be paid on september 4, 2020 to shareholders of record as of august 3rd. our ending cash balance as of june 30th, was $169 million and this included approximately $22 million of restricted cash.
moving to slide 16, you will find a summary of our debt as of june 30, 2020. our quarter-ending net debt position was approximately $376 million comprised of approximately $147 million of unrestricted cash and approximately $523 million of total short-term borrowings and long-term debt. our weighted average interest rate was 4.3%. our net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted ebitda was 2.1 times, an increase from last quarter, primarily as a result of our reduced trailing 12-month adjusted ebitda impacted by covid-19. as of june 30th total liquidity was over $234 million, this balance excludes restricted cash and includes the available borrowing capacity under our revolver.
given the very unique nature of the covid-19 pandemic and continued uncertainty, w are not providing an annual guidance. we were encouraged that june was particularly strong, but it may not be representative of future results for the longer term impacts of this pandemic. we are pleased with the new department of education contract that mac mentioned, which will provide additional revenue during the third quarter and we continue to look for opportunities in which to help the government as well as our other clients manage through the situation.
in summary, it was positive to see sequential improvement in the second quarter. while we continue to monitor the covid-19 situation and resulting impact to our business. we are executing well against our longer term initiatives such as innovation in puerto rico, new services with the government and our progress on key projects in latin america, all of which should benefit us over the longer term.
we will now open the call for questions. operator, please go ahead and open the line.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from john davis with raymond james. please go ahead.
john davis -- raymond james financial -- analyst
hey. good afternoon, guys. appreciate the commentary on merchant in june and then kind of where we are in july. but any commentary on some of the other segments and kind of how they performed july to-date, like last quarter you gave kind of an update on all the segments for april. so just maybe some -- at least some color or commentary for july would be helpful?
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
sure, john, this is joaquin. in terms of payments the correlation obviously to what we mentioned in merchant acquiring will be there. so we have seen transactions come back strongly compared to obviously april and may. as i mentioned in the prepaid remarks there was kind of a rollback of some of the more restrictive measures, still a lot more flexible than what we originally had here in the month of april and that has slowed down a bit, what we saw in the month of june. so transactions continue to improve and we are encouraged by that movement in the month of july. everybody has slowed down a little bit just compared to what we saw in the month of june.
when we look at latam very similar as well, although as we mentioned last time in latam just given the diversity of products and the fact that not all of our revenues are transactionally driven, the volatility that we have in that segment is not the same. but what we have seen transactions a come back from our trough in the month of april, may. and in the case of business solutions, as you can see, i mean, we still reflected some slight growth for the quarter, we continue to have opportunities with the government. we mentioned the department of education contract that we were just awarded and that should be helpful to q3. but overall, that segment continues to be steady.
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. so, john, what you'll see is in puerto rico like much of the country in the world, there has been a slight pullback in sort of restrictions, but business is still operating on the island. and then, as joaquin said we won some new business with the government. so we found ways to continue to help support them through the pandemic and finding new business opportunities.
john davis -- raymond james financial -- analyst
okay, super helpful. and then, mac, appreciate the commentary on ath revenue up 400%. any the other stats, you can give to size that for us? how many for that today user base, increase in transactions per user, any other kind of stats that you give to help us with ath global and kind of the progress we're seeing there?
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
yes, so let me break it down in a couple of different components as it relates to my opening comments. i mean, again, like the rest of world, w're seeing a big shift to digital transactions and we are doubling down on our investments in that area.
so on ath movil, the p2p app, we saw a 50% increase in transactions. but more interestingly -- interesting on ath movil business, where a small business like a food truck can accept these digital payments from debit accounts, we saw a 400% increase in june.
additionally, we talked about that and we did a press release last week, we now are rolling out qr codes. so you now -- as most people know ath is the number 1 payment brand on the island and with ath movil now you can actually walk into a mcdonald's or burger king, many of the fast food restaurants -- actually, most of them take a photograph of the qr code and now pay at the cash register without a card being present.
so we're seeing a big shift to digital. some of it is defensive like the fast food restaurants or existing customers, but maybe will display some cash with that and some of it is brand new categories of spend like ath movil business where we're seeing new small business enterprises that used to accept cash that now no longer want to except that -- want to accept cash.
john davis -- raymond james financial -- analyst
okay, thanks. and then on the capital allocation front, do you guys feel comfortable yet, obviously, in the second quarter you buying stock back given kind of what's going on. do you feel comfortable yet buying stock back or maybe potentially doing a deal later this year? i'm just kind of how are you are thinking obviously, the balance sheet's in great shape, but just trying to figure out kind of when and if you guys will be comfortable in doing something with capital in the near and medium-term?
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. what i would say is, again -- we everyone i think moved into the pandemic, with a significant amount of caution as joaquin stated, we didn't pull down on our revolver and we've now paid all that back. so as we move back to normal levels, we will sort of rebalance our capital allocation, sort of work. but again, we still want to be cautious, given that the pandemic is still spreading through most of the economies where we do business.
john davis -- raymond james financial -- analyst
okay. and then last quick modeling one for joaquin. the higher tax rate, is that something you see just kind of in the back half of this year, is that something we could expect kind of going forward? and maybe just a little more color on what's driving that tax rate higher? i know you said revenue mix shift, but anything else there to help us as we model all the out years? thanks, guys.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
sure, the expectation of this higher tax rate is really the second half of 2020, taking into consideration that we get to a normalized level of kind of business mix by next year. so, we don't expect this to be kind of the run rate into future years, john, but it is something that we need to continue to monitor. and to the extent that the pandemic continues to have an impact on the mix, then we'll come back and kind of realign that rate. but the expectation is that as we come back to what we had pre-pandemic, that the rate comes back to a normalized 13%, thereabout of run rate into the future.
john davis -- raymond james financial -- analyst
okay, great. thanks, guys.
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, john.
operator
the next question comes from bob napoli with william blair. please go ahead.
robert napoli -- william blair & company, llc -- analyst
good afternoon.
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
hey, bob.
robert napoli -- william blair & company, llc -- analyst
good to talk to you, i guess, just if you look at the trends, and i know it's very hard when an economy is opening and closing to forecast your business, but given that april was by far the worst month and june was by far the best, if the trend stayed like they are now, i mean, i would guess that revenue should be up in the third quarter versus the second quarter? is that a fair assumption?
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
i mean bob, what i would say, is as we all know these are unprecedented times, but the one thing that i think everyone has learned is how to accommodate the pandemic and doing business and going about business and going out and getting essentials and that type of thing. so, our hope would be that we've learned to adapt and that we won't see the closures to the significant level than we saw in the past, that we saw in april. but again unprecedented times, we can't predict the future at this point, but we do believe that the world is learning to adapt with the pandemic. and so that should be helpful. i don't know.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
no, the only thing i would add, bob is, yes june was the best month, but there are certain factors in there that we are looking at that we know aren't necessarily sustainable at those levels, right. we know that there is a lot of pent-up demand. one of people just staying in their homes for over a prolonged period of time, not doing much of buying and then having this kind of freedom to go out, drove some of that volume.
and then we also have these federal programs as well as the local programs putting additional money to people's pockets, but we're seeing a really high average ticket, which is something that -- are similar to what we saw after the hurricane, where all of that funding coming into the island and into the economy, drove up a real high average ticket and the expectation would be that that will normalize over time. and i think one of those programs are try to kind of expire and mac said people kind of get used to just going back to normal and doing their regular purchases as they did in the past.
so, as we said definitely a great month and july looked strong as well, but there are certain things in there that we know aren't necessarily sustainable over a longer period of time.
robert napoli -- william blair & company, llc -- analyst
great. and, i guess, one thing that may be insustainable was the ramp up in digital payments. you happen to have a lot of cash in the markets you serve. so maybe does this -- do you think this accelerates your potential growth rate post pandemic given the shift?
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
we do. what we found is whether people are going to their phone to check the deposits from their unemployment deposits, whether they're going to use ath movil, because they want to avoid a cash transaction and now they can go buy food by scanning a qr code. we do think that it's going to change people's behavior permanently, to where they are able to use ath movil and the need for ath movil is greater. so i think it's going to be great for that business and also place to be. we bought the gateway out of colombia.
robert napoli -- william blair & company, llc -- analyst
yeah.
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
and we are localizing that as well. but we do believe the shift to digital is because it's forced people to change their behavior and once they change it, we think it will be difficult to go back.
robert napoli -- william blair & company, llc -- analyst
agreed. last question and i'll turn it over, citibanamex and santander chile, both is expected to launch before the end of 2020, do you have any thoughts on what the size of those businesses could be over the next couple of years? is some doubts on the revenue contribution...
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
my hope is that if we launch them by the end of this year that will be in next year's guidance.
robert napoli -- william blair & company, llc -- analyst
okay. and it would be in next year's guidance it would have to be at least a couple of percent of revenue or...
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
well, what we have said is that santander chile will be meaningful to that and the combination of the two in particular will be meaning to -- meaningful to the latam segment. and over time, bob, as you and i've discussed, our plan is to have multiple clients in countries like chile...
robert napoli -- william blair & company, llc -- analyst
yeah.
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
with multiple products. so we'll have cross-sell opportunity. so again, we are on track very focused on both of those projects. we still plan on launching those by the end of 2020 and it will be material to that segment in 2020 and beyond. and not just the revenue in those deals themselves, but the reputation that it builds for us throughout the region to land new business.
robert napoli -- william blair & company, llc -- analyst
okay. and then your balance sheet looks pretty strong right now. are there opportunities cropping up that you're comfortable taking, investing in m&a wise or other at this time?
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
so, i mean, m&a has been an important part of the company, particularly as we grow outside of puerto rico, to acquire the right products and to expand the role of that. i would tell you it is, there is still a little bit of dislocation and what valuations and it is a bit more complicated to due diligence virtually, but it is still something we're very focused on and if we find the right thing, we will look at it very, very closely.
robert napoli -- william blair & company, llc -- analyst
thank you. appreciate it.
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, bob.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from james faucette with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
priscilla russo -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, this is priscilla on for james. just wanted to follow up on the santander chile timeline that you set out. i think you mentioned you want to launch by end of the year. just wanted to hear whether or not everything is going as you expected? how is product flash collaboration going on there, given the restrictions that we've seen in different latin american markets?
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
sure. so, as we've said previously, as we process all of the major of brands already, process the transaction and we are on schedule. the thing that has slowed us down are just the closures of business, the move of santander chile to a virtual environment. so, just the disruption of the pandemic generally. but we're very confident that given our current plans, we will launch this before the end of the year.
priscilla russo -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. and then on ath movil, i believe you mentioned the strength in the business. could you guess or give us some sense as to what portion of that strength is perhaps being driven by stimulus / unemployment funds that are going through versus a more recurring permanent shift toward digital?
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
so there has been an ongoing shift to digital even before the pandemic. we saw significant increases in ath movil being used for p2p transactions. when we rolled out the donation feature, when we rolled out the business feature for small businesses, what we see now is a significant acceleration in that adoption. and some of it is potentially unemployment funds that people now have in their pocket or social programs, but it's just become a general trend for all sources of income, regardless of the source of income that the preferred way to spend now is there is some type of digital application.
priscilla russo -- morgan stanley -- analyst
perfect, that's good to hear. and just one last one, you mentioned some of the new work that you're doing for the government in puerto rico. can you give us some color as to what percentage of that or at least what portion of it is more transitory related to this allocation in different stimulus funds versus some potentially more permanent relationship from here?
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
so, we have a large relationship with the government of puerto rico across multiple agencies. the one that we announced on this call with the department of education is to actually deploy and help maintain pcs in the public school system. so there will be immediate impact to 2020 for the initial transaction and then, there'll be an ongoing benefit for a few years on the maintenance piece as well. so that is -- that will have impact across multiple years. but as we saw after the hurricane when we were able to do more business with local -- commercial clients as well as the government, we're finding now with the pandemic, we are becoming the partner of choice on the island, when they look for technical partners, given our commitment to the island and the size and scale and stability that we can provide.
priscilla russo -- morgan stanley -- analyst
perfect, thank you very much.
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
thank you.

operator
good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the evertec third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. today's conference call is being recorded. at this time, i would like to turn the call over to kay sharpton, vice president of investor relations. please go ahead.
kay sharpton -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, and good afternoon. with me today are mac schuessler, our president and chief executive officer; and joaquin castrillo, our chief financial officer. before we begin, i'd like to remind everyone that this call may contain forward-looking statements and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and the company's most recent periodic sec report.
during today's call, management will provide certain information that will constitute non-gaap financial measures under sec rules, such as adjusted ebitda, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share. reconciliations to gaap measures and certain additional information are also included in today's earnings release and related supplemental slides, which are available in the investor relations section of our company's website, at www.evertecinc.com. i'll now hand the call over to mac.
morgan m. schuessler -- evertec, inc
thanks, kay, and good afternoon, everyone. we achieved strong results with the highest quarterly performance in our company's history, driven by consumer demand as the economy reopens as well as the impact from new business. additionally, we have continued to execute on our latin america initiatives, which will position us for growth over the longer term. beginning on slide four. total revenue was $137 million for the third quarter, an increase of 15% compared to 2019. adjusted ebitda was $70 million, an increase of 26% as compared to the prior year, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.65, an increase of 38%.
we generated significant operating cash flow year-to-date of $121 million and we returned approximately $18 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. additionally, our liquidity as of september 30, was $246 million. moving on to our update on slide five for puerto rico. we continue to see significant transaction revenue as a result of the federal and puerto rico government stimulus programs earlier in the quarter, timing of tax payments and the further reopening of businesses. merchant revenue surged in july to over 30% growth, tapering off in the subsequent months for a total quarterly revenue growth of 16%. the puerto rico government further reduced covid restrictions beginning in early september.
however, consumer demand has been tempered by the expiration of the stimulus support. that said, we are encouraged by the recently announced release of $13 billion in federal funds to rebuild the electric infrastructure on the island, which will be a longer-term benefit to the economy. additionally, we would expect to see a more immediate impact from the additional $300 per week of unemployment benefit, as outlined by the president's executive order, which was approved by fema for puerto rico only a few weeks ago, and began to be distributed last week. our recent contract with department of education, in which we recently provided new computers and support to the public education system, produced a onetime revenue increase of approximately $4.4 million in the quarter. we also continue to benefit from our digital channels related to the ath network.
our ath movil and ath movil business continue to deliver superior growth, and we are encouraged by the adoption rate of both consumers and businesses. we have also expanded the contactless functionality through qr codes from 400 merchants in july to over 1,500 businesses today. on slide six, i'll review our latin american business. regarding the environment, we continue to see different responses to the covid-19 pandemic and varying levels of restrictions and reopenings. chile and colombia have stabilized their covid-19 trends and recently lifted certain restrictions. mexico and brazil are allowing many merchants to reopen, with brazil recently achieving more than a month of stability. however, we remain cautious about the outlook throughout the region, given the continuing uncertainty surrounding the virus. despite the pandemic, we remain focused on executing on our lat am growth initiatives.
we continue to leverage our investment in place to pay by localizing the gateway in costa rica and panama. this platform has enabled our partner banks to transition existing merchants to the new gateway as well as add new e-commerce merchants. our paystudio acquiring platform is now in production with two new customers: alelo in brazil and anda in uruguay. as we mentioned on our q4 2019 call, alelo is one of the largest financial service companies in brazil, specializing in benefits, incentives and corporate expense management. anda is the largest nonprofit in uruguay, which serves as a benefits provider for a wide range of services such as medical, legal, travel and other services through employee payroll deductions.
both clients were term license agreements. we continue to expect to be in production on our acquiring processing services with santander in chile and our collection platform with citibanamex by the end of the year. we anticipate all of these wins to contribute to growth in 2021 for our latin america payments segment and over the longer term. as always, we have continued to invest in our employees and communities. recently, we completed an employee engagement survey. and despite the challenges of working through the covid pandemic, we saw a 13% increase in participation in the engagement survey to 85% as well as significant improvements in many areas of employee satisfaction.
while we were delighted with the engagement and the feedback, we still have areas of opportunity that we will focus on this year and next. in puerto rico and across latin america, we continued our commitment to the scholarship program, which is in its sixth year, and we awarded over 160 scholarships, an increase of almost 20% from the previous year. this year, we were particularly focused on gender equality and through specific initiatives, we were able to achieve a balance of 50% female and 50% male stem scholarship recipients in puerto rico. further, over the past year, we have focused on our environment, social and governance efforts, and we have seen increases in the scores provided by various rating agencies. we are proud of our progress on these important areas of corporate citizenship.
with that, i will now turn the call over to joaquin.
joaquin a. castrillo -- chief financial officer
thank you, mac, and good afternoon, everyone. turning to slide nine, you will see the consolidated third quarter results for evertec. total revenue for the third quarter was $136.5 million, up 15% compared to $118.8 million in the prior year, reflecting the strong bounce back in consumer demand, positively impacting all our transactional revenue.
as mac mentioned, we also benefited from onetime revenue of $4.4 million with our new department of education contract. total revenue for the nine months was $376.4 million, an increase of 4% year-over-year. adjusted ebitda for the quarter was $70 million, an increase of 26% from $55.5 million in the prior year. adjusted ebitda margin was 51.3%, and this represents a 460 basis point increase compared to the prior year. the increase in margin primarily reflects the higher transactional revenue and additional services provided to the government.
additionally, we benefited from nonoperating income of approximately $2 million due to foreign currency gains related to balance sheet remeasurement. year-to-date, adjusted ebitda was $176.5 million, an increase of 3% from $170.9 million in the prior year. adjusted net income for the quarter was $47.2 million, an increase of 37% as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting the higher adjusted ebitda and lower cash interest. this was partially offset by increased operating depreciation and amortization, driven by capital expenditures in the prior year as well as key projects that went into production this year and late last year. our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 13.6%, reflecting the mix of business in q3. we now expect our tax rate in q4 to range from 13% to 14% depending on the mix of business.
adjusted eps was $0.65 for the quarter and increased 38% compared to the prior year. year-to-date, adjusted net income was $108.5 million and approximately flat with last year. and adjusted earnings per common share was $1.49, an increase of 1% from $1.48 in the prior year. moving on to slide 10. i'll now cover our segment results, starting with merchant acquiring. in the third quarter, merchant acquiring net revenue increased 16% year-over-year to approximately $30.6 million, driven by the impact of increased sales volume. the quarter began with over 30% year-over-year revenue growth in july and moderated to a high single-digits average for the remainder of the quarter. the quarter results were driven by the reopening of business, pent-up consumer demand as well as extra funding from federal programs as a result of covid-19.
the merchant mix during the quarter shifted to a more normal distribution, and we continued to benefit from a high average ticket, although transactions were down approximately 8% for the quarter. spread was up primarily due to the higher average ticket and benefit from card mix, shifting from credit to debit as well as from international cards to local cards. adjusted ebitda for this segment was $15.9 million, up 42%. adjusted ebitda margin was 51.8%, up approximately 940 basis points as compared to the last year, reflecting the impact of the higher revenue and lower operating expenses primarily due to lower transactions.
we'll likely see these elevated margins decline as average ticket normalizes in the fourth quarter. for the nine-month period, merchant acquiring revenue increased 2% to $80.5 million. adjusted ebitda year-to-date for this segment was $40.6 million, up 14%, and adjusted ebitda margin was 50.4%, a 560 basis point increase as compared to the last year. on slide 11, you will see the results for the payment services, puerto rico and the caribbean segment. revenue for this segment in the third quarter was $33.3 million, up approximately 9% as compared to last year, primarily due to the higher ath movil and ath movil business transactions and other new services. we saw an over 200% increase in ath movil revenues, which contributed an incremental $2.3 million in the quarter. this benefit was partially offset by a decline in atm transaction volumes. adjusted ebitda for this segment was $18.5 million, up 1% as compared to last year.
adjusted ebitda margin was 55.5%, down 490 basis points as compared to last year, primarily due to higher operating expenses driven by higher cloud expenses, pos repair and maintenance and other project-related expenses. year-to-date revenue for this segment was $90.6 million, down approximately 2% as compared to last year. year-to-date adjusted ebitda was $47.8 million, down approximately 20%. and adjusted ebitda margin was 52.8%, down approximately 11.8 percentage points as compared to last year. on slide 12, you will see the results for our payment services lat am segment. revenue for this segment in the third quarter was $21.2 million, up approximately 3% as compared to last year.
the increase was driven by the acquisition of placetopay as well as revenue related to the implementation of alelo, partially offset by covid-19 impact on transactional revenue, the negative effect of anticipated attrition of approximately $1 million as well as negative foreign currency impact of approximately $700,000. adjusted ebitda for this segment was $9.5 million and adjusted ebitda margin was 44.9%, up approximately 810 basis points as compared to last year, driven by higher revenue and the benefit of balance sheet remeasurement in nonfunctional currencies of approximately $2 million. excluding the remeasurement, adjusted ebitda margin would have been approximately 34% and generally consistent with our expectations. year-to-date, revenue for this segment was $62.7 million, approximately flat as compared to last year.
year-to-date adjusted ebitda for this segment was $23.9 million, and adjusted ebitda margin was 38.1%. on slide 13, you will find the results for the business solutions segment. business solutions revenue for the third quarter was up approximately 19% to $63 million. the revenue increase in the quarter was primarily due to the department of education contract of $4.4 million, new services for popular and increases related to government contracts, coupled with delays in last year's government renewals. for the quarter, adjusted ebitda was $33 million, and adjusted ebitda margin was 52.4%, up approximately 500 basis points as compared to last year. the adjusted ebitda margin increase was primarily driven by higher revenue, particularly the department of education onetime revenue, which was recorded net of expenses. if we normalize for the onetime revenue, the adjusted ebitda margin would be in our normal percentage range of the mid-40s.
year-to-date, business solutions revenue was $174.5 million, up 9% and adjusted ebitda for this segment was $84.5 million with a 48.4% margin. moving on to slide 14. you will see a summary of corporate and other. our third quarter adjusted ebitda was a negative $6.9 million, an increase of 1% compared to prior year. our adjusted ebitda as a percentage of total revenue at 5% was favorable by approximately 70 basis points as compared to prior year, primarily due to higher revenues in the quarter. year-to-date, our corporate and other adjusted ebitda was $20.2 million or 5.4% as a percentage of total revenue and favorable approximately 30 basis points as compared to last year. moving on to our year-to-date cash flow overview on slide 15.
our beginning cash balance was approximately $131 million, including restricted cash of approximately $20 million. net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $121 million, a $15 million decrease compared to prior year, which includes an increase in accounts receivables as a result of the new computers provided under the department of education contract. most of these receivables were paid by the government subsequent to the end of the quarter. capital expenditures year-to-date were approximately $37 million. we continue to anticipate approximately $45 million of capex for the full year. we paid approximately $28 million in long-term debt payments, $3 million withholding taxes on share-based compensation and $2 million of other debt pay downs, which resulted in a total net debt decrease of approximately $33 million.
year-to-date, we paid cash dividends of $11 million. although we did not repurchase any stock in the quarter, total repurchases of common stock year-to-date were approximately $7 million. we have approximately $23 million available for future use under the company's share repurchase program. we recently announced another $0.05 dividend to be paid on december 4, 2020, to shareholders of record as of november 2, 2020. our ending cash balance as of september 30, was $162 million, and it includes approximately $18 million of restricted cash. moving to slide 16. you will find a summary of our debt as of september 30, 2020. our quarter ending net debt position was approximately $361 million, comprised of approximately $144 million of unrestricted cash and approximately $505 million of total short-term borrowings and long-term debt.
our weighted average interest rate was 4.5%. our net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted ebitda was 1.9 times. this multiple below the 2 times threshold will provide a 25 basis point improvement in our interest rate on approximately 40% of our debt in the next quarter. as of september 30, total liquidity was approximately $246 million. this balance excludes restricted cash and includes the available borrowing capacity under our revolver, which remains fully available. now moving on to our thoughts on the remainder of this year as well as some initial comments for 2021. although we are not providing guidance, given the continued uncertainty of covid-19, we believe we could see low to mid-single-digit revenue growth in q4 2020 if there are no significant changes in the impact of the pandemic.
we expect to see sales volume growth slowing in puerto rico as well as average ticket normalizing. we would anticipate modest business solutions revenue growth, and lat am should be delivering mid single-digit revenue growth driven by the new contracts, partially offset by the continued impact of covid-19 and attrition. margins should move to more normal levels between 46% and 47% as the average ticket comes down. and unlike q3, we do not anticipate any significant onetime revenue benefits in the quarter. now turning to 2021, i would like to comment on several considerations. first, we're pleased with our new agreement in lat am, which are anticipated to contribute to high-single to low-teens growth in lat am, assuming some normalization of the covid-19 impact and recovering currencies that have been a headwind in 2020. we are pleased with the placetopay gateway and anticipate further expansion as we cross-sell this product to other clients in broader geographies.
while we have some delays in client attrition in 2020, which will now be realized in 2021, we plan to stop updating these given that 2021 attrition will likely be at similar levels to 2020. second, in puerto rico, we will continue to monitor the flow of federal funds and the potential positive impact to the economy from rebuilding and investment, but the timing still remains unclear as is the impact of covid-19. we believe our focus on innovations and digital solutions will continue to benefit us in 2021. lastly, the cpi index for september was announced on october 13 and was 1.4%, which will benefit our popular revenues as per the msa agreement, largely affecting the business solutions segment. in summary, it is gratifying to see the results in q3, and we are executing well against our longer term initiatives. we look forward to updating you with our full 2021 outlook next quarter. we will now open the call for questions.

[operator instructions] and the first question comes from bob napoli with william blair.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
nice job on the quarter. the -- what do you expect from chile and citi group in 2021?
morgan m. schuessler -- evertec, inc
yes. so bob, we're not giving -- this is mac, and good to talk to you. so we are still very focused on getting those implemented this year. and in fact, in chile, we already have some merchants that we are processing transactions for. so we feel like that those will contribute to 2021. and we have been able to continue to get those projects done on time by the end of the year, but we're not giving guidance about what this will contribute until we give guidance at the next call.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
okay. very good. and that it's included, i guess, in the lat am, high single to low teens revenue growth?
joaquin a. castrillo -- chief financial officer
correct, bob. it is included in there.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
okay. and then the -- growth in the merchant acquiring segment, the higher ticket, what are you looking for in the fourth quarter for the merchant segment as far as growth in the merchant acquiring segment? and just banco popular had some pretty strong growth in spend, i think, 27% for the quarter, debit and credit card spend. does that not match up with evertec's business?
joaquin a. castrillo -- chief financial officer
i mean the way that -- one, i mean, the numbers for popular are due to certain transactions that we don't necessarily see, right? so it's more necessarily correlate. a perfectly, i mean, we saw -- and as we said on the call, very strong sales volume across the board and across the quarter. obviously, there is a lot of stimulus that was impacting q3. as we go into q4, i think we're trying to obviously continue to get information. stimulus spending have come down from the levels that people were receiving.
and we still have uncertainty as to whether there's going to be another package coming in q4. but to the extent that, that does not happen and we go back to a more normalized economy, let's say, without the stimulus, we are expecting the average figure to start to come down and normalize, which is actually something we saw throughout the quarter as well. and that's a big driver of what we're seeing in that segment and the impact to margin as well. so we would expect the margin to also start to normalize for the merchant acquiring segment as we move into q4, considering everything.
morgan m. schuessler -- evertec, inc
but bob, two things are certain. one is the $300 stimulus for the unemployment, the puerto rican government has approved those. and they've already started putting those into the island and into the system. the second thing is the shift to digital, just like probably every other company are following, we've seen a huge shift. so we saw significant growth that we talked about on ath movil and ath movil business. and both b2b transactions and the business transactions were up, i think over 350% for the quarter.
but between the two of them, it's over 200% increase between p2p and b2b. and then as we talked about, too, the demand for the qr codes, the ability to go in to starbucks, to mcdonald's, to burger king and actually not have to pull out a card and hand it to someone else. we have increased the number of locations by 275% since our last call, and we're still seeing significant demand. so 5% of the merchants now, they are ath merchants now, accept that form of qr code and some of them -- they are higher activity merchants. and we're rolling out a significant number of merchants every week as we speak. so the digital shift will continue.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
yes, that was my next question. it seems like puerto rico was set up for a massive digital shift. and the ath, the $2.3 million, was that the revenue in the quarter from ath?
joaquin a. castrillo -- chief financial officer
no. so that was the contribution of both the b2b and the business to our growth in q3, so not the actual revenue generated by those products.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
so that the $2.3 million was the growth in dollars over the prior year or the prior quarter?
joaquin a. castrillo -- chief financial officer
over the prior quarter.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
okay. and can you tell me what...
joaquin a. castrillo -- chief financial officer
the growth over the third quarter.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
okay, in the prior quarter. and what is the total revenue from that in the quarter?
joaquin a. castrillo -- chief financial officer
from the prior year quarter, year-over-year...
operator
and the next question comes from john davis with raymond james.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
encouraging to hear the $13 billion being released. how is that supposed to layer in over the next, i assume, a couple of years? and also, any update on the $8 billion of hud funding that's still, i think, in limbo. and then last one here, the $300 a week, how long is that supposed to last in puerto rico for the unemployment?
joaquin a. castrillo -- chief financial officer
in terms of the $300 million that started last week, and there was actually a retroactive payment going back to the beginning of august. and the program is pretty much the same as in the u.s. and our understanding is that, that will go on for about another month.
morgan m. schuessler -- evertec, inc
and then you were asking about the $13 billion on the electrical grid, that's going to be over a series of time. but that's going to do two things. one is, you're going to have to have workers. i mean, there's going to be stimulus to the economy and the direct investment, rebuilding the electrical grid. and then you also have the trickle effect to the broader economy. and then hopefully, long term, one of the biggest costs of doing business here is the utilities and the electric, hopefully, and continue to make it a competitive -- more competitive place to do business.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. no, that's helpful. and then as i think about outside of puerto rico, i mean, i think chile is beginning to ramp here toward the end of this year into next year. what are some of the other markets that you potentially are targeting for growth outside of puerto rico? and has there been any further progress? or any, i guess, events of note in some of the other markets, whether it's bank consortiums breaking up? or we just focused on chile at this point, maybe just kind of an ex-puerto rico broader uptake would be helpful.
morgan m. schuessler -- evertec, inc
sure. so we're seeing a couple of trends. one, we are seeing, as we've talked about on several calls, we're seeing the monopoly either getting broken up or sold like in argentina and then transbank. and as we've talked about with bob, we do have santander chile on track to implement by the end of the year. we're already processing transactions for some merchants that have now opened.
so you are seeing sort of a shift where people are willing to move outside of the monopolies or duopolies. the second thing we're seeing is really regulators issuing new licenses to fintechs so they can provide payments and banking services, and those have -- are becoming some of our customers as well. so we talked about, i think, at the beginning of this year and last that we're very focused on localizing our platforms in chile, colombia, mexico and costa rica as we tucked in the placetopay acquisition. we've now placetopay, which is our e-commerce gateway, that we're going to continue to invest in going forward as in colombia and ecuador at the time of purchase.
now we've localized in central america and panama and costa rica for some of our existing clients because, frankly, the product that they had was not to the level that we really wanted to provide to them. and we've now given them a product where they're existing -- they're migrating their existing merchants to this new platform, and it's allowing them to sell new merchants as well because the placetopay platform is much improved. and we also are looking at plans to localize the placetopay platform in both puerto rico and chile as well. so -- those are sort of the key countries, and we now have -- the great thing is we've now got the product, i mean the risk products, the payments product across issuing and acquiring and then the gateway to -- we're making the investments to localize it based on where we're running business.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then last one for me. do we have -- do you have any sort of stats or more than just directionally what you think card penetration either was in puerto rico? or what the increase has been? i mean, can you see -- like on a same-store sales basis, you're seeing an x percent increase in transactions and volume, if you look at, for example, bpop is up 27%? just anything to help us kind of dimensionalize the shift to electronic payments that's currently happening in puerto rico. any stats at all would be super helpful.
joaquin a. castrillo -- chief financial officer
i mean a specific stat, john, is really there is a one source. we're taking into consideration many different data points that we have here to kind of give some direction. obviously, we're seeing every category in terms of consumption going up from a sales volume perspective. and we're seeing the banks here also report that they're seeing volumes across credit and debit increase, we're seeing the use of all digital channels increasing as well.
and these are all driven by the use of cards at the end of the day. and so we continue to see a very big opportunity to continue to make inroads into kind of the cash business here in puerto rico, which continues to be a big part of the economy. and as mac said, ath movil and ath movil business for us is kind of the best way for us to continue to get additional penetration.
morgan m. schuessler -- evertec, inc
yes. and john, the thing i would say, there's still -- this looks a little bit more like a more sophisticated latin american country -- if you look at penetration rates versus the states because you still have a large underground economy and you still have sort of an unofficial economy. so even across traditional categories like gas stations or supermarkets or restaurants, you might have a lower level of penetration than you would see in the u.s.
but the big opportunity is where we're breaking into new markets, with b2b, with ath movil business, where you're paying service contractors, food trucks, which is a significant opportunity as well. so that's where we're seeing a lot. and as i told bob earlier, i mean, if you look at p2p, for the quarter, it was up 70%, right? and if you look ath movil business, which -- that is primarily new electronic payment volume, that was up over 350% for the quarter. so there's still a lot of opportunties.
operator
and the next question comes from james friedman with susquehanna.
james friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
good results by you and your team. i just wanted to ask in your prepared remarks, you called out the $300 a week stimulus. i know you referenced that in a prior question. but if you could just give us some sense of how enduring you see that? and how long is this going to last? and then i'll just ask my second one upfront. joaquin, you said that in '21, the client attrition would be similar to that in 2020. can you just remind us, i don't mean to beat a dead horse because it sounds like you're not going to focus on that. but what was it in 2020?
morgan m. schuessler -- evertec, inc
yes. so on the $300, it's the -- i think you're right. you're seeing amount that was approved by the president by executive order and that the local government has to match a portion of that. and it's less than the previous unemployment funding that was coming out of the federal government. the duration of that currently is probably a couple of more weeks, but we do think that's going to be helpful. if this continues, though, i mean, the economy still remains open here, it's a smaller amount. and -- but for the next couple of weeks, it will have an impact.
joaquin a. castrillo -- chief financial officer
well, the other part of your question?
morgan m. schuessler -- evertec, inc
on attrition.
james friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
can you talk...
joaquin a. castrillo -- chief financial officer
on the attrition, this year, we said, we -- for this quarter, the impact is about $1 million. and we're going to see $3 million to $4 million this year. we have originally expected $4 million to $5 million, and that's why we made a reference to a slight delay in attrition, which, as we said in previous calls, has been coming down for a few years. we're expecting an additional $3 million to $4 million next year. and given that it's at the same level, and we're trying to move away from kind of keeping -- updating that on a quarterly basis.
operator
and the next question comes from james faucette with morgan stanley.
priscilla russo -- morgan stanley -- analyst
this is priscilla russo on for james. just two quick questions. on the latin american trends as these markets have been opening up, can you talk about what you've been seeing in terms of spend uplift or transaction growth and normalization there? and then on generally the health of the merchants within puerto rico, obviously, travel is a outsized portion of your gdp. and so even though you may not have direct exposure to travel, i just wanted to understand how businesses there are doing? are they buying more products from you? perhaps using the pivot -- pos devices? any color on that would be helpful.
joaquin a. castrillo -- chief financial officer
so yes, yes, in terms of just the overall portfolio and our exposure to tourism, as we've mentioned in the past, we don't have any significant direct exposure. most hotels or airlines that we have in puerto rico are usually processing transactions through a corporate processor. so we have limited direct exposure. obviously, tourism is a bigger part of the puerto rico economy, although it's really closer to 5% really of gdp. and it has an indirect impact through restaurants and retail sales. and even though it's down, again, as we said, we have seen sales volumes up in pretty much every category. and in terms of the general state of the portfolio of merchants, we have seen a slightly higher percentage of inactive merchants over the quarter.
many merchants that haven't started back to process or that are having maybe a little bit more difficult in getting off to business. but in general terms, that continues to also move toward normalization. so nothing really that we're overly concerned in terms of those getting back online. and in terms of latin america, look, i mean, we continue to focus on the four countries that we've mentioned in the past; chile, colombia, mexico and costa rica and in getting our processing platform up and running, making sure that we are putting ourselves in a position to continue to expand margin into the future. and as we said, with santander, it's kind of our first client onto this platform and showing the success that we can bring by having a processing platform in these countries.
operator
and the next question comes from george mihalos with cowen.
george mihalos -- cowen -- analyst
really just two clarification points for me. i want to make sure i'm thinking about some of these things correctly. so just on the acquiring side. i think you said july was up 30%. and then it had moderated to kind of high single digits in september. i'm just curious, have those high single-digit trends continued in october? have you seen any sort of moderation from there? and then just as it relates to the ebitda, i think you called that the $4.4 million onetime from the doe and then another $2 million. anything else that we would need to adjust to kind of come up with a normalized margin? i think i'm kind of backing into like a 48% margin, if i do the math.
joaquin a. castrillo -- chief financial officer
that's correct, george. those are the two main items really that we called out and that you should be taking into consideration kind of onetime impact to kind of that higher margin that we reported. in terms of -- and what was the first part of the question, george?
george mihalos -- cowen -- analyst
as it relates to the acquiring segment, i think you said in a kind of up high singles...
joaquin a. castrillo -- chief financial officer
yes. no, i mean, so in october, i would say that there has been some slight moderation in terms of sales volume. we continue to see a fairly strong sales volume. we have seen the average ticket, however, come down and transactions continue to be lower than the prior year. but as we said before, those usually go hand-in-hand. so as we have seen a slight improvement or recovery from the transactional side, we have seen that average ticket start to come down. so it's something that even though the high sales volume that we saw in july was there, on a sequential basis, we have seen that average ticket come down, and that is reflecting itself in october as well.
operator
and the next question comes from korey marcello with deutsche bank.
korey marcello -- deutsche bank. -- analyst
you mentioned 5% of the ath merchants have the qr code now, and that's kind of ramping quite quickly. i'm just curious if you could just give some high-level thoughts on kind of where you see that penetration going forward? and more importantly, do you guys see a lift on kind of qr code transactions per merchant versus other transactions? just trying to think about that a little bit deeper.
morgan m. schuessler -- evertec, inc
sure. so we launched this product during the previous quarter, so in q2, and we've seen the velocity of the adoption at the merchant level is pretty rapid. and what i would tell you is trying to understand how that changes, the volumes of with a merchant, we're now analyzing because we want to do two things. one is we'd like to convert more of the transactions to our like product transactions because of ease of use. and we'd also like to convert more of the transactions to ath versus other types of electronic payments because that's our debit network. so we're in the process of analyzing that.
and we are noticing, yes, we've increased by 275% in the number of locations and within each location, it appears that the volume or the tendency to use the qr code is increasing as well. our goal is to get by the end of 2020 as much of the volume, so we focus on the larger chains, the largest merchants and sort of hold their hands and get them up and running. and then we're in the process of finding an easier way for smaller merchants. we're already in process of testing, so that they can sort of implement the product on their own. but it's a significant focus for us because we think it reinforces our relationship with these merchants and then it will increase not only the electronic payments, but when it is an electronic payment, it will be an ath payment.
korey marcello -- deutsche bank. -- analyst
got it. that's very helpful. and then i'm just curious if you could talk a little bit more about just e-comm in general in puerto rico and some of the markets you serve, like what are you seeing there in terms of a trend to e-comm? and how is evertec positioned to take on the e-comm opportunity over the next couple of years?
morgan m. schuessler -- evertec, inc
yes. so i mean, again, as we talked about, whether it's ath, whether it's our gateway, it's the trend that we're seeing like all of the other payment providers. our focus has really been the placetopay product as our e-commerce gateway. we have seen significant volume growth in ecuador during the quarter.
and then like i told you now that we've localized it in costa rica and panama, we're seeing success with those banks because they're adding new merchants, not just going sort of static with the existing base when they had the previous product. because the previous product we had, again, is not a product that we felt like we could really grow the rate we'd like to across the region. in puerto rico, we'll also convert to that product. but it's a -- the placetopay product and acquisition has been incredibly successful, and that will be the future gateway for the company.
operator
and as there are no more questions, i would like to return the floor to mac schuessler for any closing comments.
morgan m. schuessler -- evertec, inc
thank you, and i want to thank everyone for joining the call. i hope each of you and your families remain safe. we look forward to connecting with you virtually over the coming months and really look forward to seeing you again in person once we get past the pandemic. thank you, and good night.

i'll now hand the call over to mac.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, kay, and good morning, everyone. our record fourth quarter and full-year 2020 results are a testament to the resiliency of our business and our team in a challenging environment. also, we were able to continue executing our strategy, creating an even stronger business entering 2021. i'll first cover some of the quarter highlights, as well as discuss a few recent developments and then update you on our strategies for growth in 2021 and beyond.
beginning on slide 4, we have a summary of our 2020 results. total revenue for the year was approximately $511 million, up 5% compared to 2019, which exceeded the top end of our initial expectations for the year. we generated adjusted ebitda of $240 million, an increase of 6%. we also delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.07, an increase of 6% as well. our company generated significant operating cash flow of $199 million. our liquidity, as of december 31, 2020, was a strong $320 million and we returned approximately $22 million to our shareholders with over $7 million in stock buybacks and $14 million in dividends. truly impressive results and my thanks go to all the evertec team members on a job well done in the most unusual pandemic year.
now, i'd like to give you more updates on our businesses, beginning with puerto rico on slide 5. first, we anticipate the benefit from the recent consolidation in the banking industry in puerto rico, specifically the integration of firstbank that sits in there. we expect this will positively impact our 2021 merchant segment growth rate. we also believe we will continue to benefit from the current trend of digital transactions as we localized placetopay and focus on ath movil product features. we made further progress throughout the fourth quarter implemented qr codes for contactless payments, which are now available in more than 10% of our merchants. this continues to strengthen our ath brand and drives consumers to embrace digital transactions, which escalated during the pandemic. additionally, during the first half of the year, we plan to launch a new mobile app for electronic benefit, or ebt users, that provides access to their balances on their ebt cards and notification of their next deposits. this new mobile app will further complement our ebt services to the government, a response to the needs of the consumer.
regarding the overall puerto rico economic environment and pandemic impacts, there haven't been any significant changes in restrictions. similar to most places, certain social distancing measures continue to be in place, the most important being a maximum capacity requirement at 30% for restaurants and other businesses. as it relates to the economic environment, unemployment levels have improved since the beginning of the pandemic, but continue to be significantly higher than prior year.
other economic indicators, such as fema [phonetic] sales and retail sales have reflected positive variances against the prior year, which hopefully continue to drive growth into early 2021. the federal stimulus payments that were received between q2 and q3, continue to support an increase in sales volumes in q4, driven by high average ticket, although transactions were down as compared to the prior year. sequentially, we have seen some decline in average ticket as the benefits from unemployment payment and other stimulus begin to lag [phonetic]. the new $600 stimulus payment began rolling out in late january and early february and we are anticipating this to benefit in the first quarter. additionally, i am delighted to say that the vaccine rollout in puerto rico is progressing with over 10% of the island having received their first dose today.
lastly, in january, the federal government announced that fema will award $3.7 billion to help rebuild puerto rico's water and wastewater treatment plants. this award, along with the $13 billion announced in september to rebuild the electric grid, will be beneficial to the long-term health of the economy.
moving on to latin america on slide 6. we achieved a number of significant implementations in the quarter and in early 2021. i'm delighted to announce that we launched mastercard debit card processing with mercadolibre in mexico. mercadolibre owns the leading online payment solution in latin america, mercado pago, and is one of those valuable companies out of latin america known for their online marketplaces. this is testament to our growing reputation with leading banks, financial institutions, as well as technology players in latin america. additionally, i am pleased to announce that the citibanamex, collection platform, and santander chile payment processing service are both in production. furthermore, santander received formal regulatory approval from the government of chile, which is a significant milestone for the country's payment system.
regarding other wins, we have been awarded the formal bid for banco popular of costa rica. while the contract will be finalized in the coming weeks, we are pleased to continue building on this relationship. it is an important renewal of current services we provide, as well as the potential expansion of the relationship with some additional services. lastly, we renewed contracts with both banco itau and banco estado both in chile. these new wins, renewals and implementations represent an important reputational advancement for evertec in latin america. growth from these new services, with current and new customers, will be important in 2021 and beyond, particularly as these markets continue to evolve.
with respect to the economic environment in latin american markets, covid-19 continues to create challenges for the region. latam revenue in q4 was flat year-over-year as we continue to see the impact of the pandemic and previously discussed attrition. vaccine distribution has just begun in february, which will likely further delay the recovery.
moving to slide 7, i want to update you on our perspective regarding industry tailwinds, as well as our growth strategies in 2021 and beyond. there continues to be a significant opportunity for growth across puerto rico and latin america given the dominant position of cash transactions and the low penetration of card volumes. in mature markets like the us and the uk, cash transactions are estimated to be approximately 15% of total transactions. in puerto rico and latin american markets, cash use is more than 50%. we believe the positive trends in cash to digital payment conversion, driven by an increasing online presence and smartphone usage, should fuel growth for many years to come. additionally, as countries move away from the controlling monopolies or duopolies, there will be increasing opportunity to participate in this growth trajectory. while some payment markets like colombia have evolved more slowly than we anticipated, and our investments maybe lower there in the coming year, we would anticipate chile, uruguay, costa rica and mexico to be more robust in 2021.
turning to slide 8, to take advantage of this digital transformation in our markets and to advance our growth strategy further, we made progress in 2020 by accelerating innovations, such as the qr code, which is shifting more of our consumers to contactless payment transactions and further solidifying our ath brand presence. we are also seeing faster adoption of our new gateway product as we expand into other geographies. innovation will remain at the forefront of our strategy given the rapid evolution of the payments industry. we remain committed to cross-selling our products for existing clients, as well as new clients. in 2021, shifting our risk center and payments products from a licensing model to a processing model will allow us to grow with the payment transaction trends and expand our recurring revenue in the region going forward.
lastly, acquisitions will continue to be important to our growth whether in puerto rico or in latin america. our multi-product solutions, strong local presence and our financial capacity allow us to be uniquely positioned to become the partner of choice.
moving to slide 9, we are also proud of being included for the third consecutive year in the bloomberg gender-equality index, which distinguishes companies committed to transparency in gender reporting and advancing women's equality. at evertec, one of our core commitments is to diversity and the development of our employees. in 2020, we surveyed our employees and has the highest participation rates and scores for employee engagement in years. while there is still work to do, we believe that our employees are the key ingredient for successful innovation and a high-performing workforce. i want to thank all of our dedicated team members for their commitment throughout 2020 and for building a strong foundation for growth into 2021 and beyond.
with that, i will now turn the call over to joaquin.
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
thank you, mac, and good morning, everyone. i'll begin with a review of our consolidated fourth quarter and full-year 2020 results and then review each segment in greater detail.
turning to slide 11. total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $134.2 million, up 6% compared to $127.2 million in the prior year, driven by higher sales volume, positive impact from growth in ath movil and ath movil business, new services and project implementation. adjusted ebitda for the quarter was $63.9 million, an increase of 16% from $55.3 million in the prior year. adjusted ebitda margin was 47.6% and this represents a 410 basis point increase in our adjusted ebitda margin compared to the prior year. the increase in margin was primarily driven by revenue growth and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange related to balance sheet remeasurement. adjusted net income in the quarter was $42.8 million, an increase of 23% as compared to the prior year, and $0.59 on a per share basis, an increase of 23%. the increase primarily reflects the increased adjusted ebitda and includes the impact of higher operating depreciation offset by lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate in the quarter.
for the full-year, total revenue was $510.6 million and was up 5% year-over-year. revenue was favorably impacted by higher sales volume and higher spreads in our merchant acquiring business. higher ath movil and ath movil business transactions, as well as the benefit of $4.4 million from the puerto rico department of education, an increase as related to covid-19-specific services. adjusted ebitda was $240.5 million, an increase of 6% with an adjusted ebitda margin of 47.1%, up 70 basis points as compared to prior year. adjusted net income was $151.4 million, up 5% and adjusted earnings per common share was $2.07, up approximately 6% year-over-year. our full-year non-gaap tax rate was 15.2%, an increase from 12.3% in prior year mainly due to the mix of business.
moving on to slide 12, i'll now cover our segment results, starting with merchant acquiring. in the fourth quarter, net revenue increased 8% year-over-year to approximately $29.3 million. the revenue increase was due to increased sales volume, as well as increased spread, driven by higher average ticket that was up 17% as we continue to benefit from the tailwinds from the unemployment benefits and stimulus programs that began earlier in the year. through q4, we continue to see the mix of cards skewed more toward debit pre-pandemic, as well as a lot net international cards because of less inbound travel, both of which contributed to the improved spread and higher revenue. although we continue to see higher average ticket year-over-year, it continues to drift lower than the level we saw in q3 as the impact from the stimulus programs ease and pent-up demand began to normalize. adjusted ebitda for the segment was $14.6 million and adjusted ebitda margin was 49.7%, up approximately 650 basis points when compared to last year. this increase was primarily driven by higher net revenue and the positive impact to operating expenses from overall lower transaction volume, resulting in lower transaction processing cost, which is the highest expense driver for the segment.
for the full-year, merchant acquiring was up approximately 3% year-over-year at a $109.8 million, reflecting the growth over last year's results, primarily due to the same reasons mentioned in the quarter. adjusted ebitda for the full-year was $55.1 million, an increase of 17% and adjusted ebitda margin was 50.2%, up 590 basis points as compared to last year, primarily due to the impact of the higher average ticket and higher spread.
on slide 13, the results for the payment services puerto rico and the caribbean segment. revenue in the fourth quarter was $34.1 million, up approximately 5% as compared to last year. we continue to benefit from the shift toward digital transactions reflected through growth in ath movil and ath movil business with revenues up over 160% and contributing an incremental $2.3 million, as well as the impact from other new services, partially offset by declines in both pos and atm transactions of 6% and 8%, respectively. this decline in pr transaction aligns with the higher average ticket we have been experiencing in our merchant acquiring segment. adjusted ebitda for the segment was point $19.1 million, up 3% and adjusted ebitda margin was 56%, down approximately 110 basis points. adjusted ebitda margin was down due to increased operating expenses, including covid-related expenses.
for the full-year, the segment revenue decreased 1% to $124.8 million in part driven by lower pos and atm transaction volumes, our consumer behavior changes through the pandemic resulted in higher average tickets and more digital transactions, and one-time revenue last year related to an ebt project, partially offset by ath movil and ath movil business increases, which benefited from the push to digital cost by the pandemic. adjusted ebitda for the full-year was $66.9 million, down 15% and adjusted ebitda margin was 53.7%, down 890 basis points as compared to last year, primarily due to decreased revenue are in largely fixed expenses in this segment, as well as the impact of last year's high margin ebt project previously mentioned.
on slide 14, you will find the results for payment services latin america. revenue in the fourth quarter was $22 million, approximately flat as compared to last year, driven primarily by anticipated client attrition of $1 million, and negative fx impacting year-over-year growth of $0.7 million, partially offset by the revenue gains related to the placetopay acquisition. adjusted ebitda for this segment was $8.9 million and adjusted ebitda margin was 40.6%, up as compared to last year, due primarily to positive fx impact resulting from the remeasurement impact of us dollar balances in the quarter of $1.9 million as compared to negative impact in q4 of 2019 of $0.4 million. adjusting for the positive fx impact, margin would have been approximately 32% and generally consistent with our expectations.
for the full-year, the segment revenue was $84.6 million and flat to prior year driven by the same impact that i mentioned in the quarter. additionally, as we make progress on transitioning our platforms to a processing model, we are selling fewer licenses. while this was a headwind to growth in 2020, this transition will allow us to benefit from the transactional growth anticipated in the latin american markets that mac mentioned. throughout 2021, we will continue progressing on this product transition in several geographies, as well as begin to reap the benefits from the new processing-type contracts, such as santander. adjusted ebitda for the full-year was $32.8 million and adjusted ebitda margin was 38.7%, up 240 basis points as compared to last year. adjusting for the positive fx impact from remeasurement, the normalized margin for the year would have been approximately 34%.
moving to slide 15. business solutions revenue in the fourth quarter increased 6% to $60.5 million. we benefited from the cpi increase that began in october 2020, we continue to benefit from covid-related services for the permanent labor, new services for popular, as well as positive impact from projects that were completed in the quarter. adjusted ebitda for the segment was $30.3 million and adjusted ebitda margin was approximately 50%, up 630 basis points as compared to last year due to revenue mix shift toward higher-margin revenue and lower operating expenses as we completed several projects.
for the year, business solutions grew 8% to $235 million, driven by the one-time project for the department of education of $4.4 million, positive impact from covid-related services, as well as new services on project implemented for popular. full-year adjusted ebitda for this segment was $114.8 million, up 18% and adjusted ebitda margin was 48.9%, up 390 basis points year-over-year. excluding the impact from the department of education project, which was recognized net of expenses and other one-time benefits, margin would have been more closely aligned with prior year.
moving to slide 16, you will see a summary of our corporate expense. our fourth quarter corporate and other expense was $9 million, a year-over-year increase of 26%. this increase primarily reflects higher expenses related to the timing of several corporate initiatives, partially offset by lower travel as compared to last year.
for the full-year, corporate and other expense was $29.2 million and as a percent of revenue, approximately flat with prior year at 5.7%.
moving on for year-to-date cash flow overview on slide 17. net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $199 million, or a $19 million increase as compared to prior year as we continue to efficiently manage our working capital. capital expenditures were approximately $49 million and included a higher spend down normal toward innovation and other new product implementation, including the localization and transition of our latam platforms to a processing model. we repaid approximately $31 million of our long-term debt, $8 million in withholding taxes on share-based compensation, $2 million in other debt pay downs and $2 million of fx impact, which resulted in a total net debt decrease of approximately $38 million. and finally, we paid cash dividends to stockholders of over $14 million and repurchased over $7 million in common stock for a total of approximately $22 million returned to our shareholders for the year. we have approximately $100 million available for future use under the company's share repurchase program. our ending cash balance as of december 31 was $221 million, which includes approximately $18 million in restricted cash.
moving to slide 18. our year ending net debt position was approximately $298 million comprised of the $203 million of unrestricted cash and approximately $501 million of total short-term borrowings and long-term debt. our weighted average interest rate was approximately 4.4%. our net debt-to-trailing 12-month adjusted ebitda was approximately 1.8 times, reflecting a $60 million cap on cash in accordance with our credit facility.
as of december 31, total liquidity, which excludes restricted cash and includes the available borrowing capacity was $320 million. as a reminder, the terms of our credit agreement include an excess cash flow feature that applied to cash generated over a certain level to be paid against our loan. this payment will be made before the end of the first quarter and is contingent on the debtholders' acceptance.
moving to slide 19, i will now provide you with our 2021 outlook, as well as some comments on q1. we expect revenue to be in a range of $533 million to $544 million, representing growth of 4% to 7%. our adjusted earnings per share outlook of $2.15 to $2.23, represent a range of 4% to 8% as compared to the adjusted earnings per share in 2020 of $2.07. on a gaap basis, earnings per share is anticipated to be between $1.58 to $1.66.
i will now highlight some of the key underlying assumptions and uncertainties that we have analyzed and planned for. we would expect to see a strong first half revenue growth given the tailwinds from stimulus programs, as well as from -- comparing to covid impacted months last year. the back half is anticipated to be flat to down given the strong performance in last year's second half driven by high levels of stimulus funds, as well as benefits from covid-related services, as well as the impact of one-time revenue, such as the department of education project and other multi-year projects completed in the prior year.
the merchant segments will likely generate a double-digit increase for the year as we continue to benefit from increased sales volumes in part driven by recent stimulus programs along with the benefits from banking consolidation that mac mentioned. payments puerto rico is anticipated to be high-single-digit revenue growth and also first half weighted as ath movil and ath movil business continue to fuel growth, driven by the trends in digital payments. latam will see low- to mid-teens growth given the contribution from new contracts such as santander, citibanamex and others. however, covid impacts and lower software license sales, as we transition to a processing model, will be partial headwinds. business solutions will likely be flat- to low-single digits growth with a first half positive and back half negative largely due to the one-time revenue i mentioned earlier.
regarding corporate expenses, we are managing these well and would expect these to approximate 5% of total revenue, which is down both in dollars and as a percent of revenue from the last several years.
regarding our first quarter, january revenue grew approximately 8% and based on the trend to this point, our best sense is that the first quarter revenue will be mid- to high-single digits revenue growth, with an uptick in the second half of march as we lapped the beginning of the covid lockdown. all these trends are considering our guidance and combined, we believe will generate adjusted ebitda margin in a range of 46% to 47%, similar to last year, with some headwind from the normalization of the average ticket and the high-margin benefit of the department of education contract last year. further, this year, our non-operating income does not include any potential impact from fx remeasurement, which was favorable approximately $5 million to last year.
our operating depreciation and amortization is anticipated to increase to approximately $44 million, up $4 million to $5 million, primarily reflecting our increased capex spend on resulting depreciation related to multi-year projects that went into production last year and early in 2021.
our non-gaap effective tax rate is anticipated to be approximately 13%, down slightly given a more normalized mix of business as compared to 2020. this guidance assumes approximately flat average diluted shares of 73.1 million without any share buybacks included.
our capital expenditures for 2021 are expected to be approximately $50 million and reflects our ongoing investment in technology, localization of our products in latin america and continued investment in transitioning our licensing model in latam to a processing model. our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged, we will continue to focus on growth investments internally, as well as through m&a. while the timing of m&a is uncertain and we currently have a higher-than-normal cash balance, we are constantly focused on evaluating our best use of cash. we plan to continue our dividends to shareholders and if excess cash is available, we will repurchase shares under our recently renewed and increased share repurchase program.
in summary, we executed well during 2020 and delivered strong cash generation. as we continue to focus on our innovations and opportunities in puerto rico and expanding our latam business, we look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming year.
we will now open the call for questions. operator, please go ahead and open the line.

thank you. [operator instructions] the first question comes from george mihalos with cowen. please go ahead.
allison jordan -- cowen and company -- analyst
good morning. this is allison on for george. thank you for taking my questions. to start, i was curious if you can provide color on the pipeline for additional deals in latin america. and whether there is a preference for jvs or more processing partnerships like we saw in chile?
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so this is, mac. thanks for the question. i mean, if you look at what we announced over the last year and this quarter specifically, we have announced more deals organically in latin america than we have in the company. and if you look at how lucky and guided for the year to get double-digit growth in latam, that's all organic, we feel pretty good about the pipeline that we closed with and implemented. so, if you look at it, we implemented citibanamex, we implemented santander chile, we also announced mercadolibre. it's the first time we've talked about those guys as one of our partners now, which is one of the most valuable companies in latin america and probably one of the best technology company. so, i think we don't comment on deals before we sign them or close them, but we feel very good about the pipeline. and to demonstrate that, we've looked back at what we've closed over the last year, year and a half.
allison jordan -- cowen and company -- analyst
that's great color, and great progress. thank you for that update. and then last one for me. i caught the total revenue performance of 8% in january. i was wondering if you can provide color, specifically on the trends you saw in both the merchant acquiring and payment services businesses in puerto rico quarter-to-date versus the 8% and 5% we saw in 4q.
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
sure. i mean, look, if we think about january, there was an additional push of stimulus impacting the island, right? so, sales volume was up compared to what we saw coming off of q4, which is positive. however, as i said before or in the prepared remarks, the average ticket does continue to come down sequentially and we have seen a kind of inbound travel starting to come back slowly but surely and that will impact spread and that's something that we also saw in the month of january.
as it relates to transactions, ath movil and ath movil business, as we said, also in the guidance, that we are expecting that to be strong in the first half and we saw that in january, just because of kind of [phonetic] the tailwind of the shift to digital and transactions are coming back as well slowly, still kind of flattish to the prior year, but positive.
allison jordan -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. thank you for taking my questions and congrats on the results.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer

the next question is from bob napoli with william blair. please go ahead.
robert napoli -- william blair & company -- analyst
hi. thank you. just, i guess, your -- congratulations on a good year in a tough environment. really nice job. the balance sheet now you have been really strong position and i know you don't have any buybacks in your guidance. and so, is it -- i mean, do you have -- what is the capital strategy from here? and do you have a significant pipeline of m&a and then so maybe a little bit of color around that strategy as opposed to returning capital? because, i mean, obviously, you've done a nice job with the balance sheet.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
sure. yeah. thanks, bob. so what i would say is, look, 2020 was sort of a year where everyone is very conservative and cautious. we were very, very focused on continuing to invest in our products and our employees during a very difficult year, which is we learned that from hurricane maria. we do feel like -- coming into 2021, we have a little bit more confidence in what this year will look like. we are focused on being appropriate with the capital allocation and making sure that we pull all the levers this year.
on the pipeline from an m&a perspective, what i would tell you is, as you know bob, we never talk about deals until we have one. but we will continue to focus on those deals. if you look at the portfolio companies we've acquired over the last five years, it's really created what we now have -- it's created some good business in puerto rico like the relationship we have with firstbank and it's also created great assets in latin america, where we now, for the first time and a long time, are seeing double-digit organic growth in latin america. so, we will continue to focus on now investing in that business organically, but also we're continuing to look at m&a opportunities.
robert napoli -- william blair & company -- analyst
would you likely do larger m&a transactions than you have in the past given the expansion of the business and the strengthening of the balance sheet?
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
we would be opportunistic to look at any type of transaction available. i mean, there are a couple of different types we see in the region, bob, some are small tuck-ins, like we've done in the past. and we've been pleased that we've been able to get -- purchase those at a reasonable valuation and then integrate those and really leverage those products to grow the company. there is also the monopolies and duopolies across the region, which sometimes are talked about, will those sell like prisma sold in argentina? so we will look at everything, but we'll make sure that the numbers make sense and then it makes sense strategically for the company. but we're trying the visibility to as much slow as we can.
robert napoli -- william blair & company -- analyst
and then just last question. the charts that you show, i mean, it's obvious, the cash in the markets that you serve is very high, which should give you secular growth for a very long time. but with the -- is it -- would -- the organic growth rate of this business seems like it should be accelerating over the next few years, given the cash in the markets. so what are your thoughts around the acceleration of the top line revenue growth? and shouldn't earnings grow faster than revenue, a, given the cash flow and b, given that this is a good scale business that usually leads to higher margins over the long-term?
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. it's a great question. so, bob, first one i would say is, we really spent some time this year reaffirming our strategy by taking a deep dive on each of the markets we do business in, so that we could understand the opportunity and also sort of the competition in the product set. and that -- part of that output is what you see on the industry tailwind. so you're correct, we think the tailwinds in latin america are great because there's still a lot of cash, because there is still an opportunity for new entrants as the markets continue to open and people look for alternatives. and as more people move from bank -- unbankers [phonetic] to bank or some type of financial services and they move to more digital technology. so we think the tailwinds for latin america are fantastic.
when you think about the growth of the company, if you dissect the revenue guidance for this year, we are seeing acceleration in growth organically in latin america, specifically, to where we do have the double-digit growth. we do have to look -- and even in mab. so our merchant business in puerto rico, we anticipate double-digit growth. so we are seeing that, but we do -- and then payments latam is going to be high-single, right? so we are seeing an acceleration of our growth...
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
no, for latam, mid-teens.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
teens, sorry. i'm sorry, payments latam mid-teens. payments puerto rico is high-single. so we are seeing the acceleration in our growth rate, particularly in latam as you point to, and we are going to be very focused on managing our expenses, as joaquin told you, our corporate expenses are actually going to be lower this year. but we are going to make sure we invest in the business, so that as the market opportunities arise, we're able to capture those with great products, great service and stability. so, we do have to balance those. but we do think, to your point, bob, the tailwinds are great, and we are seeing that acceleration in our latam business is starting to pay off.
robert napoli -- william blair & company -- analyst
okay. thank you. appreciate it.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer

the next question is from vasu govil with kbw. please go ahead.
vasundhara govil -- keefe, bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
hi. thank you for taking my question and congratulations to both of you for a great year amid adversity [phonetic]. so, i guess, my first question was just on, any color that you could provide us on what percentage of margins are still inactive as the recovery is taking shape. if you are seeing sort of the sales improvement be pretty broad-based or being driven by a certain verticals or industries?
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
so, hi, vasu. actually, the number of inactive merchants is pretty much come all the way back to pre-pandemic levels. and, obviously, there is different puts and takes in terms of verticals, but when we see it on a general basis, verticals maybe 1% of where we were at the beginning of the pandemic and that kind of moves up and down kind of from month-to-month in terms of the verticals. so, i mean, nothing really to comment specifically.
vasundhara govil -- keefe, bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
got it. that's helpful color. and then my next question was on business solutions. historically, this business we've [phonetic] seen a low-single-digit grower and now you've had three years sort of mid- to high-single-digit growth. so, what -- is there sort of a change in the way you're thinking about the sustainable growth of this segment long-term, if you could just sort of give us some color there, mac and joaquin?
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
so, i mean, if you look back to the past two years specifically, right, and even if you look at just 2020, we've had several very specific, either projects or situations that have helped us drive that segment at a faster pace of growth. so, if you think this year we have the department of education [phonetic] contract, we also, because of our relationship with the government and the relationship with banco popular, we're there to support them in terms of covid, either in helping them get to their workforce being completely remote, or in the case of the government with printing and sending checks, processing checks related to all of the unemployment in benefit and stimulus that was coming through. so, i would say, that was a big driver of why that segment kind of outperformed what we expect at the beginning this year.
and if you look at the prior year, we saw popular kind of acquire reliable, so the banking consolidation also helped us when we look at 2019 in terms of kind of speeding up the growth in that segment. but looking forward, i think, again, our sales process is longer, the projects are longer, it takes time for us to put something in place and then implement as the revenue come through. so, that's what we're going back to this kind of flattish to low-single-digit growth for 2021.
vasundhara govil -- keefe, bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
got it. and the last one, if i may. you've seen really strong growth in this ath movil product. is there anything you can do to capitalize this and sort of take it outside of puerto rico? just any thoughts there?
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
okay. when i look outside of puerto rico, we've really expanded the products. we got the risk management product, we now have issuing capabilities that we talked about, most recently in mexico, we have acquiring capabilities that we're launching in chile, we also have the payment -- the builder election [phonetic] platform that we do in mexico. we're also renewing some contracts in chile. so, we definitely have a much broader set of products than we've historically had, which has helped us grow the business. i think when you look at ath, it's not a product that we've sold outside of puerto rico to any substantial extent. it is something that we continue to present to customers. but to this point, we haven't found a lot of opportunity, but that may change in the future as people look for sort of digital apps, but it's not something that we've sold recently in the region.
vasundhara govil -- keefe, bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
got it. thank you very much for the color.

james friedman -- susquehanna financial group -- analyst
hi, mac. hi, joaquin. hi, kay. good numbers here. congratulations. i just wanted to ask first. is it possible looking to help quantify the term to processing conversion impact? mac you had discussed it in your prepared remarks and you did as well, joaquin. so, any quantification there?
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
can you clarify, jamie? are you -- do you mean in latam when we move from licensing to processing? is that what you are referring to?
james friedman -- susquehanna financial group -- analyst
from licensing to processing, yes, and in latam, right?
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
how do we quantify?
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, look, licensing in our latam business specifically around the product that we're selling now was probably in the 15% to 20% of the business. so, that's why we're -- as we have decided, right, to move all of those products to processing, we've pretty much stopped selling licenses in those regions where we're localizing the platform. so, we have that portion of our business that's kind of flattish growth, mainly because we've been so focused in bringing these platforms up and bringing clients like santander into production.
in the case of santander, i mean, we've been localizing and talking about this now for over a year, so it does take some time to localize and get all of the specific regulatory requirements within each country set. but if you think of about what mac kind of went through, we have santander up and running in chile, we have mercadolibre in mexico. we renewed banco popular in costa rica. so, i mean -- and even though that's from the platform, it just shows that we've -- we now have the platform up and running in these two regions, and we continue to focus in colombia and in costa rica to do the same.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think the important piece is that transition is sort of multi-year and then, not only is there some incremental expense, but there is also a learning curve. and if you look at the new technology that we're deploying across the region, we have now moved to a processing model with many of the software solutions that we have, maybe just one or two countries. so we've now gained the expertise and moving into localizing these platforms, gain the expertise of implementing in a processing mode. so, that's what we're pretty comfortable about is that, we now have that experience with the software in different countries. so -- and that investment was made from the last year and going into this year.
now, when we continue to localize an existing platform in a new country, there will be some step -- there will be some additional incremental expense, but it should be less as we continue to deploy the software and it should be more cost and time effective as we move forward. but what we can tell you is, we believe the opportunities exist and we're excited that financial institutions, retailers and, as we demonstrated in this call, with mercadolibre, technology companies are looking for partners.
james friedman -- susquehanna financial group -- analyst
and about that mac, and that's a great horse to back. is that a source -- the mercadolibre, is that a sole-sourced relationship in mexico? how is that going to work?
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so the relationship with mercadolibre -- so just for everyone that background, mercadolibre is one of the largest e-commerce country -- companies in latin america. it's headquartered out of argentina, large mexican business, large businesses in brazil and across the region. they are now partnering with us on issuing in mexico for their debit card product, which is a new product for them in the market and we have a direct relationship with mercadolibre. it's -- the product is held under mercado pago, is their payments brand, but that is something we haven't talked about in the past and we're pretty excited about the specific opportunity, but also the long-term potential relationship that we can have with mercadolibre.
james friedman -- susquehanna financial group -- analyst
got it. i'll jump back in the queue. thank you.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
the next question is from james faucette with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. good morning. just want to build on jamie's question on mercadolibre. and was that specific partnership and issuance that you're doing? how do you think about the potential for expansion of other services with mercadolibre? like, where would you think there could be opportunity, etc? and what does it speak to in terms of similar type opportunities, maybe with other partners throughout the region?
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so, again, the mercadolibre relationship today is debit processing in mexico. so, we provide other services in mexico that we would love to sell to mercadolibre. they also are expanding across the region. so, if we do well on this product and if we perform well, we do believe there will be additional opportunities. and as we spoke about earlier, we are seeing this demand across latin america. what's happened in the united states, where you have so many different types of alternatives for online payments, online marketplaces. that's just now evolving in latin america. and given that we have technology that's developed in the region by spanish-speaking programmers, this really puts us in a very good position to be a partner of choice. so, we do hope that be successful relationships, not only will help us broaden the relationships with these existing clients, but we are calling cards the new client.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
and then when you look at the low- to mid-teens growth in latin america and that's certainly a huge promising. at the same time, we realize that there are some -- still some attrition headwinds, can you talk about the environment broadly in the market both in terms of covid, but maybe more generally your ability to enter into the market or expand footprint where you already have presence?
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so as we talked about earlier, we really, in 2020, focused on continuing to support our employees and support our customers and that trying to accelerate development. and that was incredibly important to us and we think that our partners notice. so, if you look in chile, we believe that santander chile is the one of the first institutions to go out with an acquiring product because of our relationship. they received regulatory approval for the product. so, we think that we've demonstrated an ability to continue to invest, to continue to deliver even under difficult circumstances. so, we think the opportunities are continuing.
i do think latin america is -- and it's a fact they are a little bit behind on vaccine. so, they may have some continued impact in 2021, but it has not slowed our implementation of clients significantly. i mean, of course, we had some delays. but, again, with citibanamex, with santander chile, with mercadolibre, we're in production, right? and we were able to do that through the pandemic.
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
and i would just add that, even though, right, as mac said, the vaccine rollout is behind where maybe the us is and the impact to some of the economics is expected to be tough or a bit more severe, right, just because of the ability of the government to support the economy, we have seen another positive. so, in colombia, for example, the way that the government is rolling out the benefits has also driven people to open bank accounts. so, the government and the way that they are pushing out stimulus is also helping some of these underlying factors that help in terms of driving growth in digital payment. so bankerization in colombia, i think they added more accounts in the last six months of 2020 than they did all of 2019. so that kind of thing is kind of the silver lining in-between all the covid impact.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's great color. thank you very much.
operator
the next question is from matt o'neill with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
matthew o'neill -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah. hi. good morning, gentlemen. thanks for taking my question. i was just wondering if we get a little bit of an update on the msa with banco popular and i was particularly curious about kind of the ongoing dialogue there, in other words, kind of the last third of the 15-year relationship as far as things like investments do you guys make on an ongoing basis in the core processing services. and any kind of requests or desires that you guys are collectively working on from there into the equation just as we start thinking about getting closer to the inevitable renegotiation phase on that contract? thanks.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
sure. good question. so, as we've said, i mean, we've talked about this in the past. we're very focused on being a partner that people want to do business with, not have to do business with. we've been very focused on improving slas with the bank. we've been very focused on improving our products and making sure that we're closely aligned. we just had our employee town hall at the end of the year. and every year, i give employees the top five headlines that i want to see in the press about our company so that every employee can relate to that. and this year, last year, one of those is that banco popular chooses us as a partner of choice. so we're very, very focused on that. very focused on making sure we continue to improve our services, our quality, and making sure that we're constantly engaging with the bank because we know long-term that contract is very, very important for evertec.
matthew o'neill -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. and, i guess, just drilling into the core processing itself. i mean, from when that agreement was initially signed back in 2010, decade later, there has been a lot of innovation, moving from more of a license to outsource model and the industry more private cloud, open api-based solutions from larger kind of outsource core providing processors in the us for example. and so, i was just kind of curious, what's the kind of state of that business today and where are they. where is it in this kind of evolutionary path?
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
the state of core banking?
matthew o'neill -- goldman sachs -- analyst
of the -- yeah. of evertec core processing services that are being provided to banco popular?
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, if you look at what we've done across our different products, if you look at ath and the qr codes that we've delivered, we're also building apis with our ath product. so it's easier for them to implement those types of products. so, we're continually trying to evaluate what's the best service we can provide, and what are those investments we need to make long-term. we'll continue to evaluate this year, are there places we need to invest more, like msp/mssp providing a sort of a hosted service offering that, not only popular, but other clients, is something that we're looking at this year. is that a business that we should invest in? so we'll continue this year to evaluate where we want to invest, just like we have done with our payments business.
matthew o'neill -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. i think just a last one to round out here. it looks like the original msa was signed on september 30 of 2010. is that when -- is that like the 15-year sort of expiration would be september 30 of 2025 or point of renewal presumably?
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
that's correct.
matthew o'neill -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. thanks so much. i'll hop back in the queue.
operator
the next question is from john davis with raymond james. please go ahead.
matthew schwarz -- raymond james -- analyst
hey. it's matt schwarz on for jd. thanks for taking my questions. thank you for the detail on the full-year guidance. two quick clarifications. is the next round of stimulus that looks like will pass in near future in the full-year guide? and then any update on hurricane relief funding and how much is embedded in the guide? thanks.
joaquin castrillo -- chief financial officer
hi. so, in terms of additional stimulus, we have included some incremental stimulus as part of the high side of our guidance. and what i would say is right-wing to see what actually gets passed in the senate. and then we also need to see how some of that factors have benefited us through 2020, like the average ticket, the shift between domestic cards and international cards, now that people are getting back to native [phonetic] and probably travel will start to pick up, those are a couple of things that helped us in 2020 that we need to see if they continue into 2021, as it relates to the profitability of, for example, the merchant acquiring business. but we have included some incremental stimulus as per the high side. i'd say that the range pretty much reflects kind of the opportunities and risks that we have some visibility, too, at this point.
in terms of the hurricane funding, i think it's positive everything that we're seeing in the news, the new administration is being proactive in kind of releasing funding to puerto rico. everything that has been previously approved under the previous administration based on the most recent reports had auto strings attached to it and that's why so little of that funding was actually used or dispersed by the puerto rico government. so, i think it's definitely encouraging. we need to now see how quickly this moves because there is still kind of a bureaucratic process, but definitely positive in light of what we're seeing in the past.
matthew schwarz -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, great. thanks for that. and then you mentioned 10% of merchants now have contactless enabled. where do you see this trajectory going? are there any major milestones you have in mind in increasing that percent to have contactless? thanks.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean, look, we rolled that out fairly quickly and to get to 10% penetration was a focus of the company and also a focus to get a certain number of merchants out. so, we feel pretty good about the progress today.
matthew schwarz -- raymond james -- analyst
right. great. thanks, guys.

operator
good day, and welcome to the evertec, inc. first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to ms. kay sharpton, vice president of investor relations. please go ahead.
kay sharpton -- vice president of investor relations
thank you and good afternoon. with me today are mac schuessler, our president and chief executive officer; and joaquin castrillo, our chief financial officer. before we begin, i'd like to remind everyone that this call may contain forward-looking statements and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and the company's most recent periodic sec report. during today's call, management will provide certain information that will constitute non-gaap financial measures under sec rules, such as adjusted ebitda, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share. reconciliations to gaap measures and certain additional information are also included in today's earnings release and related supplemental slides, which are available in the investor relations section of our company website at www.evertecinc.com.
i'll now hand the call over to mac.
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
thanks, kay, and good afternoon, everyone. we achieved strong results in the first quarter driven by consumer demand as we lapped the 1-year anniversary of the pandemic as well as benefit from the impact of new business contracts in latin america. given the q1 results, the passage of the new stimulus bill as well as our execution on our share repurchase program, we are raising our expectations for 2021, and joaquin will provide further details. beginning on slide 4. total revenue was $140 million for the first quarter, an increase of 14% compared to 2020. adjusted ebitda was $69 million, an increase of 22% as compared to the prior year. and adjusted earnings per share was $0.62, an increase of 35%. we generated significant operating cash flow during the quarter of $35 million, and we returned approximately $80 million to our shareholders through dividends and execution of share repurchases. additionally, our liquidity remains strong at $273 million as of march 31. moving on to our update on slide five for puerto rico. we continue to see significant transaction revenue growth as a result of the federal stimulus programs and increased consumer demand.
for example, merchant revenue growth in january and february was low double digits and then surged in march to over 46% growth as we lap the covid-19 lockdown last year for a total quarterly revenue growth of 23%. we also continue to benefit from growth in our digital payment channels related to the ath network. our ath movil and ath movil business delivered 160% revenue growth. further, we are encouraged by the adoption rate of qr codes by both consumers and businesses. we have expanded the contactless functionality to almost 4,000 or approximately 13% of our merchants and have added qr code payment functionality to pay at the table restaurants. additionally, toward the end of the quarter, we were pleased to extend and expand our relationship with firstbank, driven by the recent consolidation of firstbank and santander.
we extended our existing agreement, which was previously through 2025, an additional five years to 2030 and expanded the relationship to include the new merchant contract previously part of santander. regarding other recent contracts, we are leveraging our printing capacity and signed one of the largest printing contracts in the company's history. the contract is anticipated to benefit our business solutions segment in the back half of 2021 and is a testament of our ability to grow on the island. another recent change in the business solutions segment is the sale of ticketpop, an electronic ticket step processor, which represented a small portion of our revenues. we did not see this business as a core competency, and this transaction closed in april. as we consider the ecosystem in puerto rico, the vaccination efforts continued to progress, and the government expects to have 70% of the population with both doses by the end of the summer.
the covid cases have spiked up after spring break, bringing back some lower-capacity modes and other measures, but nothing close to a lockdown. from a macroeconomic perspective, we expect to continue benefiting from the recent package of the new stimulus support as well as expanding ebt benefits that will run through midyear. we are also encouraged by the recently announced release of over $900 million in federal funds for the school system and the release of $8.2 billion in hurricane recovery-related funds, which will contribute to the long-term recovery and mitigate future disaster risks. turning to latin america on slide 6. regarding the environment, we continue to see different responses to the covid-19 pandemic and varying levels of restrictions, reopening and vaccine levels. chile, for example, is third in the world for percentage of vaccinated population. however, they are still seeing a significant rise in new cases. while we remain cautious about the outlook throughout the region given the continuing uncertainties surrounding the virus, we were pleased to have driven double-digit revenue growth in the first quarter as a result of the newly implemented payment solutions in chile.
santander has launched a significant marketing campaign and has already signed over 10,000 merchants, which is halfway to their annual goal in 2021 of 20,000 merchants. mercado libre has also been strong in their debit card issuing in mexico, which we will benefit from as those cards begin to be used. we're also pleased with the expansion of our placetopay e-commerce gateway and have more than 1,800 active merchants on the platform and anticipate further growth throughout the region. lastly, i want to comment on our recently announced management changes and a couple of noteworthy items in our proxy, annual report and esg summary.
we are pleased to add diego viglianco as chief operating officer and to name phil steurer as chief strategy officer. phil has been with us since 2012 and is currently serving as our chief operating officer. shifting him to our chief strategy officer will help us drive alignment of product strategy and customer acumen. diego has a wealth of experience in latin american payments as well as strong technical expertise, and we're delighted to add him to the team. we believe these changes in our leadership will further strengthen evertec as we focus on future opportunities. additionally, this year in our proxy, we have nominated a new board member, kelly barrett. with her addition, we will increase our board gender diversity to over 20%. we have continued to advance our focus on esg and remain attuned to supporting our employees, our clients and the communities that we do business in. we are proud of our progress on these important areas of corporate citizenship and hope you will review our recent annual report and 2021 esg tear sheet on our website.
with that, i will now turn the call over to joaquin.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
thank you, mac, and good afternoon, everyone. turning to slide 8, you will see the consolidated first quarter results for evertec. total revenue for the first quarter was $139.5 million, up 14% compared to the prior year of $121.9 million covid-impacted results. current quarter results reflected strong consumer demand positively impacting all our transactional revenue in puerto rico, while also benefiting from our double-digit growth in lat am driven by our recent implementations. additionally, we benefited from onetime revenue related to hardware and software sales in the dominican republic of approximately $1 million. adjusted ebitda for the quarter was $68.9 million, an increase of 22% from $56.3 million in the prior year. adjusted ebitda margin was 49.4%, and this represents a 320 basis point increase compared to the prior year. the increase in margin primarily reflects the higher payment revenue in both puerto rico and latin america while also controlling costs.
adjusted net income for the quarter was $45 million, an increase of 34% as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting the higher adjusted ebitda and lower cash interest expense. this was partially offset by increased operating depreciation and amortization driven by capital expenditures in the prior year as was key projects that went into production last year. our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 14.7%, reflecting some discrete tax items that impacted the quarter. and we now expect our tax rate for the full year to range from 13% to 14%, depending on the mix of business. adjusted eps was $0.62 for the quarter, an increase of 35% compared to the prior year. moving on to slide 9. i'll now cover our segment results, starting with merchant acquiring. in the first quarter, merchant acquiring net revenue increased 23% year-over-year to approximately $30.9 million driven by the impact of increased sales volume. results benefited from higher sales volume as well as higher spread, in part driven by a higher average ticket, which was up 15%.
march results contributed almost 60% of the year-over-year revenue increase as we lap the full lockdown the last two weeks of march last year. the results also benefited from new stimulus, such as the $600 approved toward the end of the prior year that were distributed in puerto rico starting in february, as well as positive impact from increased ebt funds that began to be distributed in march and that will run throughout the second quarter. we also benefited from a mix shift to higher-margin businesses, such as restaurants and retail, as well as some continued card mix shift from credit to debit and from international to local cards. lastly, we also benefited from the expanded relationship with firstbank for a portion of the month of march.
adjusted ebitda for the segment was $15.5 million, up 38%. adjusted ebitda margin was 50.3%, up approximately 540 basis points as compared to last year, reflecting the impact of the higher average ticket and higher spreads as we continue to drive higher revenues with less transactions. on slide 10, you will see the results for the payment services, puerto rico and the caribbean segment. revenue for the segment in the first quarter was $36.3 million, up approximately 21%, with a similar monthly pattern of the merchant segment in the first two months of the quarter and then over 33% growth in march as compared to last year. the revenue growth was primarily due to higher ath movil and ath movil business transactions, contributing an incremental $2.5 million in the quarter, largely driven by ath movil business.
we also saw growth in pos transactions, which was the first positive quarter since the pandemic started and driven by the month of march when compared to prior year, which was negatively impacted by the lockdown. additionally, we benefited from intersegment revenue for transactional processing and risk monitoring in puerto rico for latin america. adjusted ebitda for the segment was $20.8 million, up 29% as compared to last year. adjusted ebitda margin was 57.4%, up 360 basis points as compared to last year, primarily due to higher revenue and the impact from the pandemic to last year's margin given the negative impact to revenues in a segment with a high percentage of fixed costs. on slide 11, you will see the results for our payment services lat am segment. revenue for the segment in the first quarter was $25 million, up approximately 16% as compared to last year. this increase was driven by implementation such as santander chile as well as increased revenue from placetopay.
adjusted ebitda for the segment was $10 million, and adjusted ebitda margin was 40.1%, up approximately 200 basis points as compared to last year, driven by higher revenue and the benefit of balance sheet remeasurement in nonfunctional currencies of approximately $0.2 million. this lat am margin is currently benefiting from established minimums in the santander contract with low transaction levels. and we would expect margins to move toward mid- to high 30s as transactions increase over time. on slide 12, you will find the results for the business solutions segment. business solutions revenue for the first quarter was up approximately 8% to $60.6 million. the revenue increase in the quarter benefited from approximately $1 million in onetime revenue for hardware and software sales in the dominican republic. we are also benefiting from the shift to digital channels as the higher volume of online users continues to drive growth over prior year as well as an increase in service volumes.
additionally, we benefited from new services that began in 2020 for popular and the department of education. for the quarter, adjusted ebitda was $29.6 million and adjusted ebitda margin was 48.9%, down approximately 20 basis points as compared to last year. the adjusted ebitda margin decrease was primarily driven by the mix of revenue, which included lower-margin hardware and software sales as well as costs related to the new services. moving on to slide 13, you will see a summary of corporate and other. our first quarter adjusted ebitda was a negative $7.1 million, an increase of 5% compared to prior year. our adjusted ebitda as a percentage of total revenue was 5.1%, unfavorable by approximately 50 basis points as compared to prior year primarily due to the high revenues in the quarter. moving on to our cash flow overview on slide 14. our beginning cash balance was approximately $221 million, including restricted cash of approximately $18 million.
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $35 million, nearly $1 million increase compared to prior year. capital expenditures were approximately $17 million, in part driven by higher obsolescence spend as we accelerate some projects as well as continuous focus on innovation. regarding capital expenditures for the full year, we now anticipate approximately $50 million to $55 million of capex. we also recorded approximately $15 million for the extension and expansion of our relationship with firstbank, including the acquisition of the merchant contracts. we also purchased debt securities in the amount of $3 million in response to a new regulatory requirement in costa rica directly related to our settlement services in the country and which require we provide these securities as collateral through the central bank. we paid approximately $21 million in long-term debt payments, which included approximately $17 million related to an excess cash flow feature in our credit agreement. we also paid $9 million in withholding taxes on share-based compensation and $1 million of other debt paydowns, which resulted in a total net debt decrease of approximately $31 million.
we paid cash dividends of $4 million and repurchased approximately 383,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $37.26 for a total of approximately $14 million. we have approximately $86 million available for future use under the company's share repurchase program. lastly, we had approximately $3 million of benefit on cash in foreign currency, resulting in our ending cash balance as of march 31 of $175 million. and this included approximately $19 million of restricted cash. additionally, we recently announced another $0.05 dividend to be paid on june 4, 2021, to shareholders of record of may 3, 2021. moving on to slide 15, you will find a summary of our debt as of march 31, 2021. our quarter ending net debt position was approximately $323 million comprised of approximately $156 million of unrestricted cash and approximately $479 million of total short-term borrowings and long-term debt. our weighted average interest rate was 4.5%. our net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted ebitda was approximately 1.7 times. as of march 31, total liquidity was approximately $273 million.
this balance excludes restricted cash and includes the available borrowing capacity under our revolver. moving to slide 16, i will now provide you with an update on our 2021 outlook as well as some comments on q2. given our q1 results and additional visibility, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $543 million to $552 million, representing growth of 6% to 8%. our adjusted earnings per share outlook of $2.25 to $2.32 represents a range of 9% to 12% as compared to the adjusted earnings per share in 2020 of $2.07. on a gaap basis, earnings per share is anticipated to be between $1.70 to $1.77. we had a strong q1 and expect to see a similar level of revenue in q2 given the tailwinds from stimulus programs. the benefits from the new contract that mac mentioned were already considered in the guidance range, as we previously provided. regarding the back half of the year, we continued to anticipate revenues to be flat to down given the strong performance in last year's second half, driven by high levels of stimulus funds as well as benefits from covid-related services and the impact of onetime revenues, such as the department of education project and other projects that we completed in the prior year.
we now believe adjusted ebitda margins will be in a range of 47% to 47.5%. we continue to expect some headwinds from the normalization of the average ticket and the high-margin benefit of the department of education contract last year as well as a negative impact from foreign currency remeasurement, which was favorable by over $4 million in the second half of last year. as i mentioned previously, our non-gaap effective tax rate was higher in q1. and we now anticipate the full year rate to be in a range of 13% to 14% based on the mix of business and net discrete tax items that impacted q1. this guidance also includes the benefit of the share repurchases in q1. one other item of note are related to our quarter that i want to make you aware of. in addition to finding our 10-q, we will also be filing a shelf registration or s-3 that relates to popular's shares of evertec. while we don't have any knowledge of popular's intent to sell evertec shares at this time, this is a required filing on our stockholder agreement with popular.
in summary, we are excited about the impressive results in q1, which led us to raise our guidance, and we are on track with our plans for 2021. we look forward to hopefully seeing you in person at our upcoming conferences later in the year. finally, i want to share with you the news that kay is retiring from evertec next month. i've been working closely with kay over the past six years and can attest to the significant contributions kay has brought to this leadership team, which go well beyond investor relations. i am a huge fan of kay and everything she does and will miss her dearly. thank you for everything, kay, and the best of luck in this new chapter.
mac, do you want to say some words?
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
absolutely. when i arrived at evertec over six years ago, the first person i called was kay. we worked together at global payments so i knew her intelligence, experience, integrity and relationship skills well. since arriving, kay has been an instrumental part of the leadership team. she has provided insight and advised beyond her areas of responsibility, and everyone here has become better because of her. although kay is leaving her official role, she has given me permission to call her for business advice once in a while. and beyond that, i know we will keep in touch because we are friends. kay, i want to thank you for everything, and i know you'd like to say a few words as well.

thanks, mac and joaquin, for those kind words, i've had six interesting, challenging and satisfying years at evertec. mac, what i've appreciated at evertec has been the culture you've established, one that allowed me to have a voice. i always felt heard and valued. to the investors and analysts i've spoken with over the years, thank you for the hard questions. i appreciate your interest in looking beyond the numbers and seeing the exciting potential. and to my support team at icr, i'm confident you'll give evertec the same level of excellence that you've given me over the past six years. to my colleagues, thank you for sharing the warmth of puerto rico with me despite my language shortcomings. you provided me with an opportunity to grow, to learn and appreciate this beautiful island. it is with mixed feelings that i'm leaving, but i look forward to a new chapter in my life. i wish you well and many successes ahead.
okay, operator, i think we're ready. open the line for questions.

[operator instructions] and the first question will come from bob napoli with william blair. pardon me mr. napoli. your line is open.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
hello, can you hear me? i'm sorry.
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
we can hear you now, bob.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
okay. sorry. that's my phone, probably. sorry, i was choked up from kay's speech there. it's been great working with you, kay. it's -- and i wish you the very best. so joaquin, the revenue growth in the back half of the year, i think you said that the revenue would be down year-over-year in the back half. i know you have a really tough comp in the third quarter, but fourth quarter if you look at the...
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
actually, bob, we said flat to down. so depending on kind of the range, right, that we gave. well, yes, go ahead.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
okay. now it just seems like as you get to the fourth quarter, with all the good things that are going on here, it seems like you should have pretty solid growth if you look at the fourth quarter versus 2019. but it just seems like -- i mean you guys are known for being conservative. and how -- what was the onetime gain, i guess, in the third quarter? how much was that? or...
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
sure. so i'll give you a little bit of color, bob. in the third quarter of last year, we had the department of education, and that was approximately $4 million. so that was big on the top line. but if you remember, we also recognized that net. so from a perspective of margin, it was also a very good -- a big contribution to our ebitda margin for that quarter. and yes, i mean, look, if we look at kind of the cadence of what we saw last year, the quarter after stimulus was disbursed, we did see some slowdowns. in this case and as we said in the script, some of the stimulus started to flow in the month of march. we're obviously still expecting a strong q2. but as we kind of start moving away from that stimulus, we're kind of trending in a similar way to what we saw in q4, where there is a slowdown. and as we get into q4, obviously, there's still some uncertainty, and we're taking that into consideration as part of the guidance as well.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
okay. i appreciate your conservative guidance, as you've done historically. but mac, i think just a question on the -- i mean the strong growth that you have you're showing right now, puerto rico has always been, in latin america, a very heavy cash markets. do you think this has changed? and i mean, is there -- can you give a mix like of online spend or the mix of cash? or just any thoughts on whether the secular growth has permanently shifted to use of more electronic payments in your markets?
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. so bob, we talked about that a little bit on the last call. i don't have the statistics in front of me, but it was about 50% was still cash. so we still think there's a big opportunity. and we've seen a continued conversion, particularly with the pandemic, to digital form of payments. that's why we've seen so much growth in the qr codes. so we still -- as we said on the last call, there's a lot of opportunity still in puerto rico. we're very well positioned with the relationship with popular, with the extension of the relationship with firstbank and with the new technology that we're deploying with ath. if you look at latin america, now that those markets are opening like chile, like the relationship we now have with mercado libre and then we're rolling out placetopay in central america in both costa rica and now panama as well, we think we're going to get an ability to capture some of that transfer from cash to electronics in latin america as well. so that's, we think, a big trend for the entire region, including puerto rico.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
and just last question. the new contracts, can you give any color on the revenue associated with -- the firstbank expansion sounds pretty attractive and then the chile product and some of the other -- just any commentary on the new products and what it's going to mean for the business.
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
well, i'll give you -- so on firstbank, what we've done is firstbank acquired santander. and so we've consolidated that business under the firstbank relationship and then extended that relationship until the end of 2030 -- or until 2030 as it relates to the merchant business. on the new products, placetopay, like i said earlier, we've now rolled out in costa rica. we've added merchants there. we've now rolled it out in panama. and then you mentioned santander and santander chile. specifically, the bank has publicly said they've already reached half of their goal within the first month or two of going into production. and so we're pretty optimistic about that as well. and i will tell you, evertec, within the region, is known for being one of the fintech companies that's solely focused on latin america and now has the success stories and the rolodex and credentials to get us into more -- to more meetings and more opportunities.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
thank you, appreciate it.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
thanks, bob.
operator
the next question will come from korey marcello with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
korey marcello -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey guys, congrats on the quarter. thanks for taking my question. i just wanted to touch -- you guys mentioned, obviously, the stimulus benefits and how the growth rates have typically kind of moderated a bit as you've moved away from that stimulus. is there any kind of sense that you can give us on how the volumes kind of trended in april? have those started to kind of die off a little bit? i'm just trying to triangulate how you get to the second quarter revenue growth that's kind of being flat even though the comps are a little bit easier. thanks.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
i mean, i think what we said flat was similar to q1, not necessarily similar to prior year, right? we do have a...
korey marcello -- deutsche bank -- analyst
right. that's what i meant, yes, similar to q1.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
well, i mean, when we go into april, we have seen strong kind of volume growth in april, similar to what we saw toward march. and i think when we talk about kind of moving away from the stimulus, we're talking about more of the second half of the year. and actually, to expand a little bit more on some of the assumptions there, look, we saw very high average tickets last year even in q2 and going into q3 driven because of the lockdown and people having only certain places to shop and these big kind of grocery purchases for purposes of the shelter-in-place, which we're not necessarily seeing when we see the average ticket under spread now in 2021. so even though we're still seeing very high spend, very high sales volume, those are some of the puts and takes that we're also taking into consideration as we start to kind of look at the second half of the year and the fact that we're not necessarily at the same level of average ticket spread and also the mix shift between credit and debit starting to normalize.
korey marcello -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. that makes sense. any update on business solutions? i know you guys gave sort of the first half, second half being negative. that was the guidance kind of last quarter. just given that new printing contract, is there any change to the business solutions guidance from that contract?
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
so korey, that contract we had already considered as part of our guidance. again, the department of education contract that impacted us positively in q3 is a big driver of that kind of guide to negative -- or to flat in the second half. i would say that in addition to that, as it relates to business solutions, specifically, we also benefited from some of the covid-related services that we provided both to the government and to some of our financial institutional clients that related to, in the case of the government, printing checks, supporting their technology of unemployment platforms, and in the case of some of our financial institutions, continuing to support the kind of remote work environment. and again, those are some projects that were onetime in nature or that because they're related to covid or to the relief package that we saw last year won't necessarily recur from a growth perspective in 2021.
korey marcello -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. just maybe a quick clarification. you mentioned on lat am, the margins. i know there's some margin headwinds there just from moving to more processing. but you mentioned they would move from about -- toward the mid- to high 30s. over what time frame was that? i was just trying to clarify that.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
so look, at this point, right, and to give some more clarity on what we meant, today, we're seeing the revenue from santander, which as we've stated in the past, has some minimums and is one of the things we love about this contract. but obviously, as we start to drive more transactions to the platform and start to see more cost, to the extent that santander is still below those minimums, that will put some pressure on that margin. having said that, we've done some other wins here that are related to processing like mercado libre, like banamex, that over time will offset some of that pressure. but we would still expect to see that margin kind of come down a little bit to the kind of the mid- to high 30s. in terms of time frame, i don't know if we have a specific time frame that we can give you. we're definitely happy to see santander continuing to push transactions above their expectations. i think that's good for them. it's very good for us. but we'll continue to monitor how that impacts the margin.
korey marcello -- deutsche bank -- analyst
very clear, thank you very much.
operator
the next question will come from vasu govil with kbw. please go ahead.
vasu govil -- kbw -- analyst
hi, thanks for getting my question. i also definitely want to extend my good wishes to kay. it's been great working with you. i guess my first question, as you think about like the impact that we've had from covid, do you think that we're kind of -- covid is kind of behind us and business has mostly normalized as you think about active merchants or sort of impact on tourism, the atm business? can you kind of help frame if we are still seeing some of the businesses being impacted or that's pretty much behind us at this point?
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
so i'll take a shot and then, joaquin, you -- i mean, vasu, there's definitely -- we're back to some level of normality. we do have a lot of tourists now in puerto rico. restaurants are open. but there's still a lot of places that are at lower capacity. restaurants are at lower capacity, movie theaters, cinema. so we haven't gone back to 100% of where we were. so i would say there's still opportunity for the economy to continue to be stimulated. and there's also still a lot of money to come in from the hurricane relief that has yet to come in. that being said, we don't know what the future holds as far as new variants, anything like that. and i think no one can predict those things. but we are definitely back to a much more closer state of normality. but even schools, i mean, my son is still doing school from home. so we're much closer to being back to normality, but there's still a little bit of a way to go.
vasu govil -- kbw -- analyst
got it. and just, i guess, a follow-up on that, mac, as you think about the macro environment, to your point, the stimulus funding and now the financial aid coming into puerto rico, i think the outlook probably looks a lot better than it has in the past. so is that giving you more confidence to be able to have a longer-term view of what the growth profile of the business could look like? because i know historically, there's just been too much uncertainty on the macro front.
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. so i think it gives us more certainty to puerto rico. i don't know that we will give long-term guidance. i think we will continue to give annual guidance. but i do think the relief money you've seen come in from covid, the relief money you've seen come in from the hurricane, which is just beginning and then if we see more infrastructure spending from the new administration, that's definitely going to benefit puerto rico and benefit us, on top of the fact we're still 50% cash, right? so i think you've got some pretty good dimensions of how puerto rico will operate over the next couple of years. but i don't think that we'll give long-term guidance.
vasu govil -- kbw -- analyst
understood. and just one last one, if i may. just on the m&a environment, if you could talk a little bit about what the m&a pipeline looks like, what kind of assets you're looking at. and congratulations to diego and phil for their new roles, but if you could expand a little bit on what -- where you expect phil to focus on, et cetera.
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. so i mean, first, we are excited about adding diego to the team. i mean he's had a senior leadership job at prisma mexico. he was one of the top guy at prisma, and then he was the ceo of a real-time payments company in argentina that was owned by the local banks. and he also worked at mastercard. he's moving to puerto rico, and he's -- of course, he's fluent in spanish. so we think he'll be a great addition to the team. phil is actually going to work and help me and the team on strategy and also customer excellence to make sure that we're measuring customer excellence well, making sure that we're measuring the velocity of our product adoption and then helping us continue to map out our plans for further growth.
when you're asking about m&a, i mean, it continues to be something we're very focused on. the deals have not -- the type of deals we see have not dramatically changed. and what we've seen since i've been here, it's -- the valuations have probably gone up a little bit and people's expectations just given where in the world it is and where sort of the technology space is, but it still is important to us. and it's a significant reason, the assets that we've purchased, like placetopay, is one of the reasons we're winning business. and then paygroup is the sole reason we won santander chile and mercado libre as well. so we've been pleased with those.
vasu govil -- kbw -- analyst
great. that's great color. thanks very much.
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
thanks, vasu.

the next question will come from jamie friedman with susquehanna. please go ahead.
jamie friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
kay, let me echo the congratulations. this is a great way to go out. good numbers here. mac, my first question is for you. in your prepared remarks, mac, you had mentioned, i thought the -- it was either the number of cards or transactions or accounts on file. you had some operating metric relative to santander chile. you were going kind of quick there though. could you say that part again?
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
sure. so -- and typically, we don't give this level of detail out for customers, but they've publicly given it out in their market. so this is publicly available information. they have -- their target for the year was 20,000 merchants. within a month or two of rolling out the product, they already have 10,000 merchants. so they're incredibly happy with the pace of the -- of their sales efforts. so that was the statistic we gave. then i also gave a statistic of 1,800 merchants we now have up on placetopay, which is our e-commerce gateway. that was originally in colombia and ecuador, and now we've rolled it out panama, in costa rica, and we're looking to localize it in puerto rico as well.
jamie friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
great. that sounds really positive. joaquin, you had mentioned a shareholder agreement with bpop that you're going to file, i guess, soon or you already did. what i don't -- i'm embarrassed to say, i don't remember that in the past. it might just be me. or is that something that is actually incremental?
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
no, jamie. so let me give you a little bit of context. so within our shareholder agreement, we are obligated to file this registration statement as a consequence of being a well-known seasoned issuer. if you look back a couple of weeks, we filed a 10-k/a, where we actually checked the box as a well-known seasoned issuer. and this filing is in accordance to the shareholder agreement requirement because of being a well-known seasoned issuer. but to be clear, we're not aware of any intent by the bank to sell shares or anything at this point.
jamie friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
is that something that you do every year? or is that different?
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
no. so i mean the shareholder agreement has several registration rights that are available to the bank. in this case, this is an automatic type of requirement that comes in when you are a well-known seasoned issuer. and given that we are a well-known seasoned issuer, we are obviously going to comply with the shareholder agreement and file the registration statement.
kay sharpton -- vice president of investor relations
jamie, it's a three-year filing, by the way.
jamie friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
oh, ok. so like, if i look back three years ago, i would have seen something similar, kay?
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
no, no, no. so to be clear...
kay sharpton -- vice president of investor relations
no.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
jamie, this is the first time we're filing it. the 10-k/a is the first time that we have checked the box as a well-known seasoned issuer. and because -- again, because we are a well-known seasoned issuer, the shareholder agreement has a requirement of an automatic registration statement because of that. and so this is the first time that we are kind of doing this automatic registration.
jamie friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
okay. all right. [indecipherable] really good numbers. congratulations.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
thanks, jamie.

the next question will come from john davis with raymond james. please go ahead.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks and kay, i'll add my congratulations. no more earnings season. must be nice. so mac, maybe i'll just start, piggyback off of one of the earlier questions about m&a. but more from a leverage perspective, i think the balance sheet is in the best shape you guys have had it as a public company. and as you continue to grow, that leverage will still go down. so how do you think about normalized leverage? obviously, you want to keep some dry powder for m&a, but there was a reason to keep the balance sheet levered on a few times. just kind of thoughts on where you are about this business on a normalized basis.
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. so i mean going into the pandemic, i think like everyone, we were very, very conservative about making sure we understood how the change in the business environment was going to impact our business. as you saw, we bought stock in the quarter, which had been a while since we have done that. and so we are very focused on capital allocation. we know that we have sort of the powder to do additional things, whether it's buy back stock, whether to do m&a. and so we see that as a great position to be in. but like i said earlier, we are looking at m&a. we do have the repurchase program. so we will continue to figure out what's the best use of capital.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. and just remind us how much is left on that now, on the buyback?
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
about $86 million.
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
$86 million.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
yes. we -- in late december, john, we approved $100 million through the end of '23. we purchased about $14 million in the first quarter. so we have about $86 million still to go. okay. great. and then, mac, i didn't know you guys have been giving some periodic ath movil updates. just curious where that stands today, whether it's users, transactions. i think you had some comments in the deck that it remains strong. but just curious if there are any stats out there that you'd give us from a user base for transactions. have you seen that tail off at all now that we're starting to reopen? or does that remain strong? yes. we don't have any statistics for the call today. we did say that ath movil and ath movil business had 160% revenue growth, right? so pretty strong growth for the quarter. and that is all -- or mostly new business, right? so those are new transactions. but then also on top of that, as we've talked about, ath movil is capturing new transaction types, person-to-person, small businesses that didn't accept cards like food trucks. but it is also helping us strengthen our relationship with our existing merchants because you can now use it in the biggest supermarkets, the fast food chains. where typically, we would have had this on a piece of plastic, now we're getting those on the qr codes. and so we now have 4,000 merchants out, which is about 13% of our merchant base is now accepting the ath movil qr code. so significant growth on both fronts. those that are actually driving incremental revenue and those that are actually driving sort of increased brand awareness and increased stickiness with our merchants.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. great. and then i do want to follow up, you mentioned earlier that the -- you're finally just four years later, 3.5 years later, starting to see some of the hurricane relief money hit the island. just curious, i think it's $8.2 billion of hud. how should we think about that? or what's your best guess of how that flows through? i know it's probably a little bit fuzzy, to say the least, at this point. and then remind us what else is out there. and then maybe just a bigger picture, how do you guys see the new administration from a puerto rico standpoint? there's some things that are -- do you see positively for the island with the biden white house? just curious if there are any bigger-picture thoughts on the new white house.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
john, so this is joaquin. i mean, look, the $8.2 billion, to be clear, it's -- this is positive. and -- but what's happening is that a lot of the kind of strings that were attached to a lot of these funds and are getting streamlined. the obstacles to approval are also getting removed. so the path to actually getting these through to impact the economy is a little bit clear. but there is still a process in place, right? i mean this eur8.2 billion -- and there's been a lot of kind of articles around it. it still needs to go through a process of bidding and awarding contracts. so look, i think, and we've said in the past, unfortunately, this is a story that has come all the way from after the hurricane.
we're encouraged by the fact that this is going on, and we feel that we're going to see this now start to hit the economy, but there's still somewhat of a lag between now and when we actually see that hit. in terms of what else is there, i mean, this is -- the $8.2 billion is related to hud. there are still other agencies that are in kind of the same process of distributing funds. and look, the local government has been very proactive in how they're working with the federal government. i think the federal government has been saying the right things and with the actions on this $8.2 billion are doing some of the right things that we want to see. but now we need to see some execution also from the puerto rico government to actually get their hands on this funding and move quickly to actually impact the economy.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. and then, mac, any bigger picture on what the new white house means for puerto rico more broadly, if anything?
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
i mean, look, i would know probably not a lot better than you guys. but by reading what you read in the press and the plans, i think, that this administration has, i mean they seem to be pro-social programs, which, by the way, we have a lot of in puerto rico. so continuing to support those. we're looking at new programs could be positive. i think to joaquin's point, the ability to access the hurricane funds, it seems like that this administration may help us do that more quickly. but i mean, that's sort of speculation. but i do think that this administration, from a big picture, could benefit our business.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, all right. thanks guys.

the next question will come from james faucette with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, thank you very much. like everybody else, just extend my thanks and best wishes to kay as she moves on. and thanks for all your input and time over the years. i wanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions. first, you highlighted that tourism is coming back, but there's still some more to go there. but also like normal day-to-day life is also returning. any characterization you could give us of like how much tourism has recovered? are we back to kind of 70% to 80% of the -- what you would suspect is tourist-related spend? or just any metrics around that versus day-to-day? just trying to gauge where you guys are seeing benefit right now.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
sure, james. look, we can actually point you to some websites after this that can help kind of clear up some of the numbers. but the inbound flights have definitely come back. when we compare against the prior year, we're still definitely below what a normal kind of month or period looks like for puerto rico in terms of inbound travel pre-pandemic, but flights and tourism is definitely on the rise. when we look at hotel and occupancy, some of the numbers have a lag, but the expectation i think is that those are between 60% to 70% of where they were pre-pandemic, which compared to where we were during lockdown, which went down to almost 90% of what usually is, right? it's been an improvement. so look, they're still in puerto rico, unfortunately, some rises in cases. and the government continues to look for different ways in which to mitigate these rises, including putting some restrictions in inbound travel now very recently. that could have an effect on these trends that we've been seeing the past few weeks. so again, something that we need to monitor. and as mac said before, we don't have real control over variants or how the cases continue to move, but certainly encouraging to see those numbers start to improve.
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
and james, think about it, i mean some of the core sectors like supermarket fast food, those were pretty resilient during the entire pandemic, right? people had to still put food on their tables. but people going back to the office, consuming fuel, so that -- our spending in certain categories as people reactivate, get back to work, go back to restaurants. so that supply chain improves. that's where we're slowly -- i mean it's not back to 100%. like i said, even the schools are -- not all the schools are back. and tourism, as an aside, isn't a huge piece of our business or even the puerto rican economy. but that was sort of my example of things are coming back, but there's still a bit of a way to go. but...
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. got it. that's really helpful, guys. and then mac, just following up on your m&a commentary, you said that there are a few things that you're looking at, but also acknowledge that kind of prices or valuations and expectations there, maybe, have risen. i guess kind of the last thing to finish out the equation, at least in my mind, is how has your willingness to pay up or pay for acquisitions changed at all? i mean, has that risen along with what people are asking for? or do you still think there are deals that should and could be had? just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about that final piece, which is your thought process.
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. so look, i mean we've bought several things since i've been here. and some have been at very low multiples, some have been at higher multiples given for that state of time. so we still look at opportunities frequently. and so we definitely wouldn't overpay for any asset, but i mean we still are constantly looking. and most of the stuff we've bought is small. we've been able to tuck it in, integrate it into our business and then grow organically well. in some of these countries, james, the things that may be for sale are the monopolies or the duopolies. and some of those may have fundamental problems because they may lose customers over time. so it's -- we continue to look at m&a. we have the balance sheet to buy something if we find it attractive, and we'll continue to try and make the right decisions.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst

thanks, kay, and good afternoon, everyone. we achieved strong results in the first quarter driven by consumer demand as we lapped the one-year anniversary of the pandemic as well as benefit from the impact of new business contracts in latin america. given the q1 results, the passage of the new stimulus bill as well as our execution on our share repurchase program, we are raising our expectations for 2021, and joaquin will provide further details. beginning on slide 4. total revenue was $140 million for the first quarter, an increase of 14% compared to 2020. adjusted ebitda was $69 million, an increase of 22% as compared to the prior year. and adjusted earnings per share was $0.62, an increase of 35%. we generated significant operating cash flow during the quarter of $35 million, and we returned approximately $80 million to our shareholders through dividends and execution of share repurchases. additionally, our liquidity remains strong at $273 million as of march 31. moving on to our update on slide five for puerto rico.
we continue to see significant transaction revenue growth as a result of the federal stimulus programs and increased consumer demand. for example, merchant revenue growth in january and february was low double digits and then surged in march to over 46% growth as we lap the covid-19 lockdown last year for a total quarterly revenue growth of 23%. we also continue to benefit from growth in our digital payment channels related to the ath network. our ath movil and ath movil business delivered 160% revenue growth. further, we are encouraged by the adoption rate of qr codes by both consumers and businesses. we have expanded the contactless functionality to almost 4,000 or approximately 13% of our merchants and have added qr code payment functionality to pay at the table restaurants. additionally, toward the end of the quarter, we were pleased to extend and expand our relationship with firstbank, driven by the recent consolidation of firstbank and santander.
we extended our existing agreement, which was previously through 2025, an additional five years to 2030 and expanded the relationship to include the new merchant contract previously part of santander. regarding other recent contracts, we are leveraging our printing capacity and signed one of the largest printing contracts in the company's history. the contract is anticipated to benefit our business solutions segment in the back half of 2021 and is a testament of our ability to grow on the island. another recent change in the business solutions segment is the sale of ticketpop, an electronic ticket step processor, which represented a small portion of our revenues. we did not see this business as a core competency, and this transaction closed in april. as we consider the ecosystem in puerto rico, the vaccination efforts continued to progress, and the government expects to have 70% of the population with both doses by the end of the summer. the covid cases have spiked up after spring break, bringing back some lower-capacity modes and other measures, but nothing close to a lockdown. from a macroeconomic perspective, we expect to continue benefiting from the recent package of the new stimulus support as well as expanding ebt benefits that will run through midyear. we are also encouraged by the recently announced release of over $900 million in federal funds for the school system and the release of $8.2 billion in hurricane recovery-related funds, which will contribute to the long-term recovery and mitigate future disaster risks. turning to latin america on slide six.
regarding the environment, we continue to see different responses to the covid-19 pandemic and varying levels of restrictions, reopening and vaccine levels. chile, for example, is third in the world for percentage of vaccinated population. however, they are still seeing a significant rise in new cases. while we remain cautious about the outlook throughout the region given the continuing uncertainties surrounding the virus, we were pleased to have driven double-digit revenue growth in the first quarter as a result of the newly implemented payment solutions in chile. santander has launched a significant marketing campaign and has already signed over 10,000 merchants, which is halfway to their annual goal in 2021 of 20,000 merchants. mercado libre has also been strong in their debit card issuing in mexico, which we will benefit from as those cards begin to be used. we're also pleased with the expansion of our placetopay e-commerce gateway and have more than 1,800 active merchants on the platform and anticipate further growth throughout the region. lastly, i want to comment on our recently announced management changes and a couple of noteworthy items in our proxy, annual report and esg summary. we are pleased to add diego viglianco as chief operating officer and to name phil steurer as chief strategy officer. phil has been with us since 2012 and is currently serving as our chief operating officer. shifting him to our chief strategy officer will help us drive alignment of product strategy and customer acumen. diego has a wealth of experience in latin american payments as well as strong technical expertise, and we're delighted to add him to the team. we believe these changes in our leadership will further strengthen evertec as we focus on future opportunities.
additionally, this year in our proxy, we have nominated a new board member, kelly barrett. with her addition, we will increase our board gender diversity to over 20%. we have continued to advance our focus on esg and remain attuned to supporting our employees, our clients and the communities that we do business in. we are proud of our progress on these important areas of corporate citizenship and hope you will review our recent annual report and 2021 esg tear sheet on our website.
with that, i will now turn the call over to joaquin.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
thank you, mac, and good afternoon, everyone. turning to slide eight, you will see the consolidated first quarter results for evertec. total revenue for the first quarter was $139.5 million, up 14% compared to the prior year of $121.9 million covid-impacted results. current quarter results reflected strong consumer demand positively impacting all our transactional revenue in puerto rico, while also benefiting from our double-digit growth in lat am driven by our recent implementations. additionally, we benefited from one time revenue related to hardware and software sales in the dominican republic of approximately $1 million. adjusted ebitda for the quarter was $68.9 million, an increase of 22% from $56.3 million in the prior year. adjusted ebitda margin was 49.4%, and this represents a 320 basis point increase compared to the prior year. the increase in margin primarily reflects the higher payment revenue in both puerto rico and latin america while also controlling costs. adjusted net income for the quarter was $45 million, an increase of 34% as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting the higher adjusted ebitda and lower cash interest expense. this was partially offset by increased operating depreciation and amortization driven by capital expenditures in the prior year as was key projects that went into production last year.
our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 14.7%, reflecting some discrete tax items that impacted the quarter. and we now expect our tax rate for the full year to range from 13% to 14%, depending on the mix of business. adjusted eps was $0.62 for the quarter, an increase of 35% compared to the prior year. moving on to slide nine. i'll now cover our segment results, starting with merchant acquiring. in the first quarter, merchant acquiring net revenue increased 23% year-over-year to approximately $30.9 million driven by the impact of increased sales volume. results benefited from higher sales volume as well as higher spread, in part driven by a higher average ticket, which was up 15%. march results contributed almost 60% of the year-over-year revenue increase as we lap the full lockdown the last two weeks of march last year. the results also benefited from new stimulus, such as the $600 approved toward the end of the prior year that were distributed in puerto rico starting in february, as well as positive impact from increased ebt funds that began to be distributed in march and that will run throughout the second quarter.
we also benefited from a mix shift to higher-margin businesses, such as restaurants and retail, as well as some continued card mix shift from credit to debit and from international to local cards. lastly, we also benefited from the expanded relationship with firstbank for a portion of the month of march. adjusted ebitda for the segment was $15.5 million, up 38%. adjusted ebitda margin was 50.3%, up approximately 540 basis points as compared to last year, reflecting the impact of the higher average ticket and higher spreads as we continue to drive higher revenues with less transactions. on slide 10, you will see the results for the payment services, puerto rico and the caribbean segment. revenue for the segment in the first quarter was $36.3 million, up approximately 21%, with a similar monthly pattern of the merchant segment in the first two months of the quarter and then over 33% growth in march as compared to last year. the revenue growth was primarily due to higher ath movil and ath movil business transactions, contributing an incremental $2.5 million in the quarter, largely driven by ath movil business. we also saw growth in pos transactions, which was the first positive quarter since the pandemic started and driven by the month of march when compared to prior year, which was negatively impacted by the lockdown. additionally, we benefited from intersegment revenue for transactional processing and risk monitoring in puerto rico for latin america.
adjusted ebitda for the segment was $20.8 million, up 29% as compared to last year. adjusted ebitda margin was 57.4%, up 360 basis points as compared to last year, primarily due to higher revenue and the impact from the pandemic to last year's margin given the negative impact to revenues in a segment with a high percentage of fixed costs. on slide 11, you will see the results for our payment services lat am segment. revenue for the segment in the first quarter was $25 million, up approximately 16% as compared to last year. this increase was driven by implementation such as santander chile as well as increased revenue from placetopay. adjusted ebitda for the segment was $10 million, and adjusted ebitda margin was 40.1%, up approximately 200 basis points as compared to last year, driven by higher revenue and the benefit of balance sheet remeasurement in nonfunctional currencies of approximately $0.2 million. this lat am margin is currently benefiting from established minimums in the santander contract with low transaction levels. and we would expect margins to move toward mid- to high 30s as transactions increase over time. on slide 12, you will find the results for the business solutions segment.
business solutions revenue for the first quarter was up approximately 8% to $60.6 million. the revenue increase in the quarter benefited from approximately $1 million in one time revenue for hardware and software sales in the dominican republic. we are also benefiting from the shift to digital channels as the higher volume of online users continues to drive growth over prior year as well as an increase in service volumes. additionally, we benefited from new services that began in 2020 for popular and the department of education. for the quarter, adjusted ebitda was $29.6 million and adjusted ebitda margin was 48.9%, down approximately 20 basis points as compared to last year. the adjusted ebitda margin decrease was primarily driven by the mix of revenue, which included lower-margin hardware and software sales as well as costs related to the new services. moving on to slide 13, you will see a summary of corporate and other. our first quarter adjusted ebitda was a negative $7.1 million, an increase of 5% compared to prior year. our adjusted ebitda as a percentage of total revenue was 5.1%, unfavorable by approximately 50 basis points as compared to prior year primarily due to the high revenues in the quarter. moving on to our cash flow overview on slide 14. our beginning cash balance was approximately $221 million, including restricted cash of approximately $18 million. net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $35 million, nearly $1 million increase compared to prior year. capital expenditures were approximately $17 million, in part driven by higher obsolescence spend as we accelerate some projects as well as continuous focus on innovation. regarding capital expenditures for the full year, we now anticipate approximately $50 million to $55 million of capex. we also recorded approximately $15 million for the extension and expansion of our relationship with firstbank, including the acquisition of the merchant contracts. we also purchased debt securities in the amount of $3 million in response to a new regulatory requirement in costa rica directly related to our settlement services in the country and which require we provide these securities as collateral through the central bank.
we paid approximately $21 million in long-term debt payments, which included approximately $17 million related to an excess cash flow feature in our credit agreement. we also paid $9 million in withholding taxes on share-based compensation and $1 million of other debt paydowns, which resulted in a total net debt decrease of approximately $31 million. we paid cash dividends of $4 million and repurchased approximately 383,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $37.26 for a total of approximately $14 million. we have approximately $86 million available for future use under the company's share repurchase program. lastly, we had approximately $3 million of benefit on cash in foreign currency, resulting in our ending cash balance as of march 31 of $175 million. and this included approximately $19 million of restricted cash. additionally, we recently announced another $0.05 dividend to be paid on june 4, 2021, to shareholders of record of may 3, 2021. moving on to slide 15, you will find a summary of our debt as of march 31, 2021.
our quarter ending net debt position was approximately $323 million comprised of approximately $156 million of unrestricted cash and approximately $479 million of total short-term borrowings and long-term debt. our weighted average interest rate was 4.5%. our net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted ebitda was approximately 1.7 times. as of march 31, total liquidity was approximately $273 million. this balance excludes restricted cash and includes the available borrowing capacity under our revolver. moving to slide 16, i will now provide you with an update on our 2021 outlook as well as some comments on q2. given our q1 results and additional visibility, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $543 million to $552 million, representing growth of 6% to 8%. our adjusted earnings per share outlook of $2.25 to $2.32 represents a range of 9% to 12% as compared to the adjusted earnings per share in 2020 of $2.07. on a gaap basis, earnings per share is anticipated to be between $1.70 to $1.77. we had a strong q1 and expect to see a similar level of revenue in q2 given the tailwinds from stimulus programs. the benefits from the new contract that mac mentioned were already considered in the guidance range, as we previously provided. regarding the back half of the year, we continued to anticipate revenues to be flat to down given the strong performance in last year's second half, driven by high levels of stimulus funds as well as benefits from covid-related services and the impact of one time revenues, such as the department of education project and other projects that we completed in the prior year. we now believe adjusted ebitda margins will be in a range of 47% to 47.5%.
we continue to expect some headwinds from the normalization of the average ticket and the high-margin benefit of the department of education contract last year as well as a negative impact from foreign currency remeasurement, which was favorable by over $4 million in the second half of last year. as i mentioned previously, our non-gaap effective tax rate was higher in q1. and we now anticipate the full year rate to be in a range of 13% to 14% based on the mix of business and net discrete tax items that impacted q1. this guidance also includes the benefit of the share repurchases in q1. one other item of note are related to our quarter that i want to make you aware of. in addition to finding our 10-q, we will also be filing a shelf registration or s-3 that relates to popular's shares of evertec. while we don't have any knowledge of popular's intent to sell evertec shares at this time, this is a required filing on our stockholder agreement with popular. in summary, we are excited about the impressive results in q1, which led us to raise our guidance, and we are on track with our plans for 2021. we look forward to hopefully seeing you in person at our upcoming conferences later in the year. finally, i want to share with you the news that kay is retiring from evertec next month. i've been working closely with kay over the past six years and can attest to the significant contributions kay has brought to this leadership team, which go well beyond investor relations. i am a huge fan of kay and everything she does and will miss her dearly.
thank you for everything, kay, and the best of luck in this new chapter. mac, do you want to say some words?
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
absolutely. when i arrived at evertec over six years ago, the first person i called was kay. we worked together at global payments so i knew her intelligence, experience, integrity and relationship skills well. since arriving, kay has been an instrumental part of the leadership team. she has provided insight and advised beyond her areas of responsibility, and everyone here has become better because of her. although kay is leaving her official role, she has given me permission to call her for business advice once in a while. and beyond that, i know we will keep in touch because we are friends. kay, i want to thank you for everything, and i know you'd like to say a few words as well.
kay sharpton -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, mac and joaquin, for those kind words, i've had six interesting, challenging and satisfying years at evertec. mac, what i've appreciated at evertec has been the culture you've established, one that allowed me to have a voice. i always felt heard and valued. to the investors and analysts i've spoken with over the years, thank you for the hard questions. i appreciate your interest in looking beyond the numbers and seeing the exciting potential. and to my support team at icr, i'm confident you'll give evertec the same level of excellence that you've given me over the past six years. to my colleagues, thank you for sharing the warmth of puerto rico with me despite my language shortcomings. you provided me with an opportunity to grow, to learn and appreciate this beautiful island. it is with mixed feelings that i'm leaving, but i look forward to a new chapter in my life. i wish you well and many successes ahead. okay, operator, i think we're ready. open the line for questions.

[operator instructions] and the first question will come from bob napoli with william blair. please go ahead. pardon me mr. napoli. your line is open.
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
bob?
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
hello, can you hear me? i'm sorry.
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
we can hear you now, bob.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
okay. sorry. that's my phone, probably. sorry, i was choked up from kay's speech there. it's been great working with you, kay. it's -- and i wish you the very best. so joaquin, the revenue growth in the back half of the year, i think you said that the revenue would be down year-over-year in the back half. i know you have a really tough comp in the third quarter, but fourth quarter if you look at the...
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
actually, bob, we said flat to down. so depending on kind of the range, right, that we gave. well, yes, go ahead.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
okay. now it just seems like as you get to the fourth quarter, with all the good things that are going on here, it seems like you should have pretty solid growth if you look at the fourth quarter versus 2019. but it just seems like -- i mean you guys are known for being conservative. and how -- what was the one time gain, i guess, in the third quarter? how much was that? or...
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
sure. so i'll give you a little bit of color, bob. in the third quarter of last year, we had the department of education, and that was approximately $4 million. so that was big on the top line. but if you remember, we also recognized that net. so from a perspective of margin, it was also a very good -- a big contribution to our ebitda margin for that quarter. and yes, i mean, look, if we look at kind of the cadence of what we saw last year, the quarter after stimulus was disbursed, we did see some slowdowns. in this case and as we said in the script, some of the stimulus started to flow in the month of march. we're obviously still expecting a strong q2. but as we kind of start moving away from that stimulus, we're kind of trending in a similar way to what we saw in q4, where there is a slowdown. and as we get into q4, obviously, there's still some uncertainty, and we're taking that into consideration as part of the guidance as well.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
okay. i appreciate your conservative guidance, as you've done historically. but mac, i think just a question on the -- i mean the strong growth that you have you're showing right now, puerto rico has always been, in latin america, a very heavy cash markets. do you think this has changed? and i mean, is there -- can you give a mix like of online spend or the mix of cash? or just any thoughts on whether the secular growth has permanently shifted to use of more electronic payments in your markets?
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. so bob, we talked about that a little bit on the last call. i don't have the statistics in front of me, but it was about 50% was still cash. so we still think there's a big opportunity. and we've seen a continued conversion, particularly with the pandemic, to digital form of payments. that's why we've seen so much growth in the qr codes. so we still -- as we said on the last call, there's a lot of opportunity still in puerto rico. we're very well positioned with the relationship with popular, with the extension of the relationship with firstbank and with the new technology that we're deploying with ath. if you look at latin america, now that those markets are opening like chile, like the relationship we now have with mercado libre and then we're rolling out placetopay in central america in both costa rica and now panama as well, we think we're going to get an ability to capture some of that transfer from cash to electronics in latin america as well. so that's, we think, a big trend for the entire region, including puerto rico.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
thanks. and just last question. the new contracts, can you give any color on the revenue associated with -- the firstbank expansion sounds pretty attractive and then the chile product and some of the other -- just any commentary on the new products and what it's going to mean for the business.
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
well, i'll give you -- so on firstbank, what we've done is firstbank acquired santander. and so we've consolidated that business under the firstbank relationship and then extended that relationship until the end of 2030 -- or until 2030 as it relates to the merchant business. on the new products, placetopay, like i said earlier, we've now rolled out in costa rica. we've added merchants there. we've now rolled it out in panama. and then you mentioned santander and santander chile. specifically, the bank has publicly said they've already reached half of their goal within the first month or two of going into production. and so we're pretty optimistic about that as well. and i will tell you, evertec, within the region, is known for being one of the fintech companies that's solely focused on latin america and now has the success stories and the rolodex and credentials to get us into more -- to more meetings and more opportunities.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
thanks, i appreciate it.
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
thanks, bob.

the next question will come from korey marcello with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
korey marcello -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, guys. congrats on the quarter. thanks for taking my question. i just wanted to touch on -- you guys mentioned, obviously, the stimulus benefits and how the growth rates have typically kind of moderated a bit as you've moved away from that stimulus. is there any kind of sense that you can give us on how the volumes kind of trended in april? have those started to kind of die off a little bit? i'm just trying to triangulate how you get to the second quarter revenue growth that's kind of being flat even though the comps are a little bit easier. thanks.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
i mean, i think what we said flat was similar to q1, not necessarily similar to prior year, right? we do have a...
korey marcello -- deutsche bank -- analyst
right. that's what i meant, yes, similar to q1.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
well, i mean, when we go into april, we have seen strong kind of volume growth in april, similar to what we saw toward march. and i think when we talk about kind of moving away from the stimulus, we're talking about more of the second half of the year. and actually, to expand a little bit more on some of the assumptions there, look, we saw very high average tickets last year even in q2 and going into q3 driven because of the lockdown and people having only certain places to shop and these big kind of grocery purchases for purposes of the shelter-in-place, which we're not necessarily seeing when we see the average ticket under spread now in 2021. so even though we're still seeing very high spend, very high sales volume, those are some of the puts and takes that we're also taking into consideration as we start to kind of look at the second half of the year and the fact that we're not necessarily at the same level of average ticket spread and also the mix shift between credit and debit starting to normalize.
korey marcello -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. that makes sense. any update on business solutions? i know you guys gave sort of the first half, second half being negative. that was the guidance kind of last quarter. just given that new printing contract, is there any change to the business solutions guidance from that contract?
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
so korey, that contract we had already considered as part of our guidance. again, the department of education contract that impacted us positively in q3 is a big driver of that kind of guide to negative -- or to flat in the second half. i would say that in addition to that, as it relates to business solutions, specifically, we also benefited from some of the covid-related services that we provided both to the government and to some of our financial institutional clients that related to, in the case of the government, printing checks, supporting their technology of unemployment platforms, and in the case of some of our financial institutions, continuing to support the kind of remote work environment. and again, those are some projects that were one time in nature or that because they're related to covid or to the relief package that we saw last year won't necessarily recur from a growth perspective in 2021.
korey marcello -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. just maybe a quick clarification. you mentioned on lat am, the margins. i know there's some margin headwinds there just from moving to more processing. but you mentioned they would move from about -- toward the mid- to high 30s. over what time frame was that? i was just trying to clarify that. thanks, guys.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
so look, at this point, right, and to give some more clarity on what we meant, today, we're seeing the revenue from santander, which as we've stated in the past, has some minimums and is one of the things we love about this contract. but obviously, as we start to drive more transactions to the platform and start to see more cost, to the extent that santander is still below those minimums, that will put some pressure on that margin. having said that, we've done some other wins here that are related to processing like mercado libre, like banamex, that over time will offset some of that pressure. but we would still expect to see that margin kind of come down a little bit to the kind of the mid- to high 30s. in terms of time frame, i don't know if we have a specific time frame that we can give you. we're definitely happy to see santander continuing to push transactions above their expectations. i think that's good for them. it's very good for us. but we'll continue to monitor how that impacts the margin.
korey marcello -- deutsche bank -- analyst
very clear. thank you very much.

the next question will come from vasu govil with kbw. please go ahead.
vasu govil -- kbw -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question and i also definitely want to extend my good wishes to kay. it's been great working with you. i guess my first question, as you think about like the impact that we've had from covid, do you think that we're kind of -- covid is kind of behind us and business has mostly normalized as you think about active merchants or sort of impact on tourism, the atm business? can you kind of help frame if we are still seeing some of the businesses being impacted or that's pretty much behind us at this point?
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
so i'll take a shot and then, joaquin, you -- i mean, vasu, there's definitely -- we're back to some level of normality. we do have a lot of tourists now in puerto rico. restaurants are open. but there's still a lot of places that are at lower capacity. restaurants are at lower capacity, movie theaters, cinema. so we haven't gone back to 100% of where we were. so i would say there's still opportunity for the economy to continue to be stimulated. and there's also still a lot of money to come in from the hurricane relief that has yet to come in. that being said, we don't know what the future holds as far as new variants, anything like that. and i think no one can predict those things. but we are definitely back to a much more closer state of normality. but even schools, i mean, my son is still doing school from home. so we're much closer to being back to normality, but there's still a little bit of a way to go.
vasu govil -- kbw -- analyst
got it. and just, i guess, a follow-up on that, mac, as you think about the macro environment, to your point, the stimulus funding and now the financial aid coming into puerto rico, i think the outlook probably looks a lot better than it has in the past. so is that giving you more confidence to be able to have a longer-term view of what the growth profile of the business could look like? because i know historically, there's just been too much uncertainty on the macro front.
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. so i think it gives us more certainty to puerto rico. i don't know that we will give long-term guidance. i think we will continue to give annual guidance. but i do think the relief money you've seen come in from covid, the relief money you've seen come in from the hurricane, which is just beginning and then if we see more infrastructure spending from the new administration, that's definitely going to benefit puerto rico and benefit us, on top of the fact we're still 50% cash, right? so i think you've got some pretty good dimensions of how puerto rico will operate over the next couple of years. but i don't think that we'll give long-term guidance.
vasu govil -- kbw -- analyst
understood. and just one last one, if i may. just on the m&a environment, if you could talk a little bit about what the m&a pipeline looks like, what kind of assets you're looking at. and congratulations to diego and phil for their new roles, but if you could expand a little bit on what -- where you expect phil to focus on, etc.
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. so i mean, first, we are excited about adding diego to the team. i mean he's had a senior leadership job at prisma mexico. he was one of the top guy at prisma, and then he was the chief executive officer of a real-time payments company in argentina that was owned by the local banks. and he also worked at mastercard. he's moving to puerto rico, and he's -- of course, he's fluent in spanish. so we think he'll be a great addition to the team. phil is actually going to work and help me and the team on strategy and also customer excellence to make sure that we're measuring customer excellence well, making sure that we're measuring the velocity of our product adoption and then helping us continue to map out our plans for further growth. when you're asking about m&a, i mean, it continues to be something we're very focused on. the deals have not -- the type of deals we see have not dramatically changed. and what we've seen since i've been here, it's -- the valuations have probably gone up a little bit and people's expectations just given where in the world it is and where sort of the technology space is, but it still is important to us. and it's a significant reason, the assets that we've purchased, like placetopay, is one of the reasons we're winning business. and then paygroup is the sole reason we won santander chile and mercado libre as well. so we've been pleased with those.
vasu govil -- kbw -- analyst
great. that's how great [indecipherable]. thank you very much.
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director

kay, let me echo the congratulations. this is a great way to go out. good numbers here. mac, my first question is for you. in your prepared remarks, mac, you had mentioned, i thought the -- it was either the number of cards or transactions or accounts on file. you had some operating metric relative to santander chile. you were going kind of quick there though. could you say that part again?
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
sure. so -- and typically, we don't give this level of detail out for customers, but they've publicly given it out in their market. so this is publicly available information. they have -- their target for the year was 20,000 merchants. within a month or two of rolling out the product, they already have 10,000 merchants. so they're incredibly happy with the pace of the -- of their sales efforts. so that was the statistic we gave. then i also gave a statistic of 1,800 merchants we now have up on placetopay, which is our e-commerce gateway. that was originally in colombia and ecuador, and now we've rolled it out panama, in costa rica, and we're looking to localize it in puerto rico as well.
jamie friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
great. that sounds really positive. joaquin, you had mentioned a shareholder agreement with bpop that you're going to file, i guess, soon or you already did. what i don't -- i'm embarrassed to say, i don't remember that in the past. it might just be me. or is that something that is actually incremental?
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
no, jamie. so let me give you a little bit of context. so within our shareholder agreement, we are obligated to file this registration statement as a consequence of being a well-known seasoned issuer. if you look back a couple of weeks, we filed a 10-k/a, where we actually checked the box as a well-known seasoned issuer. and this filing is in accordance to the shareholder agreement requirement because of being a well-known seasoned issuer. but to be clear, we're not aware of any intent by the bank to sell shares or anything at this point.
jamie friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
is that something that you do every year? or is that different?
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
no. so i mean the shareholder agreement has several registration rights that are available to the bank. in this case, this is an automatic type of requirement that comes in when you are a well-known seasoned issuer. and given that we are a well-known seasoned issuer, we are obviously going to comply with the shareholder agreement and file the registration statement.
kay sharpton -- vice president of investor relations
jamie, it's a three-year filing, by the way.
jamie friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
oh, ok. so like, if i look back three years ago, i would have seen something similar, kay?
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
no, no, no. so to be clear...
kay sharpton -- vice president of investor relations
no.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
jamie, this is the first time we're filing it. the 10-k/a is the first time that we have checked the box as a well-known seasoned issuer. and because -- again, because we are a well-known seasoned issuer, the shareholder agreement has a requirement of an automatic registration statement because of that. and so this is the first time that we are kind of doing this automatic registration.
jamie friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
okay. all right, i'll drop back in the queue.. really good numbers. congratulations.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
thanks, jamie.

the next question will come from john davis with raymond james. please go ahead.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks, good afternoon guys. and kay, i'll add my congratulations. no more earnings season. must be nice. so mac, maybe i'll just start, piggyback off of one of the earlier questions about m&a. but more from a leverage perspective, i think the balance sheet is in the best shape you guys have had it as a public company. and as you continue to grow, that leverage will still go down. so how do you think about normalized leverage? obviously, you want to keep some dry powder for m&a, but there was a reason to keep the balance sheet levered on a few times. just kind of thoughts on where you are about this business on a normalized basis.
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. so i mean going into the pandemic, i think like everyone, we were very, very conservative about making sure we understood how the change in the business environment was going to impact our business. as you saw, we bought stock in the quarter, which had been a while since we have done that. and so we are very focused on capital allocation. we know that we have sort of the powder to do additional things, whether it's buy back stock, whether to do m&a. and so we see that as a great position to be in. but like i said earlier, we are looking at m&a. we do have the repurchase program. so we will continue to figure out what's the best use of capital.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. and just remind us how much is left on that now, on the buyback?
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
about $86 million.
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
$86 million.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
yes. we -- in late december, john, we approved $100 million through the end of 2023. we purchased about $14 million in the first quarter. so we have about $86 million still to go.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. great. and then, mac, i didn't know you guys have been giving some periodic ath movil updates. just curious where that stands today, whether it's users, transactions. i think you had some comments in the deck that it remains strong. but just curious if there are any stats out there that you'd give us from a user base for transactions. have you seen that tail off at all now that we're starting to reopen? or does that remain strong?
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. we don't have any statistics for the call today. we did say that ath movil and ath movil business had 160% revenue growth, right? so pretty strong growth for the quarter. and that is all -- or mostly new business, right? so those are new transactions. but then also on top of that, as we've talked about, ath movil is capturing new transaction types, person-to-person, small businesses that didn't accept cards like food trucks. but it is also helping us strengthen our relationship with our existing merchants because you can now use it in the biggest supermarkets, the fast food chains. where typically, we would have had this on a piece of plastic, now we're getting those on the qr codes. and so we now have 4,000 merchants out, which is about 13% of our merchant base is now accepting the ath movil qr code. so significant growth on both fronts. those that are actually driving incremental revenue and those that are actually driving sort of increased brand awareness and increased stickiness with our merchants.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. great. and then i do want to follow up, you mentioned earlier that the -- you're finally just four years later, 3.5 years later, starting to see some of the hurricane relief money hit the island. just curious, i think it's $8.2 billion of hud. how should we think about that? or what's your best guess of how that flows through? i know it's probably a little bit fuzzy, to say the least, at this point. and then remind us what else is out there. and then maybe just a bigger picture, how do you guys see the new administration from a puerto rico standpoint? there's some things that are -- do you see positively for the island with the biden white house? just curious if there are any bigger-picture thoughts on the new white house.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
hey, john, so this is joaquin. i mean, look, the $8.2 billion, to be clear, it's -- this is positive. and -- but what's happening is that a lot of the kind of strings that were attached to a lot of these funds are now getting streamlined. the obstacles to approval are also getting removed. so the path to actually getting these through to impact the economy is a little bit clear. but there is still a process in place, right? i mean this $8.2 billion -- and there's been a lot of kind of articles around it. it still needs to go through a process of bidding and awarding contracts. so look, i think, and we've said in the past, unfortunately, this is a story that has come all the way from after the hurricane. we're encouraged by the fact that this is going on, and we feel that we're going to see this now start to hit the economy, but there's still somewhat of a lag between now and when we actually see that hit. in terms of what else is there, i mean, this is -- the $8.2 billion is related to hud. there are still other agencies that are in kind of the same process of distributing funds. and look, the local government has been very proactive in how they're working with the federal government. i think the federal government has been saying the right things and with the actions on this $8.2 billion are doing some of the right things that we want to see. but now we need to see some execution also from the puerto rico government to actually get their hands on this funding and move quickly to actually impact the economy.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. and then, mac, any bigger picture on what the new white house means for puerto rico more broadly, if anything?
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
i mean, look, i would know probably not a lot better than you guys. but by reading what you read in the press and the plans, i think, that this administration has, i mean they seem to be pro-social programs, which, by the way, we have a lot of in puerto rico. so continuing to support those. we're looking at new programs could be positive. i think to joaquin's point, the ability to access the hurricane funds, it seems like that this administration may help us do that more quickly. but i mean, that's sort of speculation. but i do think that this administration, from a big picture, could benefit our business.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. all right, thanks guys.
operator
the next question will come from james faucette with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, thank you very much. like everybody else, just extend my thanks and best wishes to kay as she moves on. and thanks for all your input and time over the years. i wanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions. first, you highlighted that tourism is coming back, but there's still some more to go there. but also like normal day-to-day life is also returning. any characterization you could give us of like how much tourism has recovered? are we back to kind of 70% to 80% of the -- what you would suspect is tourist-related spend? or just any metrics around that versus day-to-day? just trying to gauge where you guys are seeing benefit right now.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer
sure, james. look, we can actually point you to some websites after this that can help kind of clear up some of the numbers. but the inbound flights have definitely come back. when we compare against the prior year, we're still definitely below what a normal kind of month or period looks like for puerto rico in terms of inbound travel pre-pandemic, but flights and tourism is definitely on the rise. when we look at hotel and occupancy, some of the numbers have a lag, but the expectation i think is that those are between 60% to 70% of where they were pre-pandemic, which compared to where we were during lockdown, which went down to almost 90% of what usually is, right? it's been an improvement. so look, they're still in puerto rico, unfortunately, some rises in cases. and the government continues to look for different ways in which to mitigate these rises, including putting some restrictions in inbound travel now very recently. that could have an effect on these trends that we've been seeing the past few weeks. so again, something that we need to monitor. and as mac said before, we don't have real control over variants or how the cases continue to move, but certainly encouraging to see those numbers start to improve.
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
and james, think about it, i mean some of the core sectors like supermarket, fast food, those were pretty resilient during the entire pandemic, right? people had to still put food on their tables. but people going back to the office, consuming fuel, so that -- our spending in certain categories as people reactivate, get back to work, go back to restaurants. so that supply chain improves. that's where we're slowly -- i mean it's not back to 100%. like i said, even the schools are -- not all the schools are back. and tourism, as an aside, isn't a huge piece of our business or even the puerto rican economy. but that was sort of my example of things are coming back, but there's still a bit of a way to go. but...
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. got it. that's really helpful, guys. and then mac, just following up on your m&a commentary, you said that there are a few things that you're looking at, but also acknowledge that kind of prices or valuations and expectations there, maybe, have risen. i guess kind of the last thing to finish out the equation, at least in my mind, is how has your willingness to pay up or pay for acquisitions changed at all? i mean, has that risen along with what people are asking for? or do you still think there are deals that should and could be had? just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about that final piece, which is your thought process.
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
yes. so look, i mean we've bought several things since i've been here. and some have been at very low multiples, some have been at higher multiples given for that state of time. so we still look at opportunities frequently. and so we definitely wouldn't overpay for any asset, but i mean we still are constantly looking. and most of the stuff we've bought is small. we've been able to tuck it in, integrate it into our business and then grow organically well. in some of these countries, james, the things that may be for sale are the monopolies or the duopolies. and some of those may have fundamental problems because they may lose customers over time. so it's -- we continue to look at m&a. we have the balance sheet to buy something if we find it attractive, and we'll continue to try and make the right decisions.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. well, thanks to all of you once again.
morgan m. schuessler -- president, chief executive officer & director
thanks.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer

good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to evertec's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
at this time, i would like to turn the call over to william maina of investor relations. please go ahead.
william maina -- investor relations
thank you, and good afternoon. with me today are mac schuessler, our president and chief executive officer; and joaquin castrillo, our chief financial officer. before we begin, i'd like to remind everyone that this call may contain forward-looking statements and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and the company's most recent periodic sec report.
during today's call, management will provide certain information that will constitute non-gaap financial measures under sec rules such as adjusted ebitda, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share. reconciliations to gaap measures and certain additional information are also included in today's earnings release and related supplemental slides, which are available in the investor relations section of our company website at www.evertecinc.com.
i will now hand the call over to mac.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer & director
thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2021 earnings call. we delivered another strong quarter of financial results as we continue to benefit from increased transactions in puerto rico versus last year's volumes, which were impacted by the pandemic. in latin america, we continue to benefit from recent implementations as well as effective management of our operating expenses. based on our q2 results and the momentum we see heading into the second half of the year, we are again increasing our guidance for 2021. joaquin will provide further details later in the call.
beginning on slide four, our total revenue was $149 million for the second quarter, an increase of 26% compared to q2 of 2020. adjusted ebitda was $80 million, an increase of 60% as compared to the prior year. our margin for the second quarter was approximately 54%, over 1,000 basis points higher than last year, reflecting the scalability of our business. our adjusted earnings per share was $0.78, an increase of 105%. we continued to generate significant operating cash flow during the quarter of $112 million, and we returned approximately $32 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. additionally, our liquidity remained strong at $319 million as of june 30.
moving on to our update for puerto rico on slide five. we saw strong volume and revenue growth in q2, driven by the incremental inflow of federal stimulus funds and increased consumer spend versus last year. which was significantly impacted by the covid-19 lockdown. merchant acquiring sales volume growth was approximately 63% year-over-year, reflecting transaction growth of approximately 68%. most of this growth was driven by the months of april and may, which experienced sales volume increases of approximately 118% and 69% year-over-year, respectively. our results in puerto rico also benefited from continued strong growth in ath movil products, which delivered approximately 60% year-over-year revenue growth. i'm also pleased to report that our previously announced large printing contract, which we signed in the first quarter, is fully implemented and in production. as a reminder, this is one of the largest printing contract in evertec's history and is anticipated to benefit our business solutions segment in the back half of 2021.
turning to the operating environment in puerto rico. as i mentioned, and as you can see in our results, the combination of the reopening of the island and the incremental federal stimulus funds continue to positively impact our results. vaccinations continue to increase, and with over 60% of the population fully vaccinated, the puerto rico government further reduced restrictions in early july and the economy is mostly open today. we do continue to monitor the effects of the delta variant, which as has been the case in other places, has resulted in an increased number of positive cases over the past few weeks.
now turning to latin america on slide six. as i mentioned in our last call, we continue to see varying levels of covid-19 restrictions, vaccination levels and reopenings from country to country. for example, vaccine distributions began in late february in brazil, colombia, chile and mexico. however, infection rates still remain relatively high in these countries, so we remain cautious with respect to our outlook for recovery throughout the region. nevertheless, we are pleased to have delivered another quarter of strong double-digit revenue growth in latin america. our performance continues to be driven primarily by the implementation and go-live of the major wins and expanded relationships we discussed throughout last year, including banco popular of costa rica, mercado libre in mexico and santander chile, as well as our regional expansion of placetopay.
in summary, we delivered strong second quarter results, and we are again raising our 2021 outlook. while we will continue to monitor the impacts of covid-19 across our geographic footprint and remain cautious in certain countries, underlying demand for our solutions is robust, and we continue to execute well against our growth plan. our cash flow generation and balance sheet remain very strong, enabling us to continue executing on our capital deployment strategy.
i will now hand the call over to joaquin to review our results and guidance in more detail.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
thank you, mac, and good afternoon, everyone. turning to slide eight, you will see the consolidated second quarter results for evertec. total revenue for the second quarter was $149.1 million, up approximately 26% compared to the prior year's covid-impacted results of $117.9 million. as mac mentioned, our q2 results reflect increased transaction volumes in puerto rico, mainly impacted by the influx of federal stimulus and by improved consumer demand, as well as double-digit growth in lat am driven by our recent new business implementations and expanded relationships.
adjusted ebitda for the quarter was $80.3 million, an increase of 60% from $50.2 million in the prior year. adjusted ebitda margin was 53.8%, and this represents an increase compared to the prior year of over 1,000 basis points. this expansion in our margin primarily reflects the higher payment revenue in both puerto rico and latin america, the favorable impact of foreign currency and the benefit of dividends received from our investments held under the equity method.
adjusted net income for the quarter was $57.1 million, an increase of 106% as compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting the higher adjusted ebitda and lower cash interest expense. this was partially offset by increased operating depreciation and amortization, driven by capital expenditures in the prior year as well as key projects that have gone into production. our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 11.7%, while the prior-year tax rate was impacted by the cov19 lockdown, shifting our revenue mix toward higher tax business. adjusted eps was $0.78 for the quarter, an increase of 105% compared to the prior year.
moving on to slide nine, i'll now cover our segment results, starting with merchant acquiring. in the second quarter, merchant acquiring net revenue increased 55% year-over-year to $38.3 million, driven primarily by increased sales volume, reflecting stronger consumer demand and a significant impact that covid-related federal stimulus had on overall sales. sales volumes in the quarter increased approximately 63% and transactions increased approximately 68% year-over-year. on a month-to-month basis, sales volumes were up 118% in april and approximately 69% in may, reflecting the severe impact of covid-19 lockdowns in the same months last year. sales volume growth slowed to approximately 27% in june as the initial shock of the pandemic during the prior year began to subside and we saw consumer demand improve toward the end of the second quarter in the prior year.
our results also benefited from incremental ebt funds that began in march of this year and extended through the second quarter. partially offsetting our revenue growth in q2 was reduced spread, primarily due to a lower average ticket as well as a change in card mix from debit to credit as the mix between products also moved toward normalization. we expect average tickets will continue to decrease as these move toward more normalized levels in the second half of this year. adjusted ebitda for the segment was $20.5 million, up 54%, driven by higher revenues in the quarter. adjusted ebitda margin was 53.6%, a decrease of approximately 40 basis points as compared to last year, primarily driven by a higher number of transactions processed as a result of a lower average ticket.
on slide 10, you will see the results for the payment services, puerto rico and the caribbean segment. revenue for this segment in the second quarter was $38.6 million, up approximately 41%, driven by increased transactions across pos, atm and ath movil compared to last year's covid-impacted results and also positively impacted by covid-related federal stimulus flowing through the puerto rico economy. consistent with the merchant acquiring segment, payment services transaction growth was highest in april, and then moderated in may and again in june. ath movil and ath movil business transactions contributed an incremental $1.7 million of revenue in the second quarter. additionally, the segment benefited from increased intersegment revenue for transaction processing and risk monitoring services for latin america.
adjusted ebitda for the segment was $23.6 million, up 78% as compared to last year. adjusted ebitda margin was 61.2%, up over 1,200 basis points as compared to last year. the significant increase in our margin was primarily due to higher revenue and scalability of this segment compared to last year's pandemic-impacted results in a segment with a high percentage of fixed cost. on slide 11, you will see the results for our payment services, latin america segment.
revenue for the segment in the second quarter was $25.8 million, up approximately 30% as compared to last year. as mac mentioned, this increase was driven by the new business implementations and expanded relationships such as banco popular in costa rica, mercado libre in mexico and santander chile as well as increased revenue from placetopay. adjusted ebitda for the segment was $11 million, and adjusted ebitda margin was 42.5%, up approximately 1,200 basis points as compared to last year. driven by higher revenue and the benefit of balance sheet remeasurement in nonfunctional currencies of approximately $1.5 million. as a reminder, our latin america segment margin is currently benefiting from established minimums in the santander contract with low transaction levels. we would expect margins to move toward mid- to high 30s as transactions continue to increase over time.
on slide 12, you'll find the results for the business solutions segment. business solutions revenue for the second quarter was up approximately 9% to $60.7 million. the revenue increase in the quarter benefited from incremental volumes on core banking services provided to popular, growth from services that started in the second half of last year and growth of our new printing contract, which mac referenced earlier. for the quarter, adjusted ebitda was $30.6 million, an increase of 27%; and adjusted ebitda margin was 50.5%, up approximately 720 basis points as compared to last year. the adjusted ebitda margin improvement was primarily driven by the revenue growth as well as lower operating expenses, primarily a decrease in cost of sales, coupled with lower employee expenses as the prior year included special payments for employees working on site during the pandemic lockdown. moving on to slide 13, you will see a summary of corporate and other. our second quarter adjusted ebitda was a negative $5.5 million, a decrease of 16% compared to prior year. adjusted ebitda as a percentage of total revenue was 3.7% and lower than prior year by approximately 190 basis points, primarily due to the higher revenues and cost controls.
moving on to our cash flow overview on slide 14. our beginning cash balance was approximately $221 million, including restricted cash of approximately $18 million. net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $112 million, a nearly $25 million increase compared to prior year. capital expenditures were approximately $30 million, in part, driven by higher obsolescence spend as we accelerate some projects as well as continuous focus on innovation. regarding capital expenditures, for the full year, we now anticipate approximately $60 million of capex, up from our prior guidance of $50 million to $55 million. we also recorded approximately $15 million for the extension and expansion of our relationship with firstbank during the first quarter and debt securities purchased in the prior quarter of $3 million. we paid approximately $25 million in long-term debt payments, $9 million in withholding taxes on share-based compensation and $2 million of other debt paydowns, which resulted in a total net debt decrease of approximately $35 million. we paid cash dividends of approximately $7 million and repurchased approximately $24 million of common stock, for a total of approximately $32 million returned to our shareholders. we have approximately $76 million available for future use under the company's share repurchase program.
our ending cash balance as of june 30 was $219 million, and this included approximately $19 million of restricted cash. additionally, we recently announced another $0.05 dividend to be paid on september 3, 2021, to shareholders of record as of august 2, 2021. moving to slide 15, you will find a summary of our debt as of june 30, 2021. our quarter ending net debt position was approximately $276 million, comprised of approximately $200 million of unrestricted cash and approximately $476 million of total short-term borrowings and long-term debt. our weighted average interest rate was 4.5%. our net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted ebitda was approximately 1.47 times. as of june 30, total liquidity was approximately $319 million. this balance excludes restricted cash and includes the available borrowing capacity under our revolver.
moving to slide 16, i will now provide you with an update on our 2021 outlook. given our q2 results and additional visibility, we now expect revenue to be in a range of $570 million to $579 million, representing growth of 12% to 13%. our adjusted earnings per share outlook of $2.56 to $2.66 represents a growth range of 24% to 28% as compared to the adjusted earnings per share in 2020 of $2.07. on a gaap basis, earnings per share is anticipated to be between $2.01 to $2.11.
our payment segments in puerto rico had a very strong first half of the year, driven mostly by the impact of covid-related federal simulates impacting consumers directly. we will continue benefiting from this tailwind in the second half, but do expect some moderation when compared to the first half as we begin to move away from when these funds were disbursed and as some of the recurring funds in these programs begin to end. as an example, ebt funds for certain programs ended in june, and funds expected in the second half of the year will be lower than those seen through june 30. and enhanced unemployment is expected to end in the third quarter. additionally, we continue to expect normalization of the average ticket as well as mix of cards, which will pressure our merchant spread. we continue to expect our lat am growth for the full year to be in the high teens. our business solutions segment should see some moderation in comparison to the first half and down in comparison to prior year as we had a significant onetime benefit from the department of education contract last year, and as some of the covid-related services provided to the government begin to subside.
we now believe adjusted ebitda margins will be in a range of 49% to 50%. we continue to expect some margin headwinds from the normalization of the average ticket and the high margin benefit of the department of education contract last year. we are also expecting incremental expenses in the second half of the year as the annual merit increase given to employees in july takes effect and as we execute on specific initiatives that will continue to improve our operations and products going forward. we continue to expect our full year tax rate to be in a range of 13% to 14%. our guidance also includes the benefit of the share repurchases we completed through q2.
in summary, we generated strong second quarter results, which led us to again raise our full year 2021 guidance. we're executing well against our growth plan on a track to deliver continued solid results in the second half of this year.
with that, operator, please open the line for questions.

bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
well, thank you. good afternoon. congratulations. really strong results.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer & director
thanks, bob.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
i guess, the tricky part is trying to figure out what's the change for the long term. the puerto rico, latin america has a lot of cash, and covid has -- i think it probably accelerated permanently the digital shift. is that -- do you have any feel for that? is -- i mean, is that able to -- are you able to parse that out of the numbers and what you think is like a permanent secular shift versus temporary led by stimulus programs and the like as we think about 2022, if you would?
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
what i would say, bob, we definitely see, obviously, the move toward the digital channel, and as we continue to report ath movil, ath movil business, specifically in puerto rico, we are seeing and we expect, as we've said in the past, some of that definitely stay. in terms of parsing it out, obviously, as things start to open up and you start to have, again, kind of people going into more restaurants, we are expecting to see some of that card present come back. but again, i don't know if we can parse that out specifically that we will right now for 2022.

i would add, bob, i mean, some of it is permanent. and if you noticed during the quarter, we did grow 60% in some of those channels, which is still incredibly healthy. it's much lower than -- i mean, it's lower than we saw in previous quarters when we were in lockdown mode or coming out of the lockdown. the 60% is still healthy. what i would say is some of the trends and more p2p transactions, more ath movil business transactions, the increased demand of placetopay our e-commerce gateway, that we're seeing increased demand in costa rica more than we saw prior to the pandemic. and that's a combination probably of a shift of spend and also that we have a better product that we've rolled out in some of these markets. some of this is a permanent shift, we believe, and a trajectory that will continue to be helpful to our business. but at this point, it's very difficult to parse that out, but some of this is definitely permanent.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
the large credit contract for business solutions, is that like a onetime revenue source? or is that an ongoing benefit? and can you quantify it?
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer & director
the printing contract, bob?
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
you said you had a very large credit, i think, contract.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer & director
yes. so it was actually a printing contract, bob.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
right. okay. printing contract.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer & director
yes. but it was -- i mean, it was meaningful to that segment, to that business in particular. it is not just a onetime deal. it's a longer-term contract. so it will have a positive effect into the future. it started during the quarter. so it's not fully annualized in our numbers. it will fully annualize next year. but it's not a onetime deal. it is an ongoing contract with a very large company in puerto rico to do their printing.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
okay. great. and then just what was the driver july transaction growth? and last question for me, how is chile doing?
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer & director
sure. so i will take chile. chile, again, we've been pleased with our progress. we said on the last call, they reached -- exceeded where they thought they would be at this point during the year by rolling out the product. to our knowledge, they were the first ones in the market rolling out a product that competes with transbank. we're in the process of localizing now the e-commerce gateway, placetopay. so that project is going very well and exceeding expectations. when it comes to the july numbers, i'll hand that to joaquin.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
in terms of the july numbers, bob, we're still going through and kind of cleaning the numbers, but there was some moderation sequentially from what we saw coming out of the month of june. so -- and that is something that, as we said in the prepared remarks, we kind of expect, right? i mean, we did see a very significant pickup here in q2, mainly driven by kind of the push of all the stimulus coming into puerto rico and kind of making that month of april, may really high bars. and what we're seeing as we kind of move a little bit away from when that was dispersed, the month of june, just on a sequential basis, was slightly lower than the month of may, and the month of july slightly lower than the month of june.
bob napoli -- william blair -- analyst
thank you. appreciate it.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer & director
thanks bob.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from jamie friedman with susquehanna.
jamie friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
hi. thank you. great results here, mac and joaquin. you had mentioned, joaquin, a dividend benefit.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
oh, yes.
jamie friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
yes. what's that about?
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
so we have an equity method investment, where we usually just kind of recognize the -- our portion of ownership of their net income. but this time around, they provided or they paid a dividend that, from our perspective, impacts positively our ebitda even though it's a cash --
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer & director
transaction.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
in the dominican republic with contado. so we own a stake in the dominican republic processing company, cardnet. and that's what we're referring to. we received the dividend this quarter, and that dividend is impacting positively the margin.
jamie friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
okay. did you -- i'm just trying to get the kind of normalized ebitda margin. did you quantify that? it's on page eight, right?
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
i can tell you. the normalized margin for the quarter is about 51%. if you exclude -- actually, if you exclude the contado dividend, and we usually also normalize for the foreign currency remeasurement.
jamie friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
got it. okay. and then, mac, is there any way to proportionalize meli, bpop and santander chile? and i didn't hear you mention citi this time. like, which of those is the most significant? or just generally, what stages are they, maybe is a better way to say it?
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer & director
so let me tell you. so to be clear, it's banco popular, costa rica. so it's not puerto rico. and so -- and the largest of those is centered near chile. each of them are meaningful to the segment. and reputationally, as you know, jamie, mercado libre is one of the most valuable companies in the region and the most sophisticated e-commerce company in the region. so reputationally, we think that they're all important. but santander chile is the largest.
jamie friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
okay. and any reason you didn't mention citi mexico?
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer & director
no. no reason in particular.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
yes, citi continues -- we continue to work on citi. i think the only difference there that i would kind of bring to your attention is meli have gone into production, and we are already kind of seeing some of the progress. citi's on our platform, that even though it's now in production, will grow as we start to kind of create more volume within that platform. so it's something that we're growing to something more meaningful over time as we start to drive more and more transactions.
jamie friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
got it. thank you. i'll drop back in the queue.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer & director
thanks jamie.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from vasu govil of kbw.
vasu govil -- kbw -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. congratulations on a strong quarter.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer & director
thank you.
vasu govil -- kbw -- analyst
i guess my first question, just on the second half guide, it seems like the -- despite the tough comps, you guys are expecting to grow through that. and it sounded like the delta versus your prior expectation is mostly better stimulus funding that sit in the hand of the consumers. is that kind of the biggest delta now versus before? or are you also seeing just better underlying macro trends with the federal stimulus moving in and things like that?
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
i mean, i think it's a bit of everything, right? definitely, stimulus is impacting many of the macro trends that we follow in puerto rico. so again, it's very hard to parse out how much of the stimulus will continue to have kind of a long-lasting effect. but for sure, i mean coming out of q2 and the amount of funds that have been received and what we're expecting will continue to be a tailwind, will be part of what we're expecting or what we now expect in the second half of the year or in the new kind of guidance that we provided. so it is an important part of that.
vasu govil -- kbw -- analyst
understood. and then just following up on the margins, even with the adjustments, delivered a strong-margin quarter, and you have some puts and takes in the back half. but as we think about margins longer term, i mean, i would think that you should continue to see an upward bias as revenues expand. i mean, can you frame for us how you think about annual margin expansion in the normalized environment?
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
look, we've been consistent in this in saying that as we grow our top line, we should be in a position to expand margin. having said that, we are growing very fast in latin america, where we are driving kind of a lower margin than what we have in some of the puerto rico segments.
in addition, just kind of thinking about the second half and some of the puts and takes. as we have some of the average ticket in our merchant acquiring portfolio and some of the slowdown in just the overall stimulus plus the change in product mix, that will put pressure on the overall yield per transaction. so that should get reflected on the overall margin. but in general, as we look forward, i mean, we do see this -- we're very margin-focused. and you can see the scalability of the business when we drive top line.
vasu govil -- kbw -- analyst
got it. and just a quick one for you, mac. just the m&a pipeline, what's that looking like? clearly, devaluation seem to be getting out of hand in this environment. so should we expect you guys to keep doing more buybacks? or just updated thoughts on m&a.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer & director
i would say our thesis hasn't changed. i mean you've seen some pretty high valuations in latin america with some of the more recent deals. but we do have opportunities that we're looking at, opportunities that we're excited about. so i would say we have a healthy pipeline on things that we are working through. and i would say it's not only -- i know this isn't part of your question, vasu, but it's not only on the m&a front, but organically well. so organic, we also have a pretty good pipeline. so it's something we're still focused on. we will try and have a balanced approach to capital allocation and continue to pull the other levers when and where we need to.
vasu govil -- kbw -- analyst
great. thank you for the color.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer & director
thank you vasu.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from james faucette with morgan stanley.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks very much. just wanted to follow up on vasu's questions, and particularly as you're thinking about how you're incorporating the stimulus and as that rolls off. and i'm wondering how you're taking into account things like -- or if you're seeing visitorship change to puerto rico? how you're anticipating that maybe coming back or having an impact? just looking at some of the other dynamics that can be at play, particularly for that market.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
sorry, james, did you mention visitors? you mean, tourists?
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes, tourism, etc, to puerto rico and what's happening and how that's impacting your outlook?
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
no, it does. i mean -- and that's part of what i mentioned in terms of product mix. we've been now, for a few quarters, kind of calling the attention of a higher spread in our merchant acquiring segment, driven by the average ticket, but also the product mix. in the past few quarters since the pandemic, we've seen a lot more debit and a lot more domestic transactions than we had in the past. so we're definitely, as we move forward, considering that those three main factors will start to look toward normalization. that's something that we've actually already seen. and in the case of domestic versus, let's say, international or cross-border transactions, that is almost back to pre-pandemic numbers. and the reason being, over the past quarter, travel to puerto rico has actually improved significantly. i believe it's only -- if we go base it on numbers, about 6% below 2019. and actually, the month of june, i believe it's one of the highest passenger month we've had since the airport went private, which was close to 10 years ago. so we are definitely seeing some of the tourism come back. and we are considering some of those kind of nuances that the change in -- just in the overall economy can have. having said that, remember that tourism for puerto rico is only about 5% to 8% of gdp. so it's not a huge number.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer & director
and i think what we're -- i mean i think what we're seeing, to some extent, is what the rest of the company -- country has seen, is the stimulus money. and as that rolls off, it's the economy getting reactivated. we are hopeful that with hurricane money coming in, potentially with the infrastructure bill coming through, that we'll continue to see some nice tailwinds for the remainder of the year going into next year. but again, it's hard to predict with delta variant, what will get and how quickly will funding come through puerto rico. but to joaquin's point, tourism is back in puerto rico, but it's not a significant part of the island's economy nor really our business per se either.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes. no, i appreciate that. i'm just trying to make sure that we have kind of all the pieces at least as complete as we can. on that -- on hurricane relief and the infrastructure bill, are there any areas that you're paying particularly close attention to in terms of sizes or projects and other things that will merit monitoring as to that impact depending on, obviously, how that whole process plays itself out politically? but are there specific projects or things that you're paying closer attention to?
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
look, i think the infrastructure bill is an important one just because of its sheer size. i would say that there are other projects that involve some of the, for example, medicare and social security parity for puerto ricans, which is something that we haven't considered because, again, it's something that has gone back and forth in congress a few times, that if it does go the way of puerto rico, it should be incremental federal funding on a recurring basis going into the future.
so i would say that that's an important one that we haven't necessarily discussed in the past, that's out there. and i would say, just the overall progress of the reconstruction funds continues to be something very important for us to track as well as the reconstruction of the electric grid, right? there were about $13 billion allocated toward just the revamp of the grid. and even though that is not something that we were expecting or expect to see kind of impact the economy in the next six months. it is something where luma has been selected, progress has been made. and hopefully, the government moves fast enough to start putting some of those funds into the economy next year.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's a really good color.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer & director
thanks james.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from john davis with raymond james.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
hey good afternoon guys. joaquin, maybe if you could just help us a little bit with the updated outlook. obviously, great to see the revenue raise by more than the 2q upside. but maybe by segment, i think you guys have laid out some kind of growth targets at the beginning of the year on what you're kind of modeling or assuming. clearly, those have been upgraded. but just curious, maybe if you can't get by segment exactly, like where the most upside is and how we should think about growth in the business segment?
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
so i mean, i think what we can do for purposes of doing by segment, john, is kind of give where we expect to be top line growth for the whole year, right? we don't give quarterly guidance, and i think we already have, obviously, the first half. but as it relates to merchant acquiring, i mean, our expectation is given, obviously, the range, we'll be kind of in the high-teens to low-20s in terms of where that segment will be. when we look at payment in puerto rico, we would expect that to be in the high-teens for the full year. lat am, we would also expect that to be high-teens, low-20s. and then in the business solutions segment, we expect that still to be kind of low single digits. i mean as we go into the second half in business solutions, we do have the headwind of the department of education contract, which was, again, about $4 million in q3, and that was pretty significant to both the top line and ebitda because of how we recognize it net of expenses. so it was a pretty good contribution to margin. and so at a high level, that's kind of the breakdown of the different segments.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. no, that's exactly what i was looking for. super helpful. and then maybe just around ath movil, just trends. curious how that's trended during the reopening. have you seen kind of continued growth and traction within ath movil? and i apologize if i missed it, and maybe any updated stats that you can give around that would be great.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer & director
yes. so that we mentioned in the early comments, about a 60% growth for the quarter. so we are still seeing -- and i think it alludes back to one of your colleague's questions, i think, bob. i mean, we are continuing to see very healthy growth in that product line. it's not what it was two or three quarters ago, but we do think that's a permanent trend where people will continue to use ath movil, and they will continue to use it for more transaction types. but it's not what it was the last couple of quarters, but 60% is pretty healthy given that we sort of have come out of the lockdown.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. great. and then, mac, maybe a bigger picture, more philosophical question for you. leverage is now 1.5 turns, headed toward one probably by the end of the year, given the significant growth that you guys are achieving this year. i assume you're not going to let leverage just continue to go lower. and i understand m&a valuations are somewhat stretched. so if i go back pre-hurricane, you had $0.10 dividend. i believe now it's $0.05 a quarter. how do you think about dividends versus buybacks? is special dividend something you guys would consider? just curious on capital return for shareholders, how you guys think about it.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer & director
yes. so our number one priority is growth, and we do -- and we think that's through investing in our business organically and then m&a. so that will continue to be our focus. i think the balance sheet, we're in a great position to continue to invest in those areas. and we do know that m&a remains important for us. so that will be our top priority, is to continue to grow the company, because we think we're building a unique franchise in latin america. that is unusual and is creating value long term for shareholders. we do look at buybacks and we do look at dividends. i wouldn't parse those out on this call as to which we would move on in any certain direction, but our focus is growth.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
well great. thanks guys.
morgan m. schuessler -- president and chief executive officer & director
thank you.
operator
thank you. and that does conclude the question-and-answer session. i would like to return the floor to management for any closing comments.

operator
good afternoon, and welcome to the evertec third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to kevin hunt of investor relations. please go ahead.
kevin hunt -- investor relations
thank you, and good afternoon. with me today are mac schuessler, our president and chief executive officer; and joaquin castrillo, our chief financial officer.
before we begin, i'd like to remind everyone this call may contain forward-looking statements and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and the company's most recent periodic sec report. during today's call, management will provide certain information that will constitute non-gaap financial measures under sec rules, such as adjusted ebitda, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share. reconciliations to gaap measures and certain additional information are also included in today's earnings release and related supplemental slides, which are available in the investor relations section of our company website at www.evertecinc.com.
i'll now hand the call over to mac.
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2021 earnings call. we are pleased to announce another strong quarter of financial results as we continue to benefit from strong sales volumes across our markets. in puerto rico, the continued effect from federal funds, increased digital usage and return to some pre-covid seasonality drove strong transaction volumes. in latin america, we are seeing strong growth, driven by both recent implementations as well as organic growth from existing clients.
beginning on slide 4, our total revenue for the third quarter was $146 million, an increase of approximately 7% compared to the third quarter of 2020. adjusted ebitda was $70 million, roughly the same as the prior year. and our adjusted earnings per share was $0.62, a decrease of 5% year-over-year, in line with our expectations, despite a higher than expected adjusted effective tax rate. we generated significant year-to-date operating cash flow of $176 million and we returned approximately $35 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. our liquidity remains strong at $363 million as of september 30th.
moving on to our update for puerto rico on slide 5. we saw continued strong volume and revenue growth in the third quarter. the ongoing effect from the inflow of federal stimulus and ebitda funds earlier in the year was a major driver of growth as well as a pick up and back-to-school spending in august, a sign that we are returning to pre-covid spending patterns. merchant acquiring sales volume growth was approximately 23% year-over-year. and average ticket is coming down on a year-over-year basis, but remains above pre-pandemic levels. we remain pleased with the growth of ath movil, which was up 24% for the quarter as we continue to see a shift in preference to digital payment methods.
turning to the operating environment in puerto rico. vaccination rates continue to increase with over 70% of the population now fully vaccinated, the highest level of any u.s. state or territory as reported by the cdc. hospitalization rates are down over 80% from delta variant peaks back in august and this is moving us closer to a more normal environment with the government continuing to loosen restrictions. the third quarter also had the highest hotel occupancy rates since the beginning of the pandemic and we saw the first cruise ship docked in puerto rico since march of 2020.
now, turning to latin america on slide 6. we continue to see strong double-digit growth in latin america as we are still benefiting from recent implementations as well as organic growth from existing clients in several countries. we are pleased to announce our recent contract with caja popular mexicana for issuing, a deal that we have been working on for some time and then just recently received regulatory approval. cpm is the largest savings and loan cooperative in mexico with 479 branches and over 3 million members representing about 35% market share. they have been focused on increasing non-traditional payment methods in mexico, including atm, point of sale terminals and digital payments, to that end, recently launched several credit card products, which they will be rolling out to their members using our issuing platform hey studio.
our santander relationship in chile continues to progress ahead of our expectations. when the bank launches pos business back in march, they've set a goal of bringing 20,000 customers on board by the end of 2021. there are already about 37,000 customers and have set a new goal of reaching 50,000 by year-end. we have also successfully localized our gateway placetopay in chile. these are good examples of the kinds of growth opportunities that exist when previously closed markets open up competition. while vaccination rates and reopenings continue to vary country to country, we have seen encouraging progress in chile and uruguay and expect to continue to see a decrease in cases across the region as vaccines become widely available.
turning to our people, over 95% of evertec employees at our puerto rico headquarters have been now vaccinated and we reopened our puerto rico offices on a hybrid model on october 12th. we expect offices in other regions will follow in the coming months based on the conditions in each country. we remain committed to our scholarship program in puerto rico and across latin america. now, it is 7th year we awarded 107 scholarships to students across puerto rico and latin america, an increase of 10% from the prior year. we were once again able to maintain a 50-50 gender ratio, providing equal opportunities for both men and women. we are proud to awarded over $870,000 in scholarships over the past seven years and look forward to continuing to support and education for stem careers in both puerto rico and latin america.
in summary, we delivered strong third quarter results. we are once again raising our 2021 outlook with a higher expected revenue range and an eps range that is nearing to the upper end of our prior expectations, while we will certainly monitor the impacts of the different covid 19 variance across our markets and remain cautious in certain countries. at this point, we have a positive view toward the future.
i will now hand the call over to joaquin to review our results and guidance in more detail.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
thank you, mac, and good afternoon, everyone. turning to slide 8, you will see the consolidated third quarter results for evertec. total revenue for the third quarter was $145.9 million, up approximately 7% compared to the prior year. as mac mentioned, our q3 results reflect increased transaction volumes in puerto rico, mainly impacted by the inflow of covid-related federal stimulus earlier in the year and double-digit growth in latam as we continue to see more transactions from our recent business implementations and organic growth from existing clients.
adjusted ebitda for the quarter was $69.8 million, down slightly from the $70 million reported in the prior year. adjusted ebitda margin was 47.8%, down 350 basis points from a year ago. the decline in margin reflects the year-over-year comparison against the one-time department of education contract and a $2 million benefit from non-operating income due to foreign currency gains related to balance sheet remeasurement, both of which positively impacted last year's margin. adjusted net income for the quarter was $45 million, a decrease of 5% as compared to the prior year. the decline in adjusted net income was primarily due to higher operating depreciation and amortization and a higher adjusted effective tax rate. this was partially offset by lower cash interest expense. our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 16.9%, reflecting a discrete foreign tax impact this quarter. we now expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 14%. adjusted eps was $0.62 for the quarter, a decrease of 5% compared to the prior year.
moving on to slide 9, i'll now cover our segment results, starting with merchant acquiring. in the third quarter, merchant acquiring net revenue increased approximately 23% year-over-year to $37.6 million, driven by both higher sales volume and revenue generated from the expanded relationship with firstbank at the beginning of the year. sales volume in the quarter increased approximately 22% year-over-year and with a strong month of august as we noted a return to more normal back to school activity versus covid lockdowns a year ago. the inflow of both pandemic-related federal funds and ebt funds remain growth drivers in the quarter with enhanced unemployment benefits ended in the month of september.
partially offsetting our revenue growth in q3 was a reduced spread primarily due to a lower average ticket and a more normalized product mix between credit and debit and local versus international transactions. average ticket although down year-over-year continues to be above pre-pandemic levels and we continue to expect a gradual decrease going forward as consumption patterns normalize. adjusted ebitda for the segment was $19.2 million, up approximately 21% driven by the higher revenues in the quarter. adjusted ebitda margin was approximately 51%, a decrease of approximately 70 basis points as compared to last year as the revenue upside was offset by increased operating expenses mainly due to the higher volume of transactions processed.
turning to slide 10, you will see the results for the payment services puerto rico and the caribbean segment. revenue for the segment in the third quarter was $38.8 million, up approximately 16% driven by increased transactional revenue from our ath network and processing business and ath movil. pos transactions increased approximately 16% year-over-year and ath movil revenues increased approximately 24% when compared to prior year as we continue to see the adoption of the yield channels.
during the quarter, we also saw increased revenues of $2.2 million as a result of more services being provided to the latam segment in support of the newly implemented platforms. we expected intercompany revenues to gradually increase as transactions in latin america increased. adjusted ebitda for the segment was $21.8 million, up approximately 18% as compared to last year. and adjusted ebitda margin was approximately 56%, an increase of approximately 70 basis points. the margin increase was primarily due to the strong revenue growth, partially offset by an increase in technology services.
on slide 11, you will see the results for our payment services latin america segment. revenue for the segment in the third quarter was $26.8 million, up approximately 26% as compared to last year. this increase was driven by recent business implementations and expanded relationships we have highlighted in the past, like some santander chile, as mac discussed. we also saw strong organic growth from existing customers, mostly in costa rica and panama as well as strong growth from our payment gateway placetopay as we got you to localize in more of our existing countries. adjusted ebitda for the segment was $10 million, up 5% year-over-year, while adjusted ebitda margin was 37.3%, down 760 basis points as compared to last year. the decrease in margin was mainly driven by the favorable impact in the prior year of the remeasurement of assets and liabilities denominated in u.s. dollars.
on slide 12, you will find the results for the business solutions segment. business solutions revenue for the third quarter was down approximately 8% to $58.1 million. most of this decline is due to the benefit to prior year from the one time department of education contract, which contributed approximately $4.4 million as well as a decrease in cash and item processing revenue. for the quarter, adjusted ebitda was $26 million, a decrease of approximately 21% and adjusted ebitda margin was 44.8%, a decline of approximately 760 basis points as compared to last year. the adjusted ebitda margin decline was due primarily to the department of education contract, which was a significant contribution to margin prior year.
moving on to slide 13, you will see a summary of corporate and other. our third quarter adjusted ebitda was a negative $7.3 million, 6% higher than the prior year. adjusted ebitda as a percentage of total revenue was 5%, the same as prior year.
moving on to our cash flow overview on slide 14. our beginning cash balance was approximately $221 million, including restricted cash of approximately $18 million. for the nine-month period, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $176 million, a nearly $55 million increase compared to prior year. capital expenditures were approximately $43 million, driven by higher hardware obsolescence spend as well as our continuous focus on innovation through internally developed software. we continue to expect approximately $60 million of capex for the full year.
we also recorded approximately $15 million for the extension and expansion of our relationship with firstbank and purchase approximately $3 million in debt securities both during the first quarter. we've paid approximately $28 million in long-term debt payments, $9 million in withholding taxes on share-based compensation and $2 million of other debt pay downs, which resulted in a total net debt decrease of approximately $39 million. year-to-date, we have paid cash dividends of approximately $11 million and repurchased approximately $24 million of common stock for a total of approximately $35 million returned to our shareholders. we have approximately $76 million available for future use under the company's share repurchase programs. our ending cash balance as of september 30 was $263 million and this included approximately $19 million of restricted cash. additionally, we recently announced another $0.05 dividend to be paid on december 3, 2021 to shareholders of record as of november 1, 2021.
moving to slide 15, you will find a summary of our debt as of september 30, 2021. our quarter ending net debt position was approximately $228 million, reflecting approximately $472 million of total short-term borrowings and long-term debt and approximately $244 million of unrestricted cash. our weighted average interest rate was 4.5%. our net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted ebitda was approximately 1.46 times. as of september 30 total liquidity was approximately $363 million. this balance excludes restricted cash and includes the available borrowing capacity under our revolver.
moving to slide 16, i will now provide an update on our 2021 guidance adjusted primarily due to our q3 results. we now expect revenue to be in a range of $574 million to $583 million, representing growth of 12% to 14% over last year and compared to $570 million to $579 million previously estimated. regarding the overall margin, we continue to anticipate that our adjusted ebitda margin will be between 49% and 50% for the full year. we expect incremental expenses through the remainder of the year as we continue executing on specific initiatives around product and operational improvements as well as other investments around innovation. our adjusted earnings per common share outlook have been increased on the lower-end to $2.61 to $2.66 or a growth range of 26% to 28% as compared to the adjusted earnings per share of $2.07 in 2020.
now, turning to 2022, while we're not prepared to give guidance, i would like to comment on a few items that are notable. first, the level of federal fund inflow into puerto rico during 2021 of our result of the pandemic was significant and provided an important accelerator for our merchant acquiring and payment processing puerto rico segments, which will then be a headwind going into 2022 and we expect a limited benefit from the remaining funds. although we are optimistic about the progress being made on disaster recovery funds from hurricane maria, we do not expect to see the same level of impact.
second, in the merchant acquiring segment our expanded relationship with firstbank contributed to the growth this year. we will anniversary this transaction during the first quarter of next year. in latam we benefited from significant wins and multi-year projects that went into production in the beginning of the year, some of which are important minimums that contributed to this year's growth and these project minimums will not have the same impact going into 2022. that said, we are continue to announce important wins that will contribute more and more over time as volume grow. lastly, the cpi index for september was announced earlier this month and was 5.2%.
as a reminder, our msa with banco popular caps our annual increase to 2%. this will be the highest increase we have applied since becoming a public company. as previously disclosed, the msa with popular includes a provision that allows for the review of fees to ensure these are market, which popular has challenged in the past and may challenge in the future. however, we have generally been able to effectively resolve these situations with the bank. in summary, we generated strong third quarter results and remain positive about the future, which led us to again raise our full year 2021 guidance and we look forward to give you more detail on our 22 expectations on our next call.
with that, operator, please open the line for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from vasu govil with kbw.
vasundhara govil -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
hi, thank you for taking question.
operator
i'm sorry, one moment. you may go ahead.
vasundhara govil -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
hi, thank you for my -- taking my question. mac and joaquin just a high-level question for you guys. i know you don't provide long-term revenue or earnings growth target because the macro situation in puerto rico has usually been very uncertain, but it seems the macro environment is now more stable. you may have some tailwinds from the federal stimulus funds coming in. the pace of digitization has accelerated globally, including in most of your end markets. with that backdrop, how should we think about sort of the growth algorithm for evertec over the next say three to five years, if you could provide any color in terms of how you think about that internally.
and then as a follow-up. joaquin, if you could just talk about the fourth quarter revenue guide. how are you expecting some of the trends across the segment, because obviously in the third quarter you saw some pretty strong growth in the merchant acquiring segment and in the payment services latam segment, should some of those trends continue into the fourth quarter? thank you.
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
hey, vasu, thanks, and thanks for the question. so, on the first question, i'll take a stab at it and then i'll hand it over to joaquin for to give his comments and the answer the second question. on the first question, as you pointed out, we don't give long-term guidance. and we will give -- we do give annual guidance and we'll give guidance for 2022 on our next call. but i do want to point out, as you pointed out, the company -- some of the dynamics of the company in the markets that we operate have improved over the past years.
number one, in puerto rico, we have seen stabilization in the economy, both from the federal funds coming through from maria and also because of the pandemic. and in that environment, we've been able to capture additional market share as the larger banks, the international bank since left the island and both popular and have benefit from that. i mean, i'm sorry, firstbank and movil have benefited from that recently. those are all our customers, the local banks. so, we do feel like that in the short-term in the next few years we do have a great environment in puerto rico in which we can operate, continue to increase our market share and hopefully have a stable, more stable economy than we've seen here in the past.
secondly, if you look at latin america, when i arrived at the company seven years ago, these markets were closed, primarily they were operated by monopolies and duopolies for payments and we've been fortunate that the markets have opened and we now have a great set of products where we own the intellectual property, we have a rolodex of customers that continues to increase when we added santander, chile and mercado libre and lello. now, with caja popular mexicana we believe that our latam business should grow at a good pace compared to the past as well. so, we won't give you numbers and we won't give long-term guidance vasu. we will give you 2022 guidance on our next call. but to your point, the markets have stabilized and in the case of latin america it has now opened and i believe we've executed well to take care of those -- take advantage of those opportunities. joaquin?
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
yeah, in terms of the second piece of the question, vasu, what i would say is when we look at the different segments for q4 and other trends that we saw in q3 in terms of how the segments grew will sustain in general i would say that nav. for the merchant acquiring segment we still expect to see going to high-teens to low-20s in terms of growth in the fourth quarter. and in latin america we're also expecting kind of high-teens, low-20s in terms of growth. business solutions as we've communicated in the past when there is a lack of any specific project that goes into production we are expecting that in the low to mid single-digits. so, i kind of break down -- obviously thinking about the range that we just provided in the script kind of where we expect those segments to be.
vasundhara govil -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
great, thank you very much. that was super helpful.
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, vasu.
operator
our next question comes from korey marcello with deutsche bank. you may go ahead.
korey marcello -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. just wanted to talk a little bit about the volume and transaction growth. obviously, you guys spoke a little bit about the spike you saw in october. can you give us a sense of kind of how the volumes of transactions trended into kind of the september-october timeframe?
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
i think you meant august korey with the back-to-school. so, we did see...
korey marcello -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yes, august.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
we did see that kind of come back and obviously in puerto rico with the vaccination rates and we are only kind of going back to normal and kids going back to schools. it's something that we sort of expected want to see that actually get reflected again once something positive. i would say that october we continue to see a strong volume when we compare it against the prior year. i would say that similar to what we saw coming off of the month of september. so, as i just mentioned on vasu's question, i mean, we're expecting merchant acquiring to be in the high-teens, low-20s overall. so, that's based on strong volumes still in q4.
korey marcello -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then ath movil i think kind of slowed to 24% you mentioned in the quarter. i believe growth was 60% last quarter and i know there is tougher comps there. but can you give us a sense of what you think kind of the right normalized growth rate is for that business coming out of the pandemic?
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
let me -- we won't sort of, again, we'll give 2020 guidance -- 2022 guidance next call. what i would say is, during the pandemic, as we've said, we saw significant increase as people moved to digital payments and we are encouraged that we now continue to see that trend continuing. and then now that people have adopted to the technology, they are using it more frequently, we are seeing a dip velocity of adoption. so, we do expect it to grow meaningfully in the future. but to your point, the comps in the past are hard.
korey marcello -- deutsche bank -- analyst
appreciate that guys. and just maybe if i could sneak one more in. santander, i think you mentioned they up the guidance to 50,000 merchants in chile. at what point do we kind of move past the minimums and start to see incremental benefit from that? thanks guys.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
what i would say, korey, at this point, we are still within the minimum and we have some way to go. but overall for us and obviously for santander it's encouraging to see the types of opportunities that exist out there when we penetrate some of these markets that weren't necessarily open in the past. so, and we're going to be continue to be excited about the progress that they're making in terms of continuing to put clients on the platform.
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
and i think for us as a company, i mean, not only naming these marquee brands as our customers, but now performing and exceeding their expectations when they talk about that publicly is good for our pipeline in the future. so, it's not only the impact to the financial results on that specific contract, but it's also building a reputation that not only do we win business, but we exceed our customers' expectations.
korey marcello -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks, guys.
operator
our next question comes from bob napoli with william blair. you may go ahead.
robert napoli -- william blair & company -- analyst
thank you, and good afternoon mac and joaquin. so, the cpm win, the issuer processing in mexico, can you give a little color on just that business, the issuer processing business. and the size of the business kind of geographically, i mean, -- and maybe a pipeline that you have in that business.
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. so, it's not our issuing business and bob we issue both -- we assessed our customers issuing both debit and credit cards. we had announced previously that in mexico we were doing mercado libre debit cards. this is for -- this is credit cards for our caja popular mexicana which we're excited about, because they have 3 million customers on this 500 branches. they are the largest of their kind in the country. so, they are already in the market with the product working. we're moving slowly to make sure that we can work out any kinks, but they've already announced it publicly that this is operating the products in the market and this is a significant win for us in mexico.
robert napoli -- william blair & company -- analyst
and maybe, i mean, do you have more pipeline in mexico or is that, maybe just some color on the momentum in that business.
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. so, what i would say, generally, i mean, where we see our pipeline from an organic perspective is around issuing and around acquiring processing services. we have -- those are the two biggest lines and we are seeing demand throughout the region and interest. and like i said on the previous comment with santander chile, the good news is not only are we announcing wins, but i think people are impressed by the fact that we are exceeding our customers' expectation. based on their own announcements, i mean, the santander chile numbers we're giving you, are numbers that they've announced publicly. but, yeah, i would say, bob, our organic pipeline is as healthy -- has been healthier than it's ever been.
robert napoli -- william blair & company -- analyst
great. and then -- so you have liquidity getting close to $400 million of liquidity. you certainly broadened out the markets that you're serving in latin america. there seems to be a lot of opportunity in latin america. from an m&a perspective, what are you focused on? do you have a pipeline and what -- where do you see the biggest opportunities to add your business inorganically?
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. so, our thesis on the m&a has not changed significantly. we are working on a pipeline in latin america, and we're still focused solely on latin america and we're looking at opportunities every month. so, we're still actively looking at m&a and like i said, while not something when we have it, but there are still opportunities in latin america that we're evaluating.
robert napoli -- william blair & company -- analyst
and then, i guess, lastly, just on your product development or your product roadmap, where are you investing internally? what product expansions could we expect to see over the next year or two?
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. so, i think we talked little bit about this in 2019 that we -- at the end of 2019, early 2019, we talked about, we were going to invest and creating a processing model for our business, because we have just formed paygroup. we wanted to localize and turn it to a processing business for the acquiring and issuing and we named the countries, chile, colombia, mexico, costa rica. and so those are the investments that we've made in the past and we continue to make investments in that platform in those countries and looking at new countries as well. we've also invested heavily in placetopay. so, we recently, right before the pandemic, we closed on placetopay, which is our e-commerce gateway. so, we have localized that now in costa rica and puerto rico now. it was already operating in colombia and so -- and we localized in chile as well. so, we focused on our e-commerce gateway, because we believe that as everyone else e-commerce and digital transactions are important in that gateway is our primary and our lead product. and then we've also made investments, and bob, as you know, around ath movil and that's paid off very, very well and it's become a significant part of our p&l.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
the only thing i would add is placeto, bob, which is actually a platform that you referred to as cpm, which is both issuing and acquiring and that goes to while not mentioned in terms of taking products and becoming a processor as we've localized that platform and now we put client is on it. we continue to get feedback in terms of functionality products that we're really taking advantage of and kind of putting into platform across the different countries that we're in. so, i would say that those are the three main areas where we're reinvesting.
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
the pace and when we announced these wins mercado libre, when we announced santander chile, cpm all of these are from the paygroup acquisition, which is now the pay studio product and the investments we've made and now that we're getting a payback by announcing these wins.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
yeah. i would add, bob, as i said in my remarks right, as we continue to enhance these products we're also making some investments that are going to hit our opex our own just the efficiencies in the operation and efficiencies around just product development and that's part of what i mentioned in the remarks around guidance for the fourth quarter.
robert napoli -- william blair & company -- analyst
thank you. appreciate it.
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, bob.

our next question comes from george mihalos with cowen. you may go ahead.
george mihalos -- cowen & company -- analyst
good afternoon, guys. thanks for taking my question. just wanted to ask one. as it relates to the merchant acquiring business, i know you talked about some unemployment benefits ending, i'm just curious, have you seen any stored change in trend in volumes as you sort of exited september and moved into october, just curious what you're seeing on the ground there.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
what i would say, george, is i mean when we look at it year-over-year it continues to be strong across, i would say, pretty much all verticals. and when we see -- again q3 still had an enhanced unemployment that really started to and in the second half of september so that the third quarter still saw some of that kind of push of funds coming through, i would say, sequentially, as we've said in the past. there is somewhat of a slowdown that we are tracking that applies to some of the puts and takes within merchant acquiring in terms of the average ticket also starting to come down to a more normal level is still high when we look at what it was pre-pandemic. but as we move away from some of the significant funding that we saw early q2 on a sequential basis there is a slight slowdown.
george mihalos -- cowen & company -- analyst
okay, thank you.
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, george.
operator
our next question comes from john davis with raymond james. you may go ahead.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
hi, good afternoon, guys. maybe just to start wanted to hone in a little bit on latam. we're seeing really strong growth there. i think you guys highlighted that is kind of a growth area for. but what's going right, i think, you guys continue to kind of exceed our estimates for growth in that geography, but just wonder saying what's going on, a lot of your, i guess, larger competitors have call out latam is an area for growth, just want understand kind of what's going right and what's driving that growth.
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
what's driving our growth, correct?
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
correct.
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
you bet, as you mentioned our competitors. so, yeah, so what i would say is over the last three or four years, as i mentioned a little bit earlier in my comments, previously these markets were closed and evertec was in a position again five, six years ago where we really needed to improve our products, our services and again -- and once we did that the market would need to open. so, what i would say what is going well for evertec is one is we're the beneficiary of these markets now opening. i mean, starting with prisma getting sold to advent, the santander deal that we did in chile. so, these markets are now opening. so, it's a great opportunity for anybody who is willing to invest in latin america. and so that thesis is now playing out from a market opportunity perspective.
what's going well now is our ability to sell and win business, because if you remember, seven years ago, when we get on these calls and talk about how is the pipeline, how is the sales opportunities, it was much more difficult. but now that we have clients that are using our products, seeing that we're winning business, seeing that we're implementing business, i would say, the sales pipeline and the execution on winning business is going well. and then the implementations, i mean, i can tell you to move into a country like santander chile and to build that from scratch and be the first one to do it, i was incredibly proud of how we executed. the same with mercado libre, the ability to implement in mexico with the largest e-commerce player in all of latin america and that with caja popular mexicana. so, what i would say is again back to interest from different players in the market around a technology partner that can help them with issuing products and the technology partner that can help them with processing.
as you've noticed, in chile, some of the banks still want to own their own book of business and they want to own their merchant contracts, some don't. and so we've been able to partner with both sides. so, i would say across issuing and acquiring and acquiring services, our ability to win business and people seeing our dedication to the region and our ability to implement that business is what has allowed us to get to double-digit growth this year in latin america, and that's all organic. i also believe that with placetopay we've done a good job integrating that acquisition as we've learned with other acquisitions. and we've been able to localize that product more quickly in additional markets given our experience that we have with the paygroup. but that's what i think is going well. it's very symbiotic timing that the markets are now opening. there's real interest with the entrance of fintechs with regulators wanting more options in the market and our ability to execute on those opportunities.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. that's very helpful color. and then maybe just switching to the balance sheet. obviously, leverage is under 1.5 times now, just you guys have generate a lot of free cash flow year-to-date and i think when we returned the $35 million or so to shareholders. so, just maybe first kind of remind us of what your comfort level is from a leverage perspective. also, are there any opportunities with leverage where it is the refinance the balance sheet to bring down the cost of your debt, which i think is still about 4.5%? and then finally, just a little bit surprised to see kind of no buyback should we read into that there is the potential m&a on the horizon price sensitivity just curious there, because i think if you look at your free cash flow year-to-date that you're returning to shareholders and there's kind of a big discrepancy in 1.5 times leverage is just pretty well. so, just curious thoughts from here potential to do anything on the balance sheet and maybe refi that debt at a lower rate.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
hey, john, joaquin here. so, look we've said before our kind of target range on leverage is 2 to 3 times. we are now, as you said, under that and we've been under that now for a couple of quarters, in part because of the good performance we've had from an ebitda perspective. and what i would say is that we're always looking at our capital structure. i'm trying to make that more efficient. and having said that, when we look at the strategy for capital deployment and as mac said before that hasn't really changed. i mean, our key focus here is m&a, and as mac said, we have a pipeline. we're looking at targets every quarter.
and from a buyback perspective, consistent also with the strategy. we really look at those from an opportunistic perspective and we don't have a formal repurchase program or target that we're trying to hit and we did buyback some shares in q1 and q2. we did have a slower quarter this time around. but our main priority continues to be a deploying capital for growth. we have also increased our capex. so, we continue to invest in our own products, which has given us results in latin america, and that's kind of where we are at this point even though we have a strong balance sheet.
john davis -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, all right. that's it from me. thanks, guys.
operator
our next question comes from james faucette with morgan stanley. you may now go ahead.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you very much and thanks for taking time this afternoon with us. i wanted to ask you kind of outlined some of the things that have benefited you this year like stimulus etc. and obviously that abates and and that kind of thing. i'm wondering though on the flip side, as you also highlight is that we have tourism starting to pick back up and the like. how should we think about what you're like planning assumptions are or when we can kind of get back to 2019 levels and just trying to think through like the different components of the puts and takes, particularly going into next year.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
you hit on one of them which is obviously getting back a normalized economy in terms of the different factors that move at least puerto rico, tourism being one of them. but i'll just remind you, i mean, tourism in and of itself is less than 10% and in terms of puerto rico gdp. it's actually closer to 5% to 8%. and look right now, we still see, as we said in our prepared remarks, some tailwind from the stimulus that is still left out there, but not to the extent that we saw this previous year. we continue to track all of the recovery funding which at this point even though and we are optimistic that we'll see that come through next year will definitely provide more detail. that is definitely an important part of our model and our assumptions as we go into 2022. and then just how puerto rico continues to recover economically, we are in a better backdrop than we've been in some time from a macro environment, but we need to see how this all starts to normalize once team that you think there.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
as far as some of the packages you're looking at, to be clear, those are still being contemplated or they've already been signed off on and you're just kind of waiting for distribution in details there?
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
in most cases, a lot of money has already been allocated, but it hasn't been distributed. actually recently the new private company that is managing out of the transformation here in puerto rico for the public electric authority announced close to $600 million in projects that are being awarded. so, we're starting to see some movement in the right direction that is actually getting announced. but in the context of the amount that we saw, that we're seeing in the fiscal board plan which are in a billion, there is still some way to go. and again some of the right things have been said the past few quarters, both from the federal administration and the local government as to the process with some of these funds. and -- but that's what we've -- as we've also said, we expect that to be more in 2022. so, as we get closer to our next call and actually discuss the details of our 2022 guidance, we hope that we can go into a bit more details to what our expectations are.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. and sorry just lastly back on the acquisitions front is clearly you guys are seeing a good flow of potential deals. are there a few things that you can categorize for us as to what had been inhibitors to date or kind of what you would expect or would like to see happen to get more of those across the finish line?
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
i mean, i can just describe generally, sometimes assets don't trade because there may be multiple shareholders that are in the country and it's very difficult for them to get the shareholders aligned if their financial institutions. it could be valuation expectations. i mean, we actually thought when the pandemic originally started that it could be an opportunity that never really happened and valuations have gotten fairly frothy since then. if you look at our historical acquisitions, we've been able to pay a multiple that has allowed us to realize benefit very quickly. and so those have been two of the bigger barriers, but we still are looking at acquisitions around the region. and as joaquin said, look our first investment is investing in ourselves. we love to invest in our products. and we're incredibly excited that seven years later we have great products that are winning great business. second is buying companies, which we've done and integrated those fairly well. and then the other levers of deploying our capital. but m&a is still something we're focused on. we want to deal as much as anyone else. but we'll only do the right deals and we will announce one when we have it.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's great. thanks for that detail everybody.
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from james friedman with susquehanna. you may now go ahead.
james friedman -- susquehanna financial group -- analyst
good results here guys. it's jamie at susquehanna. joaquin with regard to your comments about the bpops contract structure, i'm just trying to figure out is it a good or bad thing that the cpi is rising and is there risk to the margin structure of the contract, because you're captive five and we're hearing a lot about inflation globally.
joaquin a. castrillo-salgado -- chief financial officer
i mean, so i don't think it's neither positive or negative. i think we're being factual in terms of what the contract says and the contract does cap cpi of 5%. i would say that we are very margin conscious. we have great margins. we are always looking for ways to be efficient. obviously, inflation is a real thing and cost of labor has been going up and it's something that we'll continue to manage through.
james friedman -- susquehanna financial group -- analyst
and then, mac, maybe over to you, in terms of, that good questions on this, but in terms of your increased proliferation in latin america payments infrastructure, yeah, i realize that you're at minimums and you're calling out those minimums may not persist next year, though you'll probably win new contracts, but i mean your goal presumably with these is to get off the minimums, right?
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
santander chile specifically, right?
james friedman -- susquehanna financial group -- analyst
yeah.
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
okay, yeah. so, i mean, look, so the reason we loved the deal and just for people that are sort of new to the story, when we announced santander chile, it was a processing deal, right, where they actually on the merchant contracts. but what we loved about the deal is that we make money first year, because we have minimums throughout the duration of the contract. so, we weren't bound by how quickly they could ramp new merchants. now, as they surpassed those minimums, right, and as the volumes increase above what the minimum is paid for, then we will get incremental revenue which will add to our margins. so, the fact that they are exceeding their expectations means that at some point, they will exceed the minimum they we will generate even more revenue off the contract. we haven't given any guidance on what those minimums are, what we think that timing will be, it's a five-year contract, but we do, i mean, we are significantly exceeding their expectation and our own expectation. so, that should be beneficial to us during the five-year period, but we haven't given any sort of dimension around how big are the minimums, when would they flow through and how will this impact that five-year period.
james friedman -- susquehanna financial group -- analyst
got it, all right. thanks for the perspective.
morgan m. schuessler -- president & chief executive officer
