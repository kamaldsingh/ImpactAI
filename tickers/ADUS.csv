good morning, and welcome to addus homecare corporation's first-quarter 2020 earnings conference call. today's call is being recorded. to the extent any non-gaap financial measure is directly discussed in today's call, you will also find a reconciliation of that measure to the most directly comparable financial measure, calculated according to gaap, by going to the company's website and reviewing yesterday's news release. this conference call may also contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, including statements, among others, regarding addus' expected quarterly and annual financial performance for 2020 or beyond.
for this purpose, any statements made during this call that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. without limiting the foregoing, discussions of forecasts, estimates, targets, plans, beliefs, expectations and the like are intended to identify forward-looking statements. you are hereby cautioned that these statements may be affected by important factors, among others, set forth in addus' filings with the securities and exchange commission and in its first-quarter 2020 news release. consequently, actual operations and results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.
the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. as a reminder, addus has not yet filed its 2019 form 10-k and will file its form 10-q for the first quarter when it finalizes the form 10-k. as a result, all financial results discussed on this call today are preliminary. i would like to now turn the call over to the company's president and chief executive officer, dirk allison.
please go ahead, sir.
dirk allison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, drew. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our 2020 first-quarter earnings call. with me today is brian poff, our chief financial officer; and brad bickham, our chief operating officer. as usual, i will begin with some overall comments, and then brian will discuss the first-quarter results that we issued yesterday afternoon.
following our comments, we would be happy to respond to any questions. as you saw with the preliminary financial results we announced yesterday, we had another very solid operating performance in the first quarter of 2020. our revenue for the first quarter was $190.2 million, adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of 2020 increased to $0.77, and our adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of 2020 was $17.7 million. we did start to experience a reduction in our revenues beginning in the last two weeks of march due to the coronavirus, which i will discuss in a few minutes.
as we'd previously announced, on january 1 of this year, we received a rate increase from the state of illinois. this rate increase is to cover the minimum wage increase which occurred in chicago and cook county on july 1, 2019. this increase also allowed us to correspondingly increase the wages of our illinois team located outside of the chicago area. we appreciate that the leadership of the state of illinois recognized the need to make adjustments to cover the cost associated with the higher minimum wages.
as for additional minimum wage increases in illinois, the city of chicago has passed an ordinance which will raise the city's minimum wage on july 1 by $1 to $14 per hour. this accelerates the move to a $15-per-hour minimum wage ahead of what the state of illinois had already passed. our team has been working with the state leadership to secure funding to offset this accelerated wage increase. a rate adjustment to cover this chicago minimum wage increase was included in the governor's budget, which was presented in february of this year.
however, this rate increase is dependent on the passing of a graduated tax proposal, which will be on the ballot during the upcoming november elections. we continue to advocate for increases in our rates to cover the chicago-mandated wage increases. we believe that any approved increase will benefit both our local workers and the customers that we serve in illinois. i also want to discuss some new york budget developments that have arisen over the past few months.
effective january 1, 2020, almost all medicaid providers in the state of new york received a rate reduction of 1% for the services they provide. for addus, we estimated that this would be a reduction to our earnings of approximately $1 million per year. this reduction was in response to an anticipated state budget shortfall of approximately $6 billion. at that time, the governor of new york also appointed a committee to recommend actions for further medicaid cost reductions to help close this budget shortfall.
per this committee's recommendations, an additional rate reduction of 0.5% was implemented for medicaid providers effective april 1, 2020. without any mitigation, this would reduce our earnings by approximately $500,000. we continue to work with our new york state associations to try and mitigate these rate reductions. although the impact of covid-19 on new york tax revenue is unknown at this time, it could further negatively impact the budget and increase pressure to implement further rate reductions unless advocacy to get federal relief direct to states is successful.
for the first quarter of 2020, our personal care same-store growth was 15%, driven largely by a rate increase in illinois, which was effective january 1 of this year. we should continue to see solid same-store growth in our personal care segment over the next few quarters, driven primarily by the illinois rate increase. for the first quarter of 2020, our hospice same-store growth was 12.1%, as our new mexico hospice programs had solid organic growth. in addition, our hospice partners of america programs that we acquired at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2019 experienced solid growth as well.
our home health same-store growth was 19.5%, as we continue to see the momentum with our new mexico home health services. let me discuss our operations during the covid-19 shutdown and attempt to provide some perspective on what you're seeing, on what we are seeing in the early part of the second quarter of 2020. when states first started to contemplate requiring nonessential businesses to close, the federal department of homeland security issued their definition of essential businesses. included in that definition was home health, hospice and personal care services.
based on this definition, all of our business segments were deemed essential, as we expected. as we have now seen, each of the states that have required businesses to shut down have used some form of the federal definition, allowing us to continue to function as normally as possible. but like many others, we have been impacted by these shutdowns. most of the schools across the country have closed, meaning many of our employees' children are now at home.
this can cause issues for those of us such as our caregivers who must leave their homes to perform their jobs. because of this, some of these individuals have had to stop seeing patients until schools reopen or until they are able to obtain some sort of child care. additionally, our personal care operation has a large presence in new york city and long island, new york; chicago, illinois; detroit, michigan; and the state of washington. all of these areas have been hotspot areas for this particular virus.
in these markets, especially new york city, long island and chicago, we have seen a number of patient call-offs. this is where a patient or their family decides to skip their normal personal care service visit due to their concern of having someone, even a caregiver, in their home. we have seen caregiver call-offs for similar reasons, but these type of cancellations have been less than we had anticipated. we have also seen some healthcare facilities such as skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities and independent living facilities limit our staff's physical access to provide hospice services in an effort to minimize the facility's exposure to the virus.
these and other issues have led to a reduction in our overall revenues. for april, our revenue reduction appears to be around 10%. we anticipate that this will Â— we will continue to experience some revenue reduction during the second quarter. as part of our plan to deal with covid-19, addus rapidly went to a remote working environment where possible and implemented social distancing everywhere else for the safety of our team.
we also started the process of sourcing personal protective equipment for our team of caregivers. ppe procurement has been particularly challenging in our nonclinical segment, as compared to our hospice and home health, since historically it is not a service in which widespread ppe usage is customary. however, we understood the need to start providing masks and gloves to our personal care team in order to help protect them and our patients from the spread of this virus and to provide our patients and their families an added layer of comfort with allowing our team into their homes for service. we also needed to secure the proper ppe for our clinical operations to handle their patients, including any covid-19 patients that may need clinical services.
to obtain this ppe, our senior leaders created a rapid procurement team whose primary focus for the past several weeks has been to quickly source, acquire and distribute the appropriate personal protective equipment for our caregivers. we have navigated the additional challenges of others, including state governments and the federal covid-19 task force, attempting to purchase the same ppe. i am proud to say that our team has done a great job with this project. as of today, we believe we have sufficient ppe to help provide the appropriate level of protection for our caregivers.
while ppe alone does not guarantee that our team will not contract the coronavirus, it does help to provide additional safety measures for our caregivers and patients while we are performing the services that our patients need. now that we have been able to acquire the additional ppe for our team, we have started providing services to covid-positive and presumed positive patients. our covid-19 patient volume is low at this time, although we anticipate and have prepared for our number of covid patients to continue to increase in the near term. our current case volume is equally split between our home health and personal care service lines.
as part of our operations planning concerning this virus, we have identified our offices around the country that are best suited to care for covid patients. we have provided those offices with the necessary training materials and ppe required to safely treat patients with the covid-19 virus. as we ramped up our response to this virus, we have experienced an increase in our costs to provide protective equipment to our team. we have seen certain items, such as masks, increase in cost materially above their normal price.
as i mentioned, we are now providing surgical masks to all our nonclinical caregivers, as well as to our personal care patients, in order to make their environment safer during the crisis. we are also seeing increased costs for ppe for our clinical care segments, so like a lot of providers, we are seeing lower revenues during this event while costs are increasing. notably, however, addus remains a financially strong company. while our profits will be impacted during the pandemic, we as a senior leadership team made the decision over four years ago that we would operate our company in a manner that would provide us financial flexibility in times of economic challenges.
while none of us expected to see a worldwide pandemic that has caused such personal and financial hardships, our decision to maintain a conservative financial position is now proving to be a great asset. while our revenues will be down and expenses up, we continue to have the ability to operate as we normally would, or at least as normally as possible in these times. we continue to have substantial cash balance with very little debt. we also have the ability to borrow money under a credit facility if the need arise.
and we are fortunate that we are in an industry that is needed to fight this virus, keeping our business open. before i turn this call over to brian for a more detailed review of the first-quarter financial performance, let me thank all the employees of addus. i am extremely proud of all your efforts and know each employee works hard to live our values while serving our patients. our patients want to be in their homes now more than ever, and we are a vital part of allowing that to occur.
all of us have a very important responsibility to the thousands of patients and their families who trust us with their care, and i am very appreciative for the ongoing efforts of our team. with that, let me turn the call over to brian. 
brian poff -- chief financial officer
thank you, dirk, and good morning, everyone. please note that the financial results discussed on this call and in our press release are preliminary and will not be finalized until the 2019 form 10-k financial statements are completed and filed. in coordination with our current auditors, pwc, we currently anticipate the timing to completion and filing to be in advance of our standard second quarter filing deadline. addus had a solid financial performance for the first quarter, marking a strong start to 2020.
for the quarter, we had favorable demand trends across all of our service segments and also realized the impact of the additional scheduled rate increase in illinois on january 1, 2020. as dirk noted, total net service revenues for the first quarter were $190.2 million. the revenue breakdown is as follows. personal care revenues were $160.7 million or 84.5% of revenue; hospice care revenues were $25.2 million, or 13.2% of revenue; and home health revenues were $4.3 million, or 2.3% of revenues.
our first-quarter results demonstrate we are continuing to execute on our organic growth strategy with favorable results prior to the impact of covid, which impacted the last few weeks of the quarter and will be more impactful in the second quarter, as dirk mentioned. while we are facing a challenging environment, we have a strong business model in place and believe we are well positioned to continue to support our clients and payors through the pandemic. we are also continuing to realize the incremental benefits of the four acquisitions we completed in 2019, with total annualized revenue of approximately $130 million. we continue to evaluate and pursue other acquisition opportunities and have a robust pipeline of potential transactions.
however, we are approaching acquisition activity with all appropriate caution and diligence, which temporarily could lead to a delay in the near term. other preliminary financial results for the first quarter of 2020 include the following: our gross margin percentage was 29.4%; g&a expense was 22.2% of revenue, with adjusted g&a expense at 20% of revenue; the company's adjusted ebitda increased to $17.7 million, or 9.3% of revenue; and adjusted net income per diluted share increased to $0.77. the adjusted per-share results for the first quarter of 2020 exclude the following: covid-19 direct expenses of $0.01, primarily related to additional ppe costs; m&a transaction expenses of $0.09; severance and other nonrecurring costs of $0.05; and noncash stock-based compensation of $0.08. our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was 14.2%, primarily as a result of an excess tax benefit related to equity vesting during the quarter.
for the full-year 2020, we continue to expect a tax rate of 23% to 25%. dsos were 67.5 days at the end of the first quarter of 2020, and we have continued to see consistent cash flows from our payors, with increased payments from the illinois department on aging in particular. during the fourth quarter of 2019, the state of illinois also authorized a one-time retroactive bonus payment related to the july 1, 2019, rate increase, to be paid in 2020. while we have yet to receive, we continue to expect this payment of over $6.5 million to be paid in the second quarter.
as a result of our strong earnings and collections, our first-quarter net cash provided by operations totaled $20.4 million, and at march 31, 2020, the company had cash of $130.5 million, with only $60.1 million of bank debt and $218.5 million available and fully accessible under our revolver, leaving us well capitalized during the current situation. this concludes our prepared comments this morning. i want to thank you all for being with us. i'll now ask the operator to please open the line for your questions.

[operator instructions] our first question is from the line of matthew borsch with bmo capital markets.
matt borsch -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
maybe if i could, to just start on the Â— i don't know if you're prepared to say anything else about the delayed filing. if i could just ask a simplistic question, and i'm sure you've gotten this before, but it just seems, from an outsider's perspective, that this has been delayed for so long over something that is so immaterial to your results. can you just comment on that, if you don't mind?
dirk allison -- president and chief executive officer
yes, matthew. this is dirk. yes, it is frustrating. i know it is to us, so i assume it is to you guys, too, that something that is as immaterial for a company our size as this has kept us from being able to file financials.
i think the good thing is this. once we were able to work through the fact that our two auditing firms were not going to be able to make a decision together to allow us to file, we had a plan to follow up behind that to make sure we could take care of it as quickly as possible. that plan, which required our current auditor, pwc, to come in and audit our 2017 and 2018 financials that had been previously audited by ernst & young, has begun and is on track and is progressing as we have expected. so while it Â—i think brian mentioned in his comments that we expect this to be completed by the time we file our second quarter earnings release, so we're hopeful that the first-quarter release is the last time we'll talk to you about preliminary.
matt borsch -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. all right, well, great. and if i could just add one more question on a completely different topic, as you look at the current volume environment, i think i heard you say april down 10%, i believe, for revenue, and i'm assuming that's year over year, and that you expect the second quarter as a whole to be down, i'm not asking for guidance, of course, but are you seeing any stabilization or are the volume trends worsening as you end april into may, or is it too early to say?
dirk allison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and let me say, it's not 10% year over year. not at all. it is just? it's 10%, right around 10%, lower than we were running prior to the virus starting to affect the company.
so we're still left with all the growth we've had. that make sure you understand that. let me talk about what we're seeing, briefly. this is new to us.
our operations team, we've been trying to gather data as quickly as possible. we do still have some caregivers that are on written paper time sheets, which takes a little bit longer to get in, but what we're seeing as we flow through the last three or four weeks, the real impact has been focused around new york, illinois, mainly chicago area, and a little bit of detroit. that's really where we've seen the biggest reduction. we've seen a little bit in washington state, as i mentioned earlier.
but if you really want to say, where is it affecting you? it's new york, long island and the chicago area. we saw a gradual rise in call-offs, which reduced our referrals, starting in, probably, the third week of march, and continuing on that point. they started out small. i would say about the first or second week of april we saw them get up, in new york particularly, much higher, as you probably know, the new york pinnacle of this virus.
i will tell you that what we have seen, and again, this is not necessarily a trend, but this last week, we started to see a top-out and start to come back where the percent of call-offs was starting to be lower than the week before. so we believe, in all of our markets or the majority of our markets, particularly the chicago and the long island, the new york and long island markets, we have seen the pinnacle and we're starting to come down. if that continues, then what we'd be talking about is that the 10% reduction would be in april, and then may and june, the rest of the quarter might be somewhat below that. but again, let me just caution you, we're still looking at this data and it's just starting to turn, so we've got to see if it continues.
but so far we would say we're comfortable with the 10%. we could see it starting to come back a little.
operator
and your next question is from the line of frank morgan with rbc capital markets.
frank morgan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
i appreciate the color about the rate environment out there. i'm curious if how much of a factor you think these payments under the cares act could potentially help personal care? and then just curious about any other grant monies or medicare money you may have gotten in your home healthcare business. any proceeds you received there?
dirk allison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we did receive some funds, just under $7 million, from the cares act as it relates to our medicare business, and we've taken that money and set it aside, and we're looking at the expenses related around the virus that would appropriate for it, so we'll see how that works out as time goes. really, other than that, we did not apply, obviously, at our size, for any of the loans that were out there for small business. that was not us.
so the only other item i think we have, brian, you can talk about is maybe just the deferral of the tax submissions.
brian poff -- chief financial officer
yes. i think from a cash flow perspective, frank, that's the only other thing that we've really materially we've taken advantage of, is the delay in the payroll tax submissions, but under the cares act, i think it's still kind of to be determined for, primarily for medicaid providers, what relief is out there. that's something i think everyone is working through currently. but we haven't seen anything on that side as of yet.
frank morgan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
and then on the fmap, do you feel like you've got a shot at maybe getting some of those dollars and maybe offset some of these cuts you were talking about?
brian poff -- chief financial officer
i'm sorry. frank, can you repeat that? we didn't Â— you were a little garbled on the first part.
frank morgan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. yes. the fmap, the federal matching assistance, on the medicaid side, any sense that personal care may get some of those proceeds?
brian poff -- chief financial officer
yes. that's definitely going to be helpful to us. i think we're still waiting to see exactly how that will flow through. i think we haven't seen a lot of adjustments at this point.
i think the states are going to have to utilize those as they see best, and we're working with them to see how that might benefit us down the road.
brad bickham -- chief operating officer
yes. this is brad bickham. we have seen some states give some additional payments on a temporary basis just recently. most of those are for the caregivers to pass through, so we are seeing some relief there.
it's hard to quantify as to whether it's material or not, but a lot of those funds will be passed through to the caregivers.
frank morgan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got you. and then you mentioned about a more cautious view on the deal pipeline. just curious, are you seeing a pick-up? i mean, are people reaching out to you now with all that's happened over the past two months? any characterizations on that? and then finally, just any other cost levers that you might have in terms of managing this drop in revenue? thanks.
dirk allison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. realistically. let's talk first about the acquisitions. we're not seeing people necessarily reach out more at this time.
we are still seeing some companies come through that are interested in selling, so i would say our activity is maybe slightly down from what it was before the virus, but it's certainly picked up a little bit, and we expect that will continue. and for us, we took the first 60 days of this virus just really focused inward, making sure that we had everything done to continue to operate, see our patients, pay our caregivers. we're to a point now where we feel like that's stabilized a bit, so if we can determine ways to do the appropriate due diligence in today's environment, we will start back to trying to get these things done in a manner that makes sense for us as far as mergers and acquisitions. we fully anticipate to continue with our acquisition program.
as it relates to additional cost levers, let me be clear. the only real additional cost we're seeing with this virus is the protective equipment we're now providing to our nonclinical staff. our clinical staff always had ppe. now maybe we're giving them a little more because we are taking care of some covid-positive or presumptive positive patients, but other than that, that's pretty much the same as we've always done, so it's the additional expense of the ppe for the clinical services.
the revenue reduction for us, while we mentioned it could be up to 10%, that's not something that's going to affect our company where we need, at this point, as we see it, that we need to make any drastic changes. we think it will be temporary, whether that's one month, three months, but we believe we're financially strong enough to continue to operate as we have been and feel that's the best way to do it to make sure that we're a very strong company as we come through this virus.
operator
and your next question is from the line of matt larew with william blair.
matt larew -- william blair and company -- analyst
first, wanted to ask about sort of the hiring environment. obviously, it's been a tough sort of last several weeks to months for folks who are hourly workers and potentially you'd like to open up some opportunities for you to hire, but i also know it may be challenging to do so given some of the restrictions in place because of covid, so just want to get a sense for what that's looking like. and then, sort of dovetailing on that, have you noticed a change at all in terms of the desire for family members to be the primary caregiver as a result of covid?
brad bickham -- chief operating officer
yes. this is brad bickham. on the hiring front, we have seen a pick-up on the hiring recently. when the covid virus first impacted us, we actually pulled back just to put hiring on a hold to get a better handle on how are we going to do that in a safe manner.
fortunately, states have provided some temporary regulatory relief that has allowed us to continue or start hiring back up. we'd like to make some of that training time up. but that certainly has helped and benefited us on the hiring front. your question related to family caregivers, what we have done in those states where it allows us to have a family caregiver, there are people that are now out of work that, when they decided, well, i'd rather not have somebody in the home, we've been able to identify somebody, a family member who's in the home now, that is unemployed, and bring them on as a family caregiver.
so whether that continues post the impact of the covid virus remains to be seen, but it certainly has helped benefit us in the near term.
matt larew -- william blair and company -- analyst
ok. thanks. and then obviously, dirk, you alluded to patient call-offs or patient fear driving some of the volume softness. have you had any issues with sort of new patient generation? have state agencies had to slow down their home assessments? or is it really just the one thing you can point to here is call-offs?
brad bickham -- chief operating officer
yes. so when the virus first impacted us, the call-offs were a factor. we did see a slowdown in new admissions on the personal care side because there was a delay. some of the care coordination units in the illinois market, for instance, were struggling to work from home and how you handle those assessments remotely.
we have seen that kind of pick up. i mean, i've just been pleasantly surprised that we didn't really see new admits just shut off. so that certainly has started to come back up recently, and i think that's contributing to some of the improvements that we're seeing in some of our numbers as we head into may.
matt larew -- william blair and company -- analyst
ok. and the final, just a clarification question. dirk, you said not 10% year over year but 10% pre-virus, and i want to understand. are you referring to patient census overall being about 10% lower than pre-virus, and that census building through may and june, or are you referring to sort of a revenue number? so just if you could clarify that, and then i'll jump off.
thanks.
dirk allison -- president and chief executive officer
well, we were referring to the personal care, the visits, the number of visits that we do, which is really the way that our revenue is calculated, as opposed to adc. so what we were running in february, which was on track with what we had expected, that is what we're comparing it to. our high point in february is where we're saying that we'd been at that 10% level. so certainly not year over year.
operator
and your next question is from the line of brian tanquilut with jefferies.
jason plagman -- jefferies -- analyst
it's jason plagman for brian. one, most of my questions have already been asked, but just wondered if any of the state agencies have discussed maybe adjusting reimbursement to cover the incremental cost of ppe that you're now bearing, since that wasn't traditionally a major component of the cost of delivering personal care services?
brian poff -- chief financial officer
yes. jason, i can take that and brad can add some color if you'd like. but we have seen a few states that have stepped up to try to help cover the cost of ppe. illinois, specifically, has made some, not material payments, but some payments to kind of help businesses like ours cover some of those costs.
and as he mentioned earlier, a couple of the states have given us some pass-through dollars as well as part of their funding, so we are seeing some of that.
brad bickham -- chief operating officer
yes. and those were actually fairly recent. it was really probably about the last week that we've seen some of those payments come through, for instance, from illinois on the ppe; also with some of the states adjusting rates on a temporary basis to help offset some additional costs on the caregiver side.
operator
and your next question is from the line of scott fidel with stephens.
scott fidel -- stephens inc. -- analyst
actually just wanted to first just follow up on that question around the ppe costs, and obviously without trying to ask for guidance, just interested if you can give us some insight into what type of incremental costs you're seeing from ppe, whether maybe just the amount of additional cost that you saw in april or even how you're thinking about that just for the second quarter in terms of incremental ppe costs?
dirk allison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we spent, i think brian said about a little over $200,000 in the first quarter. as you would expect, we were trying to ramp up around the middle of march, and it took a while for us to actually get supplies, ppe, in. i think we spent a total of about $1.5 million to this point.
that is Â— obviously, that's not going to be used immediately. that has some inventory in it for future usage. the question remains, going forward, what happens with the ppe for personal care? because really, from a clinical service, the only real additional cost with ppe is the fact that because the virus has come and because of the fact so many people are ordering, the cost of that equipment has gone up. if that comes back and stabilizes, then it'll have no impact on our clinical services because that's what we've been buying before.
the question is, will we continue as a company to provide masks, gloves for our personal caregivers going forward? and that's something we're talking about as a company. we'll certainly be talking with the states about that, because that would be a new cost associated with taking care of the clients in the state. so it's something still to be determined, but i'd say right now, while $1.5 million is not immaterial, that's kind of the magnitude of what we're talking.
scott fidel -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. thanks. and then just a second question, i guess, for clarification, or just some more insight, just on that $6.5-million retroactive payment from illinois that you mentioned you're expecting to get in the second quarter, have you accrued anything for that yet in revenues, or would that be all incremental to income statement in the second quarter? and then i would also assume that that should just be Â— that should flow through just on cash flows, right, from the second quarter?
brian poff -- chief financial officer
yes, scott. that would be just a cash flow impact for us in the quarter. the revenue has already been recognized in the period that it was related to, which was in 2019, and the related cost as well. so no p&l impact, and that'll be a cash flow event for us in q2 when that comes in.
scott fidel -- stephens inc. -- analyst
understood. and then just last question from me, just interested in any additional insights you can give us into just transitioning some of the operations to reflect the changing dynamics post-covid? and in particular, just interested in how things are going in terms of shifting some of your training programs for new caregivers over to more remote applications as compared Â— i know you guys traditionally were doing a lot of that in person, and there were plans to start transitioning that to more online, etc., given the changing environment.
brad bickham -- chief operating officer
yes. this is brad. we are really experimenting, kind of, with or piloting the kind of remote learning applications. what the benefit is in this current kind of environment is the fact that states have waived, in many cases, the upfront training requirements.
now we're going to have to make those up. we're looking at ways to do that on an online basis. and then part of the challenge there is, all states are generally different and unique with respect to what training is required, what flexibility you have with respect to in-person versus online training, but we're certainly accelerating the look at that and have a vendor that we're working with currently to help facilitate that going forward.
operator
[operator instructions] and your next question is from the line of mitra ramgopal with sidoti.
mitra ramgopal -- sidoti and company -- analyst
i just wanted Â— brian, i know you mentioned the acquisition pipeline remains pretty full, and you're obviously looking to get some transactions done when things return as close to normal as possible. i was just curious if any of your thinking or strategy has changed in light of what we've seen with covid-19? clearly some states being affected more than others, some would probably have some issues as it relates to budgets, etc. just curious if there's been any change in the strategy there.
brian poff -- chief financial officer
yes. i think it's Â— i mean, overall, mitra, i think in strategy, we haven't really had a different shift. i think we believe our business model is still sound. having kind of the three elements, especially in markets that, we think, still makes a lot of sense for us, and i think that's proven out as we've kind of moved through the covid situation.
so i think largely, our focus is still aligned with where we were. obviously, market to market is something that we're always cognizant of. we're always watching any dynamics changing, state budgets, etc. so that's something that we are always keenly aware of as well, as we look at potential targets and acquisitions.
so we're hopeful, as this progresses, we can kind of get back to business as usual, so we're doing everything we can behind the scenes, but still being very cautious, as you guys know. it's a different element right now to try to get out, and due diligence, things like that, so looking forward to getting back to that in the future.
mitra ramgopal -- sidoti and company -- analyst
thanks. and then also just curious in the sense that obviously some industries are being impacted a lot more than others, and clearly your business is an essential service, but do you get the sense that at the end, there'll still be some shake-out in the industry as it relates to maybe some operators not being as financially strong as yourself, etc., being unable to withstand the reduced volume in some markets, etc., and ultimately leading to long-term opportunity for you?
dirk allison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'll take that. yes. i do think, clearly, this industry, especially if we talk about the personal side of our business, there are a lot of small mom-and-pop providers of this service spread throughout the country.
and obviously this virus is difficult, as you go through it, just from an operating standpoint. how do you operate remotely? what about the Â— is there any added expense with ppe? what about the cash flow impact? so from our belief, going forward, this could affect our Â— this could give us an opportunity to continue to consolidate the personal care space once we get through this virus and see if some of those mom-and-pops are ready to maybe talk to us about coming on board.

dirk allison -- president chief executive officer
thank you, dru. good morning and thank you for joining us for our 2020 fourth quarter earnings call. with me today are brian poff, our chief financial officer; and brad bickham, our chief operating officer. as usual, i will begin with some overall comments and then brian will discuss the fourth quarter results in more detail. following our comments we would be happy to respond to any questions. as we've been saying for the past 11 months, a pandemic continues to create many challenges, as we experienced a substantial new surge of covid cases beginning midway through the fourth quarter of 2020. while i expect the environment to remain operationally challenging over the next several months, we are encouraged by the progress being made with the covid vaccine rollout and the steady reduction in covid cases since the peak in late december. we look forward to the time when this pandemic is no longer a significant disruption to our operations.
in spite of the ongoing pandemic-related challenges, my optimism about the future of both the home care industry and addus remains strong. i'm especially proud of our dedicated team of leaders and team members that have demonstrated their ability to meet our mission and execute upon our strategy. this past year has been a unique challenge for our country and i believe all of our addus team has been a vital part of keeping our elderly citizens safe. as you saw with the financial results we announced yesterday, we continued our solid operating performance in the fourth quarter of 2020. our revenue for the fourth quarter was $196 million as compared to $192.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $0.82, up from $0.73 for the fourth quarter of 2019, despite the impact of covid-19 on revenues during our latest quarter. our adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $20.9 million as compared to $18.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of 11.6%. our adjusted ebitda margin increased to 10.7% for the quarter, up from 10.1% sequentially.
during the fourth quarter of 2020, our revenues continued to be adversely impacted by the covid-19 pandemic, with a decline of 2% to 3% from our pre-covid 2020 run rate. as was the case in our third quarter of this year, this reduction occurred to varying degrees in all three segments of our business, but particularly in the new york personal care market and in our new mexico hospice operation where we still see a number of facilities limiting access which hinders our ability to work with new patients. as a result of the recent increase in covid cases during the last couple of months of 2020 and the ongoing covid precautions in place, we estimate our first quarter 2021 revenues will continue to be negatively affected by approximately 2% to 3% as compared to our pre-pandemic run rate. for the full year 2020, our revenue was $768.4 million, as compared to $648.8 million for 2019, an increase of 17.9%. adjusted earnings per diluted share for 2020 was $3.08, up from $2.50 for 2019, an increase of 23.2% despite the 10-month impact of covid-19 on revenues. our adjusted ebitda for 2020 was $76.9 million, as compared to $58.7 million for 2019, an increase of 31%. our adjusted ebitda margin increased to 10% for all of 2020, up from 9% for 2019 as we continue to see leverage from our increasing size along with the growth in our higher-margin clinical services.
our fourth quarter 2020 operating cash flow exclusive of a government stimulus advance was solid at approximately $24 million. during the fourth quarter of 2020, many of the states where we operate have continued to prioritize timely payment to home care providers. we continue to be grateful to these states and to our mco partners who have remained committed to making prompt payments to providers even with the challenges of the virus. on december 1 2020 we closed on two additional acquisitions: queen city hospice, a large provider of hospice services in ohio; and sunlife homecare, a personal care provider in tucson, arizona. the integration of these operations into addus has been proceeding consistent with our expectations and on schedule. both of these acquisitions will help us expand our services into existing markets with queen city hospice adding hospice services to our ohio personal care presence. i want to again welcome all the team members from queen city and sunlife to the addus family. we continually monitor legislative activity in both washington d.c. and our various states relative to each of our service lines. obviously, the covid relief legislation expected in budget reconciliation is projected to be significant in providing general financial relief to states suffering revenue losses from the pandemic. we are encouraged by the provision included in the proposal that will provide an additional 7.35% in federal matching funds specifically for medicaid home and community-based services.
increasing the federal minimum wage is another proposal we are watching closely that may or may not become law. regardless through our various trade associations, we are developing proposals focused on making sure that states have the necessary resources to raise reimbursement rates commensurate with any rise in the federal minimum wage. to that end we were extremely pleased to see the congressional budget office to our knowledge for the first time score the cost impact of minimum wage increases on medicaid and medicare programs. on the state level, we were disappointed that illinois delayed the scheduled january 1, 2021 rate increase until april 1st of this year. however, the illinois governor introduced his fiscal 2022 budget on february 17 and this rate increase is included effective april 1, 2021. the governor also included funding in his budget for an additional rate increase to offset the upcoming july 1, $1 minimum wage increase in chicago. however, this increase is scheduled to be delayed six months becoming effective on january 1, 2022. this is the last scheduled minimum wage increase for chicago. i also want to update you on recent developments pertaining to our new york business. we currently operate two types of personal care in the state: pca, which is a type of personal care services that represent the majority of our overall revenue; and secondly cdpap, which is a special program where we act as the fiscal intermediary for certain individuals who hire and employ their own caregivers.
in new york, cdpap, we are technically not considered the employer of the caregiver even though they are paid as w-2 employees as the client is responsible for hiring, training, scheduling and direction of caregivers. recently the state announced the winners of an open bidding process that had been under way for a number of months related to the cdpap program in an effort to reduce the number of providers and reduce cost. even though we are a relatively large provider of cdpap services in the state, we were not selected as a winning bidder as part of this process. we know other large providers who are not selected. our current revenue from this service is approximately $52 million annually. at that time -- at this time, it is unclear whether the selected parties will have the ability to fully meet the program's needs. we believe that any transition of clients as a result of this process will not take place during the next six to 12 months during which time we will continue to explore our options including a recently filed protest, which may allow us to continue to provide these services.
let me now turn back to covid for a minute. in late september, we began to experience an increase in the number of reported suspected and positive covid cases for both our patients and caregivers. the weekly average number of confirmed or suspected cases more than tripled between september and december. our weekly case numbers began to particularly accelerate from early november to the middle of december. our peak employee cases occurred mid-december and have continued to trend lower each week since that time. this surge of the pandemic affected our visits, particularly in our personal care segment but also to a degree in our clinical care service lines. our personal care segment was primarily impacted by the substantial increase in personal care staff who were subject to a mandatory 14-day quarantine period. our clinical service lines were impacted due to a further tightening of facility access restrictions and hospitals limiting elective surgeries due to increased covid-related hospitalizations in certain hard-hit communities. for the fourth quarter of 2020, our personal care same-store revenue growth was 2.6%. this growth rate was negatively affected by the increase in covid cases we experienced across our markets. this new surge of the pandemic led to a number of challenges for our company.
as discussed above, during november and december, we saw a significant increase in the number of our caregivers who had to enter into quarantine. we also saw client call-offs increase again starting in november with this increase lasting until the first week of february. our caregiver hires for august through -- for the august through october time frame were up approximately 9% over the same period in 2019. however, during november and december, when we saw the increased virus counts, our hiring slowed to where we were down 1.3% versus those same two months in 2019. while our january 2021 hiring levels were still down slightly from 2020, we did see a nice sequential increase from the hiring numbers we saw in december of 2020. for the fourth quarter of 2020, our hospice same-store revenue decreased 10.6%, as we saw our average daily census decrease 13.5% year-over-year, primarily due to continuing facility access issues in our new york, mexico hospice programs. with continued limits on access to facility-based settings, such as assisted living facilities and skilled nursing facilities, our team has encountered challenges in identifying and working with new patients who need hospice services.
we did however experience sequential same-store hospice admission growth of approximately 7%, due primarily to an increase in our non-facility referral base. our home health same-store revenue decreased by 8.2% year-over-year. we were having our best month of the year in october, when we experienced the increase in covid cases and saw some of our new mexico hospitals resume holes on elective surgeries. since the beginning of 2021, our home health admissions have increased steadily with this favorable trend continuing into february. our acquisition pipeline and liquidity position remains strong. and while we are being appropriately cautious, we continue to believe that we can close additional acquisitions during the next several months. we are primarily focused on acquisitions which strengthen our coverage in existing markets or add clinical services to our personal care business. while purchase multiples for clinical services remain high, we will continue to pursue transactions that bring both revenue and operating synergies to addus. as i look back over the past 11 months, i am proud of our team as they have continued to do a tremendous job of living our mission during these extraordinary times.
our caregivers have been able to positively affect the trajectory and impact of the covid-19 pandemic by continuing to serve the needs of our consumers and patients in their homes. all caregivers, in all segments of healthcare, deserve our appreciation for their commitment to patient care. i especially want to thank the addus team for continuing to put our patients first. before i turn the call over to brian, i want to remind our team of the value of our services. while the covid virus is still a challenge for our country as well as the world, we need to continue to live our mission and values while serving our consumers and patients. each of these individuals need to be in their homes, where we can help to keep them safe from this virus while providing much needed care.
with that, let me turn the call over to brian.
brian poff -- executive vice president chief financial officer
thank you, dirk, and good morning, everyone. addus had another solid financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2020 and for the full year, continuing to demonstrate consistent profitable growth, despite the ongoing challenges and disruptions related to the covid-19 pandemic. as dirk noted, total net service revenues for the fourth quarter were $196 million. the revenue breakdown is as follows. personal care revenues were $164.4 million or 83.9% of revenue. hospice care revenues were $27.6 million or 14.1% of revenue and home health revenues were $4 million or 2% of revenue. our revenues for the full year 2020 were $764.8 million, up 17.9% from the prior year with contributions from both organic growth and acquisitions. and we continue to execute our growth strategy with favorable results. our overall volumes were fairly consistent with the third quarter and continue to trend modestly below pre-covid levels. however, we have a strong business model in place and believe we are well positioned to meet expected demand, especially as vaccines are more widely distributed, consumers become more confident in a less restrictive environment and volumes return to historical levels.
our results also reflect the incremental benefits of the four acquisitions we completed in 2020, three of which closed in the fourth quarter. together, acquisitions completed over the past two years have combined annual total revenue of approximately $214 million. we continue to evaluate and pursue additional acquisition opportunities and have a robust pipeline of potential transactions that meet our target criteria. going forward, we believe the market landscape in 2021 will be advantageous for us to enhance our current operations while looking to complement with clinical services and expansion into select attractive markets. other financial results for the fourth quarter of 2020 include the following. our gross margin percentage was 30.2% compared with 29.9% for the fourth quarter last year. we continue to benefit from the increased mix of clinical services, most recently with our queen city acquisition in december.
while we have been impacted by the recent increase in chicago minimum wage without an offsetting reimbursement increase, we anticipate the recovery of that margin with the upcoming april 1 statewide rate increase in illinois. g&a expense was 22.6% of revenue for the quarter, up from 20.7% last year, primarily related to higher m&a expenses associated with our recent acquisitions. adjusted g&a expense was 19.5% of revenue, up slightly from 19% sequentially with a higher mix of skilled business with a higher g&a profile. the company's adjusted ebitda increased to $20.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $18.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. adjusted ebitda margin was 10.7% an increase from 9.8% for the fourth quarter of 2020 and up sequentially from 10.1% in the third quarter. adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.82 for the fourth quarter, up from $0.73 in the prior year quarter. the adjusted per-share results for the fourth quarter of 2020 exclude the following: covid-19 expenses of $0.01, m&a transaction expenses of $0.15, restructuring and other costs of $0.03 and noncash stock-based compensation of $0.10. our adjusted per share results for the fourth quarter of 2019 exclude the impact of the retroactive illinois rate increase of $0.12, m&a transaction expenses of $0.08, restructuring and other costs of $0.01 and noncash stock-based compensation of $0.08.
our tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 22.4% consistent with our expectation. based on recent legislation and extension of certain tax benefits the company has experienced historically for 2021, we continue to expect our tax rate to remain in the low to mid-20s. dsos were 60.8 days at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with 55.8 days at the end of the third quarter. we continue to see consistent payments from the majority of our payers with home and community based service providers being prioritized in many of our markets. our fourth quarter net cash provided by operations totaled $36.1 million and $109.4 million for the year, a new annual record for addus. as dirk referenced, we did apply for and received provider relief funds during the fourth quarter without, which our cash provided by operations would have been approximately $24 million for the quarter. we intend to utilize the medicaid-based relief funds to benefit our frontline team as they have continued to work tirelessly even in the midst of this pandemic. at december 31, 2020, the company had cash of $145.1 million, $196.6 million of bank debt and $112.6 million in availability under our revolver. even after our most recent acquisitions, we continue to benefit from low net leverage and remain well-positioned to continue to execute on our acquisition strategy.
this concludes our prepared comments this morning and i want to thank you all for being with us. i'll now ask the operator to please open the line for your questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] your first response is from matt borsch of bmo capital markets. please go ahead.
matt borsch -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yeah. i was hoping that you could talk a little bit more about if you are able to about the contract that you were -- you and other large providers were excluded from. is there a characteristic to those that either are new or continuing with the program as opposed to those that were shut out? and how do you -- would you have any thoughts on how you think the protest process will go from here?
dirk allison -- president chief executive officer
we don't know of any characteristics. some of the providers that were selected quite honestly are quite small and have very little business. so it's a little bit of a black box about the formula was undertaken. we have requested information from the state so that we can better understand what went on. we have not yet received that information.
as far as the protest, we believe that enough people protests that have not received the contract. there may be an opportunity for the state to relook at how they did it. but for our standpoint, we're not just stopping with the process. we're looking at other things. it's not -- honestly it's not an extremely profitable business for us. in fact it's probably one of our lowest-margin businesses across the country. but it is something, we will continue to look at as an internal team, talk to the state about and see what's the best direction for the company going forward.
matt borsch -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
that makes sense. maybe just one more question if i could. on the m&a pipeline, particularly on the personal care side, i think you -- maybe it was across all three segments but highlighting some good opportunities. is some of that coming out of just the difficulty -- of continuing difficulty of smaller organizations to manage through the pandemic? and maybe that was worsened by what happened with the virus surge in november-december?
brian poff -- executive vice president chief financial officer
yeah. i think -- matt, this is brian. i think we've seen especially in the personal care segment several opportunities of various sizes. i think a couple of factors there. i definitely think, it's been a little challenging for folks to manage through in a smaller setting in this environment. we are also seeing more states, particularly this year moving into evv, which i think we've talked about in the past. a lot of those folks had kind of moved that can down the road just a bit. but a lot of the states are starting that transition process, which i think is making business for some of the smaller providers a little more difficult and probably a little more likely to be attractive for us.
matt borsch -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
thank you. your next response is from brian tanquilut of jefferies. please go ahead.
jack levine -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. good morning. this is jack levine on for brian. thanks for taking my questions. first, one on the new york state budget just wanted -- we've been getting a lot of questions from investors. wanted to see, if you guys had any thoughts on the budget overall. what the impacts from that purpose cut could be? and then, also, if you've seen any sort of pass-through or impact from the retroactive cut to the managed care plans?
dirk allison -- president chief executive officer
yeah. yes, jack, we trying to tell you what's come out of the new york budget is really difficult. i am not even sure that everybody understands what is in there even at the state level. certainly, from the medicaid standpoint, i think it's talking at a potential 1% additional reduction in medicaid fees. we'll see, if that comes through. from our standpoint, we are just trying to make sure that in that state we are operating as efficiently as we can because of the challenges we see with the overall status -- financial status at the state.
bradley bickham -- executive vice president chief operating officer
yeah. this is brad. we have not seen any impact to the rates currently. right now, we just recently went through contract renegotiations and payer rates with most of our large providers regarding minimum wage pass-throughs and those went successfully. so we're not exactly sure how that will if it all pass through to us.
jack levine -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. great. that's helpful. and then one more for me, just on the -- the employment market outlook, particularly for personal care. i think over the past couple of years we viewed the rate-limiting factor for growth in the personal care segment is really on the supply side of things. just wondering, if there's any color you could give on the outlook for that employment market incremental to some of the commentary you gave on what hiring's looked like recently?
bradley bickham -- executive vice president chief operating officer
yes. this is brad again. certainly on the -- with respect to the employment, we've done a pretty good job recruiting. we saw some significant decline in november and december due to the covid surge. numbers started coming back up in january, have continued to increase slightly into february. when we're looking at long term with the elevated unemployment rates, i think there's the potential there. now, there's going to be some dampening effect of that, if the -- with respect to the proposal on the $400 unemployment benefit that's currently out there or currently proposed. so that may in the near-term cause some challenges for us. but i think once that that expires there should be some good opportunities for us to ramp up recruiting.
jack levine -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thanks, and congrats on a good quarter.
dirk allison -- president chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. your next response is from scott fidel of stephens. please go ahead.
kato bezel -- stephens -- analyst
hey, guys. this is kato bezel [phonetic] on for scott. i'm just wondering, if you could help size the impact from the illinois rate increases for 2021 on an annualized basis? and then just given that you were able to absorb the minimum wage increases in the second half 2020 without much margin impact, i'm wondering how we should think about the potential margin impact on the rate increase for 2021 given that there is the chicago minimum wage hike coming in over the summer? so we're just wondering, if this is kind of more net-neutral or if there's a directional margin impact from those two dynamics?
brian poff -- executive vice president chief financial officer
yeah, kato, i think we expect -- similar to prior years, we've had a similar dynamic in play. when we do get the statewide rate increase keep in mind we saw a higher minimum wage only in our chicago market. the rate increase we're going to get is going to be statewide. and at that time, we will do our typical negotiations with the union on all the non-chicago workers on those wage rates. so typically, how we've seen this transpire and how we would expect it to in the next couple of instances in april and then january of next year, is an increase in revenue with a corresponding kind of typical margin that we would see in that market.
so we've characterized, i believe in the past that, the rate increase we expect to get in april should be on an annualized basis, just north of $20 million in additional revenue and then some margin on that. so the rate increase expected for january of next year would be similar in profile.
kato bezel -- stephens -- analyst
that's it for me. thanks guys.
operator
thank you. our next response is from john ransom of raymond james. please go ahead.
john ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
hey good morning. dirk i'm just curious where you see market multiples now for particularly home care assets where there just hasn't been a lot of m&a recently.
dirk allison -- president chief executive officer
yes. john certainly, it's no surprise for anybody that's followed healthcare services that the multiples for clinical service particularly have been increasing have been quite high. i mean if you look at the hospice multiples they've been 12, 14 or so on an adjusted run rate basis.we suspect that home health is probably near that maybe slightly below. but again there's not been as many quite as many home health deals announced as of this point in time. but certainly the clinical services are in that 12 to 14-plus range at least at this point.
personal care, again personal care has been a little bit quiet the last six to nine months. we have always targeted our personal care the smaller deals at six to seven times; maybe the larger deals eight times, eight and a half times. and our guess is those multiples were probably still pretty common where we think they'll be. we don't think there has been a great uptick in the personal care market as far as valuation at this time.
john ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
great. second question just on your obviously labor is a perennial issue. i mean it's something you got to manage through every year. are you able to assist with getting your personal caregivers vaccinations? or are they kind of on their own from that standpoint?
bradley bickham -- executive vice president chief operating officer
yes. this is brad. great question. we have assisted from the standpoint we've offered a stipend for them to incentivize them to get both doses of the vaccine. that's going pretty well. but as far as being able to schedule for them that's been challenging. what we have done is blasted out information as we get it as to availability of vaccines and how to register and that sort of thing. and i've also put out a fair amount of educational materials to just help them understand the vaccine the safety of it, the efficacy of it. and then in some a couple of markets in new mexico mainly where we have skilled services that are located -- co-located in the same buildings as the personal care they have participated in some drive-through vaccinations.
john ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
and do you have an estimate on what percent of your workforce has been able to be vaccinated?
bradley bickham -- executive vice president chief operating officer
it's -- i wish the numbers were greater. i mean right now we don't really collect that information until they get that second dose and they submit their verification for payments. so, it's going a little slower than we would like, but at least, we are seeing kind of steady progress.
john ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
and i would guess i mean given the not majority but just the prevalence of family on-family, it's maybe a bit less of an issue in aggregate for you than say for home health i mean personal care versus home health. i'm balling down i'm guessing but less of an issue?
bradley bickham -- executive vice president chief operating officer
i mean that's probably correct. i mean certainly on the skilled side when you're providing services in a facility setting that's something that they're going to be looking for. so, we have certainly been promoting and encouraging our folks on the skilled side to get vaccinated quickly. they also have the easier opportunities. they're in that first-tier folks to get vaccinated. so, we're seeing a higher percentage in the skilled side. but i agree with you on the personal care side when you're talking about family caregivers it's probably not as i'd say critical until everybody gets vaccinated in the home.
john ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
great. and i know you've got operations everywhere but did the texas weather issue did it cause any ripples in your operations or hope you guys are all ok and have water and power all that stuff that look terrific. but does that cause any issues this quarter that we should be aware?
bradley bickham -- executive vice president chief operating officer
yes. fortunately in texas, we have just the skilled services. so, they weren't as impacted from as the personal care would be. that being said texas certainly got the lion's share of the headlines related to the storm, but we did see some impact in particularly downstate illinois some of the more rural markets that we serve that also got hit hard with the weather.
john ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
got you. okay. thank you. that's it for me.
operator
[operator instructions] your next response is from mitra ramgopal of sidoti. please go ahead.
mitra ramgopal -- sidoti -- analyst
yes, hi, good morning and thanks for taking the questions. first, the personal care business certainly held up well despite the pandemic. but on the hospice/home health side those lagged a little. i was just wondering, how comfortable or confident you are in terms of resumption of organic growth in those segments as we look out this year and beyond.
bradley bickham -- executive vice president chief operating officer
hi mitra, this is brad. we certainly saw the more significant impact on the hospice and the home health. and first off, on the home health piece of the business, our assets are primarily located in new mexico. they got hit pretty hard with the surge. we saw some of the hospitals there curtail elective procedures in the november and particularly more in the december time frame. what we have seen on home health actually is a pretty good bounce back in january and february with admission volume. so feel pretty comfortable on the home health side.
with respect to hospice, we've looked at the data several different ways. and even though we've had good admissions, sequential admission growth between q3 and q4 and we've actually seen that trend continue into january and february, i think a lot of it is short length-of-stay patients. and when you look at the data, we've seen our length of stay particularly with -- we look at it patients that are in service for less than 30 days. that percentage has increased. but even within that segment, we've seen the average length of stay for those decline a couple of days. and it's going to take a while to -- a little while to see that trend reverse that i think will have an impact on adc. i can tell you january adc has stabilized. february adc has ticked up over january. so we're seeing an encouraging steady increase, but it's going to probably take a little while to get back on track on the hospice side. i would look more to the second half of the year for kind of getting back to normal.
mitra ramgopal -- sidoti -- analyst
okay. that's very helpful. then on the acquisition front dirk, i know you mentioned you have a really strong pipeline across all the segments. i was just curious if -- is there going to be a greater emphasis in terms of entering new geography so to speak or just -- before to consolidate in terms of the existing markets at this point?
dirk allison -- president chief executive officer
mitra, our real focus is strengthening the markets in which we currently operate. we have -- if you look at the number of states, i believe its 23. now, we have left a couple of very small states consolidated that business back into other markets. our goal going forward it's to take those states which we operate and we want to drive hopefully eventually three levels of care in those markets and try to backfill and do that with our acquisition strategy.
now, it doesn't mean that if we had an opportunity in a substantial way to enter in a new market where we felt, we could then get to two or three levels of care in that market, we would certainly look at that. but you can -- for most of what we're looking at today it's more in the markets than where we are currently operating.
mitra ramgopal -- sidoti -- analyst
okay. no that's great. and then finally, just coming back to new york. do you see that sort of one-off or potentially a risk with maybe some other states adopting similar approaches and leading to potentially being locked out of some of these contracts?
dirk allison -- president chief executive officer
new york has always been special. and from our standpoint, it's the state that is kind of an outlier as it looks at this. we don't anticipate -- we have no -- with everything we know in the other states and we operate, this is not even something they would be looking at. there are some states that are going to more -- adding some self-directed programs which we work very well with as an agency with self-directed care. but as far as a true cdpap where the patient themselves are the -- really the employer of the caregiver and we're just kind of that fiscal intermediary that is not something we see elsewhere nor think will spread.
mitra ramgopal -- sidoti -- analyst
okay. thanks again for taking the question s.

dirk allison -- chief executive officer & chairman of the board
thank you, dru. good morning, and welcome to our 2021 first quarter earnings call. with me today are brian poff, our executive vice president, chief financial officer; and brad bickham, our president and chief operating officer. today, i will begin with some overall comments, and then brian will discuss the first quarter results in more detail. following our comments, we would be happy to respond to any questions.
while the pandemic continues to create challenges, we begin -- we have begun to see positive momentum in a number of our markets starting in mid-february. while i expect the environment to continue to have some difficulties over the next several months, we are encouraged by the progress being made with the covid vaccine rollout and the steady reduction in covid cases since the peak in late december. we look forward to the time in the near future when this pandemic is no longer a disruption to both the country and our operations.
one of the important takeaways from this pandemic has been the increased understanding of the importance of home and community-based care. addus caregivers have been an important part of the healthcare system as we work to keep our elderly citizens safe from the virus and made sure that these consumers have the daily help they need. i'm extremely proud of our dedicated team that has demonstrated their ability to meet our mission and execute upon our strategy even during this unprecedented pandemic.
yesterday, we announced our financial results for the first quarter of 2021. we continued our solid operating performance, even with the challenges from covid that we are all facing. our revenue for the first quarter was $205.3 million as compared to $190.2 million for the first quarter of 2020. adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of 2021 was $0.74 as compared to $0.77 for the first quarter of 2020, despite both last year's first quarter being a record quarter prior to the full onset of the covid-19 as well as the effect of the chicago minimum wage increase, which occurred on july 1, 2020. as we had discussed on our last earnings call, the illinois state rate increase to cover this minimum wage adjustment became effective on april 1, 2021, and will be reflected beginning with our 2021 second quarter results.
also last year, our earnings per share, our adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of 2021 was $19.3 million as compared to $17.7 million for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of approximately 9%. as expected, our first quarter same-store revenues continued to be impacted by the covid-19 virus. as was the case in our last few quarters, this reduction occurred to varying degrees in all three segments of our business, which i will discuss in just a few minutes.
as i'm sure you are aware, the changes in the leadership of our federal government is bringing about a number of potentially positive changes to our company, especially around medicaid reimbursement. the covid relief legislation that was signed into law by the president will provide general financial relief to states, suffering revenue losses from the pandemic, which will help to strengthen the budgets of these states and their medicaid reimbursement. we expect to see the funds from the $350 billion state benefit in this bill to be dispersed starting in may.
in addition, the additional 10% federal medicaid match, which is specifically for medicaid home and community-based services, should be a positive for addus. we believe the federal government will clarify the rules around this match soon, which should allow states to start to use these additional monies to support home and community-based services. on the state level, we face one last scheduled minimum wage increase for the chicago. this $1 wage increase will be effective on july 1, 2021.
the governor of illinois did include funding in his fiscal 2022 budget for an additional rate increase to offset the upcoming wage increase. however, this state reimbursement rate increase is currently scheduled to be delayed six months similar to the past few years and is scheduled to become effective on january 1, 2022. we continue to have discussions with state leaders about the delayed timing of the reimbursement increase and potential to accelerate as a result of the additional medicaid funding from the federal government.
as we have discussed on our last earnings call, we continued to assess the new york city path statewide change. while we have approximately $52 million of revenue in this particular service line in new york, it has not been a very profitable program and will be less so with the recently published reimbursement rates. let me remind you that we are only a fiscal intermediary in cdpap with a caregiver working directly for the consumer. this is not our normal form of personal care services. we have filed a protest concerning our omission from the provider selection process and understand from the recent finalization of the fiscal 2022 new york state budget that a few additional awards may be granted.
we will keep you updated as we receive additional information and explore other potential options to remain in this particular program. as to timing of these changes, we believe it will be at least nine to 12 months before the state fully implements the new program if no other structural changes are made. as i previously mentioned, our same-store revenue has been affected by the covid-19 virus. however, we are starting to see a positive trend in all three segments in which we operate. for the first quarter of 2021, our personal care same-store revenue growth was 2.4% when compared to the first quarter of 2020, a last quarter without the full impact from the pandemic.
as we discussed on our last call, during november and december, we saw a significant increase in the number of our caregivers who had to enter into quarantine. we also saw client call-offs increase again starting in november, lasting until the first week of february. in addition to the impact on growth through the covid, we were affected by the february winter storm that spread across several states where we provide personal care services and we estimate had a negative impact on our first quarter personal care revenues of approximately $1 million as a result.
with the fourth quarter covid surge we discussed, we experienced a large increase in our employees who were in quarantine and unable to serve their consumer. we went from 187 employees per week in quarantine in the third quarter of 2020, to 448 employees per week quarantine in our fourth quarter of 2020, which affected our hours of care through january. for april, this number is now down to 149 employees per week, which should help our growth rate return to a more normal level in our second quarter of 2021.
we also saw a similar dynamic as it relates to our client call-offs in personal care. our personal care caregiver hires for the august through october 2020 time frame were up approximately 9% over the same period in 2019, leading to the highest amount of hires per business day in over a year. however, during november and december of this past year, when we saw the increase in virus counts, our hiring slowed to where we were down 1.3% versus the same two months in 2019. our hiring numbers did improve in the first quarter of 2021 with hires per business day increasing 4.2% on a sequential basis and 1.2% over the first quarter of 2020.
we are encouraged with the trend in our ability to hire as we continue to see positive numbers so far in april. with the positive trends we are seeing in personal care, along with the april one reimbursement rate increase from illinois, we expect our personal care same-store revenue to be at or above our expectation of 3% to 5% for the next few quarters. for the first quarter of 2021, our hospice same-store revenue decreased 8.4%, which is still a 2220 basis point improvement over our fourth quarter of last year.
while adc remains under pressure, we did see our highest quarter of hospice admissions since the first quarter of 2020, with a sequential increase of approximately 4.6% from the fourth quarter of 2020. while our admissions have been strong, we have seen a reduction in our same-store median length of stay over the past few quarters. this median length of stay decreased from 26 days early in 2020 to just 15 days in january, which contributed to our lower adc. our median length of stay continued to trend upwards in march, increasing to 17.5 days. january is when we started to see our adc bottom out with slightly increasing adc through the middle of april.
with new mexico being our second largest hospice market, it continues to have an overall negative effect on growth, even while other hospice markets are showing improving census. as for our queens city acquisition, which closed december 1, 2020, our hospice census has grown from 890 when we closed this transaction to over 940 in april of this year, despite the business going through the normal stages of integration, including converting to homecare homebase and adp. i am very proud of this team for being able to continue to grow while transitioning to the addus system.
as for our new mexico hospice locations, we believe we will continue to see both assisted living facility and independent living facilities, losing their rules around personal personnel access as the percentage of new mexico residents who are vaccinated continues to grow and should help this market return to a more normal adc. we are excited to see our home health same-store revenue is back to the level which we experienced in the first quarter of 2020 prior to the effect of the pandemic. this compares to a fourth quarter of 2020 decrease of 8.2% in our home health same store revenues.
since the beginning of 2021, our home health admissions have increased steadily with this favorable trend continuing into april. while january same-store revenues for home health were down 11.5%, february marked the turning point with march being up 11.9% versus the same period in 2020. we are seeing our april home health numbers continue this growth trend. turning to our efforts concerning acquisitions. our pipeline continues to be strong with the current slant toward home health. our primary focus on acquisitions remain on opportunities, which add clinical services to our existing personal care markets with the goal of having additional markets with all three levels of care that we provide.
with our strong liquidity position, we continue to believe that we have the ability to close additional acquisitions during the next few months. while purchase multiples for clinical services remain high, we will continue to pursue transactions which are accretive while bringing both revenue and operating synergies to addus.
as i look back over the past year, i am proud of the team as they've continued to do a tremendous job of living our mission during these extraordinary times. our caregivers have been able to positively affect the trajectory and impact of the covid-19 pandemic by continuing to serve the needs of our consumers and patients in their homes. all caregivers in all segments of healthcare deserve our appreciation for this commitment to patient care.
i especially want to thank the addus team for continuing putting our patients first. before i turn the call over to brian, i wanted to remind our team of the value of our services. while the covid virus is still a challenge for our country as well as the world, we need to continue to deliver our mission and values while serving our consumers and patients. each of these individuals need to be in their homes, where we can help to keep them safe from the virus while providing much needed care.
with that, let me turn the call over to brian.
brian poff -- chief financial officer, executive vice president, secretary & treasurer
thank you, dirk, and good morning, everyone. addus had solid financial performance at the start of the year with consistent profitable growth and improving volume trends comparable to our pre-pandemic levels. with two of our three segments at or above our first quarter 2020 same-store revenues and our hospice adc beginning to trend positively, we look forward to a continued return to a more normalized growth profile as the covid environment improves. we will also benefit from the most recent rate increase from illinois, our largest market, which became effective on april 1, 2021.
looking at the comps over the prior year period. last year's first quarter was our strongest quarter before we really felt the full impact of covid-19. so we were very pleased with the results for the current year quarter. our volumes continue to improve in personal care and home health, and we are optimistic about hospice care volumes returning to pre-pandemic levels as more people are vaccinated, and we see greater facility access. we have a strong business model in place and believe we are well positioned to meet expected demand as consumers become more confident in a less restricted environment.
included in our results are the incremental benefits of the four acquisitions we completed in the second half of 2020; three in personal care and one in hospice, which totaled approximately $84 million in annualized revenue. together, acquisitions completed over the past two years have combined total annualized revenue of approximately $214 million. we continue to have a robust pipeline of potential transactions that are in line with our strategy of adding clinical services in markets where we have personal care operations and continuing to enhance our existing personal care markets.
based on current market conditions, we remain confident that we will have opportunities to achieve or exceed our stated goal of adding a minimum of $100 million in annualized revenue through acquisition this year. as dirk noted, total net service revenues for the first quarter were $205.3 million. the revenue breakdown is as follows: personal care revenues were $164.8 million or 80.3% of revenue. hospice care revenues were $36.1 million or 17.5% of revenue. these results include the first full quarter of our queen city hospice acquisition, which closed near the end of 2020. home health revenues were $4.3 million or 2.1% of revenue.
other financial results for the first quarter of 2021 includes following. our gross margin percentage was 29.8%, an increase from 29.4% for the first quarter last year, largely attributable to a higher mix of clinical services, which are now approximately 20% of our revenue, up from 16% in the first quarter last year. this increase was partially offset by the normal reset of payroll taxes in the new year, which impacted our margin by approximately 80 basis points sequentially.
while we still experienced a negative impact this quarter from the additional minimum wage increase in chicago, on july 1, 2020, the statewide reimbursement increase in illinois that became effective on april 1, will offset beginning in the second quarter. g&a expense was 22.1% of revenue for the quarter, a slight decrease from 22.2% last year. adjusted g&a expense was 20.4% of revenue, up slightly from 20% in the first quarter of 2020 and primarily as a result of the higher mix of skilled business with a higher g&a profile. the company's adjusted ebitda increased to $19.3 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $17.7 million in the first quarter of 2020. adjusted ebitda margin was 9.4%, an increase from 9.3% for the first quarter of 2020. adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.74.
the adjusted per share results for the first quarter of 2021 exclude the following: covid-19 expense benefit net of $0.03, which includes the impact of temporary rate increases, partially offset by covid-19 direct expenses. acquisition and de novo expenses of $0.08, restructuring and other costs of $0.02 and noncash stock-based compensation of $0.12. our adjusted per share results for the first quarter of 2020 exclude covid-19 expenses net of $0.01, acquisition of de novo expenses of $0.09, restructuring and other costs of $0.05 and noncash stock-based compensation of $0.08.
our tax rate for the first quarter of 2021 was 19.5% as a result of an excess tax benefit generated by our stock compensation. for the full year 2021, we continue to expect our tax rate to be in the low to mid-20% range. dsos were 60.8 days at the end of the first quarter of 2021, consistent with the fourth quarter. however, dsos for the illinois department of aging were 72 days at the end of the first quarter of 2021 as we saw slower payments primarily as a result of the timing of tax revenues in the state. with the increase in tax revenues and the stimulus assistance coming from the federal government in the second quarter, we have seen an acceleration in payments from illinois and have received over $24 million since the beginning of april.
our first quarter net cash used by operations totaled $18.4 million, inclusive of the return of $10.8 million in spares act funding received as part of the queen city acquisition. additionally, the timing of normal payroll payments negatively impacted cash flows by approximately $15.5 million in the quarter. at march 31, 2021, the company had cash of $145.1 million, $196.3 million of bank debt and $112.8 million in availability under our revolver. with continued low net leverage and well-positioned balance sheet, we continue to be able to execute our acquisition strategy. this concludes our prepared remarks this morning, and thank you for being with us.
i'll now ask the operator to please open the line for your questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of frank morgan with rbc capital markets.
frank morgan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
i appreciate the color around labor and the issues and the improvement in the worker quarantine. i'm just curious, quarantine aside, labor has always been sort of the thing i think you worry about the host dirk so. so just how do you feel about the labor market today as we sort of make our way into this post-covid world, do you feel better or worse? or are there any new strategies that you're considering or thinking about as the economy reopens?
bradley bickham -- president & chief operating officer
yes. this is bradley. when you look at the labor, as i tell the team in the field, i mean, it's a challenging recruitment environment all the time. we unfortunately, have a turnover in the industry, it's a little higher than we would like it to be. we're actually doing a little better than the industry statistics. that being said, we've got the unique problem since i've been here, where we have, frankly, more business than workers. and i would rather have that than the other. but with respect to recruitment, our numbers have improved. when you look at the trends, april is looking pretty good. i think there's still some headwinds with the additional unemployment out there. economies are reopening.
but again, i think we've done a pretty good job of keeping those numbers trending in the right direction. i know we are working on kind of strategies, both utilizing the national job boards, being creative are constantly refreshing and updating our ads to make them kind of more enticing to these potential employees to click on them. and then also doing a lot of work in the communities and really stressing that we can't forget about what the local community recruitment efforts can look like.
dirk allison -- chief executive officer & chairman of the board
and frank, overall, as you know, we've talked about it for the last couple of years. recruitment has been one of our bigger challenges. i think if you go back to last year, where we were looking at what was going on and then the larger unemployment benefit from the federal government, certainly a very challenging environment. and while it's still a little bit today, as brad mentioned, with the $300, we really are optimistic that over the next few months, we will start to see our ability to recruit and to hire, continue to improve as we've seen in the last month or two. so we're in a much better position in our mind today than we were maybe a few months ago.
frank morgan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got you. and then i guess, switching gears on m&a, your comments about maybe more of a slant toward the home healthcare market. just curious what you're seeing there. i know there was a recent home healthcare hospice relatively good size announced. but what do you see this driving the shift toward home healthcare? is it valuations? or is it just kind of you want to change your clinical mix?
brian poff -- chief financial officer, executive vice president, secretary & treasurer
yes, frank, this is brian. i think what we're seeing in our pipeline, i think we expected to see that coming into this year is just more potential assets coming to market out there. i think last year, i think a lot of us had expectations that we would see a lot of activity and really didn't see that. so i think, we had kind of a bonus of potential targets that are actually coming to market now. so i think we've seen a little plan of that in our pipeline. i think our focus is still largely in clinical services and enhanced personal care. and they all three legs of that stool in each of our markets. i think we just got a little more, i would say, skilled home health in our pipeline today in the other two segments currently.
frank morgan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got you. and then i guess, finally, on the margin picture, i think you called out, at least at the g&a line, the change in your clinical mix is not being able to give as much leverage. but do you still see an opportunity to really get some leverage off your g&a expense as your top line grows and i'll hop? thanks.
brian poff -- chief financial officer, executive vice president, secretary & treasurer
yes, rick, i think we definitely continue to see us leverage, especially in our corporate g&a, but even our field g&a as we add some of these services in, in markets where we have personal care other operations, we should get some additional synergies there as well. so that's our expectation is continued leverage as we continue to grow.
frank morgan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of matt borsch with bmo capital markets.
matt borsch -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yes. thank you. maybe you could just talk a little bit more on the m&a pipeline in terms of what you're seeing in personal care, in particular, that may or may not be coming out as a result of the pandemic impacts. how has that influenced the willingness to sell in the number of opportunities that are out there.
dirk allison -- chief executive officer & chairman of the board
yes. yes, the problem with a lot of the personal care, the bigger ones that have come out that we could look at. there have been reasons why it would be difficult for us to look at either it was a concentration in a market where we already operated, and it would have been a difficult combination or, quite honestly, some of them are revolving around the new york marketplace. and at this point in time, new york is not a focus of our company. we need to see that particular market really stabilize and see the direction that the governor and the leaders of the state are going to take that program.
so for us, while we're always interested in personal care. that is our 8% of our business, we want to strengthen the states in which we operate, continue to look at that. it just seems like lately, the acquisitions of any size have been more on the clinical side, and for us, honestly, hospice has been very expensive. we've reached out in some strategic opportunities with hpa with queen city to acquire those. at this point in time, though, we also feel it's very important to add the home health service to our lines of care. as we continue to look to grow, not only with our relationships with mcos, but as we start looking at the the type of payment situations we may look for down the road with mco partners.
bradley bickham -- president & chief operating officer
and matt, just real quick, just one thing to add to that. i think we're not really seeing, i would say, influx of personal care assets for sale as a result of the pandemic. i think, as you know, with us, particularly in others, all the states we operate and have done a really good job of being supportive with temporary rate increases and the like for home and community-based services across the board. and i think with that, we haven't seen an influx in potential opportunities, but kind of a normal flow.
matt borsch -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
got it. that all makes sense. and actually, dirk, you sort of anticipated my follow-up question, which was on new york specifically in the reimbursement environment. and i know you're not alone in facing challenges there. i guess, maybe there's not much to be said here. it's just that, it is what it is for right now, and correct me if i'm wrong, but there isn't really a catalyst we can see for a more partnership environment emerging in the near-term may or it should, in theory, because the funding has improved in this fiscal situation apparently as well. but sorry, i just sort of was the question here, you put answers to it. but if you have anything more to say on that? i'm interested.
dirk allison -- chief executive officer & chairman of the board
yes. honestly, the thing i would say is it is disappointing. from our standpoint, the state is getting federal money, and there's not been more support from the state as it revolves around home and community-based care. the state has put funding in their budget, but they don't always get that to the provider. it's a very difficult market. there's also changes in the way things are reimbursed there as it relates to benefits to the caregivers, which we're very excited about when minimum wage goes up as long as it's reimbursed, but new york is not, at this point in time, it's not been as forthcoming in some of the other states in supporting those increases. so right now, again, we'd love to be able to be stronger in new york, but it's not a market that at this point in time, we're going to put a lot of additional growth dollars into.
matt borsch -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay, that makes sense. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of scott fidel with stephens.
scott fidel -- stephens -- analyst
hi, thanks and good morning. first question, just actually wanted to piggyback on matt's question just around growth opportunities in personal care and sort of separate from, i guess, m&a opportunities. interested in what you're seeing potentially on the geographic expansion front? and in particular, as you're evaluating some of the potential enhanced funding that's coming through for medicaid hcbs services. are you seeing any states where it does seem like that the states are committing to actually delivering that funding more to the providers and you think could open up new geographic opportunities for you?
dirk allison -- chief executive officer & chairman of the board
well, scott, i think that is something we will be looking at and hope that as rules are clarified, there'll be some opportunities to do that. the problem that i think we have so far is that some of these additional monies that are coming to the federal government are still to arrive and the rules around those funds have not been finalized or at least shared with the states and the providers as much as we would like. so as more clarification of those rules come out, we do believe there's some opportunities, we talked about the 10% additional matcher medicaid funds that's out there for a year. yes, it is temporary. but it is monies that potentially states can use to expand their offerings in home and community case care potentially can use for rate increases they've already talked about. we would hope that maybe that could be utilized to make rate increases happen sooner rather than later. so these are all the things with the various states that we are discussing around the federal money.
scott fidel -- stephens -- analyst
got it. and yes, i realize that we're sort of in that feeling our way through the darkness a little bit here with getting visibility on how these new fundings are going to be translating down into the rates. i guess in a similar vein here, but i would be interested in what you're hearing, if anything, in terms of any additional details on the federal side in terms of buying this $400 billion proposed boost to medicaid hcbs spending? and any type of visibility you're getting into thoughts on how that funding would actually be deployed in terms of what types of initiatives it will be allowed to be used on. and then your thoughts on what you're hearing politically in terms of general support for actually getting this actually included in one of these packages that are being worked on. i would assume that it's obviously part of that first infrastructure bill, would seem like something that would maybe be more appropriate in buying and second families bill. but just interested politically and what you guys are hearing as well around support for that.
dirk allison -- chief executive officer & chairman of the board
yes. well, what we're hearing politically is certainly, there's a lot of support for the $400 billion from the democratic side of both the house and the senate. it does seem to be, at least at this point, the republicans are not quite as on board as maybe the president and the democrats, the rest of the democrats are. so whether or not this is going to end up being part of any bill that may or may not occur, we do believe it's an important part. we're certainly letting folks know that we think it's needed. but we will see. but as it relates to what, we believe it will be used for. and again, remember, there's very little out there, very little detail that we can grasp hold of today. but we do believe that what it's probably going to be focused on is both expanding access to home and computer-based consumers. a lot of those, there's a lot of talk about the waiting list that are out there for this care. so we believe the funds will be directed toward trying to handle some of that waiting list and giving more access to care. and then also, there seems to be initiatives around increased wages for caregivers. to make sure that the caregivers who are, in fact, providing that care have a living wage. so that's kind of what we're thinking that will be useful.
scott fidel -- stephens -- analyst
got it. and then just one last one for me. interested, no was a generally difficult backdrop for the hospice space around some of the pandemic headwinds in the first quarter. but it sounds like queen city was able to deliver pretty solid results month-on-month throughout the quarter. just interested in terms of operationally, you were able to glean anything into some of the trends that they were able to deliver around that performance and whether that would impute to you think that they were likely taking some market share in the market as well. thanks. that's it for mine.
bradley bickham -- president & chief operating officer
yes, scott, this is brad. on the queen city, i mean, we're very impressed with the ability that they showed to grow the business, particularly during the integration process. and i think one thing that really demonstrated to me was the fact that having density in the als and ils that they service was very important. it allowed them to keep access in those facilities. i think during the pandemic, we haven't really tracked the market share numbers, but i suspect we have probably done a pretty good job of taking some market share in those markets. but i think it really goes to show that having density in facilities, if there's any type of shutdown, we're going to pair the list of providers, you're more apt to be the ones that stay in the facilities in mexico.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of brian tanquilit with jefferies.
brian gil tanquilut -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks for all the color that you've got so far. i guess, dirk, my question for you. i mean, having been in the hospice space for a long time. we're seeing, obviously, a broad-based challenge or headwind in the hospice business. how are you seeing this kind of recovery out of that happened? and what do you as a provider need to do to turn that business around? or is this merely a waiting game of just waiting for the recovery post-covid?
dirk allison -- chief executive officer & chairman of the board
well, part of the issue around medium length of stay, it has to do with the fact that a lot of times, a lot of the median length of stay, a lot of the longer length of stay patients come from assisted living facilities, snfs. and not only have we seen the sense in those facilities go down, but we've also seen, as we've got the access. so what's happened is it's now skewed more of the admissions we're getting to acute care facilities, those that have a shorter length of stay. we do believe that as we see this pandemic, the vaccination roll through and the pandemic become less of an issue, we're hoping to see that a couple of things happen.
one, there is a census in the nursing homes that return more to a normal level and that the families that we believe maybe during the pandemic, have delayed the discussion around hospice might be because they're working from home, and they're able to take care of their family member longer. we believe that would return to something that's more normal.
so for us, we're not just stopping there and saying, adc is going to return through length of medium length of state growth over the next few months. we're working with our sales team, we're looking at places that we can try to drive additional length of stay. but i do believe as an industry itself, we should start seeing over the remainder of the year, some improvement in that and leading more back toward the normal level of medium length of stay around the mid-20s.
brian gil tanquilut -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. and then, brian, when you think about the different moving parts on the different reimbursement rates or state reimbursements that are changing. so between illinois, the sequester delay and also the increase in wages in july. if you don't mind just walking us through kind of like your estimates of the numbers, like sequential changes from q1.
brian poff -- chief financial officer, executive vice president, secretary & treasurer
yes. i mean, let's look at where sequentially. so, during the q2, to your point, brian, you'll see the benefit from the illinois rate increase, which is going to be offset partially by the increase in wages in our non-chicago workers, so there will be some margin there. it'll be helpful. so it will move our gross margin up slightly from what you see in q1. you won't have any other real impact in q2 and q3, you'll see kind of an offset in chicago minimum wage increase that dirk referenced in his comments, so we'll see kind of that normal 40 basis points or so reduction there as we don't have reimbursement offset until july unless something changes and illinois is able to pull that forward, and we're in conversations to see if that's possible. and then you get through the end of the year.
and sequester, i think as long as that's out there, we are benefiting like a lot of folks from that as well.
brian gil tanquilut -- jefferies -- analyst
alright, copy that. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question from the line of mitra ramgopal with sidoti.
mitra ramgopal -- sidoti & company -- analyst
yes, good morning. thanks for taking the question. first, i know you talked about federal funding, increased eroding for the industry and also the heightened focus of healthcare being done more in a home setting. i was wondering just from an m&a perspective, if that's resulting in maybe driving up valuations, as you look up opportunities.
dirk allison -- chief executive officer & chairman of the board
mitra, i think there's definitely a lot of appreciation for home care services, especially through the pandemic, even more so. i think prior to covid obviously, there was a value proposition there. i think recover, you also see a lot of choice and reaction to a pandemic type environment and people's preference to be in their homes. so i think there's definitely an appreciation in the space, and that's driving more of the clinical services we've seen, i think, more of those multiples climb out, particularly in hospice through last year. i think personal care multiples that we've seen, the ones that we typically would target have been pretty consistent. we haven't seen a lot of movement in those multiples at this point.
mitra ramgopal -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. that's great. and then on medicare advantage, i was wondering if you have an update there. i know that was seen as a nice potential growth opportunity for you and things got delayed as a result of the pandemic in terms of maybe implementing some programs,etc.. just wondering if you're seeing any pickup in the environment here.
bradley bickham -- president & chief operating officer
mitra, this is brad. with respect to medicare advantage and other value-based arrangements possibilities, we're certainly seeing increased discussion around it, and we're actively engaged in those discussions. we've got several projects out there that are implemented or at various stages of implementation. so i think long term, it's a nice tailwind for the industry. there's a lot more discussion on the federal level about a long-term benefit just recently. so i think there's lots of opportunities. i think the ma piece is still, as we said, a couple of years away from seeing any real meaningful numbers there. but i think in the near term, we're starting to see some pretty interesting projects that we're participating in that i think will further demonstrate the savings that our services can provide
mitra ramgopal -- sidoti & company -- analyst
thanks. and then finally, just on the vaccines and the rollout, etc.. just wondering from internally as it relates to your caregivers, employees, etc., if we've got cases of number of individuals that wanted the vaccine, especially in the healthcare arena. curious if that has been an issue for you in terms of your employees and caregivers, etc.?
dirk allison -- chief executive officer & chairman of the board
yes. on the vaccine front, we've made good progress. i think we're not as far along as we'd like to be overall. but part of that is just some regional differences in the pace of the availability of the vaccine. when you look at our skilled segment, our home health division is probably about just under 50% fully vaccinated. hospice is not quite to that level. it's not probably more in the 40% level. there's more geographic dispersion there. personal care is lagging a little bit behind the skill sectors, but mainly because just access was as not lightly available at the time. i think now what's encouraging is that you don't have to schedule the appointments. you can just show up and get vaccinated. and i suspect that we'll start seeing some pretty good traction there because i think just the ease of obtaining the vaccine, the improvement there is going to be a big driver.
mitra ramgopal -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, thanks again for taking the questions.
operator
[operator instructions] next question comes from the line of matt larew with william blair.
matt larew -- william blair & company -- analyst
hey, good morning. i was just wondering if there's a way that you could try to quantify the impact in new mexico on assisted living, independent living facility restrictions in terms of your access and then maybe give us a sense for how vaccinations have improved your access has approved?
dirk allison -- chief executive officer & chairman of the board
yes. certainly, when we look at just our admission trends, where we really were impacted was a pretty significant reduction in those als and the ils and the snfs. what we have seen in the near-term is snf admissions actually have improved incrementally. so we're starting to see some traction there. overall, admission volume even in new mexico was very robust. so we weren't disappointed in admission volume. it's just a lot of it was late stage. that being said, when you look at where we were last year from the perspective of als and ils, certainly, we're not where we want to be, on those admission volumes in new mexico. but i think there's some optimism that since facilities are starting to open up more in new mexico. and keep in mind, it was probably one of the more locked down states through half of pandemic. i mean, they started kind of early on locking facilities that is down and locking to stay down. and they've just now really got started to reopen.
bradley bickham -- president & chief operating officer
and i think also, if you look at all of our markets related to hospice, the majority of our markets did grow. so new mexico, having this difficulty with being a little bit more locked down than others and being our second largest market, did have a little bit more of an effect that you would like to see.
matt larew -- william blair & company -- analyst
okay. and then i just wanted to go back to announcement you made intra-quarter about homecare homebase and integration with the celltrak epv function. just curious what you think that product will look like. ultimately, that be exclusive to addus? what are you contributing to the project? we'll kind of be curious what the plans are for that? i know you said it would roll out in early 2022. it sounds like an interesting tool potentially.
dirk allison -- chief executive officer & chairman of the board
yes. well, first off, it is a true partnership with homecare homebase and celltrak. we are not investing dollars into the software creation. what we are investing is time and expertise. one of the things that we were able to do with homecare homebase is we probably are one of the top personal care providers in the country, and we understand what we, as a company, at least, need to run our business properly, the type data we need input and output from systems to allow us to have some of the access that we have today on the clinical side. so our partnership there, while it will not be exclusive, we will be the company to really decide how that software system operates. and our goal, as you would expect, because we're going to have personal care all the way through hospice services, we would like to be able to have that record and be able to see that patient regardless of what level of care they are in our company and get the same data out of that. so that's really the aspect we have with homecare homebases today.
matt larew -- william blair & company -- analyst
okay. and then, dirk, just going back to a comment you made about, let's dig an impact the mid-20s. obviously a lot of moving parts there, but would that be kind of a two or three quarter time period? just how long do you think it will take to get back to sort of normalized length of stay?
dirk allison -- chief executive officer & chairman of the board
well, we've gone from 15 days up now to 18 in april. so we've grown three days, which while it doesn't sound like a lot as a percentage, it's a nice move. to get back to the mid-20s, you're probably going to see the third and fourth quarter of this year, it takes us to get there. so we believe by the end of 2021, you should see our medium length of stay closer to where we would expect it to be, which is that mid-20 number.
matt larew -- william blair & company -- analyst
okay. thanks.

at this time, i would like to turn the call over to the company's chairman and chief executive officer, mr. dirk allison. please go ahead, sir.
r. dirk allison -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, dru. good morning, and thank you for joining us for our 2021 second quarter earnings call. with me today are brian poff, our chief financial officer; and brad bickham, our president and chief operating officer. as usual, i will begin with some overall comments, and then brian will discuss the second quarter results in more detail. following our comments, we would be happy to respond to any questions. yesterday, we announced our financial results for the second quarter of 2021.
we continue to be proud of our solid operating performance as we have started to see our markets return to a more normal environment. our revenue for the second quarter of 2021 was $217.9 million as compared to $184.6 million for the second quarter of 2020, an increase of 18.1%. adjusted earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of 2021 was $0.90 as compared to $0.73 for the second quarter of 2020, an increase of 23.3%. our adjusted ebitda for the second quarter of 2021 was $24.3 million as compared to $18.7 million for the second quarter of 2020, an increase of 30.1%.
during the second quarter, we started to see the positive effect of the $350 billion in state aid, which came from the federal stimulus plan. our states have done a nice job in maintaining or, in some cases, increasing receivable payments to addus, leading to a very nice cash flow for the quarter and a cash balance at june 30 of approximately $139 million. our largest state, illinois, as scheduled, increased their statewide reimbursement rate on april one to cover the minimum wage increase, which was effective in chicago on july one of last year. in addition, the state made this rate increase retroactive to january 1, 2021, for the approximate 60% of our business, which is reimbursed directly by the state as opposed to -- through mcos.
as we discussed on previous earnings calls, the minimum wage increases planned for chicago have now come to an end. the final chicago minimum wage increase of $1 per hour, which takes the city's minimum wage to $15 was effective on july one 2021. in the state of illinois budget for fiscal 2022, the state has budgeted to offset this recent july 1, 2021 chicago minimum wage increase with an additional statewide reimbursement rate increase, which was originally to be effective january 1, 2022.
however, with the receipt of the additional 10% fmap which is currently in place from the earlier mentioned stimulus bill, the state has now requested approval from the federal government to accelerate this rate increase by two months, making it effective on november 1, 2021. we are grateful for this consideration by the state and expect approval from the federal government in the next few weeks. we are hopeful that other states will consider similar requests for use of the additional federal funding.
as for our new york cdpap business, which was discussed on our last call, we continue to await word on our formal protest concerning our non-award in the provider selection process for the cdpap program. we anticipate hearing something from the state concerning this protest over the next few months. in the meantime, we did file our response to the state survey, which was created by the state to consider additional awards to providers for this program. while we have no knowledge of when there will be a decision on additional awards, the state recently provided a time line stating that new contracts for winners of this program will not be effective until november 1, 2021, at the earliest.
we continue to believe any changes that will affect addus will most likely be in 2022. with most of our locations returning to a more normal operating environment, we are starting to see improvements in our same-store revenue. our same-store revenue growth for our personal care segment increased as expected for the past quarter, partially due to the illinois rate increase, but also due to increasing volumes. for the second quarter of 2021, our personal care same-store revenue growth was [technical issues] when compared to the second quarter of 2020. our previously announced same-store revenue growth for personal care for our first quarter of this year was 2.4%. however, adjust for the recently announced illinois retro payment for our direct state business, we would have experienced a 4.4% growth rate, which is the upper end of our normal 3% to 5% target.
we continue to be very pleased with the performance of this segment of our business in spite of the challenges we have faced over the last several quarters due to the pandemic. our ability to hire caregivers in our personal care segment is also seeing improvements. our personal caregiver hires in our second quarter were approximately equal to the rate we were able to hire in our previous quarter, which was a marked improvement over the last six months of 2020.
while hiring continues to be a challenge for our team, we are pleased that we are making progress in this area, with june being our highest hiring quarter month so far in 2021. as for our home health segment, our same-store revenue growth was 24.7% as compared to the second quarter of 2020 and up from the flat year-over-year growth we saw in the first quarter of this year. since the beginning of 2021, our home health admissions have increased steadily with this favorable trend continuing throughout our second quarter and into july. a few weeks ago, we announced the pending acquisition of armada home health and hospice. effective august 1, we closed on this transaction, which more than doubled our revenues from our home health segment.
this acquisition helps to give us the increased coverage for our home health to capitalize on our strategy of fully covering the state of new mexico with all three levels of home care that we offer. we are excited about the armada team joining our company, and i want to welcome each of them to addus. for the second quarter of 2021, our hospice same-store revenue decreased 8.4% and similar to the first quarter of this year. however, we did see the same-store admission grow 12% over the second quarter of 2020, which should lead to higher census as the year progresses.
while adc has not yet returned to where we would like it to be, we did see nice growth in our adc during july. at the end of july, our census was over 2,550, which is the highest census we have seen in many months. our median length of stay, which was 17 days in our first quarter of 2021 continues to improve with a medium length of stay in our second quarter of 2021, increasing to 19 days and our july medium length of stay reaching 21 days. our queen city operation in ohio has grown from 890 at the time of acquisition to over 1,000 in july, maintaining the positive experienced -- the positive momentum experienced in 2021.
we are also excited to see our other hospice markets, including new mexico continue to make progress toward our growth expectations. as you saw with our armada acquisition, we continue to focus on acquisitions, which meet our goal of creating multiple markets of scale where we provide all three levels of homecare. for 2021, our focus has primarily been in the personal care and home health segments of our business.
however, we will continue to look at strategic opportunities in all three segments. as we announced yesterday, we closed on a new $600 million revolving credit facility. we are excited to complete this process and are grateful to our bank partners who stepped forward to support addus. with our continued strong liquidity position, we have the ability and the desire to close additional strategic acquisitions during the next several months. with the increasing focus on homecare services as a result of the pandemic, the acquisition landscape remains very competitive, particularly for clinical service providers of scale.
as we have demonstrated over the past few years, we will continue to focus on our strategy to pursue transactions that are accretive and that will bring revenue and operating synergies to addus. while conditions related to the covid-19 pandemic have improved in recent months in the united states, as facts and nations have become more widely available, it continues to be impossible to predict the effect and ultimate impact of this pandemic on addus as the situation continues to [evolve.]
our team is continuing to monitor the covid delta variant and the recent uptick in covid cases. this past 15 months have shown the value of taking care of elderly and disabled consumers and patients in their homes. and as such, we have invested in planning, preparation and materials to assist us in fulfilling our role as we monitor these developments. we firmly believe that the pandemic has raised awareness for the value of our industry -- the value our industry provides and will continue to be an opportunity for growth for our company.
however, our operations and resulting growth are dependent on our dedicated caregivers who work so hard providing outstanding care and support to our consumers, patients and their families. i am thankful for each of our team members, and i'm proud of the job they have done in the past 15 months and continue to do each day. it is important that each of us focus on achieving our mission by putting our patients first.
with that, let me turn the call over to brian.
brian poff -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, dirk, and good morning, everyone. addus had another strong financial performance in the second quarter of 2021, with consistent profitable growth and continued improvement in volume trends across all of our operating segments, personal care and home health exceeding our organic growth targets, our hospice segment experiencing solid emissions and sequential growth in census.
as dirk noted, total net service revenues for the second quarter were $217.9 million. the revenue breakdown is as follows: personal care revenues were $176.3 million or 80.9% of revenue. hospice care revenues were $36.9 million or 16.9% of revenue. these results include the addition of queen city hospice in ohio, which closed at the end of 2020. home health revenues were $4.7 million or 2.2% of revenue. included in our results are the incremental benefits of the four acquisitions we completed in the second half of 2020, three in personal care and one in hospice, which totaled approximately $84 million in annualized revenue.
we also closed our armada home health and hospice acquisition in new mexico on august 1, with $23 million in annualized revenues, and look forward to completing additional acquisitions that meet our strategic criteria. our gross margin percentage was 31.6%, an increase from 29.8% for the second quarter last year, largely attributable to the higher mix of clinical services and up from 29.8% sequentially from the first quarter as we saw the positive impact of the most recent reimbursement increase in illinois. similar to our recent past experience, we anticipate our gross margin to be negatively impacted by approximately 40 basis points in the third quarter by the last scheduled increase in chicago minimum wage that was effective on july 1, with the offsetting state reimbursement increase currently scheduled for january 1, 2022.
we are hopeful, however, that the state's request for federal approval to accelerate the statewide reimbursement increase to november one will be granted. g&a expense was 22.1% of revenue, a decrease from 23% in the second quarter last year. adjusted g&a expense was 20% of revenue, essentially flat from the same period last year and a decrease of 40 basis points sequentially from the first quarter. the company's adjusted ebitda increased to $24.3 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $18.7 million in the second quarter of 2020.
adjusted ebitda margin was 11.2% compared with 10.1% for the second quarter of 2020, an increase sequentially from 9.4% in the first quarter. adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.90. the adjusted per share results for the second quarter of 2021 excludes the following: the impact of the retroactive illinois rate increase of $0.07, acquisition and de novo expenses of $0.11, restructuring and other costs of $0.02 and noncash stock-based compensation of $0.12.
our adjusted per share results for the second quarter of 2020 excluded loss on sale of assets of $0.02, covid-19 expenses net of $0.01, acquisition expenses of $0.09, restructuring and other costs of $0.12 and noncash stock-based compensation of $0.06. our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 26.7%, within the range of our expectation. for the full year 2021, we expect a tax rate in the mid-20% range. dsos were [56.9 days] at the end of the second quarter of 2021 compared with 60.8 days at the end of the first quarter. as expected, we saw strong collections from the illinois department of aging with their dso at 42.7 days at the end of the second quarter of 2021.
our second quarter net cash provided by operations totaled $15 million. however, during the quarter, we also utilized approximately $12.3 million in government stimulus funds that we had previously received, which without addus making these payments, our cash flow from operations would have been $27.3 million. at june 30, 2021, the company had cash on hand of $139.4 million, $196.1 million of bank debt and $112.8 million in availability under our revolver.
as noted in our press release, we executed on a new senior secured credit facility effective july 30, 2021, that expands our revolving credit facility to $600 million from $300 million with no term loans. the agreement has an accordion feature that enables the credit facility to be expanded by an incremental $125 million for funding acquisitions. the maturity of the new facility has also been extended by an additional three years to july 2026. the capital one, national association acted as a lead agent for our bank group, and we appreciate the continued support of all of our lenders.
with this new facility in place, our current availability under our revolver increased immediately by an additional $19 million and further enhances our well-capitalized balance sheet, allowing us to continue to pursue our acquisition strategy. we feel confident addus is well positioned to continue to be one of the leaders in the industry, and we are looking forward to our opportunities for the remainder of 2021 and beyond. this concludes our prepared comments this morning, and thank you for being with us.
i'll now ask the operator to please open the line for your questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of matt borsch with bmo capital markets.
matt borsch -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yes. good morning. i was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit more about the competition for acquisitions. i think it was most intense in the hospice area previously. and so now perhaps it's most intense on the home health side. can you characterize who your -- what types of organizations you're competing against the most? and if i could ask this question also can you reveal if there have been inquiries about addus being acquired by some other organizations?
r. dirk allison -- president and chief executive officer
well, matt, you want to start it off with a hard one today, didn't you? as we look at acquisitions, certainly, this year, as we said earlier, we've been focused most on personal care in home health, although we will look at hospice if it's strategic. and one of the things we found, there are a number of companies out there that are looking for deals.
if you go back over the last few months, you've seen a lot of our larger competitors have acquired companies. there's also been private equity firms out there that acquired companies. and so as we look at it, this is a market that's going -- is attractive. the pandemic has proven that home care makes a lot of sense. and i think a lot of people are wanting to get into this business or get bigger.
i think the one thing that i want to emphasize is that we are going to maintain our discipline to be strategic and to look at deals that are accretive to our company. we will constantly look at opportunities in those major markets that we have talked about in the past, the five or six markets where we want to continue to build like new mexico, where we want to continue to build three levels of care.
and we will be obviously aggressive in those markets if it's a very strategic acquisition. but we also realize that some people are willing to pay more than we are. and at that point, we want to maintain our discipline. as it relates to your last part of the question, addus is not for sale, hasn't been for sale, and we are not in any way talking with anybody about that.
matt borsch -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
alright. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of scott fidel with stephens.
scott fidel -- stephens -- analyst
hi. thanks. good morning, everyone. first question, just appreciate the update around some of the enhanced fmap funds, it looks like visibility is starting to come in, in terms of what you called out, with potentially a faster update in november on the illinois rate increase that was scheduled for january.
just interested, as you're looking across the other states as well in terms of your other key personal care markets. just any type of visibility or indications that you're getting at this point in terms of how some of those enhanced fmap funds from arp may start to flow through into the personal care business?
r. dirk allison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. hi. i think what we're seeing -- and again, a lot of states are still in the planning stage. i think there's kind of an underlying thing that most states are not trying to add long-term -- new long-term plans that would require funding once the fmap dollars go away. as you know, the fmap dollrs are a match for a year.
the states have three years of which to use those funds. states, i think, are doing what -- looking like what illinois did. illinois already had a rate increase plan, and what they decided to do was use partial funds to move that forward 60 days, i think you will see things along those lines being considered in other states. but at this point in time, there's no concrete plans that we're aware of in other states that we could talk to you about today.
scott fidel -- stephens -- analyst
okay. then next question, just, brian, i know you called out the expected impact sequentially in 3q just from the chicago minimum wage going into effect. it would be helpful if you maybe wanted to just bring it up to the higher level in terms of thinking on the ebitda margin progression for 3q and then into 4q. and then how that may shake out when looking at the full year now after having reported the second quarter results, how you're thinking about full year ebitda margin against that long-term 10% plus target.
brian poff -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, scott. i think just looking back real quickly. i mean 2020 was the first year that we had a full year over 10%, which we had talked about a few years ago as kind of being our target. i think we're pretty happy getting into the second quarter of this year and being ahead of 11%. we usually have a lower first quarter as we saw as a result of payroll taxes and the like that reset. so we're seeing some relief there, additional incremental leverage off of our clinical business.
so adding armada is definitely going to help from a margin perspective in q3 to help offset a little bit of what we'll see from the headwind in the illinois minimum wage increase in chicago. if they're able to pull forward the statewide increase to november 1, i think we'll see a nice impact in q4. i think as you guys are aware, typically, with that increase, we see $20-plus million in new revenue statewide, with corresponding cost, but a nice margin attached to it. so i think our thought process looking at the full year of 2021 compared to 2020, we definitely see ourselves coming in with a higher bottom line margin percentage than we saw last year on continued growth and continued expansion.
so with our strategy that we have of adding clinical services where it makes sense strategically, continue to grow and get leverage off of our g&a, i think we would expect to see continued expansion on that bottom line as well into the future.
scott fidel -- stephens -- analyst
got it. if i could just slip a follow-up on that on the ebitda margin side. just as we now roll in the armada deal, which closed into the model. any color you could give us on -- i know you talked about that being immediately accretive financially. but how we should think about the ebitda margin profile on that or incremental eps, just trying to model the margin side on armada correctly. that is it for me. thanks.
brian poff -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. yes, on armada, it's $22 million annualized revenue. so we're coming in for two months in q3 and then you'll see it for full q4, the margin profile, it's primarily home health, a little bit of hospice, but primarily home health. so those gross margins are nice for us at 40-plus percent. bottom line margin is going to be somewhere in that kind of mid-teen range as well.
scott fidel -- stephens -- analyst
thanks.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of brian tanquilut with jefferies.
jack slevin -- jefferies -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. jack slevin on for brian. congrats on a strong quarter. i think we wanted to -- i appreciate all the commentary. i wanted to take a look at the labor side of things in personal care. i guess, just any updates you have on perhaps what the pull-through from your recruitment efforts in may, june, july have been and kind of expectations for top line growth as some of those unemployment -- elevated unemployment benefits roll off as we get into the back half of the year?
brad bickham -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yes, this is brad. i'll start with talking about the kind of candidate flow we've seen. april, may, a little slower. june was a really good month for us, from both a candidate flow and a hiring standpoint. july numbers actually look good as well. i think what we're seeing on personal care is as these unemployment benefits are starting to -- the enhanced benefits are starting to phase out in various states and then early september entirely.
i think you're starting to see people try to get ahead of that and start applying for jobs. so we're encouraged by the increase in the candidate flow. i think it did bode well for some continued consistent hiring. but as far as on the growth trajectory, i mean, i think we've said the 3% to 5% is the long-term goal, we'll be at the higher end of that range we expect in q3.
jack slevin -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then on the hospice business, obviously, i think the challenges are well adjusted and understood in the market. but could you just give a sense of where you're at like maybe july trends on median length of stay and average length of stay? and how you guys are thinking about adc tracking through the back half of the year?
brad bickham -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yes, it's brad again. on the hospice side, i mean, what we've been pleased that when we look at where we were at our kind of low point in january, we have had seen a steady increase in median length of stay and a steady increase in adc each month, that has continued through july as well. and i think our july median length of stay is 21 days.
if you remember -- recall our kind of low point was in january at 15 days. so we're adding about a day a month. and i think heading back up toward our normalized kind of mid- to upper 20s on the median length of stay, which we anticipate that we'll get there kind of -- we certainly have said the back half of the year, and it looks like that trend is continuing.
jack slevin -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. okay. and then last one for me. on some of the medicare advantage pilots, i appreciate that probably you don't have to too much data left or collected at this point. but have you seen any uptick in payers that are interested in running more medicare advantage pilots in the core personal care business or anything there?
i think we're hearing a lot of chatter on the payer side about nonmedical determinants of health and social determinants of health, those kind of buzzwords are picking up use. so i just wanted to kind of hear your thoughts on what the landscape looks like there and how we could think about the opportunity set rolling forward a couple of years?
r. dirk allison -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we have seen increased interest from a number of our payers in putting together pilot programs to try to determine the effectiveness of personal care inside, say, a medicare advantage program or a managed medicaid program. in fact, we're working on a number of other pilots that we hope to announce over the next few months. and to the point that we're pretty busy. so i would say long term, it bodes very well.
i think that in the interim, what we have to do, a number of our programs are designed to give us the information and to work with our [payers] on whether it be gaap closures or whether it be on clinical measures such as er visits and readmissions. and as we get that data -- and we're hopeful that we're starting to see some of that data now.
as we get that data and it continues to be what we expect it to be, then we would think long term, we would be able to show medicare advantage plans that by incorporating nonclinical care into their offering, we can overall affect their cost of care. so we're excited about the future, but it's going to take some time. it's not going to happen overnight because a lot of these pilots are just starting, but we're excited about the interest we're seeing.
jack slevin -- jefferies -- analyst
awesome. that is it for me. thanks again and congrats.
operator
your next question comes from the line of mitra ramgopal with sidoti.
mitra ramgopal -- sidoti -- analyst
yes. hi. good morning. thanks for taking the question. i just had a 2-part question on the labor front. first, if maybe you can give us an update in terms of the progress you've made regarding vaccines among your caregivers. and secondly, if that -- with the surge in the delta variants, et cetera, if that's having an impact in both recruiting and the ability to also bring on new business?
brad bickham -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
mitra, this is brad. on the vaccination front, honestly, we're not where we would like to be overall. we're at about, i think, 35% overall. however, on the skill side, is considerably higher. we're actually a 60-plus percent on the home health side and almost 60% on the hospice side. we're continuing our efforts to educate our caregivers on the benefits of being vaccinated, but it's an ongoing process and certainly more challenging with a personal care workforce that is largely part-time workers.
so just trying to get those individuals vaccinated and also getting honestly good data on that. i mean i think if that 35% is fully vaccinated employees, and it is a little more challenging to pull those numbers through, and i suspect the number is actually higher than that than what we're seeing. with respect to the delta variants, i really haven't seen an impact yet from the delta variant, either from standpoint of referral volumes or from employee quarantines, or from affecting the hiring trends yet. so it's something we're certainly mindful of and certainly keeping an eye on. but right now, haven't seen anything material impact on our numbers.
mitra ramgopal -- sidoti -- analyst
okay. no. thanks for that. and just a quick question on the m&a front. just curious in terms of the valuations you are seeing today, maybe relative to a year ago, if it's there's been a significant change and also just the competitive environment for acquisitions if that's also gotten a little more difficult?
brian poff -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, mitra. i think, on the valuation front, i think in personal care, we really haven't seen much of a change there. i think on the skilled side with a lot of the folks that are trying to kind of enter into the market that we've seen that dirk was referencing earlier, whether it be through private equity or otherwise, definitely has driven some competition up there.
so [putting] of size and scale and quality, i think you've seen a little bit of a higher multiple being paid, particularly seems in hospice. i think home health, we haven't seen that impact as much. so i think from our perspective, yes, it's an attractive space for a lot of individuals, it's very competitive. if you get in a broker process, this is going to be competitive.
as we've said, i think, a couple of times, we're doing our best to try to do our own sourcing as well to try to maybe avoid some of the situations and not be forced into situations where it's a higher price auction that kind of be in line with our strategy of making sure we're getting good assets that are accretive for addus and for our shareholders. and i think we've got good opportunities to continue to close those type of deals.
mitra ramgopal -- sidoti -- analyst
okay. thanks for taking the questions.

operator
good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the addus homecare third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to dru anderson. please go ahead..
dru l. anderson -- senior vice president and principal
thank you. good morning, and welcome to the addus homecare third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. to the extent any non-gaap financial measure is discussed in today's call, you will also find a reconciliation of that measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated according to gaap by going to the company's website and reviewing yesterday's news release. this conference call may also contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, including statements, among others, regarding addus' expected quarterly and annual financial performance for 2021 or beyond.
for this purpose, any statements made during this call that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. without limiting the foregoing discussions of forecasts, estimates, targets, plans, beliefs, expectations and the like are intended to identify forward-looking statements. you are hereby cautioned that these statements may be affected by important factors, among others, set forth in addus' filings with the securities and exchange commission and in its third quarter 2021 news release.
consequently, actual operations and results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
i would now like to turn the call over to the company's chairman and chief executive officer, mr. dirk allison. please go ahead, sir.
dirk allison -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, dru. good morning, and welcome to our 2021 third quarter earnings call. with me today are brian poff, our chief financial officer; and brad bickham, our president and chief operating officer. as is our custom, i will begin with a few overall comments, and then brian will discuss the third quarter results in more detail. following our comments, we'll be happy to respond to any questions. yesterday, we announced our financial results for the third quarter of 2021, and we are proud of our operating performance.
our team was able to produce record results in the quarter despite certain pressures from the current operating environment that i will discuss. our revenue for the third quarter of 2021 was $216.7 million as compared to $194 million for the third quarter of 2020, an increase of 11.7%. adjusted earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of 2021 or $0.91 as compared to $0.76 for the third quarter of 2020, an increase of 19.7%. our adjusted ebitda for the third quarter of 2021 was $24.9 million as compared to $19.5 million for the third quarter of 2020, an increase of 27.4%.
during the third quarter, we continued to see the positive effect of the $350 billion in state aid, which came from the most recent federal stimulus plan as our states have done a nice job in maintaining and, in some cases, increasing outstanding accounts receivable payments to addus leading to a strong cash flow quarter and a cash balance at september 30 of approximately $152 million. over the past few years, i have discussed the minimum wage increases, which were occurring in chicago.
these annual minimum wage increases have now been fully implemented. the final chicago minimum wage increase of $1 per hour, which takes the city's minimum wage to $15, was effective on july one, 2021. it is important to note that this cost increase is reflected in our third quarter results without a corresponding reimbursement rate increase, which had a negative effect on our operating margin. as we told you during our last earnings call, the state of illinois budget for the fiscal year 2022 planned to offset the chicago minimum wage increase with an additional statewide reimbursement rate increase, which was to be effective january one, 2022.
however, with its receipt of the additional 10% fmap funding through the previously mentioned stimulus bill, the state has requested approval from cms to accelerate this rate increase by two months making it effective on november one, 2021, and appear confident that they will receive approval for a november one increase. this rate increase will cover the entire state of illinois and positively impact our fourth quarter financial results.
several other states have requested approval from cms for changes to their home and community-based service programs utilizing the additional federal funds from the 10% fmap. many of these requests include proposed reimbursement rate increases for our services. we hope to see these requests approved by cms in the near future and to learn more about the specific reimbursement rate increases included in those requests.
along with our positive operating trends, we saw some near-term pressure related to other developments that impacted our third quarter financial results. our ability to continue our new york consumer-directed business, as we discussed on our last call, remains uncertain as we continue to await word on our formal protest concerning our non-award and the provider selection process for the cdpap program. we anticipate hearing something from the state concerning this protest over the next few months, although no official timetable has been released.
in the meantime, we filed our response to the state's follow-up survey, which was created by the state to consider additional awards to providers for this program. while we continue to await decisions on any additional awards, we have stopped accepting most new referrals for the new york cdpap program due to the uncertainty of continuity and negative reimbursement changes for a portion of our business that was already one of our lowest margin contracts.
as a result of the covid impact and our attentional approach to the new york cdpap over the past 12 months, we have seen our revenue in this program decreased from an annualized run rate of approximately $52 million as of the third quarter of 2020 to approximately $44 million as of the end of our third quarter of 2021. we expect our revenues from the new york cdpap to continue to decline in the absence of changes to the existing status as we continue to limit new referrals. our third quarter results were also modestly impacted by an increase in the number of caregivers in quarantine due to the surge in covid infections resulting from the delta variance.
while the impact of this most recent surge in the covid virus was not as significant as the one we saw during the fourth quarter of 2020, we did see an increasing number of missed visits due to call-offs. these call-offs peaked in september and steadily decreased through the month of october. these call-offs had an immaterial effect on our third quarter revenues. while there was no impact to our third quarter results, another challenge that we, like most companies face today is the issue concerning vaccinations.
as many of you know, the federal government has proposed that all healthcare employees whose businesses operate under a condition of participation with medicare or medicaid must be vaccinated. this proposed vaccination mandate would cover our home health and hospice segments. in addition, new york, delaware and the city of philadelphia have mandated that all healthcare companies, including personal care, must ensure that their employees in those markets are vaccinated.
companies like addus are also operating under the potential of an osha requirement that all employers with 100 or more employees must mandate that their employees be vaccinated. these various city and state mandates as well as the potential of federal mandates make it imperative that we focus on getting as many of our employees vaccinated as possible. while addus has not mandated vaccines for our employees, we have taken a number of steps to strongly encourage our employees to get the covid vaccine. over the past few months, we have implemented a number of initiatives designed to increase the vaccination rate of our employees.
these include a stipend for getting vaccinated and ongoing communication program centered around the theme of be a hero, which includes videos with corporate leadership and board members as well as written communications with stories of caregivers who have received the vaccine and now a program that provides prize opportunities for vaccinated employees. these efforts have been effective as we have seen our vaccination rates continue to increase.
with new york being our largest market with the current vaccine mandate, it has been a priority to get our employees vaccinated and to track vaccination status. our dispersed workforce makes this process more challenging. but as of today, we have confirmed that roughly 93% of our new york caregivers have now been fully vaccinated or received their first dose of a two-shot regiment. we are very pleased with this response from our employees but we also realized that all markets may not embrace the mandate like they have in new york.
while vaccine mandates are a potential issue for addus, we are pleased in the progress we are seeing. overall, our confirmed vaccination percentages are 79% vaccinated in home health, 71% vaccinated in hospice and 56% vaccinated for personal care. based on our experience with our new york caregivers, we believe these numbers could be understated by some amount based on incomplete information. we are still working to ascertain vaccination status for all employees, which is an ongoing process, particularly with our dispersed personal caregivers.
as of today, we have not seen any material effect on our revenues due to these various mandates, and we continue our efforts to be well positioned to adhere to any future mandates implemented as they occur. a critical item for our personal care organic growth is the ability to hire new care givers. a tightening labor market had some effect on our growth in certain markets and particularly, oregon, idaho and tennessee. many segments of the economy are seeing labor shortages, which may continue and may be more severe in some areas of the country. however, our overall hiring in our personal care segment continues to see improvement.
we saw solid growth in our hires per business day during the third quarter in our personal care segment with september being our best hiring month of 2021. this favorable hiring trend continued into the month of october. our personal caregiver hires in our third quarter were up slightly over the third quarter of the prior year and a 5.8% on a sequential basis with most of the increase occurring in september. now let me discuss our revenue growth in our various operating segments. our same-store revenue growth for our personal care operation exclusive of the new york cdpap program was 4% when compared to the third quarter of 2020.
this growth is within our range of expectations for our personal care segment. with our upcoming illinois rate increase, we expect to be at the high end of this rate of growth over our next few quarters. we are pleased with the performance of this segment of our business in spite of the challenges we have faced over the last several quarters due to the pandemic. as for our home health segment, this segment of our company has continued its strong performance.
during our third quarter of 2021, our same-store revenue growth was 24.8%. since the beginning of 2021, our home health admissions have increased steadily with this favorable trend continuing throughout the third quarter. we are excited about our home health operation, and we'll continue to focus our efforts on expanding this part of our company. on our last earnings call, we discussed our belief that we would start to see a steady growth in our hospice adc during the last half of 2021.
with strong hospice admissions since the beginning of the year, we believe that a corresponding increase in our adc would come. we are pleased to see the beginnings of this growth in our third quarter hospice results. while our hospice same-store revenue decreased 4.8% over a strong third quarter in 2020, it was an approximate 400 basis point improvement over our second quarter same-store growth. as we saw in the second quarter of this year, our same-store admissions continued to be strong, growing 22.3% over the third quarter of 2020 and 14.5% on a sequential quarterly basis.
this should continue to lead to higher census as the year progresses. our hospice adc grew to 2,629 for the third quarter of 2021 as compared to an adc of 2,460 for the second quarter of this year. this improvement is consistent with our expectation of seeing our hospice census gradually improve over the last half of 2021 as our median length of stay also continues to improve from our low point in january of this year. we are also seeing an improvement in our hospice volumes in both als and snfs both of which have been slower to return than census outside of the facility setting.
in july, we announced the acquisition of armada home health and hospice effective october one, we closed on our acquisition of summit home health, a home health provider in illinois. this represents our entry into clinical services in illinois, our largest state for personal care services. this is consistent with our strategy of adding clinical care to our personal care markets. we are excited about our armada home health and hospice as well as summit home health being a part of our company, and i want to welcome all of our new team members to the addus family.
as you saw with both of these purchases, we continue to focus our acquisitions -- on acquisitions which meet our goal of creating multiple markets where we provide all three levels of home care. we will continue to look at our opportunities in all three segments with a focus on acquiring services in markets where we have strong personal care coverage. this past 18 months has shown the value of taking care of elderly and disabled consumers and patients in their homes during the pandemic. we have invested in planning, preparations and materials to assist us in safely fulfilling our role as we continue to monitor developments related to the pandemic and changes in the home care industry.
we believe the pandemic has raised awareness about the value -- our value our industry provides and will continue to be a growth opportunity for our company. but our operations and resulting growth are dependent on our dedicated caregivers who work so hard providing outstanding care and support to our consumers, patients and their families. i am thankful for each one of our team members, and i am proud of the job they have done in the past 18 months and continue to do each day. it is important that each of us focus on achieving our mission by putting our patients first.
with that, let me turn the call over to brian.
brian poff -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, dirk, and good morning, everyone. addus had a record financial performance for the third quarter of 2021 with consistent profitable growth and solid volume trends. we saw strong organic growth in both personal care and home health with continued improvement in hospice as we expected. with sequential growth in hospice admissions average daily census and median length of stay, we anticipate a return to positive year-over-year organic growth in that segment by the end of 2021. as dirk noted, total net service revenues for the third quarter were $216.7 million, up sequentially from $214.9 million in the second quarter when adjusting for the out-of-period illinois retro rate increase that was included in our second quarter results.
the revenue breakdown for the third quarter is as follows: personal care revenues were $169.6 million or 78.3% of revenue, an increase from $165.9 million in the prior year quarter. hospice care revenues were $39.1 million or 18% of revenue, an increase from $24 million in the third quarter of 2020. and home health revenues were $8 million or 3.7% of revenue, an increase from $4.1 million in the prior year. as dirk mentioned, we decided to suspend materially all new referrals in our new york consumer-directed program due to the continued uncertainty of the program.
when excluding the new york consumer-directed revenues, our same-store revenue growth in personal care was 4%, consistent with our expectations and within our target range of 3% to 5% and in spite of modest pressures during the quarter from the delta variant and a tightening labor market. home health organic growth in the third quarter was 24.8% over the prior year with strong admission trends. our hospice organic growth deficit is improving, down 4.8% for the third quarter of 2021, but an approximately 400 basis point improvement sequentially from the second quarter.
our home health and hospice revenues during the quarter both benefited from the acquisition of armada home health hospice, which was completed on august one. we look forward to a full quarter contribution from armada in both of these segments in the fourth quarter. together with the recently completed summon home health acquisition in chicago, we have added combined total annualized revenue of approximately $30 million so far in 2021. we continue to evaluate and pursue other acquisition opportunities, and we have several projects in our pipeline that meet our criteria, but primarily in clinical services.
other financial results for the third quarter of 2021 include the following: our gross margin percentage was 30.9%, an increase from 29% for the third quarter last year, largely attributable to our growing mix of clinical services. this was a decrease sequentially from 31.6% in the second quarter of 2021 as we saw the impact from the final increment of minimum wage increase in chicago negatively impact our gross margin as we have not yet received a corresponding reimbursement increase.
with the state of illinois application to advance their previously scheduled reimbursement increase from january one, 2022 to november one, 2021, and we expect to see the benefit from this statewide increase in the fourth quarter. g&a expense was 21.4% of revenue, a slight increase from 21% of revenue a year ago and lower sequentially for 22.1% in the second quarter with lower acquisition and stock compensation expenses. adjusted g&a expense was 19.5%, up slightly from 19% for the same period in the prior year on a higher mix of clinical services with a higher g&a profile. however, adjusted g&a expense was lower sequentially from 20% in the second quarter.
the company's adjusted ebitda increased $24.9 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $19.5 million in the third quarter of 2020. adjusted ebitda margin was 11.5% compared with 10.1% for the third quarter of 2020 and an increase sequentially from 11.2% in the second quarter. adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.91. the adjusted per share results for the third quarter of 2021 exclude the following: acquisition and de novo expenses of $0.08 and noncash stock-based compensation of $0.11.
the adjusted per share results for the third quarter of 2020 exclude the following: covid-19 expense of $0.02, acquisition and de novo expenses of $0.02, restructuring and other costs of $0.08 and noncash stock-based compensation of $0.07. our tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was 26.6% within the range of our expectation. for the full calendar 2021, we continue to expect a tax rate in the mid-20% range.
dsos were 52.9 days at the end of the third quarter of 2021 compared with 56.9 days at the end of the second quarter. we continue to see consistent payments from the majority of our payers, including another strong cash collection quarter from the illinois department of ag whose esos were down to 36.4 days at the end of the third quarter of 2021. we continue to see strong cash flows with our third quarter net cash provided by operations totaling $17.6 million.
at september 30, 2021, the company had cash on hand of $152.4 million with $224.9 million of bank debt. under our recently expanded revolver at the end of the third quarter, we had capacity and availability of $367 million and $123.8 million, respectively, and remain well positioned to execute on our acquisition strategy. this concludes our prepared comments this morning, and we would like to thank you for all being with us.
i'll now ask the operator to please open the line for your questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of matt borsch with bmo capital. your line is open.
matt borsch -- bmo capital -- analyst
yes. impressive results, particularly given all the circumstances. let me ask you about the m&a pipeline and how that may be changing given what we've been going through here. and to the extent you can comment at all about what kind of valuations are prevailing and how that may have changed? i'm particularly interested in the hospice side where for a while their valuation and maybe this is still the case that we've been quite elevated.
brian poff -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, matt. i think what we're seeing currently in the pipeline, i think our valuation ranges really haven't moved from the projects that we've been working on. i think we still have several things that we would like to continue to progress. but as you know, we're being very selective in what we're looking to acquire both from a valuation standpoint, but also a good strategically with where we have overlap in our service lines. so i think we feel still pretty positive about what we're looking at today. haven't seen valuations move. i will say i think we've seen probably a little bit of a slowdown in maybe things coming to market through brokered processes. i think two, three, four, five months ago, there's quite a bit more activity. we are seeing a little bit, i guess, less activity in that regard over the last couple of months.
matt borsch -- bmo capital -- analyst
okay. great. and are you trying to emphasize the home care side of the business just given that, that remains a fairly small percentage of your overall revenue?
brian poff -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i think we definitely -- we indicated this in the last couple of quarters as well. our focus has been on trying to add clinical services where we have significant personal care assets. so i think that still is consistent with what we're looking at today and home -- skilled home health is obviously a much smaller portion of our business. so we were happy to bring on summit this last quarter, which gives us our first clinical services in illinois. it was a small acquisition, but i think it's in really well with chicago, which is our largest personal care market. so where we can continue to replicate that type of acquisition in the future, we definitely would like to. if we get a little more size and scale, definitely has always preferred as well.
matt borsch -- bmo capital -- analyst
alright, thank you.
operator
thank you, our next question comes from the line of scott fidel with stephens. your line is open.
scott fidel -- stephens -- analyst
hi, thanks. good morning. interested if you could maybe give us a little thoughts on the headwinds and tailwinds just in terms of thinking about modeling revenues and margins sequentially. just thinking about in the last couple of quarters, it seemed like the street has probably been a little bit aggressive on the revenue side and a little bit conservative on the margin side. so trying to get in front of that a little bit here. and understand that you don't provide formal guidance, but maybe giving us some framing to think about sequentially for 4q relative to 3q.
brian poff -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, scott. i think liked to fourth quarter, obviously, with the illinois rate increase coming on board in november, which we expect to get full approval on that from cms or the state to get approval, i'm sorry, very shortly. obviously, that's going to be a benefit, not just to revenue but also to margin as we've taken the impact of the chicago minimum wage increase. keep in mind, we'll give all of our non-chicago workers that increase. at the same time, we get the rate increase. but so would be a benefit for us in q4. so i think your point is well taken, looking at q3 as kind of a baseline move into q4, especially from the top line and revenue expectation we've seen consistent sequential growth. i think we would expect to see that continuing into q4. we'll benefit from one extra month of armada in q4 and summit, which is the small acquisition we did up in chicago. but thinking about it from a margin perspective, we should see the benefit of illinois particularly in q4. if you look forward into 2022, especially in q1, with reset of payroll taxes, you've got potentially the medicare sequester holiday ceasing at the end of the year, probably would expect to see some of that rationalize in q1.
scott fidel -- stephens -- analyst
alright, thanks. got it. and then just as my follow-up question, just i guess, back on to cdpap and the situation there. and appreciate you calling out the annualized revenue contribution, that's helpful. that's still a bit tricky, i think, for all of us in terms of what to do with that contract in our models at this point and whether to keep it in or not? so not asking you what we should do with our models there, but if you could give us some insight, i guess, into sort of where you think things sit from a timing perspective at this point. and i know you mentioned that it's a much lower margin now on that contract. but if you were able to clean out even more specifically what you think the annualized ebitda contribution is from cdpap, i think that would be helpful for us to try to ring-fence if that contract did go offline.
dirk allison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. honestly, scott, as we look at what's going to happen with the cdpap program and at least in our mind, we're going to continue to limit new referrals into that program. we're concerned not only about our ability to continue in that program because of a contract, but also the profitability of that as the state has come out with -- and lowered the reimbursement for that particular program. so we have continued -- as you will see, since the last year, we started right at about a year ago, starting to limit that -- those referrals were down almost $10 million in revenue to around $44 million annualized today. you should see that continue to decrease at a similar rate over the next year. the only change would be if the state came through, gave us contract and adjusted their rates so that going forward, providers in that particular program can actually make a return then we would consider continuing to service new clients. but right now, we'll continue to see that decrease, as far as the margin...
brian poff -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i think, scott, i think to dirk's point, timing is going to be probably something we don't have a lot of insight into you, unfortunately, right now. i think the state has not really come forward with any kind of a set time table. so i think we had said a few months ago, we -- they've kind of put out this potential for a november one period of starting to transfer patients. i think we were a little dubious of that even at the time. haven't seen that come to fruition. so hard for us to put a box around when will we see that transition, assuming that we you did not say in the program through one of the various methods that dirk described in his comments earlier, i think from a margin perspective, we're down to $44 million in annualized revenue. our margins there are in the kind of that mid- to upper single-digit range. so it's a pretty low-margin contract. so not material for us. and as that continues to kind of trail off, i think even continues to lessen the exposure.
scott fidel -- stephens -- analyst
ok, that's helpful. thanks.
operator
thank you.our next question comes from the line of frank morgan with rbc capital markets. your line is open.
frank morgan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
good morning,i was hoping we could kind of go back to the sort of the -- what you're seeing in terms of momentum exiting the quarter? i think you gave a little bit of commentary about hospice. but as you look across all three of the segments, maybe what you're seeing so far in the year. and i guess i'm also curious on the hospice side since that's the one that's been sort of the drag is maybe more color specifically on the recovery in that mix of snf and alpha pools. that's my first question.
brad bickham -- president and chief operating officer
yes. frank, this is brad. with respect to kind of where we stand in the various segments exiting the quarter, what's encouraging on the personal care side, it was probably impacted the most from a covid standpoint with quarantined employees. we started seeing those numbers decrease toward the end of september, and that's continued into october. also kind of a driver is our hiring metrics, which have been strong. september, surprisingly was actually our strongest hiring month, not just this year but actually the strongest over the last two years. i don't know if that's a reflection of some of the stimulus money coming to an end with respect to the enhanced unemployment benefits, but the timing seems to match up. with respect to and then just related to that october hiring trends have actually been pretty favorable there as well.
and we still continue to see robust demand for our services. with respect to home health, home health has been just checking along. and we've had some really good quarters, i anticipate -- of course, the comps are going to start geting a little more challenging because of all the growth that we've had this year. but optimistic that, that's going to continue traditionally on the home health side, kind of as you get later in the year, a lot of people going to try to use surgeries and stuff to use up any deduct or any deductibles that they have under their plans. go ahead and get them out, taken care of this year. so you'll see a pickup kind of late q4 and then into q1 there. with respect to hospice, we've actually seen a couple of things going in. since january of this year, we bottomed out on our median length of stay.
we've seen nice sequential increases in our median length of stay. it's not quite up to the mid-20s yet, but it's around 20, 21 days. october, it looks like we may have picked up about a day there as well. so it seems -- and continuing to see some good admission volume. now we'll say hospice in q4 around the holidays tend to slow down a little bit and then pick up again in q1. as far as the mix, we have seen actually a pickup in both als and nursing homes. we started seeing the smith volume pickup last quarter. this quarter, we actually started seeing the als pick up as well. so we're still not back to what our kind of prepandemic mix is. and i think that's going to take some time with facility occupancy levels increasing, but certainly, we started seeing a nice pickup there.
frank morgan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got you. maybe as a follow-up, in terms of home healthcare and hospice how much agency labor or just premium labor that have you had to use? and then maybe a brine question. just remind us what the annualized effect of that sequester would be on all your medicare revenues? thanks.
dirk allison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, i'll take the staffing question first. we really have used minimal outside staffing on both home health and hospice. we've been fortunate there.
brian poff -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. on sequester, frank, i think when that goes away just with the mix of our skilled business today, that would probably be around $3 million in total. but keep in mind, we're also going to get our kind of annual cpi rate increase here in the fourth quarter as well that will probably help to offset that. so i think the way we look at it going into next year, assuming that sequester holiday does go away, will be essentially flat, but i wouldn't expect to see us have a net rate increase going into next year, but essentially flat.
frank morgan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok, thanks.
operator
thank you, our next question comes from the line of matt larew with william blair. your line is open.
matt larew -- william blair -- analyst
hi, good morning. i just wanted to ask maybe the latest you're hearing around the potential for some hcbs funding and a legislative package before the end of the year. i know there's been many iterations and discussions around that, but just kind of related to hearing on the whole.
dirk allison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. certainly, we -- like everybody else, we're sitting here waiting to see if the democrats are going to get together and pass the reconciliation bill. right now, as we understand it, there's $150 billion in the current draft of the reconciliation bill that will be dedicated to home and community-based care. as far as really having any further insight of where that stands, all we know is that it is still in the build today but we have no knowledge of when and if this might be passed.
matt larew -- william blair -- analyst
okay. and then just one on a previous question. you mentioned you utilize much contract labor. obviously, a number of your peers have referenced that. they also referenced things like additional bonuses, pretty significant increases in the wage trend. did you also not experience that? and i guess, any thoughts on why you've been able to avoid some of those near-term staffing challenges?
brian poff -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i think when you look on the staffing side, i mean, one, our exposure on the clinical is certainly not as maybe significant as some of our peers. but it is -- we're starting to see some wage pressure, certainly, in particular markets. so nurses specifically, are more competitive. we've had to make some proactive adjustments there on the compensation side. so far, we've avoided some of the special bonuses. but we are having to make some proactive adjustments on the -- for wages, particularly with respect to nurses. but we've been fortunate to be able to avoid any of that premium labor so far, but it's a competitive environment out there on the clinical services.
dirk allison -- chairman and chief executive officer
and administrative.
brian poff -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. and we're starting to see administrative services kind of across all segments. that is a much smaller part of our cost structure. but certainly a service coordinators our personal care side, which are schedulers certainly starting to see some wage pressures there.
matt larew -- william blair -- analyst
ok, appreciated. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of brian tanquilut with jefferies. your line is open.
brian tanquilut -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you, good morning guys. i guess, brian, first question for you or maybe for dirk as well. i know in the past, you've talked about kind of like a goal of acquiring at least $100 million of revenue a year and year at $30 million this year. so i know you typically source your own deal. so just curious, brian, you said you're not seeing that much or there's a slowdown in brokered deals, but what are you seeing on the deal front from your own bd team. and are there any changes in the market that you would call out that would explain some of the slowdown in your typical m&a pace?
brian poff -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i think specifically, i just talk about kind of our pace for this year. and we had some projects that we were working on early this year. and i think as you guys know, we're pretty stringent in our diligence process. we also are looking at things that are very specific and strategic to us. we're not looking to necessarily just make acquisitions to make acquisitions. so kind of through that selective process and then some things that didn't get across the finish line, i think, has put us where we are a little behind where we'd like to be as far as acquired revenues for this year.i will say the year is not over just yet. it's still in november. but we still got some things in our pipeline that we're excited about, and we'll see if we can get those through our process and to close.
so i think from a market perspective, i think what we've seen, as i mentioned a little bit earlier, just broker processes, we're not seeing the level of activity we saw probably over the summer. it seemed like there were several things out in the market at the time. a lot of those that didn't fit well with us, but we are probably feeling that broker processes a little slower toward the end of the year. i think you had a big bolus of people that we're looking to get out to the market and advance the potential cap gains issues. i think they realize now going into the end of the year, that's probably going to be difficult to get closed this year.
so maybe their decision process to say it's better to kind of rebase off of a delta wave and look at going out early next year, not really sure. that's a little speculative on my part. but that's probably all i can really say that what we're seeing different in the market today.
brian tanquilut -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. and then, dirk, just any updates you can share with us on the ma front in terms of your efforts to try to gain traction there and maybe expand into the m&a market?
dirk allison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. again, brian, what we've been doing as it relates to medicare advantage and really the whole value-based care approach. we currently -- as we said, we've announced one deal with presbyterian where we're working on a value-based approach. we hope to -- we should be announcing further deals soon, which will show that we're into a number of pilots all related around value-based care. and the reason i talk about that is even though some of the pilots will be doing or managed medicaid providers. the data that we're going to develop or are developing from these various pilots will allow us to sit across with the medicare advantage providers and talk about how we can help them control their medical loss costs. so we're still very excited about this. in fact, we believe value-based care is a real opportunity not only for addus, obviously, but for others in the industry.
we think the market is headed that direction. we have a team that is working specifically around value-based care and what we can do in the future with medicare advantage. it's just, again, it's not going to be something that flips the switch and becomes material to addus in the next year or so. it's going to take three or four years for us to continue to work with these various companies and present the opportunity we believe we bring to them to lower their cost. so we're still excited about it, but it's going to be a long-term process.
brian tanquilut -- jefferies -- analyst
ok, thank you guys.
operator
thank you, our next question comes from the line of john ransom with raymond james. your line is open.
john ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
good morning. have you seen any material inflection in labor supply since some of these states ended their unemployment benefits?
brad bickham -- president and chief operating officer
yes, john, this is brad. we have -- i mean, it certainly appears to be with -- if you look at our september hiring numbers, which corresponds when the enhanced federal unemployment benefits expired across the country. now we did see a nice pickup there. it was our strongest personal care hiring month in over two years. so whether that's specifically tied to that, not sure. but it seemed to correspond with it, and particularly in our hiring numbers, honestly, kind of in the illinois market increased pretty significantly, particularly in the chicago area, which was one of the ones that had unemployment benefit enhanced benefits out there to early september.
john ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
great. and then conversely, in states that you're operating in that are embracing vaccine mandates as sort of a harbinger for maybe some -- the federal program that you talked about. have you been able to navigate those as successfully, more successfully, less successfully than you might have thought?
brad bickham -- president and chief operating officer
yes. actually, i think more successfully than we would have thought. i mean, now new york being the largest market that is subject to a vaccine mandate that applies to our personal care caregivers, as dirk mentioned in his script, i mean, we ended up around 93% vaccinated. we still have a few out there employees that i think are still considering getting vaccinated. impact was pretty negligible. it's probably less than 2% on hours out of the gate with the mandate going into effect. so it's something that we're certainly monitoring and whether new york is going to be the same as downstate illinois or montana or idaho is to be seen.
but we're really pushing hard and encouraging our caregivers to get vaccinated and not just for -- in preparation of the mandate, but we just, honestly, as a company, i think that's the right thing to do. we do believe that in the best interest of our employees. i mean if you look at the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. so we're still continuing to push it. our biggest challenge, honestly, is just understanding the vaccination status of a very dispersed workforce is primarily part time for us. we still have a lot of unknowns, and that's our focus over the next month or so.
john ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
and just remind me the current stat on percent of your labor that's family members and how that may have evolved over the past couple of years?
dirk allison -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. we're probably around 35% family caregivers, and that's a good point when it comes to the vaccine mandates. what we have seen at some of the local levels is that family caregivers or those that are residing in the home are typically exempt from those mandates. so we'll have to wait and see what happens on the federal front and with some of these other mandates, but we have seen some relief there.
john ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
