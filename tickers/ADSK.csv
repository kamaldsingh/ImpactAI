thank you. (operator instructions)our first question comes from the line of phil winslow of wells fargo. your line is open.
philip alan winslow -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my question and congrats on great start to the year. i just wanted to drill into your comment about just the linearity of the quarter, scott you mentioned that the quarter's billings and it was well within your assumed range with revenue at the low end just because of linearity, but your full year expectations are unchanged. wonder if you could just drill into that, where was the linearity different was it something about specific industries or more geographies, and sort of how are you thinking about the go forward there?
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, phil. it was -- it's certainly within the range of our guidance and our planning, $735 million was the low end of our guidance range. so it wasn't a significant variance from what our expectations were. so we did see those both q3 and q4 had -- but i'll call better linearity. so earlier, linearity in each of those quarters, as we came into q1, q1 actually ended up with the linearity of similar to last q1, as opposed to the improved linearity that we've seen in q3, and q4, which i guess is not really surprising, given that, beginning of the year, people don't have budgets yet, sales teams are going through sales kickoff, et cetera. so we ended up with the same linearity we had in q1 a year ago as opposed to kind of the improved linearity we've seen in q3 and q4 and that's what pushed us to the low end of the range.
i'll go ahead and answer your follow-up question, which is our assumption for q2. some (ph) linearity is that it'll look more like q2 '19 as opposed to the improved linearity that we saw in q3 and q4, it doesn't really have an effect on the full-year, you see full-year guidance remains unchanged, and you see, actually, q2 guidance shows a pretty nice step-up sequentially as a result of getting some of that, and that came in a little bit later in the quarter, obviously we have it for the full quarter of q2. so it doesn't really change our view at the year. that was a good strong start to the year. just had linearity more in line with what we had seen a year ago as opposed to what we had seen in the prior two quarters.
philip alan winslow -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
got it. then just a follow up for andrew. it was great to hear some of those wins on the plangrid side, buildingconnected, wonder, if you can provide just more color on this early feedback you're getting now you provided some earlier, but how you think about bringing this into the product line and maybe even also using buildingconnected even almost as a funnel for plangrid as well. just some more color there that would be great.
andrew anagnost -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. so what was the second part you said about plangrid there phil.
philip alan winslow -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
sorry to say (ph) as a funnel, potentially you're seeing bid management, actually you've been using that as a sort of lead management, so to speak for plangrid?
andrew anagnost -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. that's exactly, and actually you've hit on one of the points that's important about this coming (ph) year. the plaingrid folks and the buildingconnected folks immediately found some synergies between how they approach the market and their individual businesses. so there's a strong flow of leads and discussion back and forth between those two teams, and that plays a pretty integral part. remember, buildingconnected has visibility to the whole entire project bidding environment within the us. and obviously, plangrid is super eager to go and talk to those projects about how they can improve site execution and effectiveness and success for their particular projects. so that's one of the big uplifts we're seeing is some of the connection between those two offerings.
and frankly as we brought buildingconnected in, we saw a very nice surge in their business. like i said, they had their best q1 ever in terms of new business, because people just like the fact that they're part of autodesk and that -- what they're focusing on with the bid management is -- it's a good tool, they added a lot of features in there during q1. and it's a solid result.
philip alan winslow -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. thanks, guys. i'll get back in queue.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of saket kalia of barclays capital. your line is open.
saket kalia -- barclays capital -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions here. maybe first for you andrew, just picking up off the last line of questioning on plangrid. clearly, it seems like it's off to a good start. and i believe the initial approach here was to let them operate largely separately at least for the vast majority of sales. but it seems like you were able to really cross-sell to some mutual customers relatively early on. so can you just talk about how you sort of envision the combined company maybe looking by the end of this fiscal year planggrid plus autodesk
buildingconnected, and within that maybe touch on on the -- just a very minor overlap you might have with some products with autodesk versus plangrid, and how you plan on sort of handling that?
andrew anagnost -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. so first off, all let me comment on some of those synergies we found in shared accounts. so one of the things we did very quickly as we established how we were going to go-to market with our named account side of our business, and a lot of the places where we're seeing like joint shared updates (ph) are in our named account business. so that was a place where we have a named account rep, where we can come in and say, hey, look you know what, we can augment your solution with plangrid and we can do some -- we can get this project, put it up on plangrid, we can get this project put it up on bim 360 that's where you're seeing a lot of collaboration, that fits within our standard salesforce, and it's functioning really well, and we have an interconnect strategy between those two, and a quarter retirement strategy that allows people to cross-sell and get benefit in terms of quarter retirement for both sides of the equation.
now what you see that plangrid team being highly effective at is doing land and expand in new accounts in the construction ecosystem. and we focus a lot of that team on going out and reaching construction companies that we historically did not touch. and that's where they're spending a lot of energy. so they leverage our named accounts team for some of these synergistic sales and they go out and they find new business out there using their existing infrastructure, which works very effectively.
as we move across into the year, what you're going to see is basically -- we're going to maintain that essential structure, but we're going to make sure that we coordinate sales more tightly within the autodesk construction group as we move toward the end of the year. but we're going to continue to have that synergistic relationship between our named account program and the salesforce that sits inside of the construction group.
and we just -- we just think those synergies are going to increase as the year progresses. remember, we just rolled out a tokenized version of plangrid as well, and you know how effective we are at driving usage within some of the named accounts underneath our eba, so you're going to see that have a synergistic factor as well and it's all brand new. i mean, we're very, very early on, in that.
saket kalia -- barclays capital -- analyst
got it. that's really helpful. maybe for you scott, just to peel back the onion a little bit on arr. it was actually a little funny, the maintenance arr number actually came in a little bit below what i was expecting, but i think the consensus is actually a little bit higher. maintenance at this point is getting to be such a small part of the business, but i guess maybe just to better help -- better calibrate, maybe the pace of decline, any sort of idea for how we should think about that pace of decline in maintenance arr, maybe through the rest of this year or some broad brushes?
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so it's a great question, saket. the m2s program, of course, just entered its third year, right, at the beginning of q2, we just entered the third year of the m2s program. and this is when the more significant price increase goes into effect for those who want to renew maintenance.
ahead of that what we've seen is the maintenance renewal rates, we're not talking subs in renewal rates anymore, but if we were the maintenance renewal rates have held up very nicely in that space. and so we continue to see both success with conversions. i said that on the -- during the script that was in the range that it had been historically, of those that convert the upsell, the collections continues to be good. we're down to at this point just short of 700,000 maintenance customers left, and that i'm super pleased. we started this with a little more than 2 million maintenance subs, and we've now moved all but at about 700,000 over to product subscription. i think this year is the year where we'll see a lot more of the remainder move over. so what i would -- my expectations is we'll continue to see good success with that moving over. and of those that elect to say -- to stay what we have seen is the minus renewal rates are holding up nicely.
saket kalia -- barclays capital -- analyst
very helpful. thanks guys.

thank you. next question comes from the line of jay vleeschhouwer of griffin securities. your line is open.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
thank you. good evening. andrew, let me start with you. one of the things that you've talked about with respect to digital infrastructure is your usage telemetry, your ability to observe and collect data about how customers are employing the products, particularly now the -- it's mostly subscription. can you talk about any trends or key observations that you're getting from the use of telemetry (ph) particularly in the growing collection space.
second question there's been quite a bit of commentary in the call thus far with regard to direct sales, and how you're handling the integration of the construction acquisitions. a broader question perhaps about customer engagement, you like some other companies have created a new customer success group, and this has become increasingly common in software. what do they do? and how do you measure the success of the customer success group?
andrew anagnost -- president & chief executive officer
okay. all right. so let me start with the first question about the kind of the insights we're seeing. so we'll -- there's a few things i can tell you, one of the insights we're getting is, usage is continuing to go up, it's going up nicely across numerous product sets. and that's really great to see.
the other thing we're seeing is that collections are seeing usage patterns better than the old suites in terms of how many products people are using, which shouldn't surprise you, because there's more offerings inside -- more diverse offerings inside the collections and we're seeing some of those things.
and one of the other things i'll tell you is that the ramp up of quote (ph) new releases that were moving away from what we would like to consider major releases. people are ramping up on to the latest capabilities relatively quickly including the people who don't pay us, which is important for us to talk about, because it says, that cohort of non-paying users continues to follow us into some of the newer capabilities. and i think that's important in terms of the future capability of capturing some of that opportunity as we move forward.
so yes, we are seeing some more fidelity in terms of usage, and we are seeing some interesting trends and some things that looked a lot better than they were in the suite days.
now in terms of the customer engagement team. the first thing i want to talk about is what is the team measured on? they're measured on net revenue retention. okay. that's their job. their job is to go in there and renew and help grow those accounts, and that's the primary metric they track. they also have metrics around nps (ph) for the interaction that they have with the customers, not kind of global npss, but relationship npss and network net promoter scores around the various interactions.
but, primarily, we measure them on how well we capture money from the renewal base and net revenue retention in particular. the way they function is a function along the spectrum from low touch -- low human touch digital relationships all the way up to high touch engagements.
one of the digital infrastructures we built that's facing this team is what we call the early warning system, it's an umbrella of a lot of metrics that basically give this team a sense for how healthy an account is how healthy are they on their usage capabilities, how healthy are they on their adoption of learning tools, on other tools, has there been a drop off, and it helps them kind of spend their time with the accounts that need the most assistance and the most engagement with autodesk. it is a new practice, we've beefed it up, it consolidates several things in the area, but i just want to emphasize the number one thing they're revenue -- they're measured on is net revenue retention and that's how we track the success of that organization. scott, do you want to add anything ?
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
no. i think you nailed it. that's -- we -- the customer success team under ray has actually done really nice job so far, and one of the things we mentioned jay in the in the opening commentary is that our net revenue retention rate has stayed right in the range that we talked about at investor day. last year, all year, it was in that approximately 110% to 120% range, and it stayed right there again in q1. so ray and his team are off to a really good start.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
very good. thanks very much.

thank you. our next question comes from heather bellini of goldman sachs. your line is open.
heather anne bellini -- goldman sachs group inc. -- analyst
great. thank you very much, gentlemen. i had a question about -- i know your referenced to linearity in your prepared remarks. i was wondering, if you could share -- if you noticed any impact or what you're hearing from your manufacturing customer base in the quarter just due to the kind of ongoing tariff war that seems to be going on, and if they've given you any sense of whether or not that's impacting their own spending plans?
and also -- i'm just also just because i'm getting asked myself, you obviously had very good outperformance, it seemed on long term deferred versus some people's expectations. could you share with us kind of how did short-term dr track versus your expectations? and that's it. thank you.
andrew anagnost -- president & chief executive officer
so i'll take the first part, then i'll hand the second part over to scott. so you saw our manufacturing business grew quite nicely during the quarter, really strong growth. now that doesn't mean we aren't hearing from our manufacturing customers that they're seeing pressure in terms of the commodities they use to build their products and things associated with that. they absolutely are. all of our customers are paying more for certain basic things to bring into their business.
but you have to understand what we sell to them isn't a commodity, it isn't a metal or a fabrication or a supplier. it's a mission critical tool and it's a mission critical digital process. and a lot of our customers see these tools and expansion of their investment with us as helping them be more efficient and be more effective when they're seeing cost pressures rise in other areas. like a lot of those competitive wins i talked about are really focused on consolidation of multiple tool sets into the single solution we offer, which is easier to deploy. it's lighter touch. it's got more and more end to end things, the different types of price points. so customers are actually looking to us to help them get more efficient, while they're seeing the cost of things that roll in the door to make their products go up.
so we have not seen any kind of backing away of expenditures in our software space. we're seeing no signs of it. we haven't seen it yet, it doesn't mean things can't change. but we also -- we do know that our customers are turning to us to make them more efficient. and i think that, that puts us in a good position when they're seeing the cost of other parts of their business go up.
now i'll turn it over to scott for the second part.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
sure. on the second one, it's interesting, heather, of course what you see showing up in long-term deferred, the sequential growth. there's some of the success we're having in -- having multi-year payments get closer to the mean that they had been in historically. we're still not quite there, right? so there's still a little more headroom in long-term deferred to get to what we talked about at investor day as that being kind of a low 20% range.
if you look at the growth rate year-on-year, the long-term deferred grew 12%, short-term deferred actually grew 21% year-on-year. so we're seeing really nice performance as you'd expect when you see the billings line grow the way it as has. we're seeing really nice performance across the deferred revenue spectrum. when you add in unbilled, total deferred revenue grew 24% year-on-year. so it was a obviously strong billings quarter that led to both good revenue results, but in particular, strong growth in deferred.
heather anne bellini -- goldman sachs group inc. -- analyst

thank you. our next question comes from the line of matt hedberg of rbc capital markets. your question please.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions. andrew, we continue to hear positive feedback from channel partners around generative design, it really transforming the whole design process. i know this remains a focus for you guys. wondering about a little bit of an update there on this momentum and really customer receptivity to this -- sort of this new way of designing ?
andrew anagnost -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. well, there's a lot going on there, and we're rolling out a lot more in generative tools, especially to the fusion platform. manufacturer going to see some new capabilities in terms of generative geometry creation tied to 2.5 axis milling constraints and more of the mainstream kind of cnc applications the customers use. so we'll probably going to see a little bit of an explosion of use of some of these tools as we roll some of this out. but you're right, we're getting a lot of adoption. and the partners are excited about it, because they can go in and have a very, very differentiated discussion with their customers about what they can do with these tools.
now one of the things we're seeing, and i want to make sure that people understand this, because people thought, well, these are really advanced things, isn't just like 3d printing focused, and isn't this just for people that want to create organic shapes for 3d printing. the biggest usage right now that we're seeing with regards to generative design is people exploring new types of design options for things that they either had existing or they are building from scratch, and then taking those explorations and turning them into things they can build using their traditional manufacturing methods.
so they're essentially using generative design as a tool to show them new solutions to problems that they wouldn't have naturally found in the first place. and that's one of the exciting things about what's going on right now is that, it's having a real impact in the mainstream (technical difficulty) customers and in the customers that are kind of looking out on the cutting edge of things. so you're absolutely right, there's lots of reasons to be excited and our partners are really getting engaged in our manufacturing portfolio, because of generative.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
that's great. and then maybe just a quick one for scott, obviously, a lot of questions on the construction opportunity. i'm curious when you think about adding sales capacity to this year, how do you kind of think about into the overall pace, and then, how do you think about putting that sort of like more or so in the construction versus a&e or the manufacturing side, just sort of wondering about, just sort of how you kind of allocating your sales capacity adds this year ?
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
sure. construction is such a massive opportunity for us matt, it won't surprise you to hear that we rotate a lot of investment into it. coming on the heels of the acquisitions we did in the fourth quarter, we've also increased spend in each of those. it wasn't the normal buy them and go through a bit of a downsizing, we've actually done the reverse. we've acquired those companies, integrated them nicely into autodesk and at the same time increased the investment in construction. so great results out of the gate as andrew mentioned in the opening commentary, and i think you can expect to see us at this level of performance, and what the market really beginning to turn this direction, you can expect to see us continue to invest in construction.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
sounds good. thanks, guys.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer

thank you. our next question comes from the line of ken talanian of evercore isi. your line is open.
ken talanian -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the questions. so for the customers that are still on maintenance, do you have a sense for how the percentage of that group who might upgrade to collections compares to the folks who are already converted?
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
what i'd say ken is really haven't seen the needle move much on that. we've had great success at the point of people moving from maintenance over to product subscription, we've had great success having them kind of cross grade and instead of going single product to single product, going single product to collection. and that really hasn't changed over the last six quarters or eight quarters now that we've been tracking into us. so i'm not expecting a significant change.
the one thing i would note in the demographic which is quite not surprising to you, the bigger customers that aren't eda (ph) eligible, obviously the bigger customers that were on maintenance were some of the first to adopt into us and move over. it's not as bigger skew as you might think from the biggest to the smallest, but there is a little bit of a bias to the larger customers. as we get down to the smaller and smaller customers, we might see a point or two difference there, but i wouldn't expect it to be significant. andrew, anything you'd add?
andrew anagnost -- president & chief executive officer
no. i think we've seen a consistent pattern, and we don't see anything that would indicate that changing. i agree with you. it's probably going to make a point or two different as we get deeper into that base. just because of the size and because maybe a mix shift inside that what's left to the maintenance base.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
all right.
ken talanian -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. and are you seeing any non-payer conversion from the shift to a serial number free licensing model.
andrew anagnost -- president & chief executive officer
we always see non-payer conversion every year. so one of the things i just have to say, because i say it every call, this non-paying conversion thing isn't going to be this big explosion, all right. it's an ongoing process. some of these people have very clever ways. they continue to not pay us. but what i will tell you is that we've successfully rolled out some really interesting ways to have conversations with these customers and engage with them directly. and we are learning a lot that we think is going to play pretty significantly into our long-term strategy with regards to converting these people.
we have direct engages with them. we can track where they go after an engagement whether or not, they continue to pirate or they pursue some kind of other path. so we're learning a lot. and that's what we expected to do this year. every year, we convert non-paying users into users, every year, we convert more than we did the previous year. but more importantly, every year, we're learning more about how to effectively engage with these customers. and that should give you a really good feeling about the long-term growth prospects as we start looking at those 14 million non-paying users and converting them over the next few years.
ken talanian -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. that's helpful.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer

thank you. our next question comes from sterling auty of jpmorgan. your line is open.
sterling auty -- jpmorgan chase & co -- analyst
yeah. thanks. hi guys. i think you gave commentary that you saw strength across geographies, obviously see the pie chart with the percentages. but just wondering for -- about some colored commentary. looking at the pmi results coming out of europe today, there's been questions in other areas of software around possible squishing as here in north america, what are you seeing from just the macro by geography ?
andrew anagnost -- president & chief executive officer
so we're not seeing any kind of geography-based slowdowns. and by the way, the pmi in emea has actually been in contraction territory for a while. so it isn't like a new phenomena. and for us, we see the pmi as measuring a different side of the demand curve. it's much more focused on the purchasing of kind of the core assets that kind of go in the door and come out as product. we're selling efficiency in digital transformation. so right now, we -- and what -- actually let's just look back historically, we've never seen a strong correlation between the pmi and near-term impacts on our business.
long term, as the pmi phasing (ph) contraction territory, you absolutely, eventually would see an impact on our business. short-term what people do is they tend to buy more of our software to try to invest in digitization and kind of getting their processes more aligned, more efficient. so we're not seeing any slowdown in any geographic areas. and the ongoing pmi results don't signal anything to us in terms of our demand environment.
sterling auty -- jpmorgan chase & co -- analyst
okay. and then one follow up, do you mind as where are we in terms of the various pricing or discount changes both on maintenance and other parts that you had outlined at the beginning of the transition. what changes recently went into effect if any? and what were the impacts ?
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. sterling on the -- you're talking about the maintenance to subscription program that we're --
sterling auty -- jpmorgan chase & co -- analyst
yeah.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
that we just began or if you remember, we started that program actually kind of middle of q2 a couple of years ago. so we just began the third year of that. and at the third year, what we have said then and just went into effect at the beginning of may is the cost to convert -- the price to convert would go up by 5%, the price through renew maintenance from last year, the price through new maintenance have got up 20%.
so both of those increases went into effect in early may. so we're sitting three weeks into that right now, not expecting to see any significant change in terms of renewal rate. i do think at this point, it probably becomes a lot more attractive for those that have gone under maintenance, to actually make the conversion. through the first quarter what we saw in conversion rates, as they kind of held in at that roughly a third that are converting at about the point of renewal. we'll see now with the difference in -- pretty significant difference in price. we'll see how that goes in this quarter and through the end of the year.
sterling auty -- jpmorgan chase & co -- analyst

thank you. next question comes from the line of matthew broome of mizuho. your line is open.
matthew broome -- mizuho -- analyst
thanks very much. you recently launched 2020 additions (ph) to autocad, revit and some other products. just curious how early feedback has been for that. so that which new features you believe will have the biggest impact?
andrew anagnost -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. so like i said earlier, we've seen pretty rapid adoption of these capabilities as they rolled out, which actually bodes well for how customers are reacting to those things. i don't have any feedback on particular feature sets. because we're working like a big lumps of areas, like in one area we're working on in revit in particular, is on rail and things associated with rail and adding capabilities that make it more efficient for rail. so there's going to be lots of areas and each one of these products that are broadly accepted. but when it comes to autocad in particular, customers are starting to embrace the multi-platform nature of what we've done with autocad, and the way we're making it easy to integrate not only our own storage environments, but third-party storage environments like dropbox and box, and other types of environments, so that our customers can efficiently use autocad data in multiple types of storage environments.
one of the features we rolled out and it doesn't get a lot of visibility is that when a customer is inside the dropbox environment, and they go and they click on a dwg files, it actually launches the autocad -- autocad web, the viewer -- and it put its full autocad web, and it actually says, you are subscriber, if you're a subscriber they get the edit experience. but it is the -- autocad web version inside these applications, that kind of reach that we're getting with some of those things is actually exposing more and more customers to the power of the mult-platform view we've taken with some of these applications. so i think you're going to hear more and more about what we're doing there.
on the revit side, you're going to hear more and more about some of the things we're doing around rail and other areas, where we're extending the capabilities to be not just revit, but in infraworks such as more specifically say it's on the infraworks side. you're going to hear more and more about some of those things as well. but those are some of the areas that are getting a lot of interest and a lot of traction.
matthew broome -- mizuho -- analyst
that's interesting. thanks. and i guess, could you provide a brief update on the media and entertainment business. it looks like there was a little bit of revenue deceleration there during the quarter.
andrew anagnost -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. so there's a couple of things you want to know about the media and entertainment business. one, it's very sensitive to large deals. all right. so for instance in q4, we had a couple of really big deals in m&e. so there was a quarter or a quarter change around media and entertainment just related those deals. last q1, we also had a big deal that came in. and like i said, the media and entertainment business of all our businesses is very sensitive to these large deals. so there is a quarter over compare to that large deal, but in addition and this is something i want you to pay attention to over a multi-quarter scenario, similar to what we did in our manufacturing business, we've retired certain products in that space that we're no longer collecting revenue on and you'll see some kind of year-over-year declines associated with that. so for instance, we don't charge for sketchbook anymore that product is out there, it's completely free, it's available to people to anybody who wants to use it. that, that money isn't in there anymore, and it shows up in the year-over-year. but those are things that are affecting the m&e business.
we actually had a pretty robust m&e quarter, right? but as i said, there's sensitivity to large deals and this idea that we feel kind of retired certain products especially things like sketchbook that are going to have year-over-year impacts.
matthew broome -- mizuho -- analyst
okay. thanks very much.

thank you. our next question comes from rob oliver of baird. your line is open.
robert cooney oliver -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
great. thank you guys, appreciate it. i wanted to take it back to the construction side if i could andrew, and talk a little bit about the pricing side. i know you've said you guys favor the named user bundles. how is pricing playing out so far relative to your expectations coming in? and on those 15 deals in particular, where there was head-to-head competition, did price play a role at all? and then i have a very quick follow-up? thanks.
andrew anagnost -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. so first off, like i said, we're really happy with the results of construction in q1, we hit all our goals we're looking good heading into q2, we're really happy with things that are going on. so let me tell you right out of the gate, that the pricing models are working in their form, but i think i know you're asking a different question.
so like -- when we go in against the competitor, let me tell you about the two things that help us win. the first thing is competitors just like the story, they see us with a best-in-class field execution solution at one end, they see us with a best-in-class design collaboration solution at the other end, all cloud-based. and they just look at us and when we tell them look, we're going to connect the building information model all the way from design through to site execution, and we're going to do it with these things in between, they believe us, and they see it and they expect it all of its functionality is going to roll out over time. and when we do things like accelerate the rollout of plangrid bim into the plangrid environment as quickly as we did, people start to say, ok, thank you autodesk, you're showing us the evidence that we're heading in the right direction.
so they buy the vision, they buy autodesk role, they don't see anybody else able to do this end-to-end kind of connection the way we're doing, and that's been something we've been consistent about.
and yes, when they go in and look at the business model that we come to market with, they say look yours is a much more customer-friendly business model, this is one i can grow with. this business model over here is this going to penalize me as i grow. so yes, we do see those things. but i want to just make it clear, primary reason we win is the big story. and that's the thing that is getting customers excited. it's the thing that's engaging them, and it's the thing that's bringing more people into our ecosystem and we are seeing that.
robert cooney oliver -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
okay, that's really helpful. thanks. and just as a quick follow up, and andrew, you had mentioned on the last call and scott just reiterated. did you guys not only absorb the planned r&d at plangrid and buildingconnected but you've ramped that r&d. and aside from platforming and integration, and this -- and i apologize because this maybe leading on to the -- to for the ramp (ph) of other areas that you're seeing from the end user functionality perspective, that are interesting to you as a possible recipient of those r&d dollars. thank you guys very much.
andrew anagnost -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. so one of the things, i want to make sure i reiterate. i mentioned this during the last call, but i think it bodes restating, we've definitely applied clear missions to the two product stacks and the two teams frankly and we've actually swapped people back and forth between the two teams. plangrid is very much focused on field execution and being the best-in-class tool for field execution. so they're looking to accelerate the roadmap that they had in place for field execution both customer-driven and internally driven, and that's where they're spending their dollars.
on bim 360, we're focusing the bim 360 team much more on closing all the gaps around project management and things associated with project management, rfi flow and all of the things that go -- connected to that and then connecting those things back to the plangrid environment and the customer see a seamless flow. so we've -- this mission-based assignment of teams has been super important. it has resulted in additional r&d dollars going in.
we are absolutely accelerating plangrid's roadmap, not decelerating it, and we're accelerating bim 360's roadmap with regards to project management capabilities. so that, that you will hear more about in june. but i think it's important to just reiterate, where we put the money and how we're spending it to moving forward. because we really do want these solutions to survive, thrive, grow and connect together rapidly inside autodesk. so we're committed to that and yes, we spend more and we brought them in and we got the results we wanted. so i think we're going to keep doing that.
robert cooney oliver -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
that's great. thanks again, gentlemen. appreciate it.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, rob.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from kash rangan of bank of america. your line is open.
kash rangan -- bank of america -- analyst
hi. thank you very much, gentlemen. my question andrew for you is when you look at the maintenance subscription conversion program, can you just give us an update on how much of that installed base has accepted the price increase versus converting to subscriptions and what is left in that third bucket? any strategy or plans you might have in place to convince the last set of holdouts to get on the program. thank you very much.
andrew anagnost -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. so we never, we never expected that every subscription -- that every maintenance customer was going to move to subscription during this program. i think one thing that's important to note is we basically converted two-thirds of them already at this point. so there's really only one-third of the subscription base left from when we started this program. and as we told you over and over again, we've -- everyone we've moved, we're growing the value of those customers through consolidation and through other efforts associated with that.
so we have to pause and look at well how far have we come here with regards to this program. and i think it's pretty impressive results given what we're trying to accomplish.
we have always expected that by the end of the year, there were going to be a set of customers left in, and there are going to be a set of customers left in maintenance. but i think also what you heard from scott earlier is that the renewal rates for maintenance are holding up quite well, incredibly well actually even with the price increases that are in front of customers. so customers are going with us along the journey. there are going to be some left at the end of the year still on maintenance, and we'll look at what we do in terms of working with those customers as we get to that point. but we're already two-thirds in there, we'll be more than two-thirds by the end of the year, we've been successful in increasing the value of those customers and most of those customers that have moved over are happy and the ones that are still on maintenance are renewing it at robust rates. so the program looks like a success to me.
kash rangan -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you very much.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, kash.
operator
thank you. next question comes from keith weiss of morgan stanley. your line is open.
hamza fodderwala -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, this is hamza fodderwala in for keith weiss. just a couple of quick questions from my end. the first one, so the manufacturing revenue growth really accelerated this quarter and it's been up double-digits for a few quarters now. i'm just wondering what's the inflection point there as far as you starting to really put up growth that's faster than many of your peers, what's driving some of that share gain? and what's the roadmap there going forward?
andrew anagnost -- president & chief executive officer
so hamza what you're seeing there is the strength that was always there underneath that you couldn't see, because of all the product retirements we did. alright. so we've been doing this for several quarters in the core part of our business, which is one of the reasons why we're so excited about, how we're doing in manufacturing in general right now.
you saw declines or slowness in the manufacturing business, because we retired a whole set of products. some of them we just retired completely, some of them were transitioned into the collections environment, some of them were combined with other products, we did some large consolidations, and this resulted in some revenue that is essentially disappeared. but it showed up eventually in other places, so now what you're seeing is the underlying strength in the core manufacturing business that was always there. and we're -- like i said excited about it and when you look at some of the things that are in the roadmap, what you're going to see is tighter and tighter coupling of this design to make workflows. you're going to see more showing up in fusion with regards to end to end design all the way through to machining workflows and new generative algorithms that take not only 3d printing workflows, but -- workflows for 2 axis, 2.5 axis, 3 axis milling operations and automating the geometry creation. you're also going to see more workflows between inventor and fusion. so that inventor customers can take advantage of the downstream production workflows that are built inside a fusion. customers are starting to look inside the manufacturing and -- the product design and manufacturing collection and they're cracking it open and they're seeing some things that they think are pretty amazing. that's part and parcel of what's driving our growth.
customers are consolidating on what we have because they see us. i can take these eight weird things that i had against consolidating this as one thing. and by the way i've got this cloud workflow that makes all my data problems a lot cleaner and it's just working. and i expect you'll see it to continue to work in the future. so i'm just happy you can now see the underlying strength in the business that we knew was there all along.
hamza fodderwala -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. and just a quick follow up. we did hear that there was a price increase on multi-user licenses in may. just wondering if that caused any pull forward business from q2 to q1. that's it from me.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so we did see and we referred to this a little bit in the opening commentary, hamza. we did see a little bit of early renew activity, but really the same percent that we've seen historically. so if you add up our total sales what percent were early renews where you'd see people trying to front run the price increases earlier renews. so as we looked at that, it was really in line from a percentage basis with what we've seen historically.
so i don't -- i'm not anticipating any change or any kind of an impact to the full year model from that. having said that, the change we made on multi-user pricing was really to do a better job capturing the value of what we're shipping with that you've seen us make kind of incremental changes in multi-user now for a couple of -- couple of years in a row. and it's to better align the price with the value that's being delivered on multi-user.
hamza fodderwala -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. thank you very much.

and now, i would like to turn the call over to andrew.
andrew anagnost -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, abhey. we started off fiscal '20 with great momentum, accentuated by continued acceleration of recent
construction acquisitions and strong growth across all geographic regions. our billings and free cash flow came in at or above expectations and reflect the strength of our business. we are on track with the integration of plangrid and buildingconnected and have exciting achievements to share with you.
although, our first quarter revenue came in at the low end of our guidance range, we are on track to achieve our fiscal '20 arr and free cash flow guidance and are reaffirming our fiscal '23 targets. our pipeline for the rest of the year is strong and growing, and the underlying demand strength we've seen in prior quarters continues to drive growth in our business. there is no change to our view of the strength of the business or the current spending environment in our end markets.
before i offer you more color on strategic highlights during the quarter, let me turn it over to scott to give
you more details on our first quarter results as well as our guidance. i'll then return with further insights
into some of the key drivers of our business, including construction, manufacturing and digital
transformation, before we open it up to q&a.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks andrew. as andrew mentioned, our leading indicators, billings and free cash flow, performed well. total revenue of $735 million was up 31% and 28% excluding our recent acquisitions. it was within our planning
assumptions, although at the low end of our guidance range. this was primarily driven by linearity, as we closed more business later in the quarter than anticipated, which affected the amount of ratable revenue recognized in the quarter.
overall demand in our end markets was robust, as indicated by our strong billings and revenue growth. our subscription volume also grew steadily across the board. sales volume of autocad lt remained strong. and this has historically been a leading indicator of potential demand slowdown. as you can see, revenue from our autocad and autocad lt products grew 37% in the first quarter, slightly better than the 36% growth rate in q4. aec and manufacturing also rose 37% and 24%, respectively.
geographically, we saw broad based strength across all regions. revenue grew 35% in emea and apac, and 27% in the americas, with strength across almost all countries. we also saw strength in direct revenue, which rose 36% and represented 30% of our total sales, consistent with last year. within direct, our estore grew 45%.
looking at arr, total arr continued to grow quickly, up 33% versus last year to $2.8 billion. adjusting for our recent acquisitions, total arr was up 29%. core arr growth was in line with our total organic growth, while cloud arr grew 164%, propelled by strong performance in construction. excluding $83mm of arr from our fourth quarter acquisitions, organic cloud arr, which is primarily made up of bim 360 and fusion 360, grew a record 43%.
we continue to make progress with our maintenance to subscription, or m2s, program. the m2s conversion rate in q1 was consistent with prior quarters, with approximately one-third of maintenance renewal opportunities migrating to product subscriptions. of those that migrated, upgrade rates among eligible subscriptions remained within the historical range of 25% to 35%. as a reminder, this is the last year of the m2s program, and we are continuing to incentivize customers to convert.
in addition to strong new customer billings, the growth in arr was supported by continued expansion of our renewal base. and as we introduced at our investor day in march, the net revenue retention rate is a key metric to monitor the health of our renewal base. net revenue retention rate measures the year-over-year change in arr for the population of customers that existed one year ago, or base customers. it's calculated by dividing the current period arr related to those same base customers by the total arr from one year ago.
during q1, the net revenue retention rate was within the fiscal '19 range of approximately 110% to 120%, and we expect it to be in this range throughout fiscal '20.
in q1, some of the deeply discounted subscriptions from our global field promotion we ran three years ago came up for renewal. we were very pleased with the renewal rates of this group of customers as they
renewed closer to list price, and the total value from the entire cohort grew.
moving to billings, we had $798 million of billings during the quarter. on a normalized basis, billings rose about 40%. recall that last year we adopted asc 606, which resulted in adjustments of approximately $160 million to our deferred revenue balance and impacted billings, since billings are calculated by taking the sum of revenue plus the change in deferred revenue.
the growth in billings was driven by strong renewals and continued momentum in our core products. we also benefited from some customers renewing early in the quarter due to upcoming price increases. our recently acquired construction assets contributed nicely to the billings increase. and in line with our plans, multi-year contracts moved higher, helping our total billings. recall that multi-year payments are good for our customers as they benefit from stable pricing and a single approval process. our partners like them as they can sign higher contract values and maximize their cash flow. and we benefit from a more predictable revenue stream and upfront cash payments.
the second and third year of those multiyear agreements are recorded in our long term deferred revenue, which grew by 12% and ended the quarter at 17% of the total deferred balance. as we indicated at our analyst day, we expect to end the year with a long term balance in the low 20% range of total deferred revenue, in line with the historical range.
on the margin front, we realized significant operating leverage as we have entered the growth phase of our journey. non-gaap gross margins of 91% were up 140 basis points versus last year. our disciplined approach to expense management combined with revenue growth enabled us to expand our non-gaap operating margin by 13 percentage points to 18%, despite absorbing two significant acquisitions.
moving to free cash flow, we generated $207 million in q1. over the last twelve months, we have now generated $550 million of free cash flow, positioning us well to hit our full year target of $1.35 billion. note that q1 benefited from the very strong q4 of fiscal '19 that we had. as you may recall, we had over $1 billion of billings during q4, some of which was collected in the first quarter of fiscal '20. as such, i expect our free cash flow in q2 to be down sequentially.
we continue to repurchase shares with our excess cash, which is consistent with our capital allocation strategy. during the quarter, we repurchased 582,000 shares for $100 million at an average price of $171.84 per share.
now i'll turn the discussion to our outlook. i'll start by saying that our view of global economic conditions and their impact on our business is unchanged from the last several quarters. we are not seeing any noticeable impact from brexit and the various trade and tariff disputes.
for the full year, we are reiterating our fiscal '20 free cash flow outlook of approximately $1.35 billion as well as our outlook for arr of about $3.5 billion, up 27% to 29%. in line with our initial plans, we expect billings of about $4.1 billion at the midpoint, driven by the strength of our renewal base, new subscription growth, continued normalization of multi-year billings, the flow through from unbilled deferred revenue, and our acquisitions.
when looking at the quarterization of free cash flow for fiscal '20, we continue to expect about three-fourths of the free cash flow to be generated in the second half of the year.
looking at our guidance for the second quarter, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $782 million to $792 million, and we expect non-gaap eps of $0.59 to $0.63. the earnings slide deck on the investor relations section of our website has more details as well as modeling assumptions for the fiscal second quarter and for full year 2020.
now i'd like to turn it back to andrew.
andrew anagnost -- president & chief executive officer
thanks scott. now, let me give you an update on some of the key growth initiatives we highlighted at investor day, specifically progress made in construction, manufacturing and digital transformation. these initiatives
are key drivers of our business both near and long-term.
first, in construction, we are seeing continued strength across the portfolio as we execute on our strategy to deliver a comprehensive, integrated platform that seamlessly connects the office, the trailer, and the field. we had significant accomplishments during the quarter as we integrated plangrid and buildingconnected into autodesk. both acquired companies showed impressive growth, which is important to call out considering that acquisitions typically see a slow down during the integration phase, whereas we experienced accelerating momentum. post-close, we have won fifteen head-to-head bids against leading competitors in this space. other milestones included the launch of our first product integration and the realization of revenue synergies.
q1 was the first full quarter where we had the entire construction portfolio in place, as we closed plangrid in december 2018 and buildingconnected in january of this year. feedback from customers has been very positive regarding the addition of these best-in-class solutions to our comprehensive construction portfolio, which now includes bim 360, plangrid, assemble systems and buildingconnected, in addition to the design tools we have always sold into that market.
on the technology development front, we were able to accelerate the product roadmap for plangrid, which resulted in the introduction of plangrid bim last month. this is a new product integration between revit and plangrid that allows customers to immediately access bim data in either 2d or 3d directly within plangrid on their mobile devices. we were able to deliver this frequently requested feature at an accelerated pace now that plangrid is part of autodesk. in fact, when plangrid bim was launched we hosted a webcast and the demand was 5x what plangrid had normally seen for prior product launches, and the number of customers who requested to be contacted by a sales person following the webinar was also more than 5x what they normally experience following a product-focused webinar.
we've also seen synergies begin to develop on the sales front. for example, aptim, a leading construction services vendor and joint customer of autodesk and plangrid, tripled its plangrid users as part of the enterprise business agreement for its digital foreman initiative. other autodesk products they use include autocad, civil 3d, plant 3d, map 3d and revit. and because we have been clear with our customers that plangrid will be focused on field execution and bim 360 on project management, there are a lot of synergies between the two offerings that our customers have yet to realize. we are also seeing buildingconnected thrive within the autodesk construction ecosystem. since the acquisition they have grown their user base from about 700,000 to over 800,000.
now, i'd like to elaborate on the impressive growth comment made earlier. when we made the acquisitions, i said that we were focused on keeping the strong sales momentum going, and that is exactly what happened. at plangrid, the sales teams are continuing to perform strongly with both new and existing customers. for example, they expanded their relationship with rosendin electric, a long standing plangrid customer with plus 6,000 employees and annual revenue of about $1.5 billion.
the company recently extended its contract for three years and significantly expanded it, in part due to autodesk's long-term vision. plangrid sales have also started to benefit from being part of the autodesk family.
during the quarter, jacobs, a global leader in professional services sector and a long-standing autodesk customer, decided to further enhance its relationship with us by adding plangrid to one of its divisions. in making this decision, jacobs pointed to its current speed in the field, ease of use, and integration with the rest of the autodesk suite as determining factors in adopting the software.
the company is currently utilizing plangrid on $1 billion infrastructure project. plangrid also ended q1 with its largest ever pipeline of deals. and the momentum continued at buildingconnected too. buildingconnected has introduced new features that continue to make its platform more and more valuable to larger and larger portions of the market. in fact, they had their best quarter ever in q1 in terms of new business and are seeing their flywheel continue to drive new business on both the general contractor and subcontractor side.
bim 360 also continues to demonstrate strong growth. in fact, our organic cloud arr, of which, bim 360 is the largest component, was up 43% in q1. this was driven by strength across the entire bim 360 portfolio, especially bim 360 design, which is our real time collaboration tool for revit users. we also saw both existing and new customers increase adoption of bim 360. a good example here is wework, with 485 locations and 466,000 members around the world, wework provides spaces and services to help people work, learn and collaborate in more meaningful ways. they expanded their subscription with autodesk this quarter and are one of our largest bim 360 design customers.
we are excited to work with them and look forward to further enhancing our relationship over the coming years. overall, all parts of our construction portfolio are performing at or above the plan and showing strong growth. i am extremely proud of all the teams involved. they remain focused and dedicated to helping autodesk grow and drive positive change in the construction industry. and lastly, i wanted to note that for those looking to get a more in-depth view of our construction business, we are hosting an event on june 4th here in san francisco, where you'll have the opportunity to hear directly from aecom, webcor and dpr in addition to our construction team regarding our portfolio and go-to market opportunity. i hope to see all of you there.
on the manufacturing front, revenue grew 24% as customers see the benefits of our differentiated solution, we are gaining share and displacing competitive offerings in the space. for example, a large manufacturer of locomotives and rail equipment further expanded its relationship with us, they are in the process of deploying our manufacturing solutions across their various divisions and are relying on inventor, our cam solutions and factory design utilities to automate their workflows.
our solutions displaced competing our products due to our simplicity and short implementation cycles, which is in line with their rapid product introduction requirements. our investments in generative design and fusion 360 have resulted in more than 100% year-over-year growth in monthly active users for our commercial customers. users love the cloud-based, comprehensive solution of fusion 360 and it is disrupting the industry.
fusion 360 offers unprecedented value and out-of-the-box productivity for concept to production workflows, and that appeals to a large swath of our customers. a us-based specialty pharmaceutical company purchased fusion 360 to replace solidworks for designing and manufacturing auto-injectors.
after reviewing various options, they decided that fusion 360 provided superior collaboration and data management capabilities in the cloud with no setup or maintenance complications. a midwest metal fabrication company chose fusion 360 to replace separate instances of cad and cam solutions. they were impressed by our integrated cad/cam functionality and collaboration features. with fusion 360, they were able to replace catia, creo, mastercam, and ptc windchill, allowing them to rely on fewer platforms and to promote collaboration.
then when it comes to digital transformation, we are seeing the positive impact it is having on our business. we are also making progress in using digitization internally as part of our plans to convert the large number of non-compliant users into paying customers. all new single user product subscriptions are already using identity-based authentication and we continue to move existing customers to this new system. we are on track to migrate all eligible single user subscriptions to identity-based authentication by the end of the current fiscal year, which will provide a much better user experience for our customers and help us in combating non-compliant usage of our software.
beyond that, we are already starting to see results from our efforts to engage directly with customers using non-compliant versions of our software and expect our ongoing learning to increase our effectiveness in fy '20 and beyond.
as you heard, there's a lot of activity happening toward the growth initiatives highlighted at investor day across construction, manufacturing and digital transformation. these drivers, as well as the large opportunity we see in converting the current 14 million non-paying users into subscribers, should result in an acceleration in profitability and cash flow metrics and sustained growth going forward. we are highly confident in autodesk's ability to capitalize on this large market opportunity and are committed to delivering our fy '20 and fy '23 targets.
with that, operator, we'd like to open up the call for questions.
",2020-Q1,ADSK

operator
thank you, sir. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of saket kalia of barclays. your line is open.
saket kalia -- barclays capital -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for taking my questions here.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer
hi, saket.
saket kalia -- barclays capital -- analyst
hey, scott. hey, andrew. hey, andrew, maybe just to start with you slightly higher level question on the macro. i know we spoke about some of the regional items that we've seen whether it was [phonetic] uk, china or central europe, but i want to maybe think about the macro from a different lens. clearly a lot of concern out there about the manufacturing economy. and as we know, not all of autodesk's business is levered to the manufacturing space. but for the part that is, can you just give us some color on the verticals that autodesk sells into, whether that's auto or aerospace for example. just to sort of get a sense for where autodesk kind of sits with regards to different sub-segments of manufacturing, specifically?
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer
hey, saket. before we jump into that, i'd like to clear out something, we've heard that there is some confusion in our guidance metrics from the press release footnotes. so what our current guidance for free cash flow for fiscal '20 is $1.3 billion. if we get there by saying, free cash flow from operations -- cash flow from operations will be $1.37 billion, netted [phonetic] $70 million of free cash flow to get to $1.3 billion. so i think that the footnote creates confusion that the $1.3 billion wasn't already netted for capex? it is. so it's $1.37 billion before capex as cash flow from ops, $1.3 billion is the free cash flow guidance for the year.
saket kalia -- barclays capital -- analyst
okay. go ahead. scott?
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so let me address your question about verticals and manufacturing in particular. first off just let me kind of just frame a few things. our manufacturing business actually did pretty well, grew 20%, a lot better than any of our competitors. that has a lot to do with the way we're diversified. it also has a lot to do with the price points and the upfront, the reduced upfront cost of our offerings are pretty attractive to a lot of people. and we're also seeing acceleration in the cam space due to the fusion 360 portfolio and the way it integrates design and cam along with the generative capability. so we're seeing is pretty strong performance in manufacturing, but to your point about which verticals we're exposed you know that our biggest vertical in manufacturing is what we call industrial machinery, and this is machinery of all manner and type. it's machines, you'll see inside automotive factories, but it's also machines you see the package serial, or to wrap toys, or to do any manner of things make paper in large industrial machines. it's our single biggest segment. another really big segment for us is what's called building product manufacturers. and these are the people that build things that go into buildings and there are also the people that build things that hang on buildings in pre-fabricated components of buildings. so i think doors and windows manufacturers, think air conditioner manufacturers, think curtain wall manufacturers, if you understand how skyscrapers are made.
our smallest level exposure is actually in the auto and aerospace where other competitors have deeper exposure in terms of the engineering processes. we are definitely big in auto in some of the more forward-looking aspects of the auto industry. so we're embedded deeper in the designed departments which are several years ahead of where the current production is and where current production volume is. and we're also working closely with a lot of autos and some of their next generation production workflows. i think you've seen some of the things we've been talking about with generative with regards to some of the work we've done with gm [phonetic] and some of the other automotives to kind of help them consolidate multiple parts -- in multi-part assemblies into a single 3d printed part and we're definitely engaged in some of that work. but that's kind of the hierarchy of exposure we have to manufacturing. it makes sense?
saket kalia -- barclays capital -- analyst
that does. that does. that's really helpful. scott, maybe if you, for my follow up, a little bit of different topic, but i'd love to talk a little bit about the remaining maintenance business. obviously, this is the last year of m2s price increases as you've mentioned before and that maintenance arr sort of continues to decline in that high-30% range. how do you sort of think about that decline in coming quarters? and maybe just speak to sort of the profile of your remaining maintenance customers. i guess with the last 25% price increase should we start to see a step-up in that maintenance base decline, or should we kind of think about it kind of chugging along the way how, so far? any color there would be helpful.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. sure, saket. so this is the year, by the way, it's a 20% price increase, not 25%. but this is, q2 was the first full quarter that, that third price increase that we announced three years ago. it went into effect at the beginning of q2. since our first quarter with that, we actually had some interesting results, conversion rate of maintenance agreements that came up for renewal, actually increase, which is what you expect with the staying on maintenance going up 20% from what had been about one-third of those to come up for renewal converting to something in the high-30% range for the quarter. so conversion rate increased as expected the -- interestingly for those that did elect to stay on maintenance and some do. the renewal rate actually ticked up. i would have expected with the increase in price. it's a stay flat or maybe even decline. it actually -- the renewal rate for maintenance for those that did not convert actually ticked moderately, but ticked up slightly in the quarter. so we're seeing the exact same, the behavior we expected, when we laid out, the m2s program. and at this point, it's -- we have three more quarters to go, it will actually overlap into the first quarter of next year before it's finished.
saket kalia -- barclays capital -- analyst

thank you. our next question comes from phil winslow of wells fargo. your question please.
philip winslow -- wells fargo -- analyst
hey, thanks guys for taking my question. yeah. thanks for the commentary on asia-pacific and europe. i wonder if you give us more color on what you're seeing in the us, particularly into the quarter? and in terms of the pipeline particularly by vertical that would be very helpful. thanks.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer
yes. the americas in the us in particular were strong. we grew 32%. our pipeline solid in the us, it's plus or across the whole americas, our visibility is pretty good. we're seeing broad strength across all the segments. so we're not seeing any weakening in any kind of segment, or by any types of vertical. so the us business is looking solid and it continues to look solid right now until something changes in the environment, but we saw a great, a great, great visibility in our pipeline to the us.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
phil, the other comments, it's worth adding on to that is, i think there was some concern that emerging markets might have underperformed during the quarter and it's actually, you have to dig into the appendix of our slides that we posted on our website. but you can see emerging markets actually grew north of 30%. and obviously there is a chunk of those emerging markets are in the americas as well. so we continue to see -- with the exception of three areas that we pointed out, we continue to see strength geographically across the board.
philip winslow -- wells fargo -- analyst
yeah. got it. and then also in terms of the breakdown saying -- we're saying obviously your businesses sort of like a matrix internationally, but and then my multiple verticals and the multiple sort of sub verticals within inside those verticals. would you think about just manufacturing exposure versus let's say your commercial construction versus media entertainment? is there one geography that's weight more let's say toward your commercial construction won [phonetic] more toward manufacturing? any sort of color on sort of that --?
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. absolutely. so that's an easy place to give some color. so construction we're definitely lean more toward the us, there's no doubt about it. on manufacturing, we're definitely lean more toward europe. we've historically been more successful in europe relative to competition than in the us. so when you see our manufacturing slowed down in germany, it's slowed down our overall manufacturing business. so europe is definitely where we're more exposed in manufacturing. the us is definitely where the bulk of the businesses for construction right now, though we're growing pretty quickly internationally on the construction side as well. but that's kind of the high-level breakdown.
philip winslow -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay, great. thanks guys.

thank you. our next question comes from jay vleeschhouwer of griffin securities. your question please.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
thank you. good evening. andrew, a quarter ago, on the call you made some interesting remarks regarding what you're calling your early warning system. this was in the context [phonetic] you're talking about digital infrastructure and your customer engagements team. the question is, what is that system telling you in terms of some of the key metrics that it's set up for in terms of usage and other metrics. and is it thus far a us-oriented system, or is it giving you signals globally that are helping you? and then secondly, a longer-term technology or roadmap question, you made some comments on the call earlier [phonetic] about your integrations thus far with the pacs [phonetic] acquisitions, the bim and revit and so forth. what about the roadmap however between aec and manufacturing. if you are going to pursue nationalization of construction, you have to have that, that core segment integration, you haven't really spoken about it much, but perhaps you can talk about that roadmap?
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer
okay. all very good questions, jay. so first let me talk about the early warning system and what it's telling us. so it is broad geographically. it tells us about multiple products and multiple geographies. and one of the things and what is also intended to do it give us a predictor scores of at-risk renewal, so that we can go take direct action with regards to at-risk renewals. what i can tell you at a very high level is telling us that there is no slowdown in usage of our products, right. in fact usage continues to grow across all types of products and all manner of vertical. so we're not seeing any systematic declines in usage or usage activity with associated [phonetic]. our pirates continue to use, use our product robustly and as do our paying subscribers. but remember that the core part of that system is designed to help our teams understand, which one of our accounts are most at risk for renewal. and, yeah, you're right, we watch things like activations, we watch things like product usage, and we watch other things like access to support that allow us to kind of score these customers in terms of risk, but it's global and we're not seeing any changes in the usage trends. the usage continues to go up globally.
now with regard to integration of the construction, i think you're actually pointing to a very important area and it's one of the things that we're really focusing on behind the scenes and it has to do with creating some workflows for the building product manufacturers, which includes like i said earlier curtain wall, as well as the component that go inside of buildings. so what we've been working to do is expand the interop between revit and inventor, so that you can actually take low-precision models from revit, move them into the high-precision environment of inventor, so that you can get, do fabrication prep for things like curtain walls and other types of manufacturing components. and then actually move them back into revenue in the low-precision world in an account slated way for the changes that happen inside of inventor go back and update inside of the revit model as well. we've been improving those integrations continuously behind the scenes, you're going to see more improvement in those integrations in q4, and a continuing roadmap next year. it's not -- that's not completing fully industrialized workflows for construction, but it's a pre-requisite to making sure you have a good bim to manufacturing or 3d solid modeling workflows, that you can actually do some of these more complex interactions between a building information model and a 3d model for manufacturing purposes. so we continue to work on those revit and inventor integrations and you'll see acceleration in that area.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
okay. thanks, andrew.

[speech overlap] our next question comes from heather bellini of goldman sachs. your line is open.
heather bellini -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thank you. just a couple of questions here. andrew, i just want to make sure that your tone and your conservatism seems like you're not seeing the weakness here so to speak, but you're just being more conservative in your outlook. i just want to confirm that, but that's how we should be reading your comments. and then i guess one of the other questions would be, how is c [phonetic] growth trending? and churn in c growth, which may be a precursor to a slowdown, if you think of the fact that your products are deployed, if increased deployment as people are hired into the industry. and then i guess the follow-up from there would be just from a linearity perspective after last quarter when you said linearity with a little bit more back-end loaded, i know you guys were going back to assuming the same linearity in q3 this year that you did last year. is that where it actually came out if -- if you can give us some color there, that'd be great. thank you.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer
all right. so, what i'll do is, i'll answer your middle question first. then i'll answer your first question, second, and i'll let scott answer the third, ok? so your middle part --
heather bellini -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer
c growth [phonetic]. that's ok. c growth ensuring no change. all right, we're seeing the same kind of c growth where our renewal rates are solid in some places we're seeing improvements. so all of those trends are consistent right now with a fairly steady environment. like we said earlier, we've seen some indications in certain specific markets that lead us to be a little bit more cautious, particularly germany and manufacturing, uk and around brexit, brexit. and you know the state-owned enterprises in china, we simply cannot engage with them and that's going to put pressure on our expectations relative to those markets. even though emerging in china is a small part of our business, it's a small percentage. over a couple of quarters, we could easily add up to $5 million in missed expectations, but there is a lot of noise. you can all hear it, it's all going on, there's something new every day. all right, all you have to do is checking twitter feed. so there is all sorts of noise and what you see us doing and i want to make sure we put this in context. what we did is we took the high end of our guidance down, so we narrowed the range. the low end of our guide on a constant currency basis is unchanged. so this is a prudent narrowing of the range to kind of reflect this noise we're seeing in the system. i think it's the right thing to do right now. i think it's appropriate.
but even if you look at the worst-case scenario, on all of that. worst case scenario, we're coming in at 96% at worst case of the numbers we set out there four years ago. i think that's pretty good. it does not just great modeling, it's actually great execution in flexible and adaptive execution and it's that ability to kind of track the business to that kind of fidelity that gives us a lot of confidence in terms of what we're looking to see out in fy '23. and i want to make sure just since you asked the question, i want to reinforce a few things that are really important drivers around some of this stuff. first off, one just five [phonetic] comment. we could easily do some unnatural acts to hit that free cash flow number at what we stated previously in the last call, you wouldn't want us to do that. i have no interest in pushing an agenda in that direction. and we're just simply not going to do it. it's not good for the business, it's not good for the long-term health and for the long-term prospects of the business and we have to pay attention to the long-term prospects of the business. so we're not going to do any unnatural [phonetic] things to try to drive that free cash flow number up. and i think that, that's an important point. but the resilience in the model, because remember, as we move into next year the model transition is dying [phonetic]. we've got the resilience in the model, let's just look out to fy '23. but look at just how the midpoint of the guide changed, half of that -- half of that is due to currency fx. okay. a total complete short-term impact on our business.
the other thing i want you to be aware of, in terms of you know what's kind of guiding us with the conservatism and we're at our pipeline solid. we're looking out our pipelines and we've got more visibility to our business than we've ever had before. the pipeline looks good in countries where we historically having problems i think might remember a year ago, we talked a lot about japan. japan is doing great. so we're seeing things like that. but more importantly, as we look out beyond the fy '20 guide into some of the fy '23 things, construction is doing really well. we believe the construction is going to continue to do well during the downturn, it spending construction continue to grow during the downturn last time, in '07 and '08 revit continue to grow for us. i think you're going to see that same thing. our performance on non-compliant users is getting better and better.
and also let's just say there was a protracted downturn. something interesting happens in those downturns infrastructure spend tends to go up. we've gotten in front of that. we've done some things in our core design product and our construction portfolio to ensure that we're good partners to the infrastructure business. so we intend to capitalize on any infrastructure spend that could come out of a protracted downturn. so you're right. we are simply being conservative and we're being prudent because of the noise out there in the system and because of the weakness we saw in some places where they can have impact on our expectation, was correct. we're growing robustly in all those places. we just have higher expectations for those places. and i think it's the right time to make that kind of adjustment and it's all short-term, but we're still very confident about what we can do in fy '23.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
and heather, i think the other part --
heather bellini -- goldman sachs -- analyst
scott, yeah.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. the other part of your [phonetic] question, that was around linearity. and i think the thing that we are seeing in linearity, and again in q2, which was consistent with our expectations in q2 was the more sales are happening a little bit later in the quarter than what we had experienced in the second half of fiscal '19. so it's more like the traditional linearity that we had in the first half of fiscal 2019, and that's now built it into our forecast for the second half of this year. so it has a couple of effects, when you do that, obviously, and andrew has talked about there's a big chunk of the adjusted in our guidance is all-time the fx, but holding that aside as linearity pushes out a little bit, it has an effect on billings, where billings covered [indecipherable] quarter, and then you end up collecting some of those billings is kind of during the current quarter and the following quarter. so there's a little bit of an effect on billings and an effect on free cash flow as well to linearity. but that's the way to think about it. the midpoint of the guide is a 27% revenue growth, midpoint of the billings guide is 40% growth even normalized for the 606 implementation at the beginning of last year and the midpoint of the guide as 12 points of margin expansion. so it's a good strong year. we continue to feel good about the momentum in the business.
heather bellini -- goldman sachs -- analyst

thank you. our next question comes from gal munda of berenberg capital management. your line is open.
gal munda -- berenberg capital management -- analyst
hi, thank you for taking my questions. the first one is just in the manufacturing side. we see the manufacturing is going below the aec part of the business. and i was just wondering, if it's macro-related, or is it may be got something to do with the comments you made around the shift to the new platform you mentioned that fusion 360 is gaining market share, you mentioned that fusion 360 is growing very, very strongly. and i'm wondering whether fusion 360 by taking market shares also potentially taking market share from some older solutions, they have like inventor, which might provide kind of short-term headwind to the revenue there?
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer
all right. so let me kind of answer that from a public [phonetic]. first off, we grew 20% manufacturing better than any of our competitors. all right. better than the market. so our performance in manufacturing is actually very strong. the relative difference in the performance between manufacturing and aec is simply due to the fact that aec is stronger. what we're seeing in aec is relevant is not only being adopted very robustly. it's actually being mandated or bim is being mandated in more and more countries and for more and more projects. japan in particular is an interesting place where historically bim was slow to be adopted and it's starting to see an acceleration of adoption and you're seeing bim mandates showing up in japan as well. so i want to make sure that we understand the relative performance difference between those two things and our performance relative to competitors in the overall market.
now, to your point about fusion. one of the reasons why there is no cannibalization related to fusion is because when every inventor customer that's getting inventor of the collection gets fusion with it. all right. so they actually get both products. so if you buying subscribe to collection, you get all the things that our collection, you actually get fusion as well. and fusion is a design out can't do all the things that inventor does. so there is very little cross overlap between those two applications in terms of actually complete design things.
the growth that you're seeing in fusion is actually coming more from competitive swaps -- we always like we've always given several examples of solidworks displacements we've seen other placements as well and this growth in the cam space as well where the integrated end-to-end solution in the price points or just really, really attractive. so i just want to make sure that we put color on that. manufacturer is doing great, the relative difference between aec and manufacturing has to do with fact that aec is doing better, and it's doing better because of bim the mandates and bim momentum and we're not seeing any cannibalization from fusion in our core business perfect.
gal munda -- berenberg capital management -- analyst
perfect. that's very helpful. and then just as a follow up. could you comment a bit about the performance between the direct and indirect. so basically the channel and your own sales force, you basically mentioned that you had some significant eba wins, maybe also comment a bit more on the e-commerce side of things, how the direct performance is going down?
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. gal, we talked about the mix being 70% through the channel, 30% direct, which is compared to 28% direct in q2 of last year. so it's grown a couple of points. our direct business actually grew 38% year-on-year, so we're seeing good strength in direct. within ebas, we continue to do most of our ebas in the second half of the year and within that most of them in the fourth quarter and the second half of the year. so the eba business while we have good traction with ebas in q2, the quarters were really starting to see a lot more eba businesses late in q3 and then through q4. the e-commerce business or e-store is actually growing very nicely year-on-year. again growing off a smaller base are growing very nicely year-on-year and that's part of our overall digital sales approach. all right. it's not just put up a store and try to drive people to it. we also use the e-store as the back-end transaction engine for a lot of our inside sales teams. so we're seeing very nice growth through that whole digital sales channel, which comes to us at a higher net revenue per concept to autodesk. so it's actually performing quite well.
gal munda -- berenberg capital management -- analyst

thank you. our next question comes from the line of ken talanian of evercore isi. please go ahead.
kenneth talanian -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. as you think about the uncertainty related to the second half, could you give us a sense for how you see the billings impact related to demand patterns and linearity differ, if at all between the larger eba type customers in the smaller volume-oriented ones. and then along those lines, how should we think about the eba renewal opportunity in the back half of this year versus last?
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. ken, we always have, as i just mentioned we always have more ebas in the second half of the year and in particular in the fourth quarter than we do in the first half of the year. that was -- we know when those ebas are coming up for renewal and we have the best inside of any of our transactions on the what's happening with the ebas. so we have a good sense of when those are going to close, that's always been pretty accurately reflected in our outlook. what you see in terms of the adjustment in billings of 50 million adjustment in billings; first of all, certain context, it's a 50 million adjustment at the midpoint on a number that's greater than 4 billion, right. so it's a little more than a 1% adjusted in the full year billings, half of that 50 million roughly, it is strictly fx. the remainder is really localized around the three areas that we talked about, around the uk with concerns over brexit. and we saw that actually much more so in july than we did in the first two months of the quarter, same with the slowdown in the manufacturing base in germany, and then with the state-owned enterprises in china. so the adjustment in billings is really a reflection of fx, and then those three kind of localized fx, but i think everyone's feeling not just all of us.
kenneth talanian -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. and if i may, given that you've already reached about $98 million in arr from your acquisitions. and i think you're targeting $100 million for the year. how do you kind of thinking about the contribution to the year now?
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. super happy with the way the integration is on and [indecipherable] this as well talk about the numbers. i'm super pleased with that. and the $100 million that you referred to was really what we talk about the plangrid. so it'd be slightly higher when you add building connected to that as well. i feel like we're on track, really happy with the way those are performed so far. it's -- those are two really significant transactions to pull in the same quarter and not. we haven't lost a bit of momentum in either one of those. so feeling good about our construction business overall. and i think the interesting point before i hand off to you, andrew, is not only have we done well with the acquired products the breadth of the portfolio we have in construction now has created an updraft for bim 360. and we talked about our cloud, our organic cloud arr growth at 45% for the quarter. bim 360 is one of the big drivers of that. so we continue to see not just success in construction with the acquired assets, but a bit of a halo effect because of the breadth of that product portfolio on our organic bim 360 products.
you took all my interesting points.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
i'm sorry.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, look, the construction portfolio is performing really well. that is very unusual to get this kind of first half -- first two quarter performance out of big acquisitions like that, we're happy. on the integration side, senior leaders from the acquired companies are taking senior positions inside the construction solutions team. so we're seeing better and better alignment between those organizations. we have a lot of confidence in where we're going with these things, you see continuing stream of product integrations. our customers are getting comfortable with our road map. the reason customers accelerated their purchasing of bim 360 is because basically they just they see the same doing and acting in all the right ways. so they're doubling down in autodesk and that's nothing, but an excellent sign for how this business is going to grow into next year.
kenneth talanian -- evercore isi -- analyst
great, thanks very much.

thank you. our next question comes from zane chrane of bernstein research. your line is open.
zane chrane -- bernstein research -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my question. i just wanted to dig into manufacturing a little bit more, the 20% growth in manufacturing revenue really was driven by arr added in q3 and q4 of last year. if i look at the annualized value of manufacturing revenue based on number of days in the quarter, its size, looks like it's down about $4 million or $5 million in acv compared to what it was at the end of q4. so -- and that's in contrast to pretty strong incremental growth in manufacturing revenue each quarter of fiscal '19, is the weakness in first half on that incremental manufacturing revenue added, is that due to increased churn or lower expansion of existing customers or just a pause and adoption due to the macro uncertainty? thank you.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think it's neither, zane. so to be clear, we -- the 20% growth in manufacturing is in line with the growth in manufacturing we've seen historically over the last two or three quarters that we're not seeing even in the markets that we talked about that the three markets that we talked about having localized impact. we're showing strong double-digit growth even in germany, which of course is a manufacturing base in itself.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
in acv.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer
in an acv. so we're not seeing that kind of a -- i'm not exactly sure the math that you did there, we're not seeing -- we can pick it up offline. we're not seeing any acceleration or deceleration, significant deceleration on the manufacturing side. renewal rates were strong across the board. new product subscription growth -- with back to one of the questions that came up earlier was in line and actually slightly higher as what we see in the prior couple of quarters. so the manufacturing space continues to perform well and i think it's a bit of a stand out relative to our peers that are far more manufacturing focused when you look at that growth rate.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, just even to comment on germany and we'll just talk about it from a pure acv standpoint. the acv growth in germany was still double-digit, high double-digit growth. what we saw was a gap between our expectations and the growth we were seeing as we headed into the end of the quarter. we have high expectations for that market and those expectations were not getting met in the same kind of pattern that we would have expected in past quarters, but acv is growing across the board manufacturing. so i think maybe it's something that we would be absolutely good to follow-up on make sure we got the math right there.
zane chrane -- bernstein research -- analyst
okay. that makes sense. just a quick question on the gap between the results versus your high expectations going in, is the gap more driven by lower expansion than you expected or less adoption from potential new customers?
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so what it is mostly a cross-sell and up-sell opportunity slowing down little bit. i'll give one example as we look out into the end of the second half. accounts in some of the european countries where we expected to see eba conversions are looking like to be more subscription sales versus the ebas. so what we're seeing is a little bit of change in behavior at the eba level and at the up-sell and cross-sell level. and that's really -- that's really what's triggering our caution. and in terms of what we saw during the quarter, we expect a certain level of uptick in the acv as we get toward the end of the quarter and for the manufacturing in germany, in particular, we didn't see that uptick in acv. we're still doing great growing, but we didn't see the uptick we expected toward the numbers we want to see, we took that as an indicator of some slowness.

kash rangan -- bank of america -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for being completely detailed and transparent with all the disclosures. i was also curious given that we've not seen any meaningful turn in the business so far. how confident that are you that we have levels at the estimates or is it potential no router revisions potentially based on what you might uncover and cover quarter or do you feel that you've seen enough and you've scrubbed the model enough to account for, whatever it is that you saw in july and that we should be ok from this point onwards?
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so obviously we spent a lot of time scrubbing the numbers and looking at this and making sure that we were -- we were looking at this in a prudent way. we feel confident that we've set the guide, right? i mean, obviously we're one tweet away from something changing, unless something radical changes in the macro environment. we feel pretty confident given our pipeline visibility to what we're guiding out there right now. and again i just want to reiterate what we did is, we narrowed the range from the top end down, the bottom at constant currency stayed the same right? prudent measured action relative to what we're seeing out there. we think we've got it right and if you look at something comes from left field, something will come from left field, but we feel like we've got it right and we scrubbed our numbers.
scott, do you want to comment anything?
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, the only thing i'd add to that, kash, and it's a great question and i appreciate you asking it, so we can talk about it on the call is that -- as we started to analyze not just where we're headed in the -- with the strength of our pipeline and the overall strength in our renewal rates, which the renewal rate is becoming a bigger and bigger part of our business. net revenue retention stayed in the same range, renewal rates on a volume basis if anything ticked up modestly of course that picked up slightly sequentially. so, feel good about the core business and we talked about the remaining performance obligations, even the current rpo, right? so those are they're going to turn into revenue in the next 12 months, growing 23% year-on-year. so -- who knows what the next tweet will say, but we feel like we've built in everything that we can see at this point, yeah.

richard davis -- canaccord -- analyst
thanks. two quick questions. one, you had a little bit of kind of work on rationalizing kind of the overlapping features between plangrid and some pre-existing functionality, how far are you on that? and then on -- second question would be, share repurchase i think you said 253,000. how much is left and can you accelerate that, can you surge that or what's up that, those are two simple questions? thanks.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, richard, thank you for that. all right. so first off let's talk about how we positioned the portfolio to our customers and port position the breadth of our portfolio, i made it very clear that the bim 360 products that's going to focus on project management, project centric workflows and all the things associated with managing projects from start to finish and integrating them into the pre-construction workflow. plangrid is going to focus on field execution and all the things associated with field execution in the capturing of information in around field execution and communicating that information back up into the global project management environment.
we made progress on multiple fronts. like i said earlier, we've integrated bim into plangrid and so there is a bim plangrid integration. we've also integrated some buildingconnected build bid management function into plangrid as well. but one of the really exciting things that we're working on and say it's part of the integration strategy is that both the plangrid team and the bim 360 teams have seen the next generation building bim 360 doc solution we built as being the foundation of what we call a common data environment. this is something we expect out in the aec industry, it's called cve. and docs is going to be the foundation of our common data environment in both plangrid and bim -- on all the other core bim 360 functionality are integrating into that platform, which gives us a great stepping stone, not only to satisfy some pretty complicated requirements around common data environment, but also to bring the products together more rapidly.
so you're going to hear a lot of things from us in the second half of this year, in the first half of next year about how these portfolios are coming together, but our customers get it, they understand and they are buying in more to our solution because they see us acting in the direction of what we said we're going to do.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
and richard on your stock buyback question, that you're spot on. so, we spent $40 million during the quarter, year-to-date we spent $140 million. there is no change in our stance on cap allocation. so we'll continue to offset the -- of course support the growth of the company first, look offset the dilution from our equity plans and then return excess cash to shareholders. we've been doing that pretty effectively with a more opportunistic buying pattern. so price grid is based on some monte carlo modeling that we do. and during the trading blackout window of course we have to trade under a thin finb plan. our trading blackout window began in early july, right, before the most recent market volatility, so that the grid that we had set up necessarily reflect the volatility that we wound up experiencing. at this point, i think you should definitely expect us to be back in the market buying back stock.
richard davis -- canaccord -- analyst
super. thank you so much.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, rich.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of tyler radke of citi. your line is open.
tyler radke -- citi research -- analyst
hey, thanks for squeezing me in here. so you talked about how you think some of these macro issues, there are only a temporary thing or a short-term thing. i guess what gives you the confidence there. and then as you think about your lowered expectations, is it fair to say it's all coming from manufacturing or is there any reduction in your view on aec? thanks.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. all right. so first off, again, let me just clarify a few things that give us confidence about the short-term impacts method is. one, half of the change in the midpoint of the guide is currency effect, ok? so, let's just make sure we all level set on that, remember it's currency effect. i think that's really important. the other thing that gives us a lot of confidence is our pipeline visibility. we have more visibility because of the changes in some of the models that we have in terms of our go-to market model with the rise of our mid-market programs and our some of our direct programs. we have quite a bit of visibility into our pipeline and we can see into our pipeline we see robust pipeline, we have visibility all the way through to the end of the year and also visibility beyond that. so we feel pretty good that some of these things are short-term effects.
in addition, we don't see anything slowing down with regards to construction and with regards to our piracy conversion work. so if we just -- if we just look at a high level, those things are all kind of short-term impacts on our business. and what was the second part of your question because i thought you asked another clarifying thing about what gave me confidence on the short-term?
tyler radke -- citi research -- analyst
yes, that was just the confidence that it's only a short-term macro part and on the -- i think you kind of answered it, but around the guidance was it all a reduction and manufacturing or was there any incremental cost on aec?
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so there is no incremental view on aec, the change in guidance came from those fx effects and our view of the impacts of the softness we saw in manufacturing in germany, the softness we saw in the uk and the gap between our potential in china and what we're actually able to execute on. those were really the key drivers.
tyler radke -- citi research -- analyst
okay, great. and if i could just sneak in one more for scott, as you think about kind of some of the expense levers you have, if you continue to see more softness just what's kind of your willingness to maybe pull back on hiring or be more conservative you have to keep free cash flow or profitability targets in place?
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, it's a great question, tyler. i think we've demonstrated pretty effectively over the last four years sound, spend, discipline. we continue to show to demonstrate sound, spend, discipline. we effectively kept total spend flat for x the acquisitions in q4, we got total spend flat for four consecutive years. so there will be a bit of an opportunity for us to take up spend, at the same time we're increasing margins. if you look at this year, we talk about spend growth of 9% and margin growth of 12 percentage points of margin year-on-year. i expect margin to expand again into fiscal '21 although there is some pent-up demand percent having been flat for four consecutive years of some pent-up demand. so spending will increase, current course of speed, barring something significantly different happening in the overall macro environment, spending, we'll see a little bit of an increase again in fiscal '21.

andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, abhey. our great momentum from the first quarter carried into the second quarter, resulting in strong performance, with revenue, billings, earnings and free cash flow coming in ahead of expectations. we also crossed the $3 billion mark on arr for the first time, which was driven by solid performance across all regions and products. our last 12 months free cash flow of $731 million is the highest amount of free cash flow we have ever generated in a four-quarter period in the company's history. we performed well in the first half of the year, demonstrating focused execution and the strength of our recurring revenue model. although we continue to execute well and are not materially impacted by current trade tensions and macro conditions, we are aware of the current business and geopolitical environment that is causing uncertainty in the market.
as we look across the next six months, we are taking a prudent approach to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal '20. however, we think the uncertainty caused by macro-related events is only a short-term issue. we remain confident in our ability to achieve the fiscal '23 goals we have laid out for you. our confidence is grounded in the value delivered by our products, their ability to help our customers differentiate via innovation and digitization, focused execution delivered by our partners and sales teams, and the significant strides we are making to capture the non-paying user community. i would also like to point out that although there are headlines of some impact from the current environment on a few industry verticals like manufacturing, we outgrew competitors and gained share in the space. the construction industry is also holding steady and continues to invest in innovative solutions, and we saw ongoing strength in construction this quarter.
before i offer you more color on strategic highlights during the quarter, let me first turn it over to scott to give you more details on our second quarter results as well as details of our updated fiscal '20 guidance. i'll then return with further insights on the key drivers of our business, including construction, manufacturing and digital transformation before we open it up for q&a.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, andrew. as andrew mentioned, revenue, billings, earnings and free cash flow all performed ahead of expectations during the second quarter. overall demand in our end markets was solid during the quarter, as indicated by our strong billings and revenue growth. growth was driven by both volume and pricing, which is a result of the strong uptake of our products by new users as well as increased usage with existing customers. sales volume of autocad lt also remained strong. this has historically been a leading indicator of a potential demand slowdown. and as you can see, revenue from our autocad and autocad lt products grew 31% in the second quarter. aec and manufacturing revenue rose 37% and 20%, respectively. geographically, we saw broad-based strength across all regions. revenue grew 32% in the americas, 27% in emea and 33% in apac, with strength across almost all countries. we also saw strength in direct revenue, which rose 38% versus last year and represented 30% of our total sales, up from 28% in the second quarter of last year.
before i comment on arr, i want to remind you how we define it. arr is the annualized value of our actual recurring revenue for the quarter, or said another way, it is the reported recurring revenue for the quarter multiplied by four. total arr of $3.1 billion continued to grow steadily and was up 31%. adjusting for our fourth quarter acquisitions, total arr was up 27%. within core arr, growth was roughly in line with total organic growth and was driven by the strength in product subscriptions. in cloud, arr grew 175%, propelled by our strong performance in construction. excluding $98 million of arr from our fourth quarter acquisitions, growth in organic cloud arr, which is primarily made up of bim 360 and fusion 360, increased from 43% in the first quarter to 45%, which is a record for that product set.
we continue to make progress with our maintenance to subscription, or m2s, program. the m2s conversion rate of the maintenance renewal opportunities migrating to product subscriptions was in the high 30% range in q2, which is higher than our historical rate. this uptick in the conversion rate was in line with expectations as our maintenance renewal prices went up by 20% in the second quarter, which made it significantly more advantageous for customers to move to subscription. of those that migrated, upgrade rates among eligible subscriptions remained within the historical range of 25% to 35%.
now moving to net revenue retention rate, during q2, the rate continued to be within the range of approximately 110% to 120% and we expect it to be in this range for the remainder of fiscal '20. as a reminder, the net revenue retention rate measures the year-over-year change in arr for the population of customers that existed one-year ago, or base customers. it is calculated by dividing the current period arr related to those base customers by the total arr from those customers one-year ago.
moving to billings, we had $893 million of billings during the quarter, up 48%. the growth in billings was driven by strength in new customer billings, and strong renewals with continued momentum in our core products. and as we have said in prior quarters and in line with our plans, billings are also benefiting from a return to more normalized levels of multi-year agreements.
remaining performance obligations, or rpo, which in the past we had referred to as total deferred revenue, is the sum of both billed and unbilled deferred revenue, rose 28% versus
last year and 3% sequentially to $2.8 billion. current rpo, which represents the future revenues under contract expected to be recognized over the next 12 months, was a little over $2 billion, an increase of 23%.
on the margin front, we realized significant operating leverage as we continue to execute in the growth phase of our journey. non-gaap gross margins of 92% were up 2 percentage points versus last year. our disciplined approach to expense management combined with revenue growth enabled us to expand our non-gaap operating margin by 14 percentage points to 23%, while absorbing two meaningful acquisitions. we realized significant leverage from our investments in sales and marketing and r&d initiatives during the quarter and are on track to deliver significant margin expansion in fiscal '20 and further expand non-gaap operating margin to approximately 40% in fiscal '23.
moving to free cash flow, we generated $205 million in q2. over the last 12 months, we have generated a record $731 million of free cash flow, driven by growing net income and strong billings. lastly, we continue to repurchase shares with our excess cash, which is consistent with our capital allocation strategy. during the second quarter, we repurchased 253,000 shares for $40 million at an average price of $159.54 per share. almost all of our repurchase activity during the quarter was through our 10b5-1 plan, which we entered into before the most recent market volatility.
now i'll turn the discussion to our outlook. i'll start by saying that our view of global economic conditions and their impact on our business has been updated to reflect the current state of various trade disputes and the geopolitical environment and their potential impact on our customers. while we have not seen any material impacts to our business, we are taking a prudent stance regarding customer spending environments in the uk due to brexit, central europe due to a slowdown in the manufacturing industry there, and china due to trade tensions. these items individually are not material headwinds, but in the aggregate are responsible for our guidance adjustment, which now reflects our current views based on what we know about the environment today.
our pipeline remains strong globally, including in these regions, but we began noticing some changes in demand environments in these areas toward the end of july. as such, for these affected areas, we feel it is appropriate to adjust our expectations for the rest of the year. as you will soon hear from andrew, customers continue to increase their spending on our products even in these areas and our renewal rates are fairly steady. additionally, we are now assuming more billings will occur later in the quarter for the remainder of the year.
at the mid-point of our updated guidance, we are calling for revenue and arr growth to be approximately 27% and 26%, respectively, which speaks to the resiliency of our model versus prior cycles. the wider than normal range of our full year guidance is a result of the greater uncertainty we are expecting over the second half of the year. additionally, currency now offers a headwind of about $10 million to our full year revenues versus being neutral at the beginning of the year. as such, the low end of our updated constant currency guidance is in line with the low end of the initial outlook we shared with you at the beginning of the year and it also reflects the potential for a slight deterioration of the environment from the current level.
while our billings guidance has come down by about $50 million, billings are still expected to grow approximately 50%, or 40% after adjusting for the adoption of the asc 606 last year. this supports our view of strong demand for our products even in uncertain environments. regarding free cash flow, the $50 million adjustment to $1.3 billion is primarily a result of our updated view of billings and their timing. we expect to achieve our original target of $1.35 billion trailing 12 months free cash flow during the first quarter of fiscal '21.
while it is too early to give you detailed color on fiscal '21, we expect to continue growing billings, revenues, and free cash flows while expanding our margins. this is supported by what we are seeing in north america, especially in aec, where our pipeline remains strong and we have more visibility into our business than in central europe and china. construction is also performing very well, as we continue to increase the value we are bringing to our customers. and we continue to make strides with capturing revenue from non-paying users.
looking at our guidance for the third quarter, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $820 million to $830 million, and we expect non-gaap eps of $0.70 to $0.74. third quarter free cash flow is expected to be modestly above the second quarter. the earnings slide deck on the investor relations section of our website has more details as well as modeling assumptions for fiscal '20.
in summary, i want to remind everyone that since our business model shift, we have moved to a much more resilient business model that generates a very steady stream of revenue that is less exposed to macro swings than when we were selling perpetual licenses. so while we are adjusting our fiscal '20 guidance slightly, we are still expecting revenue growth of 27% for the year, margin expansion of about 12 percentage points, and we are confident in delivering on our fiscal '23 targets.
now, i'd like to turn it back to andrew.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, scott. as you heard, we delivered very strong performance in the first half of the year, and despite negative headlines from europe and manufacturing, we are still seeing strong demand for our solutions. for example, a large european automobile company recently signed a new three-year enterprise business agreement, or eba, despite a more challenging macro backdrop for their industry. they see the new agreement as an investment in design, and they know innovation is needed to stay ahead of the competition. they view autodesk as a market leader in this area and count on us to provide new, innovative design solutions such as generative design.
the eba also offers them the flexibility to access our entire product portfolio, including products ranging from manufacturing and aec collections to alias, 3ds max, maya and vault, while at the same time representing a more than 130% increase in annual contract value for us. we will continue to partner with them to ensure that they get maximum value out of our products and remain a leader in an industry that is undergoing significant change. our customers know that at the end of every downturn is an upturn, and if they don't continue to innovate and use the latest technology tools throughout the cycle, they will be at a distinct disadvantage when growth returns. this underscores the importance of our products regardless of the macro environment as well as our customers' commitment to investing in technology to stay ahead of competitors.
now, let me give you an update on some key strategic growth initiatives we are focused on, specifically our continued traction within construction, gains in manufacturing and leveraging our digital transformation to capture the opportunity within our non-paying user base. these initiatives are key drivers of both our near- and long-term business.
in construction, bim 360 was the primary driver of our organic growth in cloud, led by bim 360 design and build. our customers are continually finding value in this offering. and the plangrid team continues to see strong momentum. for example, tutor perini, one of the largest general contractors in the us, selected plangrid, over competitor offerings, for two $500 million key projects. the team wanted to provide real-time, up to date documentation and plans to the field. senior management for these projects had used plangrid before at a different firm and this relationship provided an opportunity to demonstrate plangrid's capabilities for these two projects. plangrid set up the projects by processing the drawings and pulling out title block information, categorizing the drawings with tags, and hyperlinking detail call outs for 2,000 drawings in under an hour. this was an immediate time savings for tutor perini. additionally, the field teams have access to new drawings, changes, rfis, and submittals right away in an easy to use interface. going forward, we continue to look for opportunities to partner with tutor perini across all their products and subsidiaries.
buildingconnected and assemble also performed well as we continue to focus on integrating these offerings. during the quarter, we integrated buildingconnected's bid management solutions with plangrid technology, enabling the seamless transfer of data from pre-construction to the building process. the integration allows construction project managers to automatically push design and pre-construction files from buildingconnected to plangrid, saving time, reducing errors and further enhancing the cost savings associated with using both platforms. and as you recall, we integrated revit with plangrid with the launch of plangrid bim last quarter and have received tremendously positive feedback from customers regarding the update.
in the first quarter after its release, the product is also being used in over 650 projects by more than 300 customers. these integrations are steady steps toward providing autodesk construction customers with integrated workflows that connect the office, trailer and field. we are also continuing to see outstanding cross-selling with our recent construction acquisitions. for example, during the quarter, chick-fil-a, an existing autodesk customer, expanded its relationship by adding buildingconnected and assemble solutions to reduce the time to open new locations and downtime due to construction updates in existing locations.
and as a reminder, infrastructure is an area that we have seen in the past perform well during macro-related slowdowns and we continue to focus efforts in this area. this quarter, we secured a new enterprise business agreement with gannett fleming. gannett fleming is a leading, global engineering and architecture firm, ranked number 35 on the enr top 500 design list. the gannett fleming executive team considers a strategic partnership with autodesk to be a distinct competitive advantage. with the eba, gannett fleming now has direct access not only to the full portfolio of autodesk technology, but also to a wide range of autodesk services and expertise that will help them achieve their corporate growth and market expansion goals.
on the manufacturing front, revenue grew 20% in the second quarter, despite a more challenging manufacturing environment in europe. customers are seeing the benefits of our differentiated solution, and we continue to gain market share while displacing competitive offerings in the space. for example, during the second quarter, a leading swiss watchmaker selected autodesk's design and manufacturing collection to replace solidworks given the flexibility offered by our solutions. in addition, our investments in generative design and fusion 360 have resulted in competitive displacements not only in the cad market, but also in the computer-aided manufacturing or cam space where there are lower barriers to switching vendors. as a result, we see displacements of competitors like mastercam. and once we're embedded in those customers' downstream processes, we are increasingly penetrating design activities within those same accounts. customers pick fusion over competitive offerings due to its integrated cad-cam functionality, it's compatibility with other cad tools, ease of use and the attractive pricing model.
now, let's talk about progress with our digital transformation. many of you recall that a key part of this transformation will increase the insight we have on our non-compliant user base. one of the initiatives we undertook to accomplish this started last year and has given us the ability to analyze usage patterns of our non-compliant users. since last year, we have analyzed significant amount of data on these users, including how long they use the software and how their journey traverses across non-compliant usage to downloading free trials or using student editions. with this data, we can test different ways to convert them, including in-product messaging and leveraging our inside sales team.
while still early in the conversion process, we have an increasing amount of data that allows us to take necessary actions to convert this large pool of potential customers. in the quarter, we expanded our pilot cases for in-product messaging to many international regions and enhanced our license compliance initiatives using our sales teams as well as via email campaigns. these conversations resulted in multiple deals, including two over $1 million, one of which was in china. our billings from license compliance initiatives were up by approximately 65% versus last year, although on a small base.
so, as you've heard, we made great progress this quarter that enabled us to finish the first half of the year strong. we continue to execute well in construction where it spending remains strong. we are making competitive inroads in manufacturing with our innovative solutions and are making strides in converting the current 14 million non-paying users into subscribers. we are highly confident in autodesk's ability to capitalize on our large market opportunity and are committed to delivering on our fiscal '23 goals.
with that, operator, we'd now like to open the call for questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from saket kalia with barclays. your line is open.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
hey, andrew. hey, scott. thanks for taking my questions here.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
hey, saket.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
hey, scott. maybe just to start with you. just on the arr guide and the adjustment, it sounded like there was a little bit of a tie-in with the upfront deals that's signed in the quarter. i guess the question is were these upfront deals that were originally expected to come in as subscription but then came in is upfront?
i guess from an arr perspective, i just -- i imagine signing it in q3 as a subscription wouldn't make as much of a difference to q4 arr. but i'd love to just understand the dynamic there around the upfront deals this quarter and how it sort of impacted the arr outlook for the year?
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, it's a great question, saket. thanks for putting it out there because i think you're probably not the only one scratching their head. here's the way you've got to think about it. the -- if you step back and think of the way we define arr, it's actual reported subscription plus maintenance revenue for the quarter and then we annualize it by multiplying by 4.
so we give you a full-year arr number, what we're really saying is this is what we think our q4 subscription and revenue numbers -- subscription and maintenance revenue number will be times 4. what you saw in q3 is we had a fair amount of upside in the revenue line versus the midpoint of guide, the revenue was $18 million higher than the midpoint. some of what drove that was upfront revenue.
we always have a little bit of upfront revenue. so we have a couple of products, smaller products that under asc 606 don't qualify for ratable treatment. so we sell them just like a subscription. they look -- the economics of them look like a subscription, the customer buys it, they have to renew in 12 months, but under 606 you have to claim all that revenue upfront.
it's small products like vault that fall in this category. what happened in q3 is we have a handful of deals with this small product set that we thought were coming in q4, we actually got closed in q3. and because they upfront that revenue moved out of q4 and into q3 and there is no tail of it -- there is no ongoing -- all of their revenue is recognized upfront.
this happens every quarter, but this was particularly magnified where we had a handful of these deals that we thought were coming in q4, actually came in q3 instead. so good news is q3 looks super strong. the downside is that creates a headwind to the q4 subscription and maintenance revenue, and therefore, to the q4 arr calculation.
so it's kind of the combination of asc 606 and the way it treats just a small subset of our products. and then how that gets rippled through in the way we calculate arr which is actual reported revenue times 4.
what's important to remember is a couple of things. one is the way the rev rec works is not necessarily, i'm not -- it doesn't reflect the economics of the transaction. we sell these on a subscription basis, they look just to our customers just like any other subscription. so this change in arr isn't reflective of any kind of change in the overall economics of our business.
i think the second is, when you peel back the growth that we're going to see in subscription revenue this year, and you can derive this from the guidance we just gave you, saket, we see subscription revenue continuing to grow for the full-year, right? because that's an accumulated metric, it's q1 plus q2 plus q3 plus q4 when revenue moves across quarter lines, it doesn't matter when you aggregate to the full-year.
for the full-year, we see subscription revenue is growing in the 29% to 30% range. so still feel strong about that, we just got this anomaly between kind of the way 606 treats a small subset of products and how that gets reflected in our arr. that's what you see in the arr guidance change.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
yes, sure. that makes sense. it sounds like those vault deals where maybe term subscriptions, which under 606 kind of requires that that upfront...?
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. it has more to do with the product, saket, than the way we sell them. we sell them just like we sell every other product, 12 months -- you -- they pay us upfront, they get access to the product. at the end of that 12-month period, they either renew and continue to use the product or they don't renew and they lose access to the product.
so it's really transparent to a customer. it's more -- some of the details of the offering itself under 606 don't qualify for ratable treatments.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
got it. if i can -- if i can ask a quick follow-up for you. andrew, just to get off accounting. i mean really interesting development in the cad market just with more talk about saas adoption. obviously, we onshape got acquired and clearly you compete here with tools like fusion 360, but curious how you think about saas adoption in cad? and what if anything that deal could mean for autodesk competitively?
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
yes. first off, let me just kind of say that i have a lot of respect for jon hirschtick and the work that he's done over the years. i have respect for jim heppelmann in the work is done in the past and i think they're important forces in this industry, but the way this is all coming down and characterized is just off.
okay. so let's talk about what we all agree on and what's happening -- what's really happening in the market. so here is we all agree on, multi-tenant saas is the future of our business. it just is. it's the future of the entire software business. i've just been saying this for seven years now. okay. seven years and we've been executing on it for seven years. fusion 360 is a multi-tenant saas offering. okay. with the saas business model. here's the other thing we agree on. what does the saas mean? it means three important things. all right. data, the cloud is going to revolutionize data flow in the manufacturing and product development industries. it's just going to revolutionize. multi-disciplinary data flow, data flow across various parts of the supply, it's just going to revolutionize data flow. compute, compute power. we're able to deploy compute power through the cloud in ways we've never been able to follow [phonetic]. we do a generative design that's all computed off the desktop. it's all -- that is all a cloud compute exercise. and then the last thing, i think we all agree on that we don't all talk about this equally, and some of us aren't actually executing on it, is that we can layer machine learning on top of this data layer and with this compute and we can start doing predictive analytics and all sorts of predictive and insight -- and insightful studies on top of what people do. and some of our generative design algorithms already incorporate machine learning with regards to how they integrate cam.
so we all agree on that. all right. it's been uniform grid and we're all building that to some degree. we're all i think quite a bit ahead and i'll get to that in a minute. but here's is what we don't agree on is how you do it. all right. and there's a big difference here in the way fusion and onshape works. fusion is taking the strategy where we have a thin client, which is a browser and we have a thick client which is installed on the desktop and works on that cloud data layer.
the thin client, the thick client see the world exactly the same. they can't operate without the cloud behind it. they're dead without it. the reason we have the thick client is we're solving an additional problem if there's end-to-end workflow, all the way from design to cam, electronics and all these things. so we're putting a huge amount of power in there that you want to -- that you want to get in there in order to solve the bigger problem.
onshape put cad in the browser, a thin client. we knew from our thin client experiments early on, which were like five to seven years ago, that don't work. okay. that both don't float. and one thing, we've just seen from this acquisition is we were right. what was onshape installed base? eight years into this experiment, 5,000 subscribers.
we did more than that. we added more subscribers to the fusion base in q3 than that entire installed base. so, we're talking tens of thousands of paid fusion subscribers and we're talking about 5,000 subscribers for onshape. we know exactly why, because that thin client only solution doesn't work, you need a thin client and a thick client. sure, the thick client will probably get better over time, but that's what you need today and you also need the new business model with a different prices and the different options.
so, we just have a different view of how to do it and we're pretty convinced, we're way ahead. i think the data now -- now that we can see the data, we are now confirming that we're way ahead, but that's kind of where we're at. we all see the world the same way, we're executing on a differently and the market is voting with its wallet.

our next question comes from sterling auty with jp morgan. your line is open.
sterling auty -- jp morgan -- analyst
yes, thanks. hi guys. i'm wondering at this part of the transition, you mentioned the increase in the maintenance pricing, but what are the additional levers that you have to drive increases in arr growth on a dollar basis moving forward?
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
sterling, it's a along the same factors that we've talked about, right? so obviously the renewal base continues to grow. that renewal base comes to us at a better set -- price realization than that new does. we continue to drive growth out of construction. i mean you saw -- we gave you some of the data points, both in the opening commentary and in the press release. construction business drove $113 million of arr in the third quarter.
so we continue to see strong growth there as well. well, the core basically grows to a certain degree every year, which i'd say 6% to 8% growth in the core every year. so it's the same factors we've always talked about that will continue to drive that growth. i think one thing to bear in mind, we now are in year three of the m2s program and remember the very first cohort of m2s customers we signed, we've locked in their price for three years, but then at the end of that time we said they reverted to the terminal price which for that set of customers will be about 11% price increase.
we begin to see the front edge of that even for the m2s base that's been locked in. so we'll start to ripple in in the second quarter of next year. so we'll -- besides just our annual price increase rhythm that we've gotten on there is a few embedded price increases that will be coming through over the next few years as well. so, piracy recapture, construction, renewal base growth and some embedded price increases as well drive a longer-term.
sterling auty -- jp morgan -- analyst
got it. and then the one follow up would be you kind of surpassed already what you expect in terms of long-term deferred as the mix. you talked about the percentage of multi-year deals. what i'm kind of curious about is what is the collection terms that you're offering to drive some of the collection of these multi-year deals?
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
yes, it's a standard three years upfront,10% discount. i think you see most companies that sell on a annual subscription basis will offer that kind of a 10% is obviously a bit better than the cost of money over three years, but not a whole lot more and there is no extended arr terms. there's nothing else that goes with it.
what i'd say just to perhaps get it what's underneath your question, sterling, is we're monitoring that very carefully. and one of the reasons that i went ahead and gave you some headlights on fiscal '21 both revenue growing in the low 20% range and free cash flow growing in the low 20% range, is that i didn't want there to be this building perception that because multiyear is reverting to the mean. but that was some operating a headwind that we wouldn't be able to see the same kind of free cash flow growth next year.
obviously, it's an outsized growth this year going from $300 million of free cash flow in fiscal '19 to $1.3 billion to $1.34 billion this year, but we see that growing another 20% next year in fiscal '21. so we're monitoring the multi-year -- the percent of sales multiyear very closely and if we see it begin to run through hot, where we think it's not sustainable, and it will begin to create a headwind we'll modify the offering.
sterling auty -- jp morgan -- analyst
got it. thank you.

our next question comes from phil winslow with wells fargo. your line is open.
phil winslow -- wells fargo -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my question and congrats on good quarter. just a question on the next year's outlook, just building on your comments just now. when you think about the macro comments that you've made in terms of just geographies, as well as the different verticals? how do you think about the puts and takes for 2021? and then just one quick follow-up to that.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
yes. did you say for '21. yes, so first off, phil, let me comment on kind of what -- how we do things, since we talked last quarter. there really hasn't been a fundamental change in our view of the market right now. in fact, a few things got a little bit better. all right. that the uk and germany are still performing below our expectations, but they are growing and they showed a slight improvement in q4 -- i mean q3. i can't see that far in the future yet.
in q3 relative to what we saw in q2. the same goes for china. we're still not doing any business with the state-owned enterprises. but the business continue to grow just below our expectations, so we actually saw a little bit of a firming up. not a deterioration in the business, which is a good sign.
now as we look into next year, we're not seeing any fundamental change in the places where we've seen weakness. but more importantly, there is a trend going on that i want you to pay attention to, which is a tailwind for us as we move into any situation that we see in the next year and how we feel about next year. people are moving more and more rapidly to the model-based solutions we're deploying and the cloud-based solutions we're deploying because they see those is fundamental to their competitive shift, their competitive dynamics.
we're seeing continued acceleration of bim that is going to continue into next year. bim mandates, bim projects specs, especially going to continue. inventor and fusion 360 are growing as we head into next year and the momentum on construction is solid. in addition to that, one of the things that we always see as anti-cyclical as we head into any kind of environment is infrastructure. and over the last year, we've been investing in infrastructure capabilities in our product and a lot of those are going to show up next year and they are going to show up, both with regards to some of our construction portfolio and some of our design portfolio.
so we feel pretty good heading into next year and that's one of the reasons why in the opening commentary we affirmed this low single-digits growth in free cash flow for next year.
phil winslow -- wells fargo -- analyst
low 20.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
yes, low 20. didn't i say low 20s, sorry. thank you for correcting me. that would have been -- that would have definitely upset somebody. the low '20 -- the low 20% cash flow increase year-over-year.
phil winslow -- wells fargo -- analyst
great. that's great color. thank you. and then just a follow-up on that for scott, obviously you're not guiding to operating income or operating expenses, but also just help me think about sort of the framework for next year, because obviously this is an investment year plus acquisitions just high-level, give us your thought process on just the expense side? and then i'll go back in the queue. thanks.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
okay. all right. thanks, phil. on that one of the things that we've said is we expected growth -- spend growth and also cogs plus opex between '20 and '23 to be in this high-single to low double-digit range. if you look at the growth we had this year, spend growth in the guidance will be about 9%, but the overwhelming majority of that came via acquisition.
so the organic business has been roughly flat now for about four years and there is some pent-up demand for increased sales capacity for continued investment in digitization. so, what i would model for fiscal '21 is something toward the higher end of that low single to double-digit -- sorry high single to low double-digit range. so closer to the low double-digit range for fiscal '21, but then averaging out in that high single to low double throughout fiscal '23. does that get at what you were asking about?
phil winslow -- wells fargo -- analyst
yes. that's perfect. thank you very much.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
all right. thanks, phil.

operator
thank you. and our next question comes from heather bellini with goldman sachs. your line is open.
heather bellini -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great, thank you. i guess just twp quick ones. but one, just following up on what phil was just talking about. if you look out to next year, would you say that the environment that you're expecting the environment to be stronger, weaker or the same than what you had this year when you're thinking about the puts and takes of everything you were just talking about?
and then just was wondering how do you think about, in the context of what you were just saying about expense growth, how do you think about managing operating margins if the macro-environment did start to go against you? i'm just trying to think about the trade-off between driving growth versus protecting margins, if you can just share with us your philosophy there? thank you.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
so we absolutely expect things to stay fairly consistent heading in the next year. i'd like to highlight the counter-cyclical aspects of our business right now, with regards to bim mandates, with regards to the momentum around displacing solidworks and mastercam in smaller accounts for fusion, with regards to digitization in construction, with regards to infrastructure, because these are important things to keep in mind. but our assumptions into next year is these places where we saw our soft are going to continue to be soft, relative to our expectations. and we're going to continue to see kind of the same thing heading into the rest of the markets.
i'll let scott comment on the investment model.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
the only thing i'd add to what andrew just said before i jump in on spend management, is we do think by the way, there continues to be an accelerating opportunity that's not necessarily tied to overall macro spend environment in areas like construction and the momentum that you see us gaining in piracy recapture. on the spend management question, heather, you've seen us really exercise good spend management muscles for four consecutive years at this point.
i feel good about our ability to do that. i had mentioned that there is pent-up demand for spend, there is, but to the extent that we see the business beginning to trend lower than what we expected, of course, will tighten up on that front. i think it's a muscle that we've built that doesn't -- it's taken time, it doesn't go away overnight.
so i think you can expect us to continue to be diligent on spend management. that said, with the revenue growth we're expecting next year, we will not only grow revenues, we will be able to grow spend and expand margins. we are expecting expanded operating margin next year versus this year. so i think we're pretty well-positioned from a spend management standpoint next year.
heather bellini -- goldman sachs -- analyst

our next question comes from jay vleeschhouwer with griffin securities. your line is open.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
thank you. good evening. andrew, i was pretty intrigued by your several references to infrastructure, which is a business that as you know at this point of time, the company broke out and it looks as i would still about a quarter to a third of your total aec business, even after including acs. and so i'm wondering if that's a business that you might revert to reporting out in some way.
and also just talk about what you think the growth potential is of infrastructure as a proportion of the total aec revenue? and then as a follow-up longer-term question is well regarding your sales mix. that is to say, you 50-50 mix expectations of direct and indirect, we have direct potentially be in the store on that point, could you talk about whether you're still confident in the stores becoming half of half or a quarter of the total? if it -- what are the limitations you think or risks to that trajectory of growth for the store and if it doesn't come through how are you thinking about reverting spending or redirecting spending and sales development back toward named account direct and the channel?
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
yes. okay, so you asked a couple of questions there. so let me start on the infrastructure question. so, no, we're not going to be breaking out the business or providing any more color on what percentage, but what i can tell you is that we've made some deliberate investments in rail and road. some of those have already showing up this year, more are going to show up early next year that are targeted at where we believe some of the sweet spots in spending are going to be in areas where we have strength.
you might have also noticed that we moved civil 3d into the bim 360 design environment. so now the same collaborative power that we have on revit models is available for civil 3d models. that's important. that was something that customers were looking for.
and another thing we're doing that you'll start to see progress on is this notion of a common data environment, which is really important to infrastructure projects and it's important to particularly infrastructure projects in europe, but even in the us. people are really, really interested in these iso compliant common data environment that's going to be showing up really soon as well. so we've made some clear targeted investments that we believe allow us to go where the real opportunity is in that space. and on top of that, if you've been following what's happening with infraworks that product has really grown up, and its integration with esri and some of the things we've done there are actually pretty compelling and pretty interesting.
now with regards to the long-term targets. all right. so you're right. right now that we're at 30% between direct and indirect. and the reason for that is not the store isn't growing. the store is growing a lot. all right. it's still our fastest-growing channel in the company. okay. so our digital direct channel is still the fastest-growing channel in the company, say, well it's the fastest-growing, why isn't it showing more progress toward the goal [phonetic]. the true the matter is, is if the channel grew well too. all right. it's a -- it grew robustly and i think we should all celebrate that. and at the same time, what happened is because right now the store is essentially majority an lt channel. it's not totally true because we sell the whole portfolio there and we capture a lot of construction solutions digitally direct. it's margin neutral, right now. because the margin we make off of lt through the channel and through the store is the same. so we're getting the same economics. now, that said, i'm not backing away at all from the 50-50 split or the 25 for -- the half of that direct being from the digital direct channels. we're still going to achieve that.
remember, i always characterize that as a long-term target and there's lots of things that haven't lit up yet that are going to help with that. things associated with piracy recapture, things associated with construction there's a whole set of things over the next few years that are going to going to tip the balance on that number. so we're still confident. we're getting the economics we want. so we're getting the price realization we want, especially on the things that would most likely go digital direct. so we are still committed to that mix long-term.

our next question comes from matt hedberg with rbc capital markets. your line is open.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hey guys. thanks for taking my questions. the results of converting non-compliant users was impressive. i guess first of all, was this the best quarter for converting these non-compliant users? and then on a go-forward basis, should we expect more of the same of this cadence or are there in fact either additional steps that can in fact convert even more of these users?
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
so, matt. here's a few things i want to kind of characterize here. first off, we're absolutely on the plan that we always intended for this model. every year, we're taking a set of steps that we believe are going to materially improve our penetration into the non-compliant base. and every year, there'll be a set of new steps that we believe will provide some additional ramp up in that space as well.
so what did we do this year? we've rolled out in-product communication and tracking of how the pirated user journey -- the non-compliant user journey through the life cycle of learning they're non-compliant and what options they take as they travel through that cycle.
we introduced those things. we rolled it out throughout the year across more and more countries. and yes, we're seeing results that we expected, primarily through two things. one, we're increasing better leads to our inside license compliance teams and we are converting people digitally as well through some of the digital communication, but the digital communication also creates these better leads. to put in context, so that you kind of get a sense for what happened, last year we did 21 deals over $500,000 in probably whole entire year, 21 deals. in q3, alone, we did 19 deals over $500,000.
so you can see, yes, we are seeing increases in momentum and there is a whole slew of things that we'll talk about later, that we'll be doing next year that will provide us to not only get even more intelligence on this space, but make it more challenging for the base to jump to another pirated solution. okay. and that will be a discussion for later, but this is to plan. every year there is something that rolls out and every year, we seem to be getting the results that we want from this program. and given what we know we're doing next year. we feel confident we're going to continue to get the results we expect to get.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
super helpful, andrew. and then maybe, scott, just a quick one for you. on the multi-year renewals, it is good to hear that these are renewing closer to list price. just a quick question, i wonder if you could comment on the churn you're seeing for these is about what you expect that? just that piece would be helpful.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. matt, it is. and to be clear what i was talking about is, if you remember in q3 of fiscal '18, as we started down this path of selling nothing but subscriptions. we offered a promotion for legacy customers, turn in your perpetual license and for a 50% discount you can get three years at the same product on product subscription.
that was actually quite a successful promo. if you remember, we did over 40,000 of those that three-year term came due during this last quarter, while we saw we expected there to be a higher than normal churn rate and we did see that, but the aggregate value of that customer set actually grew.
so i think the promotion was quite successful. it got people to try, to move over to the product subscription and the aggregate value after renewal, and they renewed closer to list, not at the 50% discount, grew over that time-frame. so it was successful, but it did create a little bit of a headwind on our volume renewal basis.
remember we started...
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
on a unit basis.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
on a unit basis. remember, we started talking about renewal also as net revenue retention rate or sometimes, i'll call it in nr-3. and our nr-3 for the quarter continued to run in that 110% to 120% range overall. so this was a -- it was accretive to that metric.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
that's great. well done, guys.

keith weiss with morgan stanley. your line is open.
hamza fodderwala -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, guys. hamza fodderwala in for keith weiss. thank you for taking my question. so i just wanted to go back to the fiscal '20 arr outlook. so it looks like it was lowered by about a 1.5 at the midpoint. part of that was fx and some of that was upfront revenue. any sense that we could get for the magnitude of the greater upfront revenue? because i mean to me, it seems like the macro situation in europe and north america was sequentially better. so i guess why wouldn't that carry forward into q4 and reaffirm the 25% to 27% growth outlook that you gave last quarter?
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, tom, the amount of upfront revenue that moved from q4 back into q3 was about $5 million. so that was -- that contributed to the upside in q3 revenue, but remember, the way we do our subscription revenue times 4, that's that by itself was a $20 million headwind to arr in the fourth quarter. the fact is -- remember though that's upfront revenue.
so there is no tail of deferred once we put that in. and because of 606, we have to claim all our revenue upfront. there's no q4 impact of those. it just moved from q4 back into q3. but you see the full-year revenue, we see we've guided that point up because float revenue is an accumulated metric, it's q1 plus q2 plus q3 plus q4. arr is just take the snapshot of q4 subscription and maintenance revenue and multiply by 4. so $20 million -- the midpoint of that arr guidance change was $30 million, $20 million of it was just driven by this effect. it was about $5 million of incremental headwind from fx and about the same amount of just product mix. does that -- is that clear up -- does that clear up in your mind the move from q4 back to q3 and why it's an impact to arr?
hamza fodderwala -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes. so i guess ex-those changes would arr growth have been sort of reiterated if it wasn't for those one-time impacts?
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
absolutely, yes. yes, exactly. and the interesting thing about this, tom [phonetic] is the economics of our business, by the way, are completely divorced from the rev rec issue that we're talking about here. the economics of the business are unchanged, it's just between having to claim that as non-ratable upfront revenue and moving it back into q3 and the way we define arr as quarterly revenue times 4, it's that combination that drove the change in q4.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
yes, this is an interesting collision between the way we define arr and the 606 accounting rules.
hamza fodderwala -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes, it's always exciting. so i guess, just i had one quick follow-up. so the billings obviously came in much stronger than expected. to what extent is the shift to multi-year deals performing better than you expected coming into the year? and should we expect that long-term dr mix to continue trending higher because it's already kind of around the mid 20% range of total that we've seen historically? that's it for me.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
okay. yes, thanks for that to billings growth of 55% over a $1 billion of billings in q3, super strong. the biggest factor driving that is the growth of our renewal base. it has nothing to do with multi-year. it's just the overall growth the renewal base. beyond that the contribution from our construction business. construction continues to perform really well.
with the noise around the arr guide, we haven't really focused in on the success of our construction business as much as we probably should have. it continues to perform really well and it's driving upside to our billings as well. both year is part of it. and you're right. we're already at long-term deferred at about 25% of total deferred.
if you go back historically, by the way back into the fiscal '17 and '18 before we began this transition, long-term deferred ran as high as 30% of total deferred at one point, i don't think it gets back to that level. i think we keep it in this low to mid 20% range in terms of long-term as a percent of total. to the extent that it ran hot, and i said this earlier. in other words, we were selling more multi-year than i thought we could sustain longer-term.
i'd like to make a change in the offering. what i don't want to do is drive volatility and free cash flow, because of the offer we've got out there for multi-year. at this point, i don't think we've done that, but if it's continuing to accelerate. that's something we take a look at.

brad zelnick -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks so much for fitting me in. andrew, you highlighted the launch of autodesk construction cloud at au this year. what excites you most about the offering, how is the customer feedback into the launch and how do you see it driving growth next year?
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
yes. you know what excites me a lot about this is the way we're unifying the whole entire stack around this common data environment and it -- it's a real great return on the investment we made in bim 360 docs to that entire environment is becoming the common data environment and plangrid integrating into it, buildingconnected integrating into it. the existing bim 360 stack is already integrated into it and everybody is looking at this inside internally within the development and are saying, wow, this is an amazing opportunity for us to bring these things together. so the whole ability to have a conversation with the customers about, here is the umbrella brand and how we're bringing all these things together, so that they actually communicate is a really exciting part of this. and i think it's going to come rapidly and customer is going to be delighted. when we rolled it out, there were 50 new enhancements and there is a reason why those 50 new enhancements were in there is because we invested an acceleration of the integrations with respect to some of these things. we're moving faster not slowing down.
i'm really excited about the pace of what's going on. i'm excited about what the team has been doing. and i'm frankly excited about how well we are winning in the market. people look at what we're doing. they look five years out at the landscape and they say, ok, i'm going to placement that with autodesk, and i think that's a credit to the team and i guess credit to the momentum they've kept in here. and i think the whole story around construction cloud and the way they rolled it out and told it at au is really a great piece of work by the teams. so i'm really proud of them.
brad zelnick -- credit suisse -- analyst
awesome. and andrew, if i could just add another one for you, your results seem to demonstrate continued success in executing on m&a, how should we think about your appetite for additional deals in both construction and manufacturing?
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
well, we've always said that as we look out to the business, we'll continue to be as acquisitive as we were in the past at the very least. i -- we always look at market for organic and inorganic opportunities. right now, we feel like our construction portfolio has most of what it needs, we're partnering aggressively. we could potentially do tech tuck-ins around the construction solution.
as we look into other parts of the market, we'll just have to wait and see. what you see is we've demonstrated an ability to capture significant inorganic targets, integrate them and turn them into results. and i think that's one of the things you should notice regardless of whatever we do in the future that we have become a serious machine around, focusing around what are the real inorganic opportunities, how do we bring them in, and then how do you make them successful? and that's our commitment to our customers into the market.

jason celino -- keybanc capital -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for taking my question. building of the last question about the construction cloud announcement, it sounds like it's more of a branding -- grouping all your portfolio of products. what was some of the initial customer feedback that you heard?
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
yes. so, the customer feedback has been really solid and here is why. the customers don't react to the branding. they don't spend a lot of energy on that. what they do is they react to what we do. all right. so we like the branding because it helps us communicate simply. we were not propagating multiple brands out there. it allows us to focus our go-to-market efforts, allows us to communicate more precisely the company. the customers pay attention to what have you done for me? and what they were excited about at the connect and construct event and all the discussions there, is the feature velocity.
all right, they're seeing us delivering on the integrations we said we were going to deliver and they are watching us closely. all right. every quarter, they're going to see, that do we do we said we were going to do, do we do we said we were going to do. so that's what the customers are excited about. they really love the fact that we're integrating to a common data environment and we're building an iso standard, accepted common data environment, that's something that everybody gets a thumbs-up on.
they're really excited with the increased scalability and performance on bim 360 design, which was an area where they were kind of pushing on us a little bit. so those are the kind of things that customers are paying attention to. the branding makes it easier for us to tell the world what we're doing. so that you're going to see us basically amplify that. but the customers care about what we do, not what we say.

andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
thanks, abhey. building on our strong performance in q2, we delivered another quarter of solid execution and results, with revenue, billings, arr, earnings and free cash flow coming in ahead of expectations. for the first time, we delivered over $1 billion in quarterly buildings outside of a fourth quarter and our last 12 months free cash flow came in at nearly $1 billion, breaking yet another company record.
broad-based strength across our entire product portfolio in all geographic regions drove these results. we have strong momentum in construction, are gaining share in manufacturing and we continue to make strides in converting the non-paying user-base.
before we dig into details from the quarter, i want to recognize the hard work put in by the entire autodesk team, especially our colleagues in the bay area who ensured that our business did not experience any disruptions despite our san rafael office and many employees homes being without power due to wildfires in the final days of the quarter. our business continuity planning was flawless and the entire team went the extra mile to ensure that we did not miss a beat under very difficult circumstances.
now, let me turn it over to scott to give you more details on our third quarter results, as well as details of our fiscal '20 guidance. i'll then return with insights on key drivers of our business and provide an update on the progress of our strategic initiatives before we open it up for q&a.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, andrew. as andrew mentioned, revenue, billings, arr, earnings and free cash flow, all performed ahead of expectations during the third quarter. revenue growth of 28% was driven by strength across the board, with subscription revenue as the biggest driver. acquisitions from the fourth quarter of last year, contributed 4 percentage points of growth. the revenue upside versus our guidance was largely driven by deals with upfront revenue recognition, including those with the federal government or that includes certain products like vault and vred.
some of these transactions were targeted for the fourth quarter closed early. overall, we're very pleased with strong execution in the quarter. total arr grew by 28%, which is impressive in light of a tough year-on-year compare. our cloud arr all grew 164% tied to strong performance in construction. excluding $113 million of arr from acquisitions, growth in our organic cloud portfolio came in at 35%. bim 360 design was once again the biggest driver of our organic cloud revenue growth with strength across all regions. indirect and direct revenue mix remained at 70% and 30% respectively. revenue for from our autocad and autocad lt products grew 29% in the third quarter. aec revenue increased 36% and manufacturing rose 15%.
geographically, we saw broad-based strength across all regions. revenue grew 30% in americas and apac, while emea grew by 24%. our maintenance to subscription program or m2s now in its third year continue to yield great results. the m2s conversion rate increased to an all-time high of 40%. the uptick in the conversion rate was expected as our maintenance renewal prices increased by 20% in the second quarter, making it more cost-effective for customers to move to subscription. of those that migrated upgrade rates came in at 21% in line with expectations.
net revenue retention rate continued to be within the range of 110% to 120% during the third quarter and we expect it to be within this range in q4. similar to q1, some of the deeply discounted three-year subscriptions, from a previous promotion, came up for renewal. this group of customers renewed closer to list price. and we're pleased to see the total value for the entire cohort grow.
billings grew 55% to more than $1 billion. the growth was driven by our organic business, contributions from construction, annual return of multi-year contracts closer to historical levels. we believe our customers' willingness to make long-term commitments to our solutions underscores the business criticality of our products and we are closely monitoring the rate of multiyear buying to ensure it doesn't create a headwind to future cash flows.
remaining performance obligations or rpo, which is the sum of billed and unbilled deferred revenues rose 32% and 6% sequentially to almost $3 billion. current rpo, which represents the future revenues under contract, expected to be recognized over the next 12 months was $2.1 billion, an increase of 23%, so a solid leading indicator of the strength of our business.
on the margin front, we realized significant operating leverage as we continue to execute in the growth phase of our journey. non-gaap gross margins were very strong at 93%, slightly up quarter-over-quarter and up 2 percentage points versus last year. revenue growth combined with our disciplined approach to expense management enable us to expand our non-gaap operating margin by 13 percentage points to 27%. we are on track to deliver further margin expansion in q4 and approximately 40% non-gaap operating margins in fiscal '23.
moving to free cash flow, we generated $267 million in q3. over the last 12 months, we generated a record $972 million of free cash flow, demonstrating the power of our subscription model and the strength of our products. lastly, we continue to repurchase shares with our excess cash, which is consistent with our capital allocation strategy.
during the third quarter, we repurchased 856,000 shares for $124 million at an average price of $144.49 per share. year-to-date, we have repurchased 1.7 million shares for $264 million at an average price of $156.16 per share.
in addition, we paid down another $100 million on the term loan associated with the fourth quarter of fiscal '19 acquisitions and intend to repay the remaining $150 million by the end of fiscal '20.
now i'll turn the discussion to our outlook. our view of global economic conditions and their impact on our business remains unchanged from last quarter. as you'll soon hear from andrew, customers continue to increase their spending on our products even in segments experiencing some near-term headwinds.
our full-year revenue outlook has been updated for the upside we experienced in third quarter, partially offset by the early signing of some transactions initially targeted for the fourth quarter.
at the midpoint of our updated guidance, we are calling for revenue and arr growth to be approximately 27% and 25%, respectively. additionally, currency is now expected to drive an incremental headwind of about $5 million to our full-year revenue. we are adjusting our arr outlook as some of the expected q4 upfront subscription revenue was recognized in the third quarter.
additionally, fourth quarter arr is being impacted modestly by the currency headwind. as a reminder, we calculate arr by multiplying our reported quarterly subscription and maintenance revenues times 4. our billings forecast is updated to reflect our strong performance and the momentum behind multiyear deals.
we expect long-term deferred revenue to be in the mid 20% range of total deferred revenue at the end of the year. strong billings and operational execution are driving the upside to our free cash flow outlook for fiscal '20, which is now expected to be $1.3 billion to $1.34 billion.
looking at our guidance for the fourth quarter, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $880 million to $895 million and we expect non-gaap eps of $0.86 to $0.91. the earnings slide deck on the investor relations section of our website has more details as well as modeling assumptions. looking out to fiscal '21, we expect continued strength with revenue and free cash flow growing in the low 20% range. in line with our normal practice, we'll provide a more detailed fiscal '21 forecast on our next earnings call.
in summary, i want to remind everyone that since our business model shift we have moved to a much more resilient business model that generates a very steady stream of revenues, less exposed to macro swings than when we were selling perpetual licenses. we're committed to driving revenue growth while expanding operating margins. we delivered revenue growth plus free cash flow margin of 62% in the last 12 months and plan to end the year at around 67%.
overall, i'm proud of our performance and confident of delivering on our near-term and long-term targets.
now, i'd like to turn it back to andrew.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
thanks, scott. as you heard, resiliency of our business model combined with strong momentum in our products and great execution by the team help deliver another outstanding quarter, despite continued uncertainty in some parts of the world. in terms of the macro conditions, demand remained relatively in line with the second quarter. the business environment and our results improved slightly in the uk and central europe and our commercial business in china continues to perform well, despite a slowdown in state-owned enterprises.
during the quarter, robertson group, one of the largest independently owned construction companies in the uk to cover the entire construction lifecycle, significantly increased their adoption of our bim 360 portfolio. the company deployed our software on over 60 projects over the last three years and estimates a 28% increase in productivity. this is an incredible return on investment. we are thrilled to be partnering with a company prioritizing such impressive continuous improvement
and another example, one of the largest automotive parts supplier in central europe, nearly doubled their eba commitment with us this quarter. with the move to electric vehicles, the customer knows innovation is needed to stay ahead of the competition. so they are investing and retooling their factory and migrating from 2d-to-3d. our customers understand the benefits of investing in growth opportunities under all kinds of economic conditions.
these examples underscore the importance of our products regardless of the macro-environment, as well as our customers' commitment to investing in technology to stay ahead of competitors.
last week, we hosted 12,000 people in autodesk's university and customers walked away excited about our current products and our vision for their industries. in fact, 32% more customers attended the conference this year than in the previous year. across the board, customers are looking to autodesk to help them digitally transform their businesses and make them more competitive.
before i go into the strategic updates for the quarter, let me also acknowledge that for the fifth consecutive year, au las vegas was a carbon-neutral event. this sustainable effort is reinforced and expanded by autodesk's commitment to achieve company carbon neutrality in 2020. we're also delivering and continuing to investigate ways to help customers realize their sustainability goals through automation and insights in our technology. in fact, over the next few years, we intend to ramp up our financial commitment to this work by investing approximately 1% of operating profits in the autodesk foundation.
now, let me give you an update on some of the key initiatives. specifically, our continued traction within construction gains in manufacturing and success in monetizing our non-paying user-base. these are the initiatives that continue to be key drivers of our business.
in construction, the breadth and depth of our product portfolio continue to make our offerings more compelling for our customers. in the last two years, the number of participants from the construction industry had autodesk university increased over seven-fold to approximately 3,500. at au this year we announced autodesk construction cloud, which combines our advanced technology with the industry's largest network of builders and powerful predictive insights to drive more productivity, predictability and profitability for companies across the construction lifecycle.
autodesk construction cloud is comprised of our best of breed construction solutions assemble, buildingconnected, bim 360 and plangrid and connects these solutions with autodesk's unmatched design technology such as autocad and our 3d modeling solutions revit and civil 3d.
the announcement included more than 50 new product enhancements across the portfolio and deeper integrations, including powerful new artificial intelligence that helps construction teams identify and mitigate design risks before problems occur.
autodesk construction cloud is being well received by customers and supports our long-term plan. plangrid and buildingconnected continued their momentum is delivering a $113 million in arr with growth coming from new customers as well as adoption by existing autodesk customers.
during the quarter, one of australia's largest construction and infrastructure companies expanded its relationship with us by adding plangrid and bim 360 to its existing product set. the transaction resulted in the largest new product agreement for plangrid globally and the largest regional enterprise deal to-date.
we are helping the company adopt cloud-based technologies to improve project delivery and safety. the depth and breadth of our solutions that many other vendors in the space cannot deliver is very appealing to our customers. for example, we enhanced our relationship with ebc one of canada's leading construction companies focused on infrastructure, buildings and natural resources by adding buildingconnected to their existing portfolio of assemble and bim 360 solutions.
our sales team demonstrated how we could help manage their systems more effectively and prepare them better for the future. we were able to meet their needs for the design and construction phases of the building lifecycle for both the commercial and infrastructure industry segments. we continue to focus our investments on infrastructure, which has performed well in prior downturns. this focus could offer us greater resiliency should the macro-environment weekend. we recently announced availability of collaboration for civil 3d, which is now included with bim 360 design and enables teams to collaborate on complex infrastructure projects.
we also continue to gain market share in the infrastructure space. this quarter, we significantly expanded our relationship with jr group, made up of seven companies responsible for operating almost all of japan's intercity and commuter rail services. as part of our strategic collaborations, all seven of the group's companies will use our tools such as revit, civil 3d and autocad, over competitive offerings to develop a nationwide bim rail standard.
moving to manufacturing, the business is performing extremely well as we continue to gain share from competitors with steady innovations in generative design and fusion 360. we believe a large number of small and medium-sized businesses will look to upgrade their vendor stack over the next few years, which is a clear opportunity for us to grow market share.
similar to last quarter, we had a number of competitive displacements of solidworks, mastercam and ptc creo. for instance, a 3d display designer and manufacturer in north america replaced solidworks and mastercam with fusion 360, because it integrated design and cam capabilities.
in another instance, a manufacturer of plastic machine components in the uk displaced solidworks and another cam vendor with fusion 360 in their design and manufacturing workflow. the company was attracted to fusion's cloud-based collaboration capabilities, in addition to the integrated functionality and price point.
our success in manufacturing is not limited to, small and medium-sized businesses. we are making inroads and larger organizations as well. during the third quarter, daifuku chose autodesk as the best design software partner to move from 2d-to-3d solutions.
based in japan, daifuku is the world's leading material handling system supplier, serving a variety of industries, including the manufacturing, distribution, airport and automotive sectors. with its new eba, the company has standardized on inventors of 3d platform and is also considering revit for future building initiatives.
we continue to invest in our manufacturing solutions. in fact, some of you might have seen the exciting news coming out of autodesk university last week. we announced a partnership with ansys and our customers will soon have an option to use ansys simulation solutions while running our industry-leading generative design workflows in fusion 360.
we also announced the introduction of a new end-to-end design through make workflow for electronics in fusion, providing key capabilities such as integrated pcb design and thermal simulation. this is something our customers have been asking for as the market for smart products continues to grow.
with fusion 360, users can take those electronic ideas and physically produced them in the same product development environment, bypassing the current disconnect between design, simulation and manufacturing that make data importing and translation necessary.
lastly, we are looking forward to meeting some of you at our manufacturing event of the autodesk technology centre in birmingham, uk on monday, december 2, at that time you'll learn even more about our solutions and strategy in the space.
now, let's close with an update of our progress with digital transformation and how it is allowing us to monetize the non-compliant user-base. our investments in our digital infrastructure have given us unprecedented access to non-compliant users product usage patterns. we continue to learn more about these users and are in the process of expanding our compliance programs in additional regions.
during the quarter, we signed 19 license compliance deals over $500,00, including three over $1 million. the mix of deals over $500,000 was equally distributed by region. and one of the $1 million plus transactions was with a commercial entity in china.
our approach to creating positive experiences for our customers as they become compliant is paying dividends. for instance, one large manufacturer in central europe was paying for less than 10 manufacturing collections and had some old perpetual licenses. our data indicated much higher usage. we worked closely with our partner and senior management at the company to identify and fix and non-compliant usage, resulting in almost a $1 million contract.
the experience provided during the process has opened the door for us to discuss competitor displacement to further expand their usage and they now view us as a true partner rather than a software vendor. i am excited about our year-to-date performance and looking forward to a strong close to the year. we continue to execute well in construction and are making competitive inroads in manufacturing with our innovative solutions.
i am also proud of the strides we are making in converting the current non-paying users into subscribers. 20 years ago, autodesk was known as the autocad company. today, through the rapidly growing installed base of 3d products like revit, inventor, maya and fusion 360, we lead the market in bringing the power of 3d modeling in the cloud to all the industries we serve.
we are highly confident in autodesk's ability to capitalize on not only our near-term market opportunity, but also our long-term opportunity connected to the rise of ai driven 3d modeling in the cloud, because of this, we remain committed to delivering on our fiscal '23 goals.
with that, operator, we'd now like to open the call for questions.
",2020-Q3,ADSK
1.0,1.0,,,":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from saket kalia with barclays capital. your line is now open.
saket kalia -- barclays capital -- analyst
okay, great. hey, thanks guys for taking my questions here and hope everyone's doing well. andrew, maybe just to start with you, thanks for the commentary just by area. i want to look at it from a different lens and maybe see if you can talk about what you're seeing from your customers on engineering headcount and hiring? now, clearly that situation is going to differ between manufacturing -- between your manufacturing customers and your aec customers, but i'm wondering if you could give us some high level observations just about how your customers are approaching headcount during these times?
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
yes, saket, i hope you're doing well as well. look, there is -- what i'll do is i'll give you some indirect measures of what we're seeing. if our customers were engaging in a lot of headcount reductions what we would see is a tendency toward more partial renews in our base. we're not seeing that, all right, as we mentioned in the opening commentary. so we're not seeing this increase in partial renews which kind of talks to a stable employment base and a stable team environment. the other thing that we're, that we pay attention to is the whole notion of what's happening with weekly active users, ok? that's the real measure of economic activity happening on top of our applications.
this is something we didn't have during the last downturn. we weren't able to monitor weekly active use of our desktop products. that weekly active usage, while it declined a little bit as we headed into this is definitely starting to stabilize. so that's another indicator that tells us look, people are hanging on to their r&d -- their r&d and early project development team members. we're well up in front of the process here on multiple factors so people need to keep the people working on the stuff that uses our products in order to effectively, meet the demand as they come out of this. so that's what we're seeing saket.
saket kalia -- barclays capital -- analyst
that's really helpful. scott, maybe for my follow-up for you. you touched on this a little bit in your prepared remarks, and i'm wondering if you could just flesh it out a little bit more, can you just talk about what you saw in the quarter on those multi-year paid up subscriptions and just talk about how you're thinking about that in the fiscal '21 free cash flow guide?
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, thanks saket, and i hope you and your family are safe too; it's such a such a bizarre time. well, we did see -- so, multi-year continued to be relatively strong. it was an interesting quarter. the beginning of the quarter was quite strong. across the board demand was strong, multi-year was strong. it was really a continuation of the strong q4 and then right around mid-march, we saw things slow down. and it slowed not evenly, as we've talked about in the opening commentary. it slowed down a little bit by -- as countries were affected at a different rate. what we saw in multi-years, we did see it come down a bit in the second half of the quarter, but not substantially and you see that when you look at the total long-term deferred balance in relationship to the total deferred revenue balance.
so, well, it did come down. a lot of our customers continued to see value in buying the multi-year. our partners continued to see value in selling that and of course we get value because those are renewals that we don't have to chase that it frees up sales capacity, so the triumvirate of good for customers, good for partners, good for us continues. i do expect to see some headwind on multi-year transaction through the second half of the year and that's part of what is influencing the change in our guidance on billings and free cash flow as an expectation that multiyear will trend down through the year. certainly in the second quarter with some recovery toward the second half of the year.
saket kalia -- barclays capital -- analyst
that's very helpful. thanks guys.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
thanks, saket.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from phil winslow with wells fargo. your line is now open.
philip winslow -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi guys. thanks guys for taking my question and glad to hear that you are well and hope that same is true for your families and your team members. question first for you andrew, and then a follow-up for scott. andrew, you talked about, obviously the different phases of the construction lifecycle and different products you have there. when you're tied to your customers, how do you think about sort of reopening -- starting to sort of impact -- call it the architecture side, planning, construction, etc? and considering the fact, particularly on the aec side we seem to have a backlog of projects coming end of the year, what are people saying to you in terms of restarting and where sort of that backlog is especially when you think kind of on a go-forward basis and one follow-up for scott?
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
yeah, so the backlog comes in two forms. the first backlog is projects that were just put on hold and were about to go into the pipe. we hear a lot about that from our customers is that, look, a lot -- bunch of products were just put on hold until people know where they're at. those projects are not going away. none of them are in any kind of category that would represent a pull back from the projects. so, yes, at the front end in the design and kind of engineering side, there is definitely this queue of projects that were put on hold. the interesting thing on the downstream side in the construction side, what you saw was -- in some municipalities people actually stopped construction. now, those construction sites are coming back on right now and in some places construction never stopped, but they're not coming back on the same, all right? so what you're seeing is people are working with distancing -- listing requirements on the construction site.
so there's fewer people on the construction site. and these people are working in more shifts. so what you're actually seeing is more pickup in the digital tools and in anticipation from our customers that they need more tools to digitally manage their sites as they stand up these construction sites. the same goes in manufacturing. manufacturing, their biggest problem is that their output side was shut down. their new product development and all the things that are going on there, none of that was stopping. they just couldn't push the units out because of various restrictions on them. that's all starting to open up as well and that's what we're hearing from our customers. frankly, the one segment of our customer base that still doesn't know what their fate is, is the people making films; tv and film, they're still struggling with when the sets are going to go back up. games, obviously, they never saw a slowdown. but people in the film business are still waiting for when the production is going to restart.
philip winslow -- wells fargo -- analyst
hey, that was super helpful. and then scott, just a follow-up for you; obviously, we came into the year with a significant number of active users that weren't on subscription or maintenance. i'm wondering if you can tell us just sort of the trend that you saw in q1 relative to last year in terms of conversion of those to paying subscribers and just how you're thinking about this year?
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, it continues to be an enormous opportunity for us, phil. and it's one that we'll continue to pursue out even beyond fiscal '23. what we have seen during the quarter is we talked about this in the fourth quarter call as well. we've gotten better at the data science in identifying those passing on higher quality leads. that's led to the productivity of those license compliance teams improving and as the productivity improves we're investing more headcount there. that trend continued into the first half of the quarter. i will tell you as the economy got more difficult and as many of our customers faced shut down and very difficult situations. what we did do toward the second half of the quarter is, while we continue to pursue those transactions, we're not forcing a final transaction, a final outcome of that in many cases. so that pipeline continues to build. we continue to work that and build that up and that's an opportunity that's still ahead of us in the second half of the year.
philip winslow -- wells fargo -- analyst
great, thanks guys and stay safe.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
you too phil.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
thank you, phil.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from heather bellini with goldman sachs. your line is now open.
heather bellini -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you very much gentlemen for taking the question and glad to hear you and your families and the autodesk employees are doing well. i just had two questions. first, andrew, you mentioned the license compliance deal in wuhan that you closed, but i also wanted to ask -- given your global reach, how are you seeing business trends in parts of asia -- aside from that one where the economies have maybe been open for a little while longer? and any commentary, i guess the other would be any commentary on how the first month of this quarter overall is tracking versus the month of april? and then i just had a follow-up before -- had a follow-up one after that.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
yeah. okay, great. so heather, let me give you a little context. i'll kind of answer your question a little broader than you asked just so that you can a full set of the context. scott said, we kind of entered q1 with a roar. we had like a week to celebrate our success from fiscal year '20. and then what happened is march hit, you saw china start to decline, you saw korea follow suit. you saw a general decline in apac, and then kind of europe came online after that, started to decline, then the u.s. here's what we saw, though, as things played out. china and korea rebounded, right? monthly -- weekly, monthly active usage in china is now above the pre-covid highs in that country.
korea returned and became stable. japan was surprisingly steady through the entire crisis, all right, both from a business perspective -- from a business collections and from the weekly active usage numbers that we are tracking. and now what we're seeing is kind of the same kind of cascade happening in europe. we're starting to see europe weekly active usage is going up. new business is starting to go up. and you're seeing -- we're seeing a kind of a stabilization in the u.s., not any upward trajectory yet, but it's all cascading like that. and we saw this in our weekly active usage numbers. we're seeing it in our new business numbers. and another thing that stayed constant and stayed relatively steady was renewal rates.
now, we always told you that we anticipated renewal rates would decline slightly during a downturn. what happened was that renewal rates actually declined less than we expected. so, they've been -- they've held up incredibly well through this downturn, and that was consistent across geographies at all times during the crisis. there hasn't been some kind of sudden dip in renewal rates and some wavering. it's actually stayed like at a fairly consistent rate. the one thing i want to make sure you understand during the whole entire thing, our cloud products and our make products did incredibly well. like, for instance, in march, during the heat of all of this, fusion added 50,000 monthly active users in the month, right, in the heat of all of this, all right? we already told you about what was going on in bim 360 design and bim 360 docs, those products all did very well even through the downturn.
heather bellini -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's great. thank you. and then just one quick follow-up for scott, and i know you mentioned this in response to someone's question, i think, about long-term deferreds. but you had talked about, at one point, most recently, those being maybe as much as 25% of the total deferred revenue balance. i'm just wondering is there a level that you would set us at for this year that you think might be more reasonable?
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
no, i think that's the right range, heather. i think it ends up in the mid-20s. it had been slightly higher than that. you remember on the fourth quarter -- actually, on the third quarter and the fourth quarter call, i think there was concern that multiyear paid upfront product subs was going to run too hot and was going to create a problem for free cash flow this year. in fact, we thought this was going to be a year of stability as opposed to a year of a pandemic. and i have our multiyear offer actually on my watchlist, because if i got the impression that it was running to an unstable level, so hot that we couldn't maintain that percent, i wanted to make changes to the offering to kind of tamp it down a bit. we haven't made any changes to the offer. at this point, i don't think we need to. it's the same, pay for three years upfront; get a 10% discount; that it's always been. we saw it in the second half of the year come down modestly. that's my expectation for the year and that will put long-term deferred in that mid-20% of total range.

thank you. our next question comes from jay vleeschhouwer with griffin securities. your line is now open.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
thank you. good evening, andrew or scott. i'll ask both questions at once. so first, andrew, you noted a number of trends and requirements that are being accelerated by the current situation. what are the implications of that, if any, for your sales and distribution model? you've been doing a lot of hiring or planned hiring for direct sales coverage, named accounts, inside sales, the store and so forth, and of course, working with the channel. so maybe you could talk about any implications there? and then secondly, looking past this current valley affecting business, looking to your longer-term road map, you've spoken, of course, often at au, and other occasions about your new platform plasma.
what are the milestones for that internally that you'd be able to communicate over the next number of years in terms of its progress? and overlaying that at the applications layer, are there any major brands such as revit or inventor or anything else that you think would be prudent to rebuild or rewire in some way to take advantage of the new platform, in terms of collaboration, data orchestration, perhaps multi-core and multi-threading and all those good things? so a sales question and a technology question.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
okay. so let me start with the sales question. so as we've headed into this and looked at the year, as you've noticed, we've continued to invest. while we're not just going to spend as much as we originally anticipated this year, we're continuing to invest in r&d and things that we think are core to our future and infrastructure. there are some areas in go-to-market we did continue to invest in, like international expansion for our construction solutions and things related to supporting the fusion business. but, you're right, we probably slowed down a little bit on inside sales efforts when your inside sales teams, you don't want to hire more inside sales teams when you're having trouble getting in touch with customers when they're working from home.
so we slowed down some of those efforts, but there was no across-the-board slowdown in our go-to-market activity. in fact, what we did is, we prioritized those things that we thought were most important and invested there. and i think they all would make sense to you, in terms of what we're doing there. in terms of the longer-term growth, i think you're going to continue to see us invest in go-to-market internationally around our construction and cloud solutions. i think you're going to see us continue to invest in data centers and servers in our international locations that service our customers with some of our cloud solutions, because those are going to be in demand, all right? now, with regard to your second question, ok, we don't call it plasma anymore, by the way. it's a different name, which you'll get some view of later, probably around au timeframe.
so i'm going to be careful about what i talk about there. but look, first off, i want to make sure you understand. there's a lot in our cloud, all right, a lot in our cloud platform, a lot that has been exposed, a lot that hasn't yet been exposed. some of those things you're talking about allowing multidisciplinary collaboration, simultaneous access to a common model that updates based on different disciplines, but maintains control with, say, the architects or the engineers, you're going to hear a lot more about that in the coming months and probably around autodesk university. so i'm not going to steal the thunder from that. what i will say at this point is, we've got a lot going on, and we're big believers in the app model.
and what i mean by that is we believe that relatively modestly sized to thick clients with a really robust cloud backend are the future. and we got there in a very informed way. so, for instance, fusion has a thick client. but it has a very, very, very fine-grained multi-tenant cloud data infrastructure hidden behind it. fusion's cloud will get thinner -- client will get thinner over time. you could also see an evolution with revit that's similar to that. that's going to take a little longer. and we made that choice very deliberately, jay, because we've had lots of experience in pure browser-based applications. for instance, you might be aware that tinkercad has 25 million users. right now, in any given day, 11,000 people use tinkercad. it's the k-12 de facto standard for 3d modeling out there.
it's called tinkercad, but it's actually an amazing tool. it is a multi-tenant browser-based solution, as is autocad web, which has 50,000 monthly active users a month, all right, which does edits and creation of drawings as well as collaboration on drawings. both of those solutions taught us that thicker clients are better, all right? not totally thick clients, way thinner than our current desktop clients, way thinner, but like an app model. we learned this early on from our long years of experience with these pure browser-based tools. so that's why you see us doing that with fusion. you'll see us do something similar in the aec space over time. and it's winning because it helps get people to the cloud, but it has that same robust multi-tenant cloud database structure sitting underneath it.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
thank you. i'm glad you're well.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
you too, jay.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer

thank you. our next question comes from matt hedberg with rbc capital markets. your line is now open.
matthew hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. i'm glad you guys are well. there's always a lot of questions on construction and all the improvements you made on a product perspective there, but want to talk a little bit more about the momentum in manufacturing. we do hear really good things about fusion 360. and i know, andrew, you called it out on a call being a real disruptive offering. where are we in the momentum of that business? and relative to the investments that we've made in construction, are there many more that still need to happen in this particular part of your business?
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
in the manufacturing part or the construction part? i want to make sure i'm answering the question.
matthew hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yeah, the manufacturing side.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
okay, good. because -- all right. so i'm glad you asked the question. like i said, we're definitely seeing building momentum in that space. there's no doubt about it. fusion is on fire. i said in march, it added 50,000 monthly active users. there's over 600,000 monthly active users on the application today, all right? it's in the very early stages of a revenue generation activity. i am going to save the total commercial subscriber base as a reveal for the investor day coming up. suffice it to say, it's large, all right, and significant. in education, it's by far the leader. and by the way, it has a connectivity flow with tinkercad.
so we've got k-12 locked up with tinkercad and fusion's rapidly taking over post-secondary education and becoming more and more of a force in that space. i think you're going to see a lot of exciting things with fusion over the next year, especially as we start to reveal the data layers that are hiding underneath the thick client that we use for the application. so i want to hold off a little bit until investor day. but i will tell you, in any given day, 60,000 people are using fusion to solve real-world problems today. so i think it's an exciting application. it has really significant potential for the future. we are way ahead of our competition, not only in functionality, but in raw cloud power.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so it's a bit of a teaser to get you into the investor day next week, matt.
matthew hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yeah, we're looking forward to that. and then maybe a quick call for scott, i know renewals were stable this quarter, which is great to hear. i wanted to ask about the [technical issues].
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
hey, matt your -- matt, your voice is breaking up pretty badly. you started off fine and then i was losing a bit of the question there.
matthew hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
sorry about that. the joys of working from home. yeah, i guess, the question is how are vsb customers doing today? and when you look at your '21 guidance, you talked about some expectations on renewal. but what are expectations for vsb renewals in your fiscal '21 guide?
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, that's a great question because i think there's an expectation that, that segment, which we call vsb, very small business but to generalize that, think of that as a single site with 20 employees or less and 15 seats or less. and that segment for us typically drives somewhere between 10% and 15% of our sales. we're not seeing a difference in the renewal rate in that segment versus the segment right above that, up through enterprise. it's a bit surprising, frankly. i would have expected that we would have seen a bigger impact there, but we're not seeing that at this point. but bear in mind, as you could imagine we're running multiple scenarios constantly on the back end. and one of the things that i've had built into those scenarios is an expectation that we do see renewal rates move from where they are down modestly during the second quarter. and then the difference between the high end and the low end of our guidance range is sort of the rate of recovery of those. but just to be cautious, even though we're not seeing it yet, i am modeling that into the guide.
matthew hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks a lot.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks matt.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from steve koenig with wedbush securities. your line is now open.
steve koenig -- wedbush securities -- analyst
hi gentlemen, thanks for taking my question. i'll just ask two quick ones. i'll put them both out there. first one is, are you guys -- what are you seeing in terms of horizontal construction? is there any positive impact? or do you expect any tailwinds from the stimulus -- we'll call it, the stimulus spending. it's really the anti-recession spending the government is doing. so that's question number one. question number two, can you give us any color around your assumptions behind new business, kind of looking back at my autodesk model from the '09 period, your licenses, if i recall correctly, were down like mid 30%. it was pretty steep. and i'm wondering how relative to low and high-end of your guidance range, just maybe any color on assumptions you're making? thanks very much guys.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
okay, great. all right, so i'll start off and take the horizontal construction question. so we've been anticipating stimulus with regard to infrastructure for some time now and we've been investing in our core products for that, in particular, in road and rail. what you saw us recently do was engage in a partnership and an investment with aurigo, and i mentioned that in the opening commentary. aurigo is really, really strong in the early capital planning part of these types of projects, whereas we're really strong in the design and make parts. there's a overlap between our solutions, but they're very, very complementary. between the functionality we've been building in our design portfolio and this partnership, it's designed to bring the departments of transportation forward in terms of their solution stacks for these various types of infrastructure engagements.
right now, they're basically on really old stacks and fairly old technology; aurigo is a born in the cloud company, most of our stack is rapidly moving to the cloud. obviously, the construction stack is entirely in the cloud. so we've been preparing for tailwinds around infrastructure for quite some time. we believe we're ready. we believe these partnerships we put in place are absolutely the right kind of thing. we're already seeing some returns from those partnerships in terms of engagements with various departments of transportation. so yes, we do anticipate a tailwind coming from stimulus related to infrastructure, and we've been preparing for it.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
and to the second question you had, steve, i'll point you to -- i'll tell you what our expectations are, but i'll also point you to the slide deck that we posted on the website at the same time. i know it's a busy night, and there are other companies reporting at the same time. we actually moved to today to try and avoid a lot of other company traffic to try to lighten the load on you guys a bit. so there's a slide there, but i'll tell you what our expectations are. at the low end of the guidance range, we expect -- well, in both cases, we expect our new business to be most impacted in the second quarter. and then the divergence between the low end and the high end is the depth of the impact in the second quarter on new business and the rate of recovery, such that in the low end of the range we expect for the full year, we expect a slower recovery from the bottom in q2, such that for the full year, there is a slight decline in new volume for the year.
at the high end, a slightly less of an impact in q2, a swifter recovery, such that for the full year, new unit volume actually grows modestly. and that's informed by what we're seeing as markets have reopened by monitoring, as andrew said, what the weekly active usage rate looks like in each of our core markets and really getting an understanding of the usage of our products by our customers. things like our partial renewal rate staying strong, says -- if i had 10 that came up for renewal and i renewed all 10, that means that i don't have a reduction in workforce. so i think the strength of the renewal base, plus the -- our expectation on what new volume looks like is what differentiates the low end from the high end.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
one more point, we're not seeing close to the levels of declines in new business we saw during the great financial crisis ok, just to make sure you're clear on that.
steve koenig -- wedbush securities -- analyst
got it. cool. thanks a lot, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from sterling auty with j.p. morgan. your line is now open.
sterling auty -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah, thanks. hi, guys. i know that some of the hardest hit industries like transportation are not maybe viewed as heavy design users, but any sense of your exposure to transportation, hospitality, hotels, etc, in that group?
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
yeah. those segments tend to be users of things like lte versus facilities planning and facilities layout. so they're -- while they're big companies, they generally tend to be down-market users of our applications. it's a facilities usage play for us. so we don't have a lot of exposure to the main line of our business from those very hard hit industries in hospitality, transportation and in food services.
sterling auty -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
that's fair enough. and then one other question. any thoughts in terms of what you think the impact from a number of companies i've already talked about, post covid-19, maybe not bringing all the workers back and maybe we'll just see a change in the commercial real estate landscape permanently. any thoughts in terms of how that might impact your business moving forward?
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
yeah. it's careful to kind of think about that question in an important way. first off, commercial business building, the commercial buildings and commercial office space, not a huge part of our business. however, i mean, we're living this -- i saw this personally, so i can speak to this with some knowledge about how this is working. there's a couple of trends i think you need to be aware of. one, when people move to more work-from-home type environments, and we will probably have that on the other side as well, they're actually going to have less dense office space. so, for instance, the current requirements in terms of us getting back in our offices are going to require us to significantly de-densify some of our office space.
so, people are not -- in the short-term, certainly, not going to require less office space, they're just going to have fewer people in it, spread out more widely over the next 12 to 18 months, ok? so, we have to be very clear on that, people will be coming into offices that are much less dense. that's where we're going. it's where a lot of our customers are going, and they're going to need to reconfigure those office spaces in unique ways. and we're helping them to do that with some of the general design tools. but on a bigger standpoint, ok, there's still going to be population growth. we're still going to have workers.
there's still going to be a population that needs to come into an office, but how these offices are distributed and where they are may change. we've always been talking about a trend around urbanization, but we might be future talking about urbanization and suburbanization, where you're seeing this kind of spreading out away from dense urban centers into suburban centers that also have office space and high-rise living spaces. and then they're connected by infrastructure that requires them to have a hub-and-spoke kind of flow. so, there's a lot of ways that this plays out in the future, but in our projections and our view on this, people are going to be building more, not less. where they build it may change.

thank you. our next question comes from keith weiss with morgan stanley. your line is now open.
hamza fodderwala -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, this is hamza in for keith. most of my questions have been answered, but just a couple of quick ones. for you, scott, you mentioned -- so the low end of the guidance is implying that new unit volume sees a slight decline. is there any instance where we could see maybe overall subscription growth -- subscriptions actually decline year-on-year or is that just basically net new sub adds?
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, with the strength of our renewal rate, hamza -- and at least i got your name right this time. with the strength of our overall renewal rate and the size of our renewal base, no, i don't see overall subs coming down. i think the new unit volume could see some pressure, and we're seeing that in the second half of q1, but i don't see the aggregate coming down, no.
hamza fodderwala -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. and on the renewal rate, you mentioned it's been pretty stable. any color you can give us as to how that has sort of trended versus sort of the historical range, i think sort of like mid to high 80%.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, it's stayed in the same range. it really stayed steady, hamza, throughout the quarter. even as the new business slowed down -- i talked about the difference between the first half of q1 and the second half of q1. even as the new business slowed down during that timeframe, the renewal rates stayed pretty steady and stayed pretty steady across the board.
hamza fodderwala -- morgan stanley -- analyst

thank you. our next question comes from adam borg with stifel. your line is now open.
adam borg -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
hey guys and thanks for taking the question. i'm glad to hear everyone's safe. just a quick one on m&a philosophy. so, in the past, we've talked about large m&a being done on -- for the most part, on the aec side and potential focus shifting to manufacturing. just given the current potential market dislocations, would love to hear your latest thoughts. and i have a follow-up.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
yeah, so, specifically, i've talked about large m&a being done in the construction side, all right? i was very specific that we felt like we got the biggest pieces that we needed on the construction side. certainly, we are going to continue to look at all our markets. with the shakeup that will likely be accelerated over the next five years in manufacturing, with supply -- people rethinking their supply chains and numerous things associated with that, i think, our focus on manufacturing will likely continue. but don't think that we won't look opportunistically at opportunities in aec as well. the next 12 months could present themselves with all sorts of opportunities for organic and inorganic growth activity. fortunately, we've got a good strong balance sheet. we've got a nice recurring revenue model. we're in a good position this year to act on something that we think could be appropriate for us. so we don't see anything immediately in our future.
adam borg -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
got it. got it. thanks. and then just as a quick follow-up, multiuser licensing, i know that got pushed back till august. just curious how conversations are going with customers, and any feedback or color there would be great. thanks so much.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
i got to tell you a story. i'm not going to use specifics. it just came in before -- while we're preparing for today. there was a customer that was desperate to get rid of their multiuser licenses and move to single-user licenses, because they need a two-factor after a malware attack. so we've had people, customers coming to us now realizing that named users are not a bad thing, all right? as a matter of fact, when you're trying to move from working in an office to distributing your workers all over the place, it's really nice that you can just download the software, log on and it works. and they saw us responding much faster to their work-from-home needs.
so initially, before this crisis, we were getting a lot of noise about multiuser. a lot of that has started to die down. and in some cases, people are starting to realize that multiuser was not the panacea they thought it was for the problems they were having. and, in fact, it exposed them to other things. so i don't know if that will continue. times could change, as we head out of this. but, right now, it's been an excellent opportunity for people to understand and for us to have a discussion about what does named user really gets you and what are the benefits. and we're seeing some of that right now. so it's still early days. we've only done a few multiuser conversions at this point but there's some very interesting conversations around this.
adam borg -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
great. thanks, again.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
you're welcome.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer

thank you. our next question comes from brad zelnick with credit suisse. your line is now open.
brad zelnick -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks so much for fitting me in. and i'll echo all the well wishes all around. my question for you guys. it's good to see the strong usage of bim 360 design and docs. how much of this is temporary, given everyone working from home? and how much of it do you see as sustainable longer term? i mean, given the extended free trial, how are you thinking about paid conversion?
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
yes. so we didn't do the extended -- the only access program to drive paid conversion, as you know, we did it to help people work from home. however, our customers are being pretty definitive with us that their -- most of them are not going to go back to their old way of working. remember, once they started up a project in these environments and found that the fluidity of what they can do and how they can work remotely, they're very unlikely to pull the project out of the system unless they feel like, i didn't really need any of that. we don't foresee that happening. in fact, one of the things i said in the opening commentary is that, aecom was very explicit with us that we are moving to a more distributed model with these things. we're going to be increasing our usage. are you ready autodesk? and we told them, of course, definitively that we were. so, while some customers may revert back to their old way of working, we expect a significant number of them to come out of this changed. it's exposed them to something they really weren't aware that they could do previously.
brad zelnick -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks, andrew. and maybe just some follow-up regarding the strength in retention relative to expectations. how much is due to a tight labor supply, forcing firms to hold on to talent and autodesk subscriptions in anticipation of an economic recovery?
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. it's really hard to say, brad, what the drivers are, if it's a -- i'm going to hang on to people even though i don't have them put to use. i don't think that's the case. i think more and more -- if you think about where our products are largely used in the process, it's less on -- at least today on the job site and on the manufacturing floor and more upstream in the design process. and that's had a lot less impact from the shutdown and the shelter-in-place that's taken place in the wake of the coronavirus. so i don't -- we're not sensing a significant change in headcount and we look at weekly active users. we look at, i think, one of the most compelling statistics is that partial renews -- i had 10 seats, i only renewed nine, has held steady as well. and so i'm not -- we're not picking up that there's a change in the workforce or changing the work that needs to be done underneath the products.
brad zelnick -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thank you so much.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
the only thing -- remember, weekly active usage is starting to trend up in some of the places that were first hit by the pandemic. so we're seeing kind of the opposite where people are actually starting to use more as they come to their side of this.
brad zelnick -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer

thank you. our next question comes from jason celino with keybanc. your line is now open.
jason celino -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey guys. thank you for fitting me in and it's nice to hear from everyone. one quick one for scott. as we think about the different ranges for the guidance, it looks like on the spend side, its coming down to about mid to high single-digit spend growth. how do you think about the low to mid -- high end of the guide for toggling maybe some of the spend you might do?
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
the spend -- so first of all, jason, i hope you're keeping well as well. it's such a strange time. the areas of investment don't vary between the low end and the high end of our range. we'll continue to invest in r&d, given the lead that we've got and the fact that as our customers are being forced to digitize more quickly as a result of the distributed workforce plays right to our strong suit, it plays right into some of the longer-term r&d investments we've been making over the last four or five years. so now is not the time to take the foot off the gas on r&d investments. we're also going to continue to invest in construction. i think that's proven to be a market that is dramatically underpenetrated by technology. and so there will be secular growth in that space. we'll continue to invest there.
and we'll continue to invest in digitizing our own company to provide some of the value-add that we can provide to your customers. there's no change in the core focus areas. we are continuing to be diligent about spend management, as you'd expect, and there are savings. you can back into the savings that are built into our spend stream based on the range of our guidance and get a sense, there's obviously p&e spending that's going away. and by the way, i don't think it ever returns to the levels it had been historically. if the last three months have shown us anything, it's that you don't have to be sitting across the table face-to-face with someone to conduct business, whether it's a sales transaction or a brainstorming session.
so i don't expect that to fully come back. we've gotten some savings through rationalization of our marketing spend. we've moved many of our events to online. i think many of those will stay online. so there's -- there are some savings built into that and i think many of those will continue longer term. but the core areas that we're investing in, we're going to continue to invest in. and we're in a privileged position. so even with the level of disruption that is happening in the marketplace to be able to show double-digit revenue growth and market expansion two to four points through the low end and the high end of our guidance. so i feel good about the position that we're in.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
yeah, that's factoring, that we are growing revenue and margin at the same time puts us in a fairly elite category. given the acceleration of digitization we expect on the other side of this, this is the time you want us to be investing in r&d and the infrastructure that supports getting that r&d to the customers. and that's what we're going to do.
jason celino -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay, great. thank you. i appreciate the color and thanks again.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
thanks for the question, jason.

thank you. our next question comes from zane chrane with bernstein research. your line is now open.
zane chrane -- sanford c. bernstein & co. -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for fitting the new bearing and showing us some love. really appreciate it. i was impressed with the renewal rate, the net dollar renewal rate staying at 110% to 120% range. so i was wondering regarding the partial renewals holding steady, do you have any idea of what portion of your customer base is maybe benefiting from the ppp loans? i'm wondering if churn could maybe tick up once the deadline for the employee retention passes and you have a little bit more layoffs from those customers with the ppp loans at some point in the future? and then secondly, you had pretty impressive bookings, especially when looking at current rpos, i'm just trying to reconcile that with the roughly flat billings growth for the full year. so i'm wondering if you can give me a sense of what the average time deals tend to be in the pipeline before closing? and if you do have a weakening in the pipeline or the entry point of the pipeline, how many quarters does that take to show up, is it two, three, four quarters or is there any way to know that? thank you.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
all right. that's a lot to cover there, zane. i'll take the first one, and i'll let andrew handle the pipeline sales cycle question. on the first one, of course, there's no way for us to know, but i think that you look at the benefit of that program, it was targeting smaller businesses. and those -- one of the stats that we gave earlier is small businesses and i'll define that as single-site, 20 employees or less and 15 seats or less, that small business segment has typically driven 10% to 15% of our total sales. so it's a smaller piece of our overall revenue stream. it's hard to know how many of them have benefited from kind of the short-term loan programs that have been rolled out.
i don't know whether you call them stimulus or as steve said earlier, avoidance of recession. what we do monitor though and andrew talked about this earlier is, the active users -- the weekly active users of our product. and of course, we saw a dip across the globe, countries went into various phase of shelter in place, but then we're also seeing that come back, and i think that's also a strong sign of what we're not seeing as significant layoffs all across the board, also renewals staying steady is another sign of that. so it's hard to know to -- it's hard to give you a direct answer, but certainly the indicators we'll say, there's an issue there or not, we're not seeing that.
zane chrane -- sanford c. bernstein & co. -- analyst
okay, got it.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
so with regards to the pipeline question, all right, in terms of how things are going, all right, on general pipeline, so from a cascading, what we've seen in terms of new business is asia is already starting to turn up, all right. so we're already seeing the pipeline grow in apac. we're starting to see signs of that in europe. we haven't yet seen signs of it in the u.s. but given the cadence that we've seen around the pipeline from each region and by a country-by-country basis, watching not only the new business trends, but the weekly active user trends, which, by the way, presages the pipeline, we see building pipeline strength as you get further and further away from the start of the pandemic, which i think is a pretty positive sign for our business in terms of where we think we're going. and it's why we feel the way we do about the potential for the year.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i think the other bit of color that i'd add there is when you look at the change in our billings guide multiyear clearly is having an effect on that. we've seen it slow a bit in the second half of the first quarter. and what i've built into the scenarios that we've modeled out is that it continues to stay low or to modestly come down, a couple of points from where it had been throughout the year. and that does create a headwind on the billings guide.
zane chrane -- sanford c. bernstein & co. -- analyst

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the autodesk first quarter fiscal year '21 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today, abhey lamba, vice president, investor relations. please go ahead, sir.

now, i would like to turn the call over to andrew.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
thank you, abhey. to open, i want to thank all of the medical professionals and other essential workers who are confronting the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on the front lines. their efforts are not only saving lives but allowing many other people around the world to protect themselves, their families, and their communities. their efforts are truly heroic. thank you for everything you do. our thoughts are also with everyone affected by this pandemic, and our priorities remain the safety and well-being of our employees, and the continued support of our customers, partners and communities. many of us, myself included, are adopting multiple roles as we seek to juggle the demands of our professional and family lives in a world that has suddenly become both more complex and more constrained.
personally, i've had to learn how to home school my youngest child and while i've always had a healthy respect for the work teachers do -- i have developed an even deeper appreciation for the role teachers play in our societies. it takes a lot of patience and skill to help a young mind learn what it needs to learn. from a business operations standpoint, the transition to working remotely has been smooth. i am proud of how our employees and partners have balanced their personal lives with many commitments during these unprecedented times. many significant product upgrades were successfully released thanks to our cloud-based operating infrastructure. one of the metrics we have been tracking closely is the weekly active average users of our products and since the pandemic started usage of our products dipped slightly, but overall remained relatively steady.
in china, usage dropped rapidly in february but rebounded above pre-covid levels by end of march as businesses started reopening in the region. and it's no surprise we saw a major surge in usage of our cloud collaboration products as people worked from home and throughout the quarter. during the quarter and into may, renewal rates held relatively steady. among our target markets, aec revenue held up well while we experienced a slowdown in the manufacturing space. the resiliency of our business is anchored by the diversity of our geographic regions and product offerings, our subscription business model and our indirect distribution model, which allows us to operate and adapt locally as economic conditions evolve in different geographic regions.
during the quarter we helped our customers accelerate their migration to the cloud and ease their transition to working from home. we also offered extended payment terms to alleviate their liquidity concerns. please refer to the slide deck on our investor relations website for more details on these actions. i am incredibly proud of not only the way our employees rallied to support each other and the company, but also how they rallied to support our customers, our partners, and the communities they live in. without their resiliency, the resiliency of our business model wouldn't matter.
with that, i'd like to turn it over to scott now to take you through the details of our performance and guidance before i come back to provide insights into our strategic growth drivers.
r. scott herren -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, andrew. before i offer more details on the first quarter, i want to echo andrew's comments thanking our heroes battling the pandemic on the front lines. our products, partnerships and expertise helped many frontline organizations combat the pandemic, from the quick build of hospitals to manufacturing personal protective equipment, or ppe, and the philanthropic support of global, national and local communities. my own daughter has just graduated with her nursing degree and will be on the frontline next month. availability of proper ppe for her and all the other superheroes in scrubs has been my biggest concern, so i'm particularly proud autodesk has played a role in addressing that need.
our q1 performance was strong with total revenue growing by 20%, subscription plan revenue growing by 35%, and operating margin expanding by 10 percentage points. total remaining performance obligations grew 27% and current remaining performance obligations grew 18% to $2.4 billion in the quarter. we delivered free cash flow of $307 million and continued to repurchase our shares to offset dilution. typically, i would go through our results from the quarter in more detail but today i am going to focus on the covid-19 impacts on our business and guidance. you can find additional details on our q1 performance on our investor relations website. i do quickly want to mention that we have renamed what we previously called core business to design and what we previously called cloud to make. the prior labels caused some confusion, as almost all our products have cloud-enabled functionality. there is no change to the products that fit into each of these two categories.
during the quarter, renewal rates held relatively steady whereas new business not surprisingly slowed down in the second half of q1. however, the impact on our business has not been uniform by geography or industry. our business is not only diverse from a geographic standpoint, but our products and customers are diverse as well. many of you have asked about our exposure to small businesses. we generate approximately 10% to 15% of our revenues from small businesses, defined as customers with less than 20 employees and with less than 15 seats. our net revenue retention rate was within the 110% to 120% range. one of the other metrics we track for customer stickiness is partial renewals, which is a measure of subscription renewals where some, but not all, seats in a contract are renewed. our partial renewal rate remained relatively steady as well.
in prior downturns, autocad lt was a leading indicator for demand. however, during the current slowdown, our mix of autocad lt moved higher as some customers apparently chose to optimize their purchases. lastly, we saw a modest decrease in multi-year deals toward the end of the quarter although many customers continued to move forward with multi-year commitments even in the current environment. given the evolving business environment as a result of covid-19, we are actively managing our spending, reducing travel and entertainment expense, monitoring our hiring rate, shifting to virtual events across the board, and rationalizing our marketing spend. we will continue to invest in critical areas such as r&d, construction, and digitizing the company to ensure our future success as we come out of the pandemic. now, let me turn to our expectations for the remainder of the year. our investment in cloud products and a subscription business model, backed by a strong balance sheet, gives us a robust foundation to successfully navigate the economic challenges.
our full-year guidance range is wider than normal due to ongoing uncertainty in the economic environment that will have a more pronounced impact on our new business. regarding trends during the year, we expect the second quarter new business activity to be the most impacted by the pandemic. our pipeline entering the second quarter is strong and growing, but we're cautious about new business close rates. the upper end of our range assumes a swift recovery in new business in the third quarter and continued improvement into the fourth quarter, with full-year new unit volume growing modestly. at the low end of the range, we are modeling deeper impact on second quarter sales followed by a slower recovery in the third quarter and further improvement in the fourth, with full-year new units posting a modest year-over-year decline.
on the other hand, the majority of our business is renewals and we have not experienced a meaningful change in our renewal rates, which offers us resilience in an uncertain environment. still, we are modeling a decline in renewal rates in the second quarter out of an abundance of caution. our low-end and high-end guidance scenarios differ in the extent of the drop in the second quarter and the pace of recovery later in the year. given our strong renewal rates, we expect our net revenue retention rate to remain above 100% but move below the current range of 110% to 120% for the rest of the year. in addition to reduced new product demand, we anticipate our billings will be impacted by fewer multi-year transactions. the lower end of our billings guidance assumes a steeper decline in multi-year contracts whereas the upper end is based on a more modest decline. the reduction in billings and timing of large transactions are impacting our free cash flow expectations.
fiscal '21 will be a significantly more back-end loaded year, which will move some of the free cash flow from this year to next. we expect our full-year operating margin to expand by approximately 2 to 4 percentage points. looking at the second quarter forecast, we expect the pandemic to meaningfully impact our billings, which can be sequentially down by low double-digit percent. additionally, our decision to offer extended payment terms to our customers for sales up through early august, combined with a more back-end loaded quarter will impact our q2 free cash flow, which could end up being breakeven to slightly negative before accelerating in the second half of the year. although our fiscal year '21 results are being impacted by covid-19, we are confident in our fiscal '23 free cash flow target of $2.4 billion, assuming the recovery starts by the end of this fiscal year. we've built a resilient business model that will allow us to capitalize on multiple tailwinds once we exit the current pandemic.
and now, i'd like to turn it back to andrew.
andrew anagnost -- president and chief executive officer, board director
thank you, scott. we expect all secular trends that we have been investing in for years to be accelerated during and beyond this pandemic. people are being forced to change the way they work and in turn are experiencing the benefits that our cloud and subscription solutions have to offer. these companies are not going to go back to how they worked before, and digitization will be accelerated as businesses take all steps necessary to ensure they are more resilient. our investments over the last few years combined with our ongoing focus on cloud-based offerings leave us with a competitive advantage and well positioned to help our customers not only during this pandemic, but also in the new world that they will be working in when it is over.
in fact, some of our biggest customers are already altering the mix of our products to lean more heavily into the cloud and digitization. although aec spending has held up well and work is continuing, some customers are seeing project delays, cancellations and in some cases job sites temporarily shut down. however, despite these realities, we have seen continued adoption of our construction offerings. for example, meja construction, a general contractor in southeastern united states, selected our products over a competitive construction management solution at their time of renewal. their business is growing rapidly and price was becoming a concern with their current vendor. they needed a comprehensive solution that was fast and easy to implement. the multi-year deal started with plangrid for the field, evolved to include bim 360 for the office and field connectivity, and ultimately included buildingconnected for project bidding.
many construction sites were shut down temporarily, impacting our new business for field focused solutions like plangrid. however, our products span the complete construction value chain and our collaboration products like bim 360 design and docs experienced solid growth. our extended access program allows customers to try out and experience the value of the cloud collaboration products at no cost for a limited period of time. we are seeing customers who were in the process of adoption accelerate their timelines. we are also seeing customers purchase additional seats directly through our digital store. since early march, cumulative new commercial projects grew over 200% in bim 360 design and over 100% in bim 360 docs. this surge in usage has been a great test for our cloud product infrastructure, which has scaled up seamlessly.
as you might recall, bim 360 design is the cloud collaboration tool that allows our customers to use our design products anytime, anywhere with data stored in the cloud. now that customers are experiencing cloud-based solutions that allow them to work efficiently from anywhere, we do not think they will revert to previous ways of working. one of our largest customers, aecom, significantly increased their adoption of bim 360 and reached out to us beforehand to ensure that we were set up to support the increased usage. aecom is the world's premier infrastructure firm. david felker, cio, americas and construction, recently commented, ""we're shifting rapidly to remote working, which is absolutely essential for the continuity of our business. our strategic partnership with autodesk and the bim 360 cloud platform along with substantial investments in digital solutions and technology have enabled our successful pivot to this new way of working. we forecast that our use of bim 360 will continue to grow dramatically in the short term and will become our new baseline for projects in the long term.""
we are not only helping our customers work remotely, we are also doing so quickly. when new zealand went into lockdown overnight, we helped warren and mahoney architects successfully mobilize their entire business to work from home in five days. in the process they doubled their number of bim 360 design subscriptions. they told us they would not have been able to so successfully continue their business operations while working from home without our support, and they also noted that all projects will be delivered using our platform going forward. we believe the current pandemic will accelerate digitization and automation in the aec industry as customers look to make their businesses more resilient. at the end of every downturn there is an upturn and businesses will need our products more than ever to stay competitive on the other side of this.
one segment that has historically done well as governments seek to provide stimulus is infrastructure. during the quarter we announced an alliance with aurigo to better serve public and private owners. capital project owners at departments of transportation, cities, counties and enterprises will benefit from this alliance and we are already receiving positive feedback from customers. this quarter we had a top architecture firm, and a subsidiary of one of the largest state-owned enterprises in china, choose our products over bentley's. their typical projects for domestic and international clients include healthcare infrastructure, stadiums, airports and skyscrapers. autodesk's streamlined workflows and data compatibility allow them to collaborate across teams and bring digital design down to the construction service phase. beyond that, they have already taken advantage of our products for generating optimized design schemes and are excited to use generative design in revit, as we recently announced generative design is available in revit 2021.
as our customers plan to return to work safely, they need help redesigning space layouts in buildings and this is one of the things generative design enables people to do effectively. although manufacturing has been impacted by supply chain disruptions and temporary factory shutdowns, our products are enabling customers to operate under evolving conditions. customers use our solutions to develop new products and r&d continues even when production floors experience disruption. automation and flexible supply chains will be vital to competitiveness in the future. our products help customers work remotely in the distributed environment, and collaborate among their divisions, customers and supply chains in the cloud.
fusion 360 is the leading comprehensive multi-tenant cloud cad, cam and plm solution, and continued to gain traction during this pandemic as customers are reassessing their technology portfolio's readiness to cope with the demands of distributed work. in fact, april was the fastest growing month for new user acquisition. a good example of this is that we closed a large stand-alone fusion 360 deal with a big semiconductor company. currently they use the electronics design capabilities in fusion for their printed circuit board design work, and we expect to further expand our presence with them due to the integrated functionality offered by our products at a more attractive price point. in addition, basf, the largest chemical producer in the world, increased their eba users of fusion 360 to 2,000 during the quarter.
they look forward to using fusion 360 as a collaboration platform to improve the efficiency of communication between several teams, starting with equipment design and maintenance at one of their chemical plants. growth remains strong relative to our competition across our manufacturing portfolio. customers of our on-premise solutions report minimal disruption in the move to remote work, which has been supported by cloud features included in our subscription offering. during the quarter, we signed our first enterprise business agreement with an automobile manufacturer in china. the usage-based model was a good fit for the customer who needs flexible access to our expansive portfolio of products. covid-19 was a catalyst for them to substantially increase their engagement with us. they made the decision to adopt the most efficient solution to ensure they stay competitive in their industry on the other side of this downturn.
in addition to growing our presence in the commercial space, we continue to maintain our leadership in the education space where future engineers are rapidly adopting our products. our new user acquisition in the education space, driven by fusion 360, went up over 70% in april. moving onto another high-priority area for us, we are still making traction monetizing noncompliant users. in terms of sales-led initiatives, we are being sensitive to customer situations and are often deferring the final outreach. but this does not mean progress has stopped. the first deal we closed in wuhan after the business reopened was a license compliance transaction that we had been working on for many months prior to the pandemic. we closed an additional license compliance deal and competitive win over bentley in central america and the customer is now piloting bim 360 docs.
in closing, while all of us are impacted by the current pandemic, we are building a stronger autodesk for the next year and beyond. we have a head start over our competition in critical capabilities like cloud computing and cloud-based collaboration, and we will continue to invest in our strategic initiatives. there are three key areas that make us confident in our fiscal '23 targets and our growth after that: one, digitization in aec is going to accelerate in the coming years as companies seek to adopt not only bim, but complete design-to-make workflows enabled by the cloud that not only make current processes more resilient and efficient but support new industrial paradigms for the construction site. two, the evolution of manufacturing to a more distributed, networked, and cloud-based workflow is also going to accelerate significantly over the next few years.
and we have the industry's leading multi-tenant, cloud-based solution to address the emerging customer needs that will come with this new paradigm. and three, finally, our business model is more robust, adaptable, and resilient than in the entire history of the company. this will allow us to not only invest aggressively in the future but do so with an eye to both revenue and margin growth. we look forward to virtually engaging with many of you at investor day, on june 3rd, where we will have more time to share our strategic initiatives.
with that, operator, we'd now like to open the call up for questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of saket kalia from barclays capital. your line is now open.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
ok. great. hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions here.
and scott, congratulations on the next step. you'll certainly be missed.
scott herren -- chief financial officer
thanks, saket.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
andrew, maybe first for you. a lot to talk about, but one of the questions that i feel like we got a little bit, especially during the month of october and november, were what potentially higher infrastructure spending spurred by the government could mean for autodesk. and of course, we don't know what that looks like yet, or frankly, even if it will happen, but i was wondering if you could share some of what autodesk maybe saw during the 2009 recovery and reinvestment act as perhaps a frame of reference. does that make sense?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes, saket. that makes sense. first off, let me start the question by being super clear. we don't have any kind of projections around stimulus or the impact of stimulus on our business in any of our models, all right? that's stuff that we leave out because one does not want to leave themselves exposed to the vagaries of governments.
however, if we go back to '08 and '09, and i think it's important to remember this, one of the narratives out there about autodesk in '08 and '09 is autodesk is so exposed to the housing market. oh, my gosh. and the reality was that autodesk revenue recovered well significantly faster than the housing market did, and that was because of the distributed nature of our work and our customer base and the projects and the sectors that we cover. infrastructure spending and stimulus spending, that then absolutely helped because it created a pipeline of projects that were new, but we were already recovering before some of the stimulus showed up.
and i think it's important to recognize that. if you look at what the impact might be if we actually see some of this show up and we actually see some important stimulus, obviously, it's going to increase the project pipelines of our customers. and that's always good for us. and it could see more adoption of our portfolio.
it could be really good for the construction portfolio. but again, saket, i want to make it super clear, we don't model that kind of stuff in our outlook, and we're not expecting it to hit our numbers.
scott herren -- chief financial officer
yes. saket, the only other comment that i'd add on top of that is, look, let's say an infrastructure bill does get passed. it will take some time for that bill to turn into real projects and for those projects to get put out to bid and for that then to downstream, start to drive our business. so even if that were to happen, let's say, early in the new administration, i wouldn't expect it to have a material impact on fiscal '22 anyway.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
got it. that's super helpful. scott, maybe for my follow-up for you. thanks for the early fiscal '22 guide.
it's very helpful. i guess with 20% free cash flow growth next year and that target of $2.4 billion in fiscal '23, it looks like that acceleration in free cash flow that we're seeing here in fiscal '21 is going to â actually in fiscal '21 and '22 is going to continue into '23. can you just talk a little bit about some of the drivers that might contribute to that? you touched on this a little bit on your prepared comments. so i'm just wondering if you could double-click on it once more.
scott herren -- chief financial officer
yes. sure, saket. and by the way, you were one of the ones that got it right, actually, as i recall, looking at your preview note for what to expect on fiscal '22. and as you know, we've been running multiple scenarios.
i've been probably driving my team crazy running scenarios over the last nine months. and in each case, we run it not just for the impact to this fiscal year and next fiscal year, out through fiscal '23 to even fiscal '25 and beyond. so to have a good sense of how the model responds to a variety of different scenarios, that's part of what underpins our confidence in fiscal '23. but if you step back and say, what are the drivers behind that, i mean i'll start with the biggest driver.
you've seen our renewal rates stay steady through this process. and in fact, even modestly, we saw a sequential increase in renewal rates. but given the size of our renewal base, that's a big driver longer term. and we talked about the net revenue retention rate kind of staying in that 100% to 110% range even during the pandemic.
so if you take a big renewal base with a high renewal rate and a 100% to 110% net revenue retention rate, that drives a lot of growth. add to that what we're seeing in cloud and the cloud product's acceleration overall. we still have a pretty significant opportunity to convert nonpaying users out in front of us. and we've built the leading portfolio, product portfolio in construction.
so there's a â and we've talked again today about the success of our manufacturing business and where we're headed there and some of the traction we're beginning to get with fusion 360 and the way we're monetizing that with some of the extensions. so there's a lot behind that. that's what drives our confidence not just in this year and some of the early view i gave you of fiscal '22 but then how that ramps up out through fiscal '23. i think there's two other quick things that i'd like to add to that.
we do â we're seeing a modest improvement in economic activity right now that andrew talked about. certain countries are back to pre-covid levels, but it's not consistent. our expectation is that we will see continued economic improvement through next year, but that will â i doubt it's going to be a straight line, right? i think that will be more pronounced in the second half of next year, which means the year will be a bit more back-end loaded. and that linearity effects not just revenue.
it also affects when we collect cash. a lot of the sales of that momentum in the second half of the year will turn into fiscal '23 free cash flow. and then one other item that i want to get on the call so that you can build it into your model. we do see a cash tax impact year on year this year to next year of about $50 million to $60 million as our profitability has improved fairly significantly.
so you add all those together, that's what underpins our confidence, the early view of fiscal '22 cash flow and our confidence in the $2.4 billion in fiscal '23.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
got it. that's very helpful. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from matt hedberg from rbc capital markets. your line is now open.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hey. great. guys, thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on these numbers in a really difficult situation. i will also offer my congrats to scott.
it's been great working with you. obviously, we'll miss you at autodesk, but congrats and best of luck. andrew, i wanted to ask about the nine-figure, three-year renewal deal. that is super exciting.
i guess i'm wondering, can you give us a bit of history on how that customer has grown to this level and maybe the opportunity for other enterprise deals of this caliber given your sort of extended platform these days.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. so we actually broke records a couple of times during this quarter. so these deals are becoming more of the norm than not in our quarters. and i want to tell you what essentially underpins all of these.
and i think it's important and it kind of â it's the same dynamic in all of them. our customers look three years out. they look at what they're trying to do internally transformationally with digital transformation or with the transition to bim or with the transition to the cloud with fusion and other things associated with that. and they ask themselves, ok, what are they going to need in an eba in order to drive and maintain that expansion without coming back and renegotiating the contract with us again.
that's what's powering this, a strategic discussion about what are the long-term adoption requirements of these customers. so for instance, a customer might see themselves expanding more into industrialized construction and applying both inventor and revit more broadly in their process, and they want to make sure they plan for that, or they're going to see expansion of construction cloud deeper into their processes. so they're planning for that. they're saying, well, i'm using this much construction cloud this year.
i'm going to use this much next year or the year after that, the year after that. so this is what is driving these kinds of deals, this discussion about the three-year expansion of usage of our portfolio in these accounts. and it's not just usage across users. it's usage across breadth of portfolio.
otherwise, you couldn't see deals of these size coming through. that's the dynamic that plays out in almost all of these deals that we're seeing. makes sense, matt?
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. yes. no. that's super helpful.
and then maybe just to double-click on the saas side. i mean, andrew, you talk to executives every day. and i guess i think we're all excited about the prospects of the vaccine. on those conversations though, in a post-covid world, i mean, do you get a sense that â you've always had a lot of success with 360 saas today.
but do you think we could see even a bit of a slingshot effect as part of these larger deals as customers really effectively race to embrace saas potentially for the next pandemic at some point?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. i actually think it even goes beyond pandemics. it's like once you got a taste of it, you want more of it is what's going on, too, ok? because remember, some of these customers, they were not broadly deploying our saas solutions prior to the pandemic. and what they're seeing now is, you know what, this stuff is important.
i need to get on it, and i need to prepare for the future, and this is how i'm going to drive my digitization. so we're absolutely going to see continued growth in these saas platforms. it's interesting that you mentioned the vaccine and things like that because what we're seeing when we talk to executives right now is everybody doesn't see a change in the time line of how this pandemic is going to play out. but all of us, what we're seeing is increasing reduction in uncertainty.
it starts with vaccine conversations and then more than one vaccine. and then it goes into, hey, the u.s. election is getting less uncertain. who's going to be the president is less uncertain.
so there's this progressive building of uncertainty being removed. and customers are getting more and more comfortable about looking at their second half investment scenarios for next year, and saas is in every one of those conversations, ok? and i think as long as we continue on this trajectory of uncertainty being removed, you're going to see people being increasingly comfortable with how they feel about the second half of next year.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of philip winslow from wells fargo. your line is now open.
philip winslow -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
congrats on this great quarter. and scott, obviously, it's been a real pleasure working with you not just at autodesk but going back to citrix. and we'll definitely miss you, my friend.
scott herren -- chief financial officer
thanks, phil.
philip winslow -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
i got a question for you in terms of the aec portfolio. obviously, very diversified in terms of the sort of the stages of, call it, building from design, planning, actual construction. and so i guess sort of a 2-part question here. what are you seeing in sort of that portfolio right now and into q4? and then when you are thinking about next fiscal year, how are you expecting sort of the ebbs and flows of that portfolio to play out?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. actually, phil, you're pushing on an important competitive differentiator for us. the breadth of capability we have across the entire aec cycle and the way we're integrating that information in the cloud is fairly unique, all right? and what we're seeing â and this is something that i think you'll see progressively again and again. right now, a lot of people are talking about digital twins, and that's the vocabulary that's out there.
obviously, we haven't used that vocabulary very often. but what's going on right now is bim â 3d bim is the original digital twin, all right? and this whole discussion around digital twins and aec and things associated with it is accelerating the dialogue around if i want to do digital twins, i got to do bim because there's no digital twin without a building information model. and you're going to see a continuing ongoing acceleration of the usage of bim upfront in our portfolio, but then what we've layered on top of it is a couple of critical things that make the entire portfolio more valuable. you may have noticed we emphasized this notion in the new construction cloud platform around a common data environment and all the things that go along with that common data environment.
that common data environment is not just saas-based. it's also ultimately going to be iso compliant, and it's going to allow us to move that building information data all the way through the entire process. so you're going to see more and more adoption of what's in autodesk build, all the way through from the preconstruction planning cycle to the construction site. and that's a pretty powerful differentiator for us.
but the one last thing i want to mention to you, and we talked about this at au, and i want to make sure you paid attention to it, was the rollout of tandem, autodesk tandem. and what was tandem? so tandem is â if digital twins start with bim, tandem is a way to bring bim data together from multiple places, from our bim models or our bim information from other third parties that are building controller information perhaps from other bim-based data from other types of applications and bring it into a single aggregated view in the cloud that updates dynamically as the building project progresses. this puts us at the forefront of bringing the power of bim to create digital twins to the ability to create digital twins in the cloud that actually represent the final state of the project no matter where all that project data comes from. so we're pretty excited about this progression and what it means for the company.
and i think you're going to see a lot of interest and uptake in the approach we're taking.
philip winslow -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
that's awesome. that's super exciting. and an equally as exciting question for scott, long-term deferred revenue. how are you thinking about that next year? obviously, the guidance for this year is hanging out in the mid-20s, but how are you sort of modeling that when you think about cash flow for next year and the year after that?
scott herren -- chief financial officer
yes. i think for next year, it stays in that range, phil, and i don't want to get into doing too much forecasting of fiscal '22 until we get to the q4 earnings call. and obviously, we can give you more detail at that point. but what we're seeing this year is kind of moderating assumptions around multiyear.
and of course, that's what drives a lot of that long-term deferred. and so you see the sequential trend there in long term. it hasn't fallen off the floor. it hasn't fallen off the desk and onto the floor.
the multiyear rates are still there, but they're not as robust as we have seen historically in maintenance. i think ultimately, it returns to that level. but frankly, i don't think the moderating multiyear that we see this year is a big negative in a sense that given our renewal â the strength of our renewal rates, we'll continue to get that, collect that cash. we'll just collect it in the subsequent two years instead of collecting all three years upfront.
and we'll collect it without the 10% discount that we put in as an incentive for those multiyear transactions. so think of it kind of settling in where it is for the foreseeable future. ultimately, i think there's probably a little room for it to run.
philip winslow -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
awesome. and congrats again on a great quarter.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of heather bellini from goldman sachs. your line is now open.
heather bellini -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thank you so much. and scott, i will echo my congratulations and to you as well, andrew, for the company's execution in this challenging macro environment. i wanted to ask two questions.
one, if you can share with us kind of, i mean, the competitive positioning in construction given your pricing model and how you might see some of the competitors responding. so if you could spend some time on that, maybe a little bit more on the differentiation, if that's gotten even wider over the course of the pandemic. and then also, if i look at your growth in asia pac, you can â that was the best region in terms of growth. how far behind do you think the americas is from the recovery and the solid growth that you're seeing in apac? thank you so much.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
all right. so let me start with the competitive positioning on the construction. you're absolutely right, heather, that the pandemic actually gave us an opportunity to lap our competition a bit. the slowdown definitely took the wind out of certain parts of the market.
however, we didn't slow down. we continued to invest, and we put quite a bit of money into rolling out the unified platform. so what you see with autodesk build, which is what we're going to lead with in every new deal, we're leading with autodesk build over and over again, and we're going to lead internationally, and we're going to lead in the u.s. with this, is a comprehensive project management and field management application that goes from design all the way through to site management, site execution and layers on the analytics associated with construction iq and some of the predictive skills, all built on top of autodesk docs, all right? so this is a pretty significant change.
that platform is highly competitive. as a matter of fact, it's differentiated in numerous ways because of its end-to-end capabilities. in terms of pricing models, here is what's unique about it, heather. i think it's very important to remember this.
no one, no one in the industry is more flexible with the way we deliver these applications in autodesk. so if you want to buy named users and deploy named users, we got named users for you. that's our primary deployment model for most of our applications. if you want to pay based on project turnover, you can do that.
if you want to pay based on usage and consumption, you can do that. this flexibility is heavily coveted by our customers. and in fact, i think this flexibility has been part and parcel of what's allowed us to continue to expand the usage of the construction cloud even during what's happened over the last year. so i think technologically, we're now competitively differentiated because we took the pandemic at the time to double down on the platform unification and get it out there.
and business model-wise, we're differentiated. so we're feeling we're in a pretty strong competitive position as we head into the recovery next year across all the various markets. we love that we have tough competition in this space. we think it's good for us.
we think it's good for our customers, but we're feeling really good about where we're at. now with regards to the americas versus apac, right, here's what i'll say. usage ramped up fairly quickly in asia pacific. and like we said earlier, it's definitely above pre-covid levels in a lot of places, not everywhere, but in a lot of places.
the u.s., in particular, just seemed to have stalled, all right? usage hasn't fallen back. it's ramped up a little bit as time goes on, but it's not seeing this kind of surge. i think we should just kind of hold tight for a while and see what the levering out of the uncertainty does right now for the usage in the u.s., all right? between the election results, between the good news about vaccine, between the potential that people see about stimulus in their project pipeline, i think we might start to see a change. so it'll be interesting what we can talk about on the next earnings call.
but i think the unwinding of uncertainty matters a lot in our markets.
heather bellini -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you so much.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of jay vleeschhouwer from griffin securities. your line is now open.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
thank you. andrew, starting with the nine-figure deal, returning to that subject. it's especially interesting when we consider that once upon a time, a $100,000 deal was a big deal for autodesk. so you're obviously now many orders of magnitude beyond that.
but the question is, to the extent that there are now, as we understand, additional eight-figure deals in the pipeline, how are you thinking about your license management and customer success requirements and capacities that you need to invest in and ramp up to support, which is obviously going to be a larger propensity for these kinds of deployments? and then returning to au for a moment. you made some interesting remarks last week having to do with some additional new possible opportunities for the company in manufacturing software, supply chain, even smart products you alluded to. maybe talk about how seriously you mean to pursue those new things. and then for scott, first, thank you for the last 25 quarters.
and as your going-away question or multipart question, andrew earlier parsed the usage data by geo. could you do the same thing by perhaps stand-alone versus collections and perhaps even by vertical in terms of what you're seeing in the usage telemetry there?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
all right. so it's a classic, jay, multipart question. all right. so jay, let me start with the license management piece.
this is something we take particularly seriously. and i'm really glad you asked about it because the license management and the ability to manage these licenses is actually a value-add to our customers. they want to manage this investment in autodesk asset as an enterprise asset, all right? and it's super important in the space that we do this. one of the reasons we've been moving so quickly to retire legacy models in our user base is because that actually holds us back from delivering best-in-class license management for our customers.
every customer, every maintenance license is still out there. every multiuser license that's still based on the old desktop paradigm versus what we want to do in the cloud paradigm is holding us back from deploying the systems in a way that help our customers manage these things holistically. the good news is that our eba customers get a totally different dashboard on how they use our software, and they're able to get more per user usage analytics and more data in terms of understanding our customer base. but this investment in the sheet of glass that our customers look through in terms of managing their relationship with autodesk is something we've been doing ongoing for years.
and you look for it to accelerate as we retire the last of these legacy business models and start unifying everything on a stack that really provides a high level of control to our customers and a high level of fidelity about what their actual usage is. we believe this is a value-add of the portfolio, and you'll see us continue to invest in this. now with manufacturing investments, i think you want to just pay attention to what we're doing with fusion and the areas we're targeting because we think these are important areas that we want to pay attention to. we've integrated certain types of technology in the fusion.
we want to augment and supplement and extend those so that fusion is a professional-grade solution surrounded by other professional-grade solutions that tackle significant growth markets inside the manufacturing vertical. our first angle of attack within the convergence of design and make and merging advanced manufacturing methods with advanced modeling methods, i think you're going to see us attack the convergence of mechanical engineering and electrical components inside designs. we've already started doing some of that thing, and we're going to do it in a uniquely cloud way. we're going to do it with uniquely underpinnings of cloud compute.
and we're going to do it in highly differentiated ways but also in ways that respect some of the tools our customers are using today.
scott herren -- chief financial officer
and jay, i'll jump in on the second part. and i guess thank you for the congratulations on my 25th autodesk earnings call. if i get this right, it's your 125th autodesk earnings call, so a little bit of a difference there in terms of history of the company. i'd like to congratulate you as well.
it's interesting, when you look at this, right, we're seeing less of a differential by vertical and more of a differential by country. so in other words, the country x is seeing nice robust growth. we see that in both the aec and the manufacturing side. if it's continuing to be somewhat flat and stable, we see that again by vertical.
so it's â i'd say the better differentiator in usage is more how is the region performing, how is the country performing than it is within that country, is it aec or manufacturing. the industry collections versus stand-alone, what i â i'll just reiterate what i said in the opening commentary that industry collections continues to be a stable share of our overall business. so we're not seeing a significant mix shift there. we had â early on, we had seen a mix shift of the new sales more toward lte.
and we talked about last quarter that reverted back to the mean, where it had been historically. so we're not seeing a significant mix shift at this point either way. the last thing that i'd add because i know the detail of your spreadsheets, and you're probably â you probably already got everything laid out here. but to give you a sense on our new business growth, and in particular, product subscription new business growth from a unit standpoint, no question we've been impacted by the pandemic, more so in new business units than in other places.
that new business grew sequentially from q2 to q3. and it's our expectation those units will grow again from q3 to q4. so just to give you a sense of how things are performing.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst

thank you. our next question comes from the line of brad zelnick from credit suisse. your line is now open.
brad zelnick -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks so much. so congrats all around, guys. particularly for scott, best of everything, especially in your next chapter.
and the topic for both of you, i wanted to ask you about innovation. the sheer amount of innovation on display at autodesk university this year was, i guess i'd just say, overflowing. so andrew, for you, the easy question, what excites you the most? and my parting gift for you, scott, maybe a little more complex, how should we think about the pace of innovation going forward? because you've always talked about high single, low double-digit spend growth, but we're below 7% year to date. so should we think about spend growth accelerating meaningfully to the high end of your range to recapture the tremendous opportunity ahead? thanks.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
all right. so brad, i love this question. innovation is absolutely hypercritical to everything we do. we believe we are powering a lot of transformation and a lot of dialogue in the industry right now.
we are delighted to see our competitors start to talk like we've been talking for years. and i think that's a sign of the kind of innovation we're putting into the market. here's what i'll tell you i'm really excited about. i am excited about the merger of saas, cloud compute and machine learning and this transformational power for our industry, all right? this is what gets me up every morning right now in terms of what we're going to be able to deliver for our customers.
when we get more and more of their processes in the cloud, when we're computing more and more with their data with ever-decreasing compute cost in the cloud and layering on machine learning, we are going to be able to provide our customers with insights and productivity enhancements that are simply beyond anything they've imagined right now. and it gets me extremely excited to be part of driving that change into the industry and what it means. now i can talk about the individual technologies that play into all that. there's lots.
but if you talk at a high level about what gets me excited, it's that. and one thing i think is before â as a segue to scott answering his question, i think it's important for you to know that next year, we're probably the largest r&d spender in our segment, all right? and i just want you to think about that after all the discussions we had going to the business model transformation to all of a sudden be talking about a world where nobody â probably nobody is spending as much in this space on r&d as autodesk is. i think that is a fundamental change and a lot of innovation comes from that much spend. scott?
scott herren -- chief financial officer
i'm not sure what to add to that, andrew. i think you said it exactly right. we're in a fortunate position, brad â and thanks for your kind words, by the way. but we're in a fortunate position in the model where we can both grow spending and increase margins year on year.
and so if you look at the midpoint of the updated guide for this year, for fiscal '21, it implies just short of an 8% growth in total spend. so the cost of goods sold plus opex. looking ahead, on top of that, we've invested pretty significantly and grown our investment in r&d, headcount for r&d, for sales capacity this year and some of the areas that andrew just touched on earlier in jay's question about building out our internal systems and our internal infrastructure. so we've invested quite a bit in innovation already this year that will obviously carry on into next year.
and we've made a handful of not large but strategic acquisitions to continue to fuel that innovation. so we â i think long term, targeting double-digit revenue growth is somewhat dependent on us continuing to invest on the r&d side of things. and i feel really good about the position we're in to be able to both drive that investment and increase margins out through fiscal '23.
brad zelnick -- credit suisse -- analyst

thank you. our next question comes from the line of keith weiss from morgan stanley. your line is now open.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
excellent. thank you guys for taking the question. scott, would it be out of line to try to convince you to stay at autodesk? i mean it's a lot more interesting than like a networking company.
scott herren -- chief financial officer
no. i think the first...
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
it sounded like i should have tried harder, keith, keep him.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
exactly. he's a good one. you should have tried harder to keep him. on the quarter, two things that i wanted to just get a little bit more color on.
one is kind of like the pace of recovery that you guys are seeing and expecting. it seemed like earlier this year, you might have thought it was going to come a little bit faster given what you're seeing in asia pac. maybe that's spreading out a little bit. but with the turn in like the current rpo figures this quarter, it looks like you guys are really actually â the whole business is turning a corner here.
so one, can you give us kind of your latest thinking on the shape of the recovery and kind of what's assumed as we look into fy '22? and then carrying on, on kind of that total spend commentary, a lot of companies that we talked to saw expense savings this year due to covid and lower t&e spending and just were able to sort of garner efficiencies in their overall business, some of which they need to give back in the year ahead as we get into a more normalized environment. is there a big component of that in the autodesk business that we should be thinking about when we're modeling margins into fy '22?
scott herren -- chief financial officer
yes. so keith, i'll start, and andrew, you can add color to it. in terms of what we're seeing, we are seeing recovery. andrew alluded to it and gave some of the specific countries where we're seeing recovery already and where we're a level of activity that's above pre-covid rates.
i think someone earlier highlighted apac. apac has been quite strong for us from that standpoint. we're seeing continental europe recover nicely as well. our expectations for q4 is that we'll continue to see a modestly improving economic environment.
and as we look at it next year, i think we will continue to see improvement. i'm not sure it's going to be a straight line improvement, especially given kind of the current wave, but we'll continue to see improvement. and i expect by the second half of the year, that we'll see some pretty good recovery in economic activity that clearly will benefit us. so think of next year as being a little more back-end loaded.
and i think that's part of what you see with the early look that we've given you on what revenue growth looks like this year. q4, again, midpoint of the guide has revenue growth at about 12%, and op margin for q4 will be about in line with the full year at about 29%. and i think looking at it next year, you'll see both of those grow. revenue growth will increase from there, and op margin will increase from there.
on the specific covid spend savings, i think we've had the same savings that everyone has had. obviously, t&e, travel expense has been a big savings for us. but as we look at â and events have gone more virtual. i think that will continue.
we've had modest amount of savings from the operations of our facilities or our offices. as we look at next year though, i don't expect it to be a significant year-on-year headwind. travel, of course, will return, but we're going to build the budget such that i don't expect it to come back anywhere near to where it was in, let's say, calendar 2019 or in our fiscal '20. i think if nothing else we've learned, you don't have to be face-to-face with a customer to get that final agreement.
you don't have to be face-to-face internally to get things done the way we need to get them done internally. so i think we'll continue to see ongoing savings in t&e. it'll step up from this year, certainly, but it's not going to be a significant headwind for us on spend.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
super helpful. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of adam borg from stifel. your line is now open.
adam borg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hey, guys. and thanks for taking the question. and scott, of course, congrats on the new role. just on some announcements coming out of au and talking a little bit more about autodesk build, you mentioned how you're leading with that going forward.
you do have a big installed base on bim 360 and plangrid. so i was just curious kind of what the migration path looks like for those â those assets to autodesk build. and maybe just quickly as a follow-up, on the spacemaker acquisition, any commentary, scott, on expectations for inorganic revenue growth. thanks so much.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. all right. so let me start with the migration path. so for plangrid, for those customers that migrate from plangrid and ultimately migrate onto build, it's actually not a heavy lift because of the way we built the application.
plangrid's huge innovation and huge value-add to the whole stack is the mobile experience. they're really good at it. so what we did is we basically used the plangrid experience and the plangrid team as the mobile experience for build. so the move from plangrid to build as a progression is not a heavy lift.
now you're right. we have a long tail of customers that are on bim 360 field, bim 360 next gen field. those customers over time are going to be migrating to build at a pace that makes sense for them. but what we've done is we've created environments that allow them to ship during â as projects sunset and they go into new projects.
we've got a whole master plan with our customer success organization and construction on how they move over time. we're not going to force anybody to move ahead of time, but we've got a well-crafted plan for how we move these people. it's more of a heavy lift for people that are on bim 360 field, less of a heavy lift for people who are on bim 360 next gen, which is where docs â bim 360 â autodesk docs was built off of, and it's a much smaller lift for plangrid customers.
scott herren -- chief financial officer
and adam, to your question on spacemaker, i'm super excited with the technology. and i don't know if you got a chance to see it demoed at au. but if you didn't, i highly recommend you go take a look at it. this is a â it's obviously tremendously exciting technology and some super talented people that we picked up with the spacemaker acquisition.
impact financially is going to be nominal. it'll actually be slightly dilutive, and that's built into our expectations for next year. there's another effect that i probably should have mentioned earlier, and i want to make sure i get it out on the call though. the one thing that will change next year, and that's a slight headwind to us in terms of revenue growth year on year, we have â almost all of our products are already ratable, right? there's a couple of really small products, one, vault that we've talked about in the past that did not get over the hurdle to get away from upfront revenue recognition.
we've continued to work on that front. we've continued to do things that incorporate much more cloud-based functionality. and i think in the first part of next year, vault will flip from upfront rev rec to full ratable rev rec. and that looks like it's about a point of growth.
again, already built into the kind of the early view that i gave you of the low double â low to mid-teens revenue growth for next year. the impact of vault is built into that. obviously, it normalizes in fiscal '23, but once it becomes ratable, the compare points are equivalent. but that's one, if you're building your model in that level of detail, think about that being a bit of a headwind that's already built into the early view that i've given you on fiscal '22.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. i'll make one more comment on spacemaker just because i kind of forgot to segue to you on that. but spacemaker represents that perfect convergence of saas, cloud compute and machine learning into solving real-world problems for our customers. i think you're going to see the impact on our business accumulate over time as the technology expands and as it connects itself deeper with revit and other parts of the process.
one of the things i love about the spacemaker team is they have this philosophy about making multiple constituents more successful with their objectives. and that's the building owner, the developer, making their investment more profitable. that's the city, making sure that the impact on infrastructure is managed and controlled. and they also have â a big customer or a big stakeholder in this is the environment and helping architects and city planners make more sustainable decisions in real time for how things are built.
it's the perfect example of how all these things come together to change the way people make design decisions and ultimately go decisions. the look for its impact to expand over time as that team starts hooking into other parts of our process, builds out their existing products and inevitably starts moving into other parts of the organization, which we always see with acquisitions like this.
scott herren -- chief financial officer
yes. there's absolutely a lot of synergies that we see with spacemaker coming in.

steve koenig -- smbc nikko securities -- analyst
cool. so i'll just ask one question. andrew, you had some pretty open, transparent communication with customers this last quarter in terms of the letter that was written. and just in terms of looking at what those customers were asking for, they were very clearly asking for accelerating the road map in architecture and engineering design, which we â doesn't seem like we've talked a lot about on the call today, hasn't been a focus.
and if i read between the lines in that communication, the customers also seemed a bit frustrated with the transitions they've been going through from maintenance to subscriptions to collections and now to named users. and it just seems like there's a little bit of dissonance between what they're asking for and what i'm hearing from you on the call today, and i'd love to get your thoughts on how â why is that â why is there that maybe misperception gap? and what are you guys doing about it?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
steve, there's absolutely no dissonance, all right? one of the things i think i've said consistently in the communication, and i'll take you back to the communication, is we started investing in the road map for revit well ahead of these communications, all right, from these customers because we made a deliberate choice to invest in construction and not in revit functionality for architects. so these customers are going to fairly quickly start to see changes and additions to revit from the investment we made actually at the end of last year. and i think you're missing something completely. we just spent several hundred million dollars on the architecture segment of our space, all right? spacemaker is squarely targeted at design and architecture, and the founders of the spacemaker are architects, all right? this technology is right on the x.
and like i said, we just spent a lot of money to do this. and this is right in the x. it's something we've been looking at for a while. so no, there's no dissonance here in terms of where we're focused and where we're â with regard to the migration, look, you got to be â we started this migration with two â something under two million maintenance customers.
most of those have come along with us. we never expected that all of them were going to come along with us happily. and what we've done is we've reached the end of the tail with some maintenance customers that are more frustrated with the changes than not. but at the same time, we've added millions of other customers that weren't able to afford some of our solutions before because of the upfront cost of these solutions.
so yes, maintenance customers that have been with us, they've seen lots of transitions. they're not done yet. we haven't retired all those models yet. but remember, we started with less than two million of those.
we're over five million of subscribers right now. a fraction of those are from that maintenance base. we have to remember, let's look at the big picture here as well as the small picture. i understand and i emphasize the frustration of those customers that started on maintenance and journey with us, but we have reached so many more customers, so many more architecture firms, so many individual architects, so many people that couldn't afford revit, so many people that couldn't afford that extra seat of autocad, so many high-growth companies that as they add seats, they're actually spending less over five years than they would have with us, adding fees in the perpetual model.
that's a big story, and it's transformative for the industry in terms of how much value people are able to get now. so let's make sure we stay focused on the big picture here.
steve koenig -- smbc nikko securities -- analyst
cool. well, i appreciate your thoughts, and thanks again for the open communication. good luck to you, scott.

andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you, simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. first off, i hope you and your families are remaining safe and healthy. and before jumping into our third-quarter results, i would like to thank again our employees and the families and communities that support them as well as our partners and customers for their sustained commitment during uncertain times. that commitment was reflected in our execution and demonstrated the resilience of our business model this past quarter.
together, they enabled us to deliver strong q3 results with billings, revenue, earnings and free cash flow coming in above expectations despite the volatile macroeconomic conditions resulting from the pandemic. i'm pleased to see the acceleration of our saas business model, the secular shift to cloud underpinning it and the competitive opportunities it brings. we have many miles of opportunity ahead of us. our enterprise customers are undertaking their own digital transformation, and by enabling that transformation, we are becoming a strategic partner rather than a software vendor.
these strategic partnerships are broader than in the past with our customers expanding their autodesk product portfolio. our third-quarter results reflect this trend as our enterprise deal activity with large customers accelerated. we closed some of the largest transactions in the company's history, including a nine-digit deal. i am proud of our team's execution, which positions us well entering the fourth quarter with a strong pipeline of deals.in the third quarter, we also saw the ebb and flow of the economic impact of the pandemic.
as you know, our transition to the cloud means we are able to monitor the usage patterns of our products across the globe and see the positive correlation between increasing usage level and new business growth in those regions. china, korea, japan and most of europe saw usage levels rise above pre-covid levels. while usage trends in the u.s. and the u.k.
have not yet returned to pre-covid levels, they have stabilized in the u.s. and growing sequentially in the u.k. in line with the usage trends, our new business remains impacted by the pandemic. but the diversity of our revenue stream and customer base is helping us deliver strong results.
now as you know, scott has decided to take on the next challenge in his career by accepting the cfo role at cisco starting mid-december. scott has played a huge role in driving the business over the last six years, helping autodesk successfully navigate the business model transition. we are sad to see him leave, but we are also excited for him. thank you, scott, for your many contributions to autodesk, and i wish you continued success in the next chapter of your career.
scott is leaving behind a strong team to ensure smooth operations while we look for his replacement. we have started the search process, and it is my top priority in the near term. now i'd like to turn it over to scott to take you through the details of our quarterly performance and guidance for the year. i'll then come back to provide insight into our strategic growth drivers.
scott herren -- chief financial officer
thanks, andrew. i'm leaving autodesk with mixed emotions as i'm excited about what lies ahead for me but also sad about leaving my colleagues at autodesk. the last six years have been the most fun and rewarding of my entire career as we've transformed the company from a traditional license revenue model to a cloud-based recurring revenue model. that transition is now complete, and i leave knowing autodesk is well positioned for the future with leading positions in attractive markets and accelerating momentum.
looking at the quarter's results. several factors contributed to our outperformance across all key metrics, including strong enterprise deal activity, healthy subscription renewal rates, digital sales, a sequential improvement in new business trends and foreign exchange rates. total revenue growth came in at 13% as reported, 14% in constant currency, with subscription plan revenue growing by 24% and operating margin expanding by three percentage points. we previously told you that we extended payment terms for customers impacted by the pandemic.
the normalization of payment terms, combined with improving business trends and strong cash collections in q3, helped drive healthy free cash flow of $340 million. current rpo, which reflects committed revenue for the next 12 months, was up 16%, a slight improvement on the rate of growth we saw in the second quarter. total rpo was up 21%. we again benefited from the diversity of our customer base.
business softness in certain areas like the u.s. and parts of europe was offset by strength in other areas. digital sales continued to drive double-digit billings growth through our online channel supported by accelerated growth in our cloud-based fusion offerings. we're developing broader strategic relationships with our enterprise customers with multiyear commitments.
as is typical for most enterprise agreements, the nine-digit deal andrew mentioned is a three-year commitment billed annually and do not have a meaningful impact on our revenue or cash flow during the third quarter. the run rate business with our partners also continue to perform well. while we're seeing the traction of our transition to the named user business model, it results in a subset of our customers optimizing their installed base by reducing the number of named user seats needed after they take advantage of our 2-for-1 trade-in program. i'm pleased to report that these overall trends are in line with our expectations.
as we've said in the past, in aggregate, the transition to the named user model is a revenue-neutral event for us but enables us to offer more value to our customers in a similar way as other saas providers. our net revenue retention rate remained within the 100% to 110% range we laid out in our guidance. our product subscription renewal rates remain strong, reinforcing the critical nature of our products to our customers. as in the prior quarter, approximately 40% of the maintenance customers who came up for renewal converted to subscriptions.
our maintenance renewal rate declined sequentially, which was expected as we are nearing the end of our maintenance program. industry collections remained a stable share of our total business in q3. as anticipated, multiyear payments were down year over year, but we saw modest sequential improvement in the share of multiyear payments across each geography as customers continue to make long-term investments in our products. and finally, during the third quarter, we spent $196 million to buy back 800,000 shares at an average price of $231 per share.
year to date, we have repurchased 2.12 million shares at an average price of approximately $186 per share for a total spend of $393 million. now let me turn to our guidance. we are raising the low end of our full-year guidance range to a range of $3.75 billion to $3.765 billion, bringing the midpoint growth rate up to 15% year over year. we're also raising our non-gaap operating margin outlook to the upper end of our prior range, a four-point improvement from last year.
our fourth-quarter performance will benefit from the strength of our third-quarter results, but the business environment remains uncertain given the current wave of covid cases. we expect product subscription renewal rates to continue to be very healthy. churn on our maintenance offering will likely accelerate as we enter the final stages of ending our maintenance offering. and we expect our net revenue retention rate to remain between 100% and 110% for the quarter.
our pipeline entering the fourth quarter is strong, but we've assumed that new business and multiyear contracts will continue to be under pressure. the narrowing of our billings and free cash flow outlook range is primarily driven by moderating assumptions around multiyear and the uncertainty presented by the current environment. it's a testament to the strategic value of our products to our customers and the resiliency of our model that we're still expecting to report 15% revenue growth despite the current economic headwinds. looking out to our fiscal-year 2022, we expect an improving macroeconomic environment as we exit this year will result in accelerating growth in new business over the course of fiscal '22.
given our subscription model, revenue growth will lag the improving sales environment. as we've said in the past, the path to fiscal '23 will not be linear. we expect our fiscal '22 revenue growth to be low to mid-teens and free cash flow growth to reaccelerate to approximately 20%. we're confident in our fiscal '23 free cash flow target of $2.4 billion as we will benefit from improving business momentum in fiscal '22 that will provide a tailwind to our revenue and free cash flow growth.
in fiscal '23, we'll also benefit from the renewals of our fiscal '20 transactions when we restarted multiyear payments for a part of our business. beyond fiscal '23, our continued investment in cloud products and a subscription business model, backed by a strong balance sheet, give us a robust foundation and platform for double-digit growth. and now i'd like to turn it back to andrew.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you, scott. our strong performance in q3 once again demonstrates the advantages of our diverse customer base, resiliency of our employees, the power of our saas offerings and the strength of our business model. at autodesk university last week, we hosted approximately 100,000 customers and partners and made a series of product and partnership announcements as well as our acquisition of spacemaker, which closed yesterday and offers industry-leading functionality to architects. spacemaker will enable us to support design professionals much earlier in their workflow by harnessing ai to rapidly create and evaluate options for a building or urban development.
through automated data capture, smart design, decision support and collaboration functionality, spacemaker enables users to quickly generate, optimize and iterate on design. it also offers a fundamental shift in how we imagine and build cities in the future and the time needed to evaluate various possible options. i encourage you to check out the demo from last week that is available on our website. we also announced the autodesk construction cloud platform, which unifies our aec cloud offerings and the data held within them, to enable a connected project ecosystem across design and construction.
underpinning the autodesk construction cloud is our common data environment, autodesk docs. this provides seamless navigation, integrated workflows and project controls and enables a single source of truth across the project life cycle. autodesk build, quantify and bim collaborate bring together the best of plangrid and bim 360 with new functionality to create a comprehensive field construction and project management solution. for our design customers, bim collaborate pro extends the capabilities of bim 360 design on the new platform to create a more seamless exchange of project data between design and construction.
during the quarter, morgan sindall, a leading construction group in the u.k., committed to autodesk as their strategic platform partner. as lee ramsey, morgan sindall's digital design director said, ""i researched all the marketplace solutions. autodesk stood out for me. autodesk construction cloud provides greater integration between different roles and functions, allowing data to be shared across projects, silos to be broken and a vast amount of efficiency to be gained."" the breadth of our aec business has underpinned its resilient performance and enabled it to be a net beneficiary from secular and cyclical trends.
despite many construction projects being interrupted, delayed or navigating new ways of working because of the pandemic, we are still seeing year-on-year growth across all our construction offerings. our cloud-based products enable our customers to navigate the cycle today and to be more efficient and sustainable for tomorrow. our office-based solutions continue to do well, while our field-based solutions improved sequentially, boosted by several competitive wins. customers continue to choose plangrid to digitize their processes because it is easy to use and they only pay for what they need.
this quarter, our bim 360 product set records for both worldwide weekly average users and projects. we also continue to see adoption with our larger customers and within the infrastructure industry. during the quarter, one of the world's leading professional services firms, which serves clients in the infrastructure and building sectors, increased its investment with autodesk. we have been partnering together for over 15 years, and the renewal of our enterprise business agreement enables this firm to expand its use of bim 360 and plangrid in order to adapt faster to industry changes and create new markets for its services.
in another instance, japan's largest homebuilder, daiwa house industry company ltd., renewed its enterprise business agreement with us. the company is making key investments in bim and has selected autodesk to be a strategic innovation partner to achieve its goals for digital transformation, design for manufacturing and industrialized construction. the company is adopting bim at all levels of the organization and has made a commitment to adopt additional autodesk products, including bim 360 docs and design and plangrid. we are thrilled to be working with daiwa house at the forefront of industrialized construction.
our cloud-based platform is also propelling growth in manufacturing by enabling the convergence of design and make. on the commercial side, our market-leading cloud-based platform, fusion 360, enjoyed another quarter of accelerating subscriptions, growing scale of deployments and adding competitive displacements to end the quarter with over 120,000 subscriptions. at au, we introduced several extensions of fusion 360 that further encourage adoption and usage of the platform by adding specialist functionality. as a reminder, extensions offer expanded tools and functionality that can be added on demand to the core fusion 360 offering.
this kind of functional flexibility and cost effectiveness enhances the value of our platform for designers, engineers and manufacturers. we also announced exciting partnerships with sandvik coromant and rockwell automation. with sandvik coromant, a metal cutting tools and services company, we took the first step to realize a shared long-term vision of accelerating the automation of manufacturing processes by making tool data and manufacturing recommendations available to users of fusion 360. with rockwell automation, a provider of industrial automation and information technology, we combined factory layout capabilities available in our industry collection with their factory simulation tools.
together, these solutions will help our mutual customers digitally design and commission factories in less time and with greater efficiency. this quarter, we also announced the acquisition of camplete, a leading provider of post-processing and machine simulation solution. camplete bridges the gap between cam programming and shop floor machine tool operations. it allows manufacturers to digitally simulate and verify the machine code that drives the production equipment before running it on the shop floor.
this will enable our customers to identify potential problems in a digital environment at the programming phase that could otherwise scrap work or damage machine tools in production. during the quarter, a large multinational defense, security and aerospace company with an extensive global supply chain chose to increase its investment with autodesk through an enterprise business agreement. to stay at the forefront of its industry, the company is using innovative manufacturing methods to save time and money and has set a target to 3d print approximately 1/3 of the components in its new jet. as it radically changes the way it designs and builds, the company has selected autodesk as a key strategic partner.
the adoption of our products is also driving change throughout its supply chain, which must adopt new ways of working. with fusion 360, it now has access to our advanced manufacturing solutions to help it realize its business goals. in education, we continue to expand our footprint. tinkercad, our fully browser-based product development platform for aspiring designers, now has over 30 million users worldwide.
fusion 360 on chromebooks is experiencing rapid adoption at high schools and universities and is replacing entry-level browser-based cad/cam with professional-grade, career-accelerating fusion 360. for instance, the university of illinois at urbana-champagne has now switched to fusion 360 across multiple departments, including biomedical engineering, systems engineering and mechanical engineering. beyond our industry-specific results, we are seeing early adoption of our premium subscription plan, with customers taking advantage of the enhanced subscription offering at renewal. many of our multiuser customers who are transitioning to the named user model are finding great value in the premium plan due to its advanced user analytics, single sign-on capabilities and enhanced support.
for example, scheuch, a leader in the field of innovative air and environment technology, decided to commit to a long-term investment in premium this quarter, primarily due to sso and user management capabilities. they see autodesk as a strategic partner as it continues to harmonize its global it infrastructure. let me finish by updating you on our progress monetizing noncompliant users. we continue to be sensitive to the short-term economic pressure faced by our customers but remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity as we demonstrate the value of our cloud-based platform to our customers.
for example, in china, a customer which left us to try a lower-cost competitor quickly returned due to autocad's superior functionality and invested further in autodesk by purchasing collections for the first time to focus on growth. our efforts to educate our customers about the benefits of staying compliant with our subscriptions are yielding results. we are able to convert them to paying users in a customer-friendly manner. during the quarter, we closed eight deals over $500,000 with our license compliance team.
in closing, we continue to build a strong autodesk for the long term. our early and sustained organic and strategic investment in critical capabilities like cloud computing and cloud-based collaboration, combined with a successful transition to a saas business model, give us significant competitive advantages and confidence to grow in the double-digit range in the foreseeable future, and we have multiple drivers that make us confident in our fiscal '23 free cash flow target of $2.4 billion. with that, operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of saket kalia from barclays. you may begin.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
ok. great. thanks, andrew for taking my questions here and congrats on the new additions to the team.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
maybe just to start you touched on this a little bit in your prepared remarks, andrew, but can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about new business recovery this year and maybe just broad brush, what verticals or geos might be stronger than others?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. thank you, saket. i think that's a really appropriate question to open up with. as you know, new business was down last year and that has a disproportionate impact on how we see revenue in q1, but the way we look at it shaping up this year is q1 is kind of the trough of the new business recovery.
and we're going to be accelerating our new business growth out through the year into the second half of the year. in fact, we really see a world where most of the new business that didn't show up last year, kind of reemerges as we head through this year. so it's important to see that business that disappeared last year didn't disappear. it just got shifted out.
in fact, you're hearing a lot about the acceleration of digitization in multiple industries, and we're seeing that in our space in spades as well. and i think if we look at particular sectors, it's actually really going to be distributed across all the sectors and kind of similar ways. aec is already investing really significantly ahead of the market in terms of their digitization efforts. you kind of saw early evidence of that with the eba business we did.
the record number ebas we did in q4 relative to previous years. in manufacturing, you kind of see the same accelerated interest in digitalization and new cloud-based workflows, especially surrounding what we're seeing in fusion. the same goes in media entertainment. the media entertainment business, which was classically a laggard on some of these highly digital, highly cloud integrated workflows is moving to the cloud in a big way.
now geographically kind of in a broad-brush, i kind of highlighted in the opening remarks that, we saw a broad recovery in europe and asia to pre-covid levels of monthly active usage. and we saw a little bit of a lag in the u.s. and the uk. i think we're going to see that kind of geographic fraternity new business in that cascade.
it's going to be strong in apac. it's going to get strong in europe, and then it's going to start to come back in the u.s. and the uk. q1 will be the trough of this new business growth, and we're going to accelerate right out of that into the rest of the year.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
got it. that's really helpful. maybe for a follow-up, understanding that innovyze hasn't closed, it isn't included in guidance. can you just give us some broad brushes on maybe how big that revenue scale there is, and maybe just touch on whether there are any significant differences in the business model versus autodesk?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. differences in opportunities, saket. so first off, let's just kind of just level set on why we did innovyze. i think we've been super clear that infrastructure is one of these really big growth opportunities for us long-term.
infrastructure projects take a long time to design and plan, and they last even longer after that. so an investment in infrastructure is an investment in the long-term health of autodesk. and i think we just have to be super clear about that. water was one of those areas where it would have taken us all a lot of time to catch up organically, whereas road and rail is an area we've been highlighting to you that we've been investing in organically with our portfolio and really making great strides there.
when you look at the business at a high level, in terms of the differences and where the revenue is going to come from. so look, at a high level, innovyze is going to be accretive to our revenue growth, roughly to a percentage point, as we head into this year that includes deferred revenue write-offs and the fact that we have a partial year in here, it's probably going to be dilutive this year about a percentage point off of operating margin. but here's the opportunity that i want to make sure you highlight. you actually poked out a little bit between the differences in our business model.
not only are we going to plug innovyze into our sales engine, in terms of named accounts, channel sales and international expansion. we're also going to apply our expertise on business model transformation to the innovyze product portfolio. and i think that's going to be an important transitional element of how we absorb innovyze into the company. we're good at this.
we know how to do this, and we know how to navigate this. so what you're going to see in fy 2023 is you'll probably see a little bit of a depression of innovyze's revenue growth in isolation, because we're going to be applying the business model transformation. and as you know, with the business model transformation, there's downward pressure in revenue as a result, but acceleration of revenue as you head out onto the other side of the business model transformation. so if we look at fy 2023, it's probably going to be neutral to the overall revenue growth of the company.
it's not going to touch the free cash flow number $2.4 billion is going to come out innovyze or no innovyze. and they'll probably be a little bit more of a headwind operating margin, maybe between 1% and 2% as we go through the business model transformation, but a nice acceleration up to our double-digit growth standards as we head beyond fy 2023 to 2024, 2025 and 2026, which is kind of an extra bonus on top of what we're going to be able to do, just to expand the core innovyze water business, to capitalize on the increasing investment in infrastructure. so it's a good question to talk about the differences in our business model, because there's actually an opportunity there and a difference.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
very helpful, andrew. thanks again and congrats on the new additions to the team.
operator
our next question comes from line of phil winslow from wells fargo. you may begin.
phil winslow -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. i thank everyone for taking my question and then congrats on a strong close to the year. and once again, congratulations on the new hires in particular. great to have debbie back.
really want to focus on the mix side of autodesk. how do you think about it in a reopening scenario and given the fact that we have a lot of backlog of projects, particularly in the construction and infrastructure world you're heading into this year, what is the opportunity for autodesk to potentially accelerate adoption of some of the main functions, buildingconnected, plangrid to try to help the industry work through this backlog?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. so we actually started to see the early signs of that as we headed into q4 as new business, starting to strengthen in our construction portfolio in particular. and we also saw it across the fusion base, as well as people started to look at their manufacturing and the design to manufacturing operations. so we see a pretty significant opportunity here.
look in many ways, the pandemic gave us an opportunity to catch up and pull ahead a little bit here. our portfolio is now best-in-class. our development team did an incredible heavy lift and an amazing job unifying what was the best of plangrid, which with the best of what we had in bim 360, we now have autodesk build on this foundation of autodesk docs. and there is no one that has a better office to trailer solution than we do.
and i think if you go out there and you talk to customers and you talk to this space and they look at what we've done with autodesk build, you're going to hear the same kind of feedback that we really built a great product, and that's the product we're going to be leading with on new business. it's not that we won't be leading on the acquired portfolio products as we continue to sell those, but we're going to lead with build, and we're going to lead with build in many places. and that's going to give us a chance to not only drive a successful international expansion, but also continue to lap some of our competitors in the rest of the market, especially in places like the mid-market, but another one pieces of our secret sauce heading into the year, phil, is the flexibility we offer on business models. we meet our customers wherever they are.
and i think this is super important for you to pay attention to, we sell named user subscriptions. we sell site licenses. we sell project-based licensing when they want it. we sell consumption inside of ebas, whatever they need for whatever project they're pursuing.
we have a model for them and a product for them. and i think that important convergence between the flexibility, which by the way, costs us complexity in the backend, but it's worth it in terms of meeting the customers where they are. when you combine that with the products, we feel really, really optimistic about how we're going to accelerate in this year and meet some of this demand. and our customers are looking for it.
they want to digitize faster. they're starting to increase their spending. and we think we've got the portfolio of products and the portfolio of purchasing options that makes it work. we're not trying to force people into one kind of business model, and then maybe try to lock them in kind of places that they don't want to be.
so we feel pretty optimistic.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of jay vleeschhouwer.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
no follow-up from phil. so we didn't get a follow-up here.
operator
not at this time. our next question comes from the line of jay vleeschhouwer from griffin securities. you may begin.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
thank you. good evening. andrew, the company has quite a lot on his plate, a very broad agenda. and the question is within the context of your three overarching strategic priorities, obviously making the numbers that you guided to now for fiscal 2022.
can you talk about some of the other critical programmatic executable that you are aiming for this year? for instance, in terms of a channel in terms of delivering on the platform, going live perhaps with ppu other critical technical milestones that you might care to talk about in terms of new products like tandem and spacemaker and so forth. and then secondly, on the last call, you noted that within your peer group, autodesk is the largest r&d spender, which is the case, but could you talk in a little bit more detail about how you're allocating r&d? maybe talk about the priorities you've spoken of reinvesting in the aec? and maybe talk about some of those critical investment priorities views in the r&d?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
all right. so there was â it's usually a multi-party question from jay. all right. so let's talk about some of the programmatic pieces here.
now i don't want to take any thunder away from this year's au, which is where we talk a lot about, as you probably noticed with last day, you're going to see more of a product announcement focused au, as we move forward. so i don't want to take any thunder away from that. but if you look at programmatically where we're going to be leaning into, platform enhancements that bring design and make and industries together and create commonality across many of the industries we serve are going to be a particular lever that we're to be moving with. we just hired a new cto with a lot of platform strategy chops that we're going to be leveraging to integrate some deeper platform capabilities into the company.
we're also going to be looking programmatically at the named user transition program, as you know, that was kind of a bumpy program last year. the customers really didn't appreciate us introducing that into a pandemic year, and they really want to understand what their options are with regards to flexible usage and occasional use moving forward. for so look for us to explore those kinds of capabilities as we've extended out, what the deadline was in that program, which still makes that program being executed faster than maintenance subscription, but probably more on a timeline that fits with what our customers can absorb. so you'll see us kind of look at those flexible options and explore some of those things with our customers.
now if you look specifically at how we're allocating investment, i mean â i think you saw what we did around the a in aec. we acquired spacemaker. we're integrating that team, building up capabilities around that team, particularly around integrating machine learning and cloud-based platforms into the design process in architecture and engineering. so that investment is clear, we've highlighted it.
you've just seen how we're investing in infrastructure and civil infrastructure. we've already talked organically about road and rail. and now we've also talked about water and all of this kind of builds on top of what we're doing with construction cloud. i haven't talked a lot about what we're going to be doing with manufacturing, but here's what i can tell you.
we're very interested in the cloud transformation in manufacturing, and i think you'll see us lean deeply into the cloud transformation around manufacturing more. we've invested pretty heavily there. our investment is large in that whole portfolio, particularly in the fusion portfolio. i think you'll continue to see us to invest to that area.
and as we head toward au, you'll hear exciting things about fusion. you'll hear exciting things about tandem. you'll hear exciting things about the platform for the company. and you'll hear exciting things about how the aec portfolio is starting to come together in a similar way that we brought together some of the construction portfolio acquisitions that we did previously.so look for us to kind of play across all those fields.
now, in terms of the breadth of what we're doing, i think i might've talked about this last time. we reverticalized the company just recently in october. so now i have someone that's responsible for the aec execution. again, that's amy bunszel, scott reese working on the execution and product design and manufacturing, and diana colella working in the media and entertainment space, and they are working closely with me and the rest of the team to execute on these vertical priorities while we've also elevated platform up to a executive staff level, reporting directly to me, which will allow us to synergize the platform efforts more tightly with those things.
so we're doing this from an operational perspective, as well as from a strategic investment perspective.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
ok. thank you, andrew.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
you're welcome.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of gal munda from berenberg capital. you may begin.
gal munda -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
hey. thank you for taking my questions. so the first one, i was just like to ask you, andrew, when you kind of look at how the year played out in terms of the multi-years there or network licenses, versus what you expected. is it fair to say that you're kind of ride bang in the middle to that two to one thing that you expected and you've just extended the program to 2023.
does that mean that you're kind of very comfortable with the way that this program is kind of converting and you think that it's going to remain at that level where it's not a significant headwind to the model?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. so look, our original statements about this being neutral to the model, continue to hold. so there's no change in that expectation. i think what you saw last year, and i think this is a natural thing, like there's two sides of the bell curve, right? there is the size of the bell curve for which two for one is like, hey, that's a no brainer for me.
i'm going to take the two for one. and there's a size of the bell curve for which two for one requires some more thought by the customer. more thought about â ok, wait a second. my usage is greater than two for one, autodesk, what are you going to do to allow me to be flex a little bit more an eba is too big for me.
so what you saw early on is a lot of those people on the left side of the bell curve, the 50% of people that were up for renewal last year that said, hey, this is good for me. they moved quite rapidly through that, right? the extension is for the people that require more thought about how this is going to impact their business and how they're going to adapt if their usage is greater than the two for one that the program had. so that's one of the reasons why we're working on the extension also to ensure that we have the new flexible models out there for them to explore. so there's no change in our expectations, which regards to the impact on our business.
it's going to be over in the whole period of the program neutral in terms of impact to our business. positive long-term in terms of experience for the customers.
gal munda -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
yes. absolutely. and then just the second as this follow-up. you mentioned that for this year, you, again, expecting kind of mid-20s long-term deferred revenue in terms of the, you said, no material contribution to free cash flow.
when we look into more toward fy 2023 and then maybe even beyond that, we're hearing this, multi-year licenses is still been very, very strong even during the pandemic. so what would be the normal rate that you kind of think about if you think maybe more longer term, not just next year and maybe the year after?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. so simon, remind me what we're reverting. so one of the things we're doing, and i want to make sure we're super clear on this with regards to multi-year. with multi-year our expectations that are revert solely back to the mean here.
all right and not try to exceed what we've done historically, ok? and i just want to make sure that we understand that and we can get ourselves grounded in that simple fact. we're reverting back to the mean behavior and yes, as we ended last fiscal year, right, we saw quite an interesting pickup in multi-year, frankly, more than we expected, all right, given that we were still in the pandemic year, but if we look at where we want to be, it's just a reversion back to the mean. and remember that the multi-year business is attractive to both our channel partners and our customers, because our channel partners liked to collect the cash up front. and our customers like to lock in the price protection for multiple years.
and if you recall, reversion to the mean historically for our maintenance business was about 30% of the business, roughly speaking. we want to stay right within that domain and we will probably stay within that domain for the foreseeable future. and that was adjusted peak, not the mean, ok, a piece to 30%, not in the middle. the mean was probably somewhere in the mid-20's.
gal munda -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
got you. thank you, andrew.

our next question will come from the line of adam borg from stifel. you may begin.
adam borg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question, and also welcoming the new folks coming in. maybe just a question on the net revenue retention rate. obviously, the pandemic and speed of recovery will be the key input in the near-term.
i was just curious, andrew, if there's any kind of initiatives you're working on internally that can help drive net retention revenue rates back to the historical range. thanks so much.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. so we're hitting the ranges that we've set for net revenue retention. and frankly, obviously there's two things that drive net revenue retention, renewal rates and aov renewal, and the ability to expand into accounts, right? and so we're working both of those sides in terms of increasing renewal rates and increasing our ability to expand in accounts with the make solutions. so when we look at net revenue retention, remember, one of the things that we saw and i think we highlighted this a lot over the last year was how strong the renewal rates lasted throughout the â through the last year and how we continued to move forward.
so we actually overperformed based on our expectations on renewal rates of the business. we continue to see â we continue to expect that to accelerate. but more importantly, the net revenue retention is going to be driven by more and more people incorporating our digital portfolios, construction cloud, fusion, other types of products like that and also moving to bim in the aec space. so look for a lot of the increases in net revenue retention to be programmatically driven by the move to bim, the move to digitize in the cloud â in construction cloud and the move to transform their manufacturing processes with fusion 360 and other solutions like that.
adam borg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thanks again.
operator
and our next question will come from the line of sterling auty from jp morgan. you may begin.
sterling auty -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yes. thanks. hi, guys. just one question from my side.
in the context of the improving economy, i'm wondering what if anything you contemplated in that improvement in the business coming from the possibility of further stimulus spending from the government and in particular [audio gap].
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
we do not factor that in, ok. governments move slowly, the money trickles down slowly. so we have not factored any of that into our plans and into our guides. that said, we do expect it to be an investment.
you probably have heard that the american society of civil engineers in the u.s. rated u.s. infrastructure a d+. other countries aren't doing particularly well either.
this is an area for investment and focus. and we expect to see some of that investment focus, but we haven't factored this in.
sterling auty -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question will come from line of joe vruwink from baird. you may begin.
joe vruwink -- baird -- analyst
great. hi, everyone. one modeling question first and then one on the business. just when looking at the first quarter guide, i think the revenue variance in terms of variance to consensus estimates that seems explained by the couple 100 basis points you talked about.
but i'm wondering in terms of the eps variance as a bit wider. are there some discrete investments that take place in 1q? is this a function of the extra day thrown into the mix? or i guess, the question is how do you see margins progressing throughout the year and as 1q kind of different than just the normal cadence?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. so this is a really important question. so let's talk about q1 and the shape of the curve and what actually drives revenue in q1. so i think i said earlier, q1 is actually at the trough of where we expect things to be.
we're going to accelerate quite rapidly out of q1. but what actually drives the revenue guiding q1? the most important thing is the revenue recognition. so let's look at last year. last year, we did not grow a new business to the degree, we expected to.
in fact, we saw declines year over year in our new business. the impact of those declines in new business bookings in the previous year have a disproportionately large effect on q1, but they worked themselves out relatively quickly as you move into q2, q3, q4 and beyond. so we absolutely do have a somewhat more backend loaded year than we would in a classic autodesk year, but not extremely disagreed simply because of the hole that was created. and i think i said earlier, the new business that we lost in last year, it didn't disappear.
it's coming back and it's coming back with a vengeance as we head into the next year. but there's a couple of other little factors that affect q1 disproportionally. and i think it's really important that we all get grounded on some of these things. so the first one is, we have a set of products that because they are not yet cloud enabled to a certain degree are recognized upfront in the revenue â in the accounting rules.
they have to be. we have been working hard to ensure that all of those products are cloud enabled and that will actually force them to be recognized ratably. one of the products that is moving from upfront recognition to ratable recognition is the vault product family. and that vault product family was providing quite a bit of upfront revenue recognition previously.
and now, as we enter q1, it's all going to be recognized, ratably because vault now has a mobile client, it now has other cloud enabled features in it. so that was all of a sudden a headwind to revenue recognition in q1, but it works itself out as the year progresses, as the relatability progresses and the buildup progresses. and this is just the way a subscription business model works. so there's some unusual sort of one-time headwinds to q1 that unwind themselves fairly quickly.
and q1 is the trough and we will accelerate out of there, but it's definitely related to the buildup of recognized revenue as we progress. so that â i hope that helps you understand a little bit more how q1 works. yes, there are some additional little details like q1 is one day shorter this year, year over year. so it's actually one less day of revenue in the quarter and it's three days shorter than quarter over quarter.
but those other things i talked about are much more important for understanding the q1 guide and how it unwind as the year progresses. make sense.
joe vruwink -- baird -- analyst
it does. it does. thank you. and if i can squeeze in one more.
just as you engage with your customers and they come back and you're booking new business. but as they talked to you about the composition of what they see going forward and their view on how a non-res construction cycle might develop. what are you hearing in terms of similarities? the cycle is going to be like, out of 2008, 2009, out of 2001, 2002 or what are some of the differences that you're hearing? and how did those similarities or differences impact autodesk just given how your product portfolio has changed?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. so remember, first off that we are distributed across almost all facets of the industry, and it's important to realize that when one wobbles, another one pops up. and we're absolutely seeing that pattern. so for instance, you see in commercial real estate development, you see a slowing of projects.
you actually do see a rebooting of project that had been put on hold by the pandemic, but you see a slowing of new projects. but you see other new projects coming in the pipeline in terms of urban multi-family housing, suburban multi-family housing, other types of commercial real estate outside of dense urban areas. so we're hearing a lot from customers about a shift in where their portfolios are moving to. one thing we are getting consistently though, is an ongoing focus on adopting certain aspects of our cloud portfolio, particularly, what we do with autodesk build collaborations.
the collaboration tools for revit models. we're seeing a lot of increased adoption in that, we saw a lot of strength last year. we're seeing some of that strength heading in. i think that's going to be an important part of our portfolio moving forward, because not only does it allow for a seamless remote work, but it also allows for better downstream integration to the rest of the build process.
so we're seeing a lot of those tools being adopted, and we're also seeing a lot more adoption of some of the cloud-based tools that we're seeing in manufacturing. so the cloud is definitely front and center in terms of some of the growth areas in our portfolio, but do not underestimate bim and the role of revit in the digitization of aec, it will continue to be a strong driver in the new world order, but it's uneven. it cuts very across geographies, across segments. you definitely see differences in terms of where people are going to seeing things booting up and where they see things slowing down.
but like every cycle we've ever seen, the money just shifts to somewhere else.
joe vruwink -- baird -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of matt hedberg from rbc capital markets. you may begin.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for taking my questions, and that was really good color on q1. i think that makes a ton of sense. and also my congrats to debbie, it's really good to see you back at autodesk.
i guess, andrew now that we're sort of unwinding uncertainty, i think that's a term you've used before. when we think of the trajectory to 2023, i mean, i just would kind of like to get me to some high level thoughts there. and i guess even more so, beyond 2023, what's the right way to think about that as we enter this new fiscal year.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. so thank you for this question, right. and it's an important question. so first off, i want to make sure that i just reiterate something i've said many times before.
we model our business with super high fidelity, ok. and within those models, we never put forward our best case, right. we always had a buffer in there at some degree, buffers are great for like pandemic years. you love it when you have a buffer.
now of course, as you get closer to events like fy 2023 and things associated with that. the buffer gets smaller, but the accuracy of your model also gets better as well? so we have super â we have a lot of confidence in the buildup to fy 2023, the $2.4 billion in free cash flow, the organic metrics surrounding our business and we also have a lot of confidence in the double-digit growth as we had beyond fiscal 2023. fiscal 2023, isn't some event, it's just another milepost like fiscal 2020 was fiscal 2023 is. it's another milepost on a journey, but there is ongoing growth in the double digit range out beyond fiscal 2023.
now i think one of the things people anchor on right now is what about this buildup from 2022 to 2023? one of the things i want to remind you is about the nature of how momentum is going to be exiting 2022. remember, we're going to be slightly more backend loaded in terms of the accumulation of revenue in new business heading into fiscal 2023, not dramatically backend loaded, but more backend loaded than we were traditionally be. we're going to exit 2023 with quite a bit more momentum than the full-year targets would indicate, all right, relatively speaking in terms of those outcomes. so we feel pretty confident with the momentum we'll exit fy 2023 with, and that we have the book of business from the renewal base, from the continuing digitization of aec, from the continuing convergence of design and make and manufacturing, and to the conversion of non-compliant users to hit the numbers that we have in fy 2023 and beyond.
and we were confident in our models, we're confident in the margin of error. we're confident in the levers we can pull if we had to pull any. so we see line of sight to some of the organic goals that we've been talking about, and we continue to be confident even with what seems to be a big buildup from 2022 to 2023, you just have to pay attention to the momentum we have as we exit the full-year 2022 into 2023.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
super helpful. very clear. thanks, andrew.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
no different than that 2019 to 2020 discussion that we had. i think like yesterday, but it was three years ago.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
it does. thank you.
operator
our next question will come from the line of keith weiss from morgan stanley. you may begin.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
i wanted to dig into the recovery. so our survey work shows expectations are getting a little bit pushed out from the kind of first half of 2022 to the next quarter end. we've heard from you and your peers on a slow recovery. so kind of what are you hearing from customers and what do they need to see in order to pick up the pace of recovery? and also where are the areas that you see there could be some risks that it could get further delayed.
thank you.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. so first off, our customers have to invest ahead of their project load in order to be successful. remember our tools show up not only in the execution phase and the make phase, but also very early in the early conceptual design phases. and one of the big areas of strength that we saw in q4 was that large increase in enterprise business agreements.
we see the record number of ebas we saw is kind of an emblematic of customers investing in future digitalization capacity. so we expect to see that regardless of the situation in the markets right now. but our view continues to be q1 the trough, the acceleration starts to come out of q1, as we head out of the spring and into the summer. right now there's lots of uncertainty and you hear lots of buzz around variants and vaccine distributions.
but i think all of us are smart enough to know that just like when we have these discussions about testing infrastructure and testing rollout and testing capacity, all these things work themselves out over a multi-month period in terms of distribution of vaccines, distribution of assignment of capacity and all the things associated with that. now if all of that stuff starts to crumble and fumble, of course, you end up in a new situation, but that is highly unlikely in this situation. and there's much more alignment on trying to get the right things done. and that's what we're hearing from our customers more and more is they're trying to invest ahead of the growth they see coming forward.
so we're pretty bullish as we head into the second half of the year and we're pretty optimistic as we head into the summer. there's always something that can derail this, a wobble in the vaccine distribution or something associated with that or some kind of rise of political uncertainty. but you know what, we can't predict those things. and we don't see those things.
and what we see mostly are tailwinds right now, as we head out of q1 and into q2 and beyond.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. that's super helpful. and then just to sneak one more in, your comments on the areas investment were certainly helpful. but just taking a step back, the innovyze deal was one of the largest acquisitions to date.
i believe it was above plangrid. so how should we just think about the kind of higher level framework for investing organically in r&d versus kind of the acquisitions as a source of innovation? thank you.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. so we tend to invest organically in innovations that either we've been invested â that we've been working on for a period of time, that it represents net new business opportunities that we will acquire to net new business opportunities where there's like, no mature market yet. but we will tend to acquire in areas where we're seeing long-term opportunities or opportunities for enhanced digitization or enhanced cloud capability in verticals where we might not have established vertical â businesses or sub verticals where we might not have established businesses. but make no bones about it.
our organic investment is very much driven on this convergence of design and make in both aec and manufacturing. and on this convergence of manufacturing and construction across our industries, we've got a lot of organic focus and the innovation in those areas. we will acquire inorganically for innovation in certain cloud-based areas, but more likely, we'll acquire for vertical specialization in areas where established businesses have created a presence.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you so much.
operator
thank you.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
and i think innovyze is indicative to that.

and now i will turn the call over to andrew. 
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you, simon, and welcome everyone to the call. i hope you and your families remain safe and healthy. before jumping into our fourth quarter and full-year results, i would like to again thank our employees and the families and communities that support them as well as our partners and customers, for their continued commitment during uncertain times. that commitment, combined with our resilient subscription business model and the secular shift to the cloud, enabled us to maintain momentum and exceed our goals.
we generated strong growth, with full-year subscription revenue and remaining performance obligations or rpo up 26% and 19%, respectively. we also made significant progress toward digitizing aec, converging design and make in manufacturing and converting non-compliant and legacy users. we signed a record number of new enterprise business agreements, or ebas, in the fourth quarter. in fact, they were equal to the number we signed in the entirety of the previous year.
that's a testament both to our execution and growing partnership with our enterprise customers as we enable their digital transformations, demonstrated by enterprise bim 360 usage nearly doubling year over year. while we made great strides this year, we intend to extend our leadership in the cloud and expand our presence in existing and adjacent industry verticals across the globe. the pending acquisition of innovyze, which we announced yesterday and is expected to close later this quarter, is a great example of that intent. innovyze is a global leader in water infrastructure simulation and modeling, serving many of the world's largest utilities, the majority of the top enr design firms, and other leading environmental and engineering consultancies.
innovyze enables water distribution networks and drainage systems to be more cost-effectively and sustainably designed and operated. combined with civil 3d, infraworks, revit and autodesk construction cloud, we would be able to provide end-to-end water and wastewater solutions across planning, design, construction and operations.with our existing capabilities in road and rail, and our partnership with aurigo in capital planning, we now have end-to-end infrastructure solutions for facility owners and public sector agencies. autodesk provides innovyze with multiple opportunities to scale through enterprise, channel sales, and geographic expansion. we also intend to apply our expertise in navigating through a business model transition to drive additional growth in fiscal 2024 and beyond.
i'm excited about the opportunities ahead, and look to the future with optimism. in the near-term, we expect the unwinding of uncertainty from vaccine availability and political stability to drive confidence and investment over the second half of the year. over the long-term, autodesk's purpose to drive efficiency and sustainability has never been more relevant or urgent. in partnership with our customers, we have an unmatched capacity to drive efficiency and meet the global challenges of carbon emissions, embedded carbon, water scarcity and waste.
and autodesk is playing its part. we are on track to meet our commitment to be climate neutral and remain dedicated to being a resilient, diverse, and equitable company. we were most recently recognized by barron's as number four on their list of the world's 100 most sustainable companies, and the highest-ranked software company. we are proud of our impact at autodesk, and through our customers the impact we are making in the wider world.
i'm also thrilled to announce two strong additions to my team. debbie clifford will be returning to autodesk as chief financial officer and raji arasu will be joining as chief technology officer. debbie is currently chief financial officer at surveymonkey but spent the 13 years prior to that role in various financial leadership roles at autodesk, including leading the internal business model transition team, engaging with many of you in support of our investor outreach, and as my finance business partner before i became ceo. with her leadership skills, expertise and passion for our mission, autodesk's finance team will not miss a beat.
raji joins us from intuit, where she currently serves as senior vice president of their platform and services business. prior to that, she was cto for ebay subsidiary stubhub. at autodesk, she will oversee and be responsible for the autodesk's technology and platform strategy, as well as being operationally responsible for the on-going development of our platform services. raji will replace current autodesk cto scott borduin, who announced his intent to retire last year after more than 21 years of service to the company.
scott had two tours as autodesk ceo, the prior one working for carol bartz and has not only contributed to the rise of inventor and fusion to the products they are today, but also as a passionate evangelist for autodesk and our vision. emblematic of his dedication to autodesk, he moved out his retirement date so that he can help raji during her transition into autodesk. i'd like to give scott a heartfelt thank you for all he's done and is continuing to do. before i provide insights into our strategic growth drivers, let me take you through the details of our quarterly and full-year performance, and the guidance for the next year.
in an extraordinary year, we performed strongly across all metrics, perhaps best encapsulated by the sum of our revenue growth and free cash flow margin for the year equaling 51%. several factors contributed to that strength in the fourth quarter, including, record ebas, robust subscription renewal rates, accelerating digital sales, and continued sequential growth in new business. total revenue growth in the quarter was 16%, both as reported and in constant currency, with subscription revenue growing by 22% and now representing approximately 91% of total revenue. there was approximately two percentage points of benefit to subscription and maintenance growth from upfront revenue recognition of some products that do not incorporate substantial cloud services.
looking at revenue by product and geography. autocad and lt revenue grew 11% in the fourth quarter, and 16% for the year. aec grew 18% in q4, and 20% for the year. manufacturing rose 17% in q4, and 10% for the year.
even excluding the benefit from a strong performance in automotive ebas, which include non-ratable vred revenue, manufacturing grew double digits in the quarter. m&e grew 14% in the quarter, boosted by a strong performance from our collaboration platform, shotgun, and was up 10% for the year. geographically, revenue growth ticked up in all regions. revenue grew 14% in the americas, 13% in emea, and 23% in apac during the quarter.
we also saw strength in direct revenue, which rose 28% versus last year, and represented 34% of our total sales, up three percentage points from the fourth quarter of last year. the strength in our direct business was driven by some non-ratable products included in a few large ebas and digital sales. during the year, we grew total subscriptions by 8% to 5.3 million. excluding the multi-user trade-in program, total subscriptions grew 4% to 5.1 million.
subscription plan subscriptions grew 15%, and by 10% excluding the multi-user trade-in program. we added 130,000 make subscriptions due to the strong adoption of our bim 360 family and fusion 360 products. during q4, our maintenance conversion and renewal rates declined sequentially, which was expected as we are entering the final stages of our maintenance-to-subscription program. with only one quarter left before this program retires, we have approximately 126,000 maintenance subscriptions remaining, accounting for approximately 3% of our revenue in the fourth quarter.
i am proud to share that we have converted over 1.3 million maintenance subscriptions to date. at the end of the fourth quarter, the lion's share of our commercial subscriptions were named users benefiting from easier access, usage data visibility and secure license management. we anticipate many of our remaining multi-user subscribers will make the transition to named users as the pandemic recedes, and we are now extending our 2:1 multi-user trade-in to august 2023 to enable that. as announced last november, we are also exploring consumption-based models to meet the needs of customers requiring flexible license usage.
our net revenue retention rate remained within the 100 to 110 percentage range we laid out in our guidance. our product subscription renewal rates remained robust, reinforcing the business-critical nature of our products to our customers. our billings were broadly level with last year, reflecting fewer multi-year sales, and our long-term deferred revenue was 26% of total deferred revenue in q4. our total rpo of $4.2 billion is up 19%, and our current rpo of $2.7 billion grew 16%.
on margins, we continue to realize good operating leverage due to strong revenue growth and diligent expense management. for the full year, non-gaap gross margins remained very strong at 93%, up one percentage point from last year, our non-gaap operating margin increased by five percentage points to 29%.as you have seen in our press release, our gaap results include a $679 million deferred tax asset valuation allowance released in the fourth quarter. this largely reflects the completion of our business model transition and the significant growth in our profitability. consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we continued to repurchase shares with excess cash to offset dilution from our equity plans.
during the fourth quarter, we purchased 530,000 shares for $157 million at an average price of approximately $295 per share. for the full year, we purchased 2.6 million shares for $549 million at an average price of approximately $208 per share. now let me turn to our guidance, which does not include innovyze. we expect an improving macro-economic environment during the year will result in accelerating growth in new business over the course of fiscal 2022.
usage trends during the fourth quarter remained above pre-covid levels in most of asia pacific and continental europe and below pre-covid levels in the u.s. and uk. we have seen an uptick in interest for multi-year deals, growing optimism in the channel, and gradual recovery in bid activity on buildingconnected in the u.s. we expect product subscription renewal rates to continue to be very healthy, and our net revenue retention rate to remain between 100% and 110%.
given our subscription model, revenue growth will lag the improving sales environment. for fiscal 2022, we expect revenue to grow by 13% to 15%, margins to expand to between 31% and 32%, and free cash flow growth to reaccelerate to approximately 20%. when looking at the quarterization of free cash flow for fiscal 2022, we expect about three quarters of our free cash flow to again be generated in the second half of the year due to our macro-economic phasing assumptions and normal seasonality. as we noted last quarter, vault revenue is becoming ratable for fiscal 2022 with the release of significant new mobile functionality in the first quarter, and this will reduce our revenue growth by about a percentage point over the year with the biggest impact in other revenue on the p&l and in the manufacturing product family.
looking at our guidance for the first quarter, normal seasonality is compounded by vault ratability and one fewer calendar day versus q1 fiscal 2021, which together reduces year-on-year revenue growth in the first quarter by about two percentage points. with improving macro-economic conditions and easing comparables, we expect our revenue growth to accelerate after the first quarter. the slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for the fiscal first quarter and full-year 2022. we expect innovyze to be accretive to revenue growth, broadly neutral to free cash flow and a headwind on reported operating margins in fiscal 2022 and 2023.
we will provide additional details after the innovyze transaction completes. let me finish by giving you some details on the progress we made executing on our strategy to digitize aec, converge design and make in manufacturing, and monetize non-compliant and legacy users. earlier in february, we launched our autodesk construction cloud platform, which unifies our organic and acquired aec cloud offerings, and the data held within them, to enable a connected project ecosystem across design and construction. underpinning the autodesk construction cloud is our common data environment, autodesk docs; this provides seamless navigation, integrated workflows and project controls, and enables a single source of truth across the project lifecycle.
autodesk build brings together the best of plangrid and bim 360 with new functionality which, along with autodesk quantify and bim collaborate, creates a comprehensive suite of field construction and project management solutions. for our design customers, bim collaborate pro extends the capabilities of bim 360 design on the new platform to create a more seamless exchange of project data between design and construction. our strategy is to combine organic and acquired software in existing and adjacent verticals to create end-to-end, cloud-based solutions for our customers that drive efficiency and sustainability. we have pursued that strategy to create autodesk construction cloud, we are pursuing that strategy in infrastructure with the acquisition of innovyze, and we will continue to pursue that strategy in manufacturing.
the reasons for, and benefits of this strategy, were clearly demonstrated in our fourth quarter results. our growing partnership with our enterprise customers, as we enable their digital transformations, resulted both in a record number of new ebas in the fourth quarter; and also strong expansion and renewal rates with existing eba customers. we are seeing our new products, typically used by contractors, being increasingly adopted by design firms. for example, we expanded our agreement with jacobs, the world's largest design firm, to include pype, plangrid, and assemble to enable greater collaboration and more efficient workflows.autodesk has been a trusted partner of jacobs over the last 30 years, aligned with its mission to challenge today and reinvent tomorrow.
jacobs is also using autodesk's transformative services to help them deliver innovative solutions to their customers. for example, autodesk and jacobs partnered to deliver the world's first generatively designed airport in australia and, together, we are focused on leveraging generative design to solve other client challenges around the world. environmental air systems, eas, a full-service mechanical contractor and custom-built hvac equipment manufacturer which is on the forefront of industrialized construction, increased its investment with autodesk by replacing its existing project management tool with bim 360. it is now able to leverage its existing investment in aec collections, and provide a comprehensive tool for its teams to collaborate and to connect the office and the field.and tyrã©ns, a leading sustainable urban development consultancy in sweden, significantly expanded its strategic platform partnership with autodesk.
as per bjã¤lnes, tyrã©ns digital strategy manager for business area x, said, ""tyrã©ns is at the leading edge of the digital transformation of the construction and maintenance industry. digitalization enables smart building design, but requires secure data flows and seamless collaboration across a broad ecosystem of stakeholders during the construction and operations process. autodesk's revit and bim 360 docs empowered us to create true digital representations, and now with autodesk forge we can leverage those assets as digital twins to create value for different stakeholders, such as a reduction of energy consumption, the prediction and optimization of maintenance, and new smart seamless end user services."" we are also seeing benefits from our strategy in manufacturing. in the automotive sector, we now provide design software through our enterprise agreements to nearly all the largest global automotive oems, and are extending our footprint beyond design into the factory.
for example, our expanded partnership with rivian, a global provider of electric adventure vehicles, now extends across facilities with revit, bim360, and plangrid; manufacturing with inventor and generative design; and in the design studio with alias, vred, and shotgun. we are able to support rivian as it converts existing facilities to digital twins, optimizes its factory layout using generative design, improves energy efficiency through simulation, and enables collaboration and efficiency using a common data environment. similarly, we are providing end-to-end support to our long-term customer, transmashholding, tmh, which is the largest manufacturer of rolling stock and rail equipment in russia and cis, to accelerate its digital transformation and converge its design and make processes. tmh now builds trains in concept in alias, designs and engineers in inventor, optimizes in fusion, produces in powermill, and sells in vred.
our market-leading cloud-based platform, fusion 360, enjoyed another quarter of accelerating subscriptions, growing scale of deployments, and adding competitive displacements, ending the quarter with over 140,000 commercial subscriptions. conturo protoptyping, a machine shop based in pittsburgh, recently expanded its relationship with autodesk by adding more fusion seats. conturo is also adopting our recently launched machining extension, due to its integrated design and cam workflows, its advanced manufacturing capability, and the potential of generative design to reduce project timelines and solve design-for-manufacturing issues faster than ever before. in education, we continue to expand our footprint and replace traditional cad competitors.
with tinkercad and fusion 360 alone, autodesk is now approaching 40 million education users worldwide. for example, all of university college london's mechanical engineers switched to fusion 360 during the fourth quarter. as professor tim baker, mbe, who led the transition, said: ""covid-19 accelerated ucl's transition to the cloud. by enabling collaborative, multi-disciplinary engineering, fusion 360's next-generation platform equips our graduates to become the world's leading engineers of the future."" while all our software remains free for educators and students, graduates continue to bring fusion 360 with them into the workplace, from start-ups through to the giants of manufacturing.
while we have moderated our license compliance activity during the pandemic, we continue to work with existing and potential customers to ensure they pay for the software they use and comply with our terms of use. our goal remains to give non-compliant and legacy users access to the benefits of subscription access through flexible models. during the quarter, we closed 23 deals over $500,000 dollars with our license compliance initiatives, three of which were over a $1 million.for example, a european customer became aware during its transition to named users that its employees were accessing licenses in regions outside of the contract scope. our premium plan provided them with the flexibility to manage all licenses centrally, monitor usage to remain in compliance, and resulted in a $1 million-plus deal.
and a leading supplier of industrial automation solutions based in europe, who became a legacy customer three years ago, subscribed to our product design and manufacturing collection when we were able to demonstrate that recent workflow improvements and cloud enabled functionality would allow them to win more business by improving communication with their own customers, and improved efficiency through quicker layout in 2d and handover to 3d and visualization. in closing, we continue to build a stronger autodesk for the long term. our early and sustained organic and strategic investment in critical capabilities like cloud computing and cloud-based collaboration, combined with a successful transition to a saas business model, give us significant competitive advantages and confidence to grow in the double-digit range in the foreseeable future. we expect to have accelerating momentum during fiscal 2022 and we have multiple drivers that make us confident in our fiscal 2023 free cash flow target of $2.4 billion and double-digit growth thereafter.
with that, operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of jay vleeschhouwer from griffin securities. your line is now open.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
thank you. good evening, andrew and debbie. let me ask you, andrew, first, a couple of business and technology or technology evolution questions. you highlighted infrastructure.
and the company has been in that business for many, many years, and you'll recall that once upon a time, was, in fact, a reporting segment and maybe should be again at some point. could you describe the main ways in which that business has evolved over the last number of years in terms of its scope or its customer base? and what the vision really is for that business in terms of perhaps adding new types of customers, such as owner-operators that have not really been a large part of your business profile to date. secondly, since we're halfway between au 2020 and au 2021, could you update us on some of the important initiatives that you yourself highlighted during your q&a session at au six months ago, mainly the forge roadmap and its implications for your long term, and secondarily, sharing technology across the portfolio and across industries. in other words, leveraging your r&d more and more across the company in that respect.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. all right, jay, so let me start with the infrastructure discussion. so here's what fundamentally staying with the business. one, we've been winning more and more departments of transportation as we've progressed since the last time the infrastructure business was broken out.
and what we did is we focused our organic portfolio very much on road and rail work, you know, bridges, roads and rails, and created a lot of workflows between civil 3d and infraworks, and some of our specific tools. and we've been very happy with the progress we've been making there, and we continue that organic investment targeting those pieces of infrastructure. we don't feel it needs to be broken out into a separate business because, you know, i think you might recall, since those days, we've moved our entire sales organization to account-based sales, so it's very easy to cover these types of customers with the kinds of support that we need to engage with them directly. look, water's next, as you can see with what we've been doing with tandem and the digital twin work and also with what we've acquired with innovyze with their info360 solution and some of the tools around there with digital twins for waste management and water management.
we're definitely moving closer to things that are directly relevant to owner-operators. and i would -- you would expect to see us do more of that as time progresses, ok? so that kind of gives you a sense for what we're looking at and how we've gotten here. now with regard to au initiatives, i don't want to kind of, you know, pre-empt next au's announcements. but what i'll tell you is, you know, we continue to add additional capabilities to forge into the apis.
and i think this coming au, you're going to hear me talk a lot more about some of the common experiences we're creating across some of our new environments that we're building through our various customers. so i want to hold on to some of that news as we move forward to the next au. but, you know, the hint is there's some common data experiences. there's some common ways of managing and accessing projects that we're developing and deploying, all things that are relevant to making the platform more powerful for bringing together the various products that our customers use.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
ok. for debbie, quickly. you highlighted strong growth in product subs. if you're able to look at that in absolute terms, how would that product subs' level of business compare with, let's say, the second and third quarter of last year and perhaps even the fourth quarter? are you at now perhaps the highest level you've been in four or five quarters as far as product subs are concerned?
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
the short answer is yes. we've returned to growth after a period of several quarters that were impacted by covid. and so we're pleased with the growth that we saw in q1, and that's evidenced in the revenue results.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of saket kalia from barclays. your line is now open.
saket kalia -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
ok. great. can you hear me ok?
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
yeah. 
saket kalia -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
excellent. excellent. thanks so much for taking my questions, and welcome, debbie. maybe first for you, andrew.
i'd love to dig into the new business acceleration you've touched on as we are starting this recovery. you know, maybe in particular, how much of this recovery do you feel is in demand, that is do you feel is tied to increased engineering hiring versus perhaps pent-up demand for tools post-pandemic, just as we kind of think about the pace of this recovery going forward? does that make sense?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. it's hard for me to break it down into increased engineering hiring versus kind of pent-up demand. so i really -- i can't really give you a fine grain view on that. what i can tell you is that usage of some of our more engineering-intensive products is going up pretty significantly, ok? and, you know, we talked a lot about usage every year with regards to how the monthly active users and the daily active users is going in various countries.
what we've seen is the majority of our countries are now at or above pre-covid levels. the u.k. is now above pre-covid levels. the u.s.
still struggling a little bit to get above pre-covid levels, but showing a lot of robust impact. you also noticed -- i think you probably watched the indexes out there, the pmi and the abi indices, in particular. we have always found those indices to be lagging indicators of our business. so they actually tell us that something has already happened with the purchasing behavior of our customers.
and what you've seen is those indices continuing to shift toward growth, which you hint at, saket, that it's the book of work that's going up, all right, which means people are going to hire more engineers, they're going to hire more people and they're going to engage -- they're going be using our products more. so it's probably driven mostly by hiring related to the book of business of our customers is going up. the indices seem to indicate that as a lagging indicator of what we've seen in terms of purchasing behavior and usage. but that's kind of as much granularity as i can give you on that.
saket kalia -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
no, that's super helpful, andrew. thanks. maybe for a follow-up for you, debbie. you touched on this a little bit in the prepared remarks, but i'd like to just talk about the acceleration in revenue this year.
i think we get some of the drivers, but i'd love to sort of get your take and perhaps as part of that, your confidence in that growth lasting into fiscal '23 and for that matter, remainder term as well.
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
well, thanks, saket. i'd start by saying, so q1 is our seasonally smallest quarter. and our guidance assumes that we'll see improving results as the year progresses, which is consistent with what we're seeing. we're seeing uncertainty lessening, growing confidence from our customers and our channels, and improving demand in our end markets, which is resulting in accelerating growth in new business.
we're also seeing increasing renewal rates, strong direct business, particularly through the estore. our total direct revenue grew 25% year over year in q1 and now represents 33% of total revenue. we're also pleased that we're starting to see momentum in key indicators like rpo, which grew 22% year over year in q1. and it's because of these factors that we're confident in the ramp during fiscal '22.
now if i shift attention to fiscal '23 and even beyond that, let me just break that down a little bit. i mentioned on the call that since i rejoined autodesk, i've been focused on two primary things. the first is reacquainting myself with everything autodesk, the team, the strategy, what's happened while i was away for a couple of years. and the second is digging deep to get a solid understanding of the fiscal '22 budget and our fiscal '23 financial goals.
it's because of that work that i see significant opportunities for growth, including a growing tam, from things like accelerating digitization in aec, the convergence of design and make in manufacturing, an expansion into adjacent verticals like you saw us do recently with the acquisition of innovyze that got us into water infrastructure. we're also focused on further monetizing our tam in a variety of ways. some examples include conversion of noncompliant users. andrew mentioned that billings from noncompliant users almost doubled year over year in q1, and we're seeing more direct selling, as i just mentioned, and that direct selling gets us greater price realization that is another growth driver for us.
this is all against a macroeconomic backdrop that we see improving. and it's because of all of this that we're confident in our fiscal '23 revenue growth potential and the free cash flow target of $2.4 billion in that period. now i've been back for 90 days, less than 90 days, actually. so next step for me is more work on the long-range financial plan and getting a deeper understanding of our path in fiscal '24 and beyond.
our goal is to drive double-digit growth using some kind of rule of 40-type framework over time.
saket kalia -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
very helpful. thanks for your time, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of adam borg from stifel. your line is now open.
adam borg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hey, guys, and thanks for taking the question. maybe just on upchain. so obviously, i know that just closed a few weeks back, but i was just curious if you could talk more about the vision over time of integrating upchain with fusion and forge and how we should even think about the convergence of both vault and upchain, just given the similarities? obviously, one's on-prem and one's in the cloud.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. an excellent question, adam. so as you know, upchain is plm and pdm, product data management, product -- and product life cycle management in the cloud. so it's a fully cloud-native application.
it's got both product data management and plm. it understands both files and cloud information models like with power fusion, for example. our vision for how this is going to work is fusion already has a stack built on its cloud information model that goes all the way through simple data management up through into product life cycle management. upchain will likely replace that capability within fusion over time.
but more importantly, what upchain does is it supports a whole swath of legacy applications from our competitors and from other places. so what we're going to do is we're going to go into accounts with legacy applications or where we see overlap with other applications and combine the fusion stack and the upchain stack to handle the whole swath of data our customers use. now ultimately, as well, what we're going to do is we're going to integrate upchain with vault so that vault can now have an extension to the cloud. we're not going to force our vault users to move from on-prem to the cloud.
vault is a very popular application. we sell a lot of it every quarter. and we're going to continue to update and maintain it. you might have noticed that we just released a mobile and extension to it and some web -- additional web extensions capability for vault.
so we continue to drive vault, but we are going to integrate vault and upchain over time, which will give our vault customers a path to putting all their data in the cloud as they see fit to do it, but we're not going to force that migration. so look for it to replace the guts of fusion life cycle over time and integrate with fusion cloud information model and look for it to integrate with vault over time and provide a path for vault customers to the cloud. and then ultimately, look for us to be going after legacy systems with a combination of our fusion offering and upchain's capability to bring all the customers' data and all the applications the customer use together in one robust cloud environment.
adam borg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great, andrew. maybe just a quick follow-up. just on the autodesk construction cloud. you cited some nice examples of some customer wins in the quarter.
just as you think about that business over the course of the year, especially with the improving macro kind of where are you thinking -- how you're thinking about that business as the year progresses? thanks so much.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. so we have really high expectations for how that business progresses as the year progresses. and we're getting -- we're definitely getting some good indications. one of the things we watch are the bids -- the activity on bid board through our buildingconnected service.
that activity has been going up in q1. it's been progressively going up each month, which is great. so we see a lot of activity heading into there. just like a lot of our businesses, we expect some of the new business to be back-end loaded.
but we're super happy with where we are right now. we had a good launch of autodesk build. it's getting good take-up in monthly active usage from some of our customers. new customers are embracing it.
our international expansion efforts that we put on hold last year because of the pandemic are now moving into full year this year. later this year, we roll out autodesk build to the channel, and that's going to accelerate build's business. and, you know, one other thing i just want to highlight is why we're winning, ok, and why we continue to win business and why we're so incredibly confident about the future. here's what customers tell us, right? the end-to-end solution that we offer, all the way from planning -- early planning to design to preconstruction to preconstruction planning to site execution, all the way to digital handoff to actual maintenance and operations of the asset, nobody has this, especially to the depths that we have in each one of those disciplines.
the other thing that people are really excited about is the deep integration with them and the fact that it's a bim-native platform. it speaks bim from the get-go. it will always speak bim, and it's really good at it. this is driving more and more displacement of competitive solutions and accounts where we overlap.
and one of the other big things that we hear from customers is our business model flexibility, all right? customers love that they can buy from us where they need to buy from us and how they need to buy from us, right? you know, if you need a project-based license, we've got it. if you need a consumption-based model, we got it. if you need a per-user model, we got it. we adapt and flex our business model to whatever the particular customer's needs are or their ecosystem's needs are, and we can do it anywhere in the world.
so if we're dealing with an international customer, they know that when they standardize on us, they can get everywhere with the solution we do. so that's why we're winning. that's why we're bullish as we move into the next year and why we're excited about the construction market becoming hot and active again. the digitization of this market, a multiyear trend, there's lots of opportunity for lots of people, and we're seeing lots of validation in the direction we're heading.
and i think it's going to be an exciting year for digital construction.
adam borg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thanks, again.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of joe vruwink from baird. your line is now open.
joe vruwink -- baird -- analyst
great. hi, everyone. maybe just to focus on fusion 360. i think the first disclosure on commercial subs was about a year ago, and 152,000 of subs, about 80% since then.
andrew, when you mentioned that business being at a tipping point or i think you might just say pass the tipping point, is it just a function of scale and customer awareness now that the product is as large as it is? or are there other dynamics at play that you would point to as kind of supporting the business through this fiscal year?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
well, you know, there's a lot of things. one, there's the increased interest in the cloud, all right? there's the simple network effect of people saying, ""you know what, i displaced my mastercam and solidworks with fusion, you should try the two. it's awesome. so we're getting that network effect of people basically encouraging each other to move forward and get off the legacy systems and move to the cloud with fusion.
so we're seeing some of that. we're also seeing -- and this is super important. we're seeing increased purchases within accounts we penetrated previously, which means we're moving from kind of being a niche solution inside these companies or maybe partially -- a piloted solution to production. and that's also an important driver.
and we expect these trends to continue this year and continue moving forward. you know, and one of the really exciting things about this is we talked about growth beyond fy '23 and in fy '24 and '25 and beyond. the early success we're seeing in fusion right now is going to be a growth engine that continues to accelerate over the next five years, especially as we start introducing our new design -- our extensions. we already have one for advanced manufacturing.
we have various other extensions. there's going to be new extensions in the second half of the year. those extensions continue to be out there. we're particularly excited that we sold more fusion than other applications in q1 without any type of promotional activity.
all of this points toward increasing customer demand for what we're doing.
joe vruwink -- baird -- analyst
ok. that's great. and then just on the comment that in regards to your construction end markets, uncertainty is lessening. i appreciate no sale is ever easy.
but are there things that become easier, the fact that license compliance billings seem to have had a good quarter, coinciding with a better backdrop? is that something that accelerates as the year goes on? or would you maybe point to other areas of your business as well?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
i'm sorry. could you -- you went out a little bit for me on the last part of that. what -- the part of the question, what's the key point of the question here? sorry.
joe vruwink -- baird -- analyst
with uncertainty lessening, license compliance and having those conversations seems like that could be one area to benefit. are there other areas as well?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. ok. so, you know, as i've said many times, license compliance is one of these areas that we're just going to build a steady drumbeat on, right? it's going to be the gift that keeps giving for years and years to come. we do not want to accelerate it unnaturally because we want to bring our customers along with us.
we want to keep them happy, help them get compliant. you noticed the story that i offered up in indonesia about that customer actually buying premium subscription, as well as becoming compliant and being happy about how they were able to deploy it, that's the kind of outcomes we want from the solution. so we did see some acceleration. you saw the growth numbers in the opening commentary around noncompliant billings in q1.
but that was off of a q1 that was previously off. so we had a really strong compare. don't expect any hockey sticks, though the q1 of this year was better than the q1 of fiscal '20. so you're seeing continued growth, which is what we want to see, a nice steady growth in this business.
but don't look for any hockey sticks this year. we're back to the path we were on previously. 
joe vruwink -- baird -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
you're welcome.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of matt hedberg from rbc capital. your line is now open.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
well, great. thanks for taking my questions. andrew, i wanted to go back to the construction side again. obviously, the cost of building just continues to go up from a materials basis.
and i know you guys have talked about the amount of waste globally that comes from construction site. is that having a positive impact on pipeline generation as a lot of these construction firms, they just have to think end customers. they just have to become more way more efficient. is that a portion of your pipeline growth there? 
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
so, matt, that's a very astute observation, all right? it's too early to say if the cost of -- the increases in the cost of material is driving increased focus on digitization. but it is one of those things that we have constantly highlighted as one of the reasons why the value chain for construction needs to digitize. because when material prices have gone up the way they have, you can't afford to overpurchase and waste materials. so i can't tell you precisely if this is one of the pipeline drivers.
but i can tell you that we're mentioning it to customers, and we're having customers about, hey, conversation with customers who want to keep your material costs down, digitize, right? plan for less waste. only order what you need. so it's definitely entering into the conversation. i think it's too early to say if it's driving acceleration in the pipeline.
but i think it's likely that it is.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
that's really great to hear. and then -- thank you for that. and then debbie, welcome from me as well. i guess one of the questions that we always get, and i'm sure you get as well, you know, is sort of what gives you confidence in that kind of that hockey stick cash flow guide for fiscal '23.
now that you had a little bit of time to kind of reflect on the model, what are sort of -- what's your sort of your view on some of the major drivers? i know we've heard scott talk about them in the past. i'm just sort of curious on your perspective that gives you really that confidence that you seem -- it was clear in your remarks.
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure. matt, good to talk to you, too. it's -- in large part, it's a lot of the things that i mentioned before. i think it's this combination of a growing tam, as well as further monetization of our tam.
and so that continued digitization in aec with more innovation in revit with expanding bim mandates and ongoing bim proliferation around the world with the digitization of construction that andrew just talked about. even the infrastructure bill could be a wildcard for us. we're hopeful, although nothing is baked into our numbers at this point. but these are all the multiple growth drivers that give me confidence in the ramp.
i think some of the other data points that we have out there, i'll repeat because these are the things, frankly, that i've been looking at to get my own sense of confidence into that ramp into fiscal '23: the conversion of noncompliant users, the fact that those billings doubled in q1, and we're seeing more success with that program; the fact that we are selling more direct, that's a driver of growth for us and ultimately, will translate to free cash flow over time; the improving macroeconomic backdrop. all of these factors combined are what give me confidence in our ability to achieve our revenue growth potential in fiscal '23, as well as that free cash flow number of $2.4 billion.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks, debbie.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
and matt, i'll just reinforce some of the things that debbie said because i don't think we can talk about this enough because -- did you notice the list of things she gave there, right? there's a whole set of horizontal things just around the normal business, the noncompliance, the new types of subscription models, the rollout of consumption, the accelerating growth in our end markets. all of that combined also with the strategic levers around digitization and aec around the convergence of design and make of what we're seeing with fusion and then the whole move into new adjacencies that we're doing. any one of those things could contribute to viable long-term growth, we have all of those levers to pull, all right? i just want to remind you, we have all those levers to pull. and i guess, we're really good at picking and choosing the levers to pull when we need to pull them.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
sounds great. thanks a lot, guys. 
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of sterling auty from j.p. morgan. your line is now open.
sterling auty -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
yes. thanks. hi, guys. one housekeeping one to start.
can you be specific in terms of what the contribution to the guide is from the acquisitions?  
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
sure. sterling, so the impact on the acquisitions was a one-point increase to our revenue guidance range on the year, a one-point decrease to our operating margin range on the year, and it was neutral to free cash flow. that's consistent with what we said on the last call. 
sterling auty -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
all right. perfect. and then, andrew, as we think going forward, is fusion 360 always incremental to kind of the installed base of traditional seats? or have you already started to see a little bit of conversion one to the other? and if that's the case, what kind of change does that have on kind of the arr contribution?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. so nobody is moving from inventor to fusion right now, ok? it's just not happening, all right? it's actually, most of the business is about going after incremental seats inside of competitive accounts, say, especially down market. the one great thing about our strategy is most of the inventor is bought through collections, which includes fusion. so if an inventor user does start to move to fusion over time, they continue on the same subscription path we're doing.
and what we'll do with our collections is some of the extensions that would be available to a vanilla fusion user that they'd have to pay for would be included with the collections version. so essentially, what you see is a kind of an asp-neutral conversion from inventor to fusion. but that's going to take a long time. most of the inventor customers are going to stay comfortably where they are.
but when they do move, it's essentially asp-neutral in terms of impact on our arr. it doesn't change the arr trajectory. 
sterling auty -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
excellent. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of jason celino from keybanc capital. your line is now open.
jason celino -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions. maybe one, the ambitions in infrastructure. andrew, you talked about the gains in roads and bridges with improvements to civil 3d and expansions in the water here.
but how do you think about some of those other areas of infrastructure, maybe some like -- with some of the electric utilities or other areas?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. so right now, jason, we're going to stay focused on road and rail and bridges and the things that go along with road and rail and water. that's going to be our focus area. there's a lot of exciting things happening with elastic grid designs and the electrification and things associated with that.
we're not going to be focusing on that right now. we may in the future. but right now, if you look at -- even if you look at where the infrastructure bill is going, for instance, most of it is going to the upgrading and expanding the deteriorating infrastructure we have in the company around road, rail, bridges, civil and water infrastructure. and that's going to be our sweet spot for the fulfillment wins in that respect.
jason celino -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
and then, you know, you also talked about the -- why autodesk wins in construction, which was quite helpful. you also alluded to the digitization opportunity there just being more broadly bigger. maybe can you talk about how much of that tam might be coming from pure greenfield versus displacements of legacy or in-house or other competitor tools? thank you.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. a lot of the tam is greenfield. you know, really sometimes what you're competing with here is some kind of free tool and excel spreadsheet or a lack of any digital process whatsoever beyond email and pdfs, right? so i -- there's a lot of greenfield opportunity here in addition to kind of just flipping existing customers off of legacy systems or consolidating their systems. so this -- there is a very robust long tail of growth here that's going to go on for years.
that's why it's so exciting to see all the activity in this space because it's going to take a village to digitize this entire market. and we're at the very, very early stages of this, which is great.
jason celino -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. appreciate the color. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of gal munda from berenberg. your line is now open.
gal munda -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
hi, andrew. hi, debbie and the team. thanks for taking my questions. the first one, andrew, maybe just a little bit on construction.
your construction portfolio has really expanded and it's very, very strong now. i'm just wondering how should we think about the individual brands that you acquired between, you know, plangrid, assemble, buildingconnected, pipe on one side, and then autodesk construction cloud on the other side in terms of user adoption. and do you see users that came in for individual brands now starting to kind of move toward the platform approach as well?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. it's an excellent question, gal. so as you know, gal, autodesk build, and the construction cloud, in general, is the unification of all those brands and it's where we lead with new customers. absolutely.
you know, when we're going out there chasing new businesses, autodesk build, it's all the capabilities that are built into autodesk build. it's autodesk takeoff. it's all of those tools associated with the construction cloud. and that's where we lead.
but we're also seeing people migrate off of the individual brands and move forward, right? so we're seeing the same kind of thing happening incrementally. but that's not -- we're going to let those people move at their own pace. right? so when they're choosing to move on to the consolidated cloud, they're doing that by choice and as part of a process. over time, we will ultimately migrate all of them to construction cloud and autodesk build.
but right now, we're leading with our new customers with autodesk build and helping customers consolidate on the autodesk build when they want to bring some of those old brands along with them. but all the best technology from all those brands is in the construction cloud now.
gal munda -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
understood. thank you. and maybe, debbie, just another question for you. i completely understand that q1 is the smallest quarter in terms of new business generation and in terms of the renewals as well.
so what i wanted to touch, though, is it might not have been a good time to kind of organically think about raising the guidance for the year so early in the year. i'd like to just kind of take a step back and think about what happened during q1 and what you're seeing so far in q2. if that kind of level of trading and recovery continues, is it fair to say that you feel pretty confident about your full-year guidance then?
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
i mean, we issued the guidance today that we feel comfortable with. and i would say that we certainly have a strong sense of optimism based on the results that we had in q1. but it's just too early for us to change the underlying view on the year after only one quarter, but we're off to a good start.
gal munda -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
gotcha. thank you.
operator
thank you. that is all the time we have for q&a today. i would like to turn the call back over to simon mays-smith for closing remarks.
simon mays-smith -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, everyone, for joining us. i look forward to chatting to you next quarter, updating you on our performance. if you have any questions in the meantime, please just pm me directly, happy to answer your questions. thanks very much.

and now i will turn the call over to andrew. 
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you, simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. i hope you and your families remain safe and healthy. now while parts of the world emerge from the pandemic, others are entering the eye of the storm. i especially want to acknowledge our colleagues, family, and friends in india.
we are thinking about you, and we are helping wherever we can. thank you to all our employees and their families, our partners, and customers for their continued resilience, patience, and commitment. our first quarter marks an important inflection point. while solid execution, a resilient subscription business model, and continued secular shift to the cloud underpinned our strong first-quarter results, weighing uncertainty and growing confidence in our end markets generated momentum.
robust growth in new product subscriptions, combined with improving usage and renewal rates, accelerated billings and rpo growth to 10% and 22%, respectively. together, these reinforce our confidence that we are through the revenue growth trough and on track to achieve our fiscal '22 and '23 goals. in mid-may, we completed the acquisition of upchain, a cloud-native product data and life cycle management solution. combined with existing autodesk offerings like fusion 360, upchain will profoundly simplify data sharing and collaboration for engineers, manufacturers, suppliers, and other product stakeholders, enabling customers to bring products to market faster and build a stronger supply chain.
its next-generation platform enables it to be rapidly deployed, scaled, maintained, and updated without the expensive inflexible, and time-consuming integrations of legacy systems. we will grow upchain through our enterprise and channel partnerships and expect it to become a meaningful on-ramp for legacy design tools to the fusion 360 cloud ecosystem and facilitate further expansion into adjacent verticals. as we highlighted in our recently published impact report, the convergence of design and make brings both greater efficiency and sustainability to buildings in a broad range of manufactured goods, stretching from evs and bicycles to high-performance skis and low-cost ventilators. while we are enabling customers to achieve their sustainability targets, we continue to lead by example, reaching our carbon-neutral goal across our business and value chain in fiscal '21.
the report also sets out new diversity, equity, and inclusion goals. and while i'm proud that 50% of autodesk board and 45% of our executive team are women, we can and will do more both internally and through partnerships with organizations like iff labs externally. as we recently announced, pascal di fronzo, autodesk's executive vice president of corporate affairs and chief legal officer, will be retiring in december after 23 very successful years at the company. he has been a trusted counselor and steward of the company.
his contributions to autodesk are many and have been incredibly impactful, and i want to thank him for his dedication and wish him all the best in retirement. i am very excited to welcome debbie back to autodesk, and will now turn the call over to her to take you through the details of our quarterly results and guidance for the year. i will then come back to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives.
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
thanks, andrew. i'm very excited to be back. looking at the first quarter's results, several factors contributed to our strong financial performance, including robust growth in new product subscriptions, accelerating digital sales, stronger-than-expected upfront revenue, and improving subscription renewal rates. in addition, a one-month contribution from innovyze and foreign exchange rates provided a modest tailwind to the quarter.
total revenue in the quarter grew 12% and 11% in constant currency, with subscription revenue growing by 18%. looking at revenue by product and geography, autocad and autocad lt revenue grew by 9%. aec revenue grew 16% and manufacturing revenue grew 8%. excluding the impact of moving our bulk product to ratable revenue recognition, which we discussed last quarter, manufacturing revenue grew double digits.
m&e revenue grew 5%. across the globe, revenue grew 8% in the americas, 11% in emea, and 20% in apac. direct revenue increased 25% and represented 33% of our total revenue, up from 30% last year due to strength from both enterprise and e-commerce. our e-commerce sites had their highest new billings growth rate in two years, driven by strong traffic growth and recent site enhancements.
reflecting the business-critical nature of our products to our customers, our net revenue retention rate remained within the 100% to 110% range, and our product subscription renewal rates strengthened. our billings accelerated 10% to $974 million. total deferred revenue grew 11% to $3.35 billion. short-term deferred revenue increased 17%, primarily reflecting growth in new product subscriptions and increasing renewal rates, but also the inclusion of innovyze.
this was partly offset by a smaller contribution from long-term deferred revenue, resulting from fewer multiyear contracts when compared to last year. total rpo of $4.23 billion and current rpo of $2.86 billion both grew 22%. current rpo growth was primarily driven by the increase in short-term deferred revenue, but also by strong growth in enterprise business agreements and, to a lesser extent, early renewals ahead of anticipated price increases. excluding the contribution from early renewals and innovyze, current rpo grew approximately 20%.
non-gaap gross margin and operating margin remained strong at 92% and 28%, respectively, broadly level year over year and reflecting the trough in revenue growth relative to cost growth. we delivered healthy free cash flow of $316 million during the quarter, driven by collections of prior-quarter billings and strong results in the current quarter. consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we continued to repurchase shares with excess cash to offset dilution from our equity plans. during the first quarter, we purchased 515,000 shares for $143 million at an average price of approximately $277 per share.
now i'll shift to giving you my initial thoughts as cfo and then finish with our outlook. since i rejoined autodesk about two months ago, i've been focused on two things: first, reacquainting myself with everything autodesk, the team, our strategy, and how we've evolved during my two years away; and second, i've been digging deep to gain a solid understanding of our fiscal '22 budget and fiscal '23 financial goals. on the first point, while much at autodesk is familiar to me, i've been pleasantly surprised by how much has changed for the better, reflecting the enormous progress autodesk has made over the last two years. autodesk has undergone a cultural revolution.
there's been a powerful shift in the company's values and ways we work, and the pace of decision-making has accelerated. as a company, we now benefit not only from the scale of our operation, but also from a newfound agility that is enabling our success in newer markets like construction and manufacturing in the cloud. i'm also struck by the compelling and expanding opportunities ahead of us. digital transformation is happening now, it is real, and we are well-positioned to capitalize on that trend in the industries we serve.
as i begin to turn my attention to our long-range financial plan, these initial learnings give me confidence in our growth potential in fiscal '24 and beyond. let me finish with our guidance, which now includes innovyze and upchain. we still expect that an improving economic environment during the year will result in strong growth in new business over the course of fiscal '22. we expect product subscription renewal rates to continue to be healthy and our net revenue retention rate to remain between 100% and 110%.
given our subscription model, revenue growth will lag the improving sales environment. we continue to expect about three quarters of our free cash flow to again be generated in the second half of the year due to our economic phasing assumptions and normal seasonality. for fiscal '22, we are raising our full-year revenue guidance to a range of $4.305 billion to $4.385 billion or a 14% to 16% increase over last year, reflecting a partial year contribution from acquisitions, net of the deferred revenue writedowns. given our results are weighted in the second half and q1 is our seasonally smallest quarter, it's obviously too early to change our view on the underlying trajectory of the year, but we're off to a good start.
we expect non-gaap operating margin to expand to between 30% and 31%, which includes approximately 1 percentage point of negative headwind from acquisitions. finally, we still expect free cash flow to be around $1.6 billion with a broadly neutral impact from acquisitions. the slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for the second fiscal quarter and full-year '22. with improving economic conditions and easier comparables, we still expect our first-quarter revenue growth will be the trough.
our accelerating momentum in fiscal '22 will propel us into fiscal '23, and i am therefore confident in our fiscal '23 revenue growth potential and free cash flow target of $2.4 billion. as i begin to look beyond fiscal '23, the digital transformation of the industries we serve, our sustained investment in the cloud, and our flexible business model give us a robust platform for double-digit growth. andrew, back to you.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you, debbie. let me finish by giving you an update on our strategic growth initiatives. the secular trends we have been investing in for years have accelerated during the pandemic: the digitization of aec, the convergence of design and make and our expansion into adjacent verticals through organic investment and acquisitions are growing our total addressable market. the evolution of our business model, the value generated by the growing connectivity of our platform for new and legacy customers, and the hardening of our systems to noncompliant users enables us to attract, retain more of that potential opportunity, growing our ecosystem and the usage and value we generate from it.
turning to aec. our unique vision is to connect all the phases of construction with end-to-end cloud-based solutions that combine horizontal data flow with best-in-class functionality to enable seamless collaboration from planning, design, preconstruction, construction, asset operations, and maintenance. the breadth and depth of our solutions distinguish us in the market, and we continue to build on that advantage to industry-leading r&d, which we sustain through the pandemic and acquisitions. our latest product releases reflect that.
for example, revit 2022 is a bridge to more open and interoperable ways of working that accelerate our design customers' digital transformation and improve communication design intent across all disciplines and project phases. for construction teams, we released autodesk build, autodesk takeoff, and autodesk bim collaborate, as well as product enhancements, which further empower construction teams to drive better business outcomes such as winning more business, reducing rework, delivering projects on time, and improving safety by connecting data, workflows and teams across the project life cycle. as the construction backlog comes back online and the new project pipeline builds, we are emerging from the pandemic stronger. this is reflected in our success during the quarter.
for example, burns & mcdonnell is a family of companies bringing together an unmatched team of 7,600 engineers, construction professionals, architects, planners, technologists, and scientists to design and build critical infrastructure projects. it is at the forefront of technology use and having invested in revit and bim 360 design some time ago, most of its data is already in the cloud. monthly active users, or maus, on autodesk software have grown by 80% since 2018. this quarter, burns & mcdonnell renewed its autodesk eba and increased its investment with us, adding more cloud-based products from the autodesk construction portfolio, including autodesk build, pipe, assemble, and buildingconnected.
our unified common data platform enables it to move and collaborate seamlessly from design through construction and to implementation with common workflows across multiple global practices. 1898 & co., part of burns & mcdonnell, is its future-focused consulting and technology solutions division, and it is a founding participant in our tandem digital twin programs. the vault company is a $1 billion professional construction services firm in the u.s., focusing on integrated delivery of complex vertical construction projects that require extremely tight collaboration between stakeholders and integrated workflows between industry partners, the office, and seals. vault was already relying on bim collaborate pro and plangrid when, this quarter, it selected autodesk build over a directly competitive construction project management solution and also invested in pipe.
autodesk construction cloud's unified platform connects previously siloed data, reduces rework, and saves time for vault across the company, enabling teams to easily manage projects from planning and design through to the field and handover. and multigreen, a real estate development and operating company specializing in sustainable and tech-enabled multifamily housing in high-growth and supply constrained markets, standardized on autodesk construction cloud. in order to build more efficiently and sustainably, they knew they had to standardize on a single platform to connect their teams from concept and design through project completion and day-to-day operations. in addition to revit, inventor, buildingconnected, autodesk takeoff, and autodesk build, they will be using bim 360's integration with the embodied carbon calculator to analyze material carbon emissions with all their data connected through our common data environment.
in infrastructure, we released civil 3d, infraworks, and autocad map 3d and autocad plant 3d, and recap pro with enhancements in transportation, water, plant, land development, and reality capture. most importantly, we continue to mature our project delivery platform across design and construction to better support digital project execution that helps our customers increase operational efficiencies, make better design decisions, increase quality and reduce cost and material waste. during the quarter, we received notice of an award and design from the montana department of transportation. instead of a competitor offering, they will be using our aec collection, which includes civil 3d, revit, infraworks, navisworks recap, and our common data environment, autodesk docs.
the department was particularly impressed by connected bridge design workflows between revit and infraworks that drive efficiency and sustainability. turning to manufacturing. we have made significant organic investments in addition to upchain. inventor 2022 introduced new features and enhancements to speed up product development and interoperability with autocad, fusion 360, and revit.
in fusion 360, we have introduced new functionality across the entire product development process and numerous integrated extensions that unlock advanced design and manufacturing technologies. in vault, we introduced a new mobile application and web browser experience for engineers and non-cad users to access their real-time data anywhere and on any device. the potential to converge design and make in the cloud is becoming more of a reality every day to our customer. autodesk continues to lead that transition.
aec technologies, the world's leading solutions provider for smart devices, grew its investment with autodesk. having struggled with data management and data integrations in their product life cycle management using a competitor's 3d modeling product, aec technologies switched to our product design and manufacturing collection with vault to manage all their data. they found our connected workflows particularly attractive and believe they will improve productivity and collaboration across their teams and enable them to go to market more effectively by increasing flexibility in their supply chain. for data management, our customers can now choose vault for on-prem and upchain as they transition to the cloud.
with the largest number of new commercial users in 2020, fusion 360's strong momentum continued, growing commercial subscriptions to 152,000 without any systematic cost promotions. while still early in its life cycle, we believe fusion 360 has reached an adoption tipping point. and with extensions and upchain, we are excited about its future. during the quarter, a u.k.-based design, manufacturing, and installer of architectural precast design invested in fusion 360 in its nesting and fabrication extension.
by converting the design and manufacturing process into a single unified experience in the cloud, fusion 360 enables faster design, prototyping, and go-to-market. by creating optimized and associative multi-sheet layouts for sheet metal and non-sheet metal parts in preparation for cutting on cnc machines, our nesting and fabrication extension helps them to significantly reduce waste. last month, three students from danville community college in virginia won the inaugural project mfg national championship, an advanced manufacturing competition sponsored by the u.s. department of defense.
jeremiah williams, director for integrated machining technology at danville community college said that, ""by testing a variety of advanced skills like welding and multiaccess machining, as well as communication and teamwork, the project mfg national championship is one of the most challenging skilled trade competitions in the country. fusion 360's next-generation platform enabled our team to complete all required and optional objectives from prototype through to welding and machining the finished product and to win this prestigious prize."" as announced last quarter, we expanded our multiuser trade-in to august 2023, but we are still seeing customers convert and benefit from kind of transition to named users. ssp, one of the leading integrated design offices in germany, traded in their multiuser licenses with us this quarter and significantly increased their investment by purchasing additional aec collections and premium subscriptions, in the process, may completely replace the competitive design solution, standardizing their workflow on our cloud platform. the premium plan is especially valuable to them as they improve their site-to-site management using single sign-on, which enables more digital collaboration and efficiency while increasing employee satisfaction.
while we continue to be sensitive as the economy recovers, we are successfully converting noncompliant users to paying customers with q1 license compliance billings almost doubling year over year during the quarter. for example, a noncompliant client customer converted into one of our largest premium customers to date. over 500 branches in indonesia made it difficult to track and manage software usage, and this customer was inadvertently using more licenses than it was paying for. after completing a self-audit, which confirmed the software gap, it purchased premium to help manage the complex rollout of compliant licenses.
they are now a happy premium customer with detailed usage insights and the ability to flexibly manage their licenses from headquarters across their entire branch network. now let me finish with a story. construction began on notre dame cathedral in 1163, but was not completed for more than 100 years. in a 12th century version of lightweighting, notre dame was the first gothic structure to use flying buttresses, which are slanted beams that support the heavy walls and ceilings that enable giant rose glass and stained-glass windows in large edifices with open-air spaces beneath them.
following a catastrophic fire in 2019, the cathedral is being rebuilt with traditional and sustainable materials enhanced by next-generation building information modeling provided by autodesk. combining traditional design and build know-how with modern workflow solutions, reconstruction is expected to be completed in 2024 in time to welcome athletes at the summer olympics in paris and future generations from across the globe. i share this because as the world rebuilds after the catastrophic impact of the pandemic, i am reminded again that autodesk's purpose to enable its customers to build and manufacture efficiently and sustainably has never been more important or urgent. together, we can meet the generational challenges posed by carbon, water, and waste.
autodesk's central role in meeting these challenges underpins my confidence this year and my confidence in the future. with that, operator, we would like to open the call up for questions.
",2022-Q1,ADSK
0.9999,0.9995,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of saket kalia of barclays. your line is open.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
ok, great. hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions here. debbie, maybe we'll just start with you, just given some of the moving parts.
i'd love to zoom in on the fy '22 guidance a bit. you touched on this a little bit in your prepared remarks, but can you just talk about what drove the change to guide in billings and free cash flow specifically? you know, you talked about supply chain and fx, i was wondering if you could just go one level deeper, just help us parse that out a little bit. does that make sense? 
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
it does. and i think we'll start with andrew here. 
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. let me start and then debbie and i will kind of tag team here on some of this. so first off, saket, let's make sure we all kind of level set on the business is strong. you saw the numbers.
we're seeing tremendous growth. we're seeing record renewal rates. we're approaching net revenue retention rates at the high end of our guide, and they're continuing to go up, right? that's super, super important here, and we feel pretty good about where the business is going. so the business is strong, and we're seeing a lot of strength there.
if you look at what we're talking about here, we saw several things happened during the quarter, and we got this reinforced by our customers and by our channel partners. we saw a deceleration in what we were seeing around monthly active usage and all things associated with that. and that then translated into to us kind of looking at our guide and looking at things going forward, and we pragmatically just assumed at this point that what we saw in the quarter is going to continue into q4. and that's what you're seeing, a pragmatic assessment that, hey, this kind of supply chain pressure, this inflationary pressure that's kind of squeezing the margins with some of our customers is going to continue into q4.
if we look forward in terms of the guide, in terms of what's going on into next year, look, we assume two things. one, this interesting fx environment we're in, which i want debbie to kind of comment on again and kind of reinforce some of the things she said in the opening commentary, presents some potential risk. so we want to flag those risks. in addition, if some of these supply chain issues bleed over into the beginning of next year, we wanted to flag some additional risk there, but there's certainly a large currency headwind that we're seeing.
and i'd like debbie to just kind of reiterate some of the things she said in the opening commentary so we can all get on the same page about that. 
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
yeah. but let me go back to the fiscal '22 guide first because i think one of the metrics that i talked about in the opening commentary pretty much says it all. and that is that for our new volume growth, we saw a 30% growth for the first half of fiscal '22, and then in q3, it was in the mid-20s. so it was still very strong growth.
it just fell short of our expectations. as we look ahead, we did highlight the potential risks that we see to fiscal '23 free cash flow. and it's true that fx, based on what we know today, is a big factor. it's been highly volatile.
the rate moves that we saw in the first half of the year created about $55 million in potential headwind to fiscal '23 cash flow. and since then and, in the last 90 days alone, further rate moves created about another $45 million in potential headwind to cash flow. so as you can imagine, we're obviously watching fx rates closely. but it's clear that if the current rates persist through next year, that risk could materialize in free cash flow.
our goal today was just to highlight the risk as we look ahead to next year. but it's important to remind that overall, the strategy is working, and we have numerous growth levers to capitalize on over the long term. 
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
we still see pass -- constant currency pass to $2.4 billion next year, but we want to flag this risk because we think that's a prudent thing to do at this time, given what we're seeing today right now. not a guide. it's a risk flag. 
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
understood. and i think that is prudent. andrew, maybe just for the follow-up for you. you know, just to maybe zoom out from the numbers and some of the moving parts as we start to think about next year and the years after.
you know, one of the things that i'd love to just get your view on is now that we have an infrastructure bill in the u.s., can you just talk about a couple of the components that you feel could be particularly helpful for autodesk's business, and maybe when you think we start to see some of the benefits in your customer base? 
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. so first off, let's be very clear. we don't have any infrastructure uplift built in any of our guidance or anything that we're talking about right now, ok? these things play out over multiple years. this is a great bill.
we're really happy to see it. included in the bill is a $100 million fund to accelerate investment in digital tools for department of transportation. we feel that that's a good thing and it's an important part of this bill from our perspective because it's going to change the ecosystem. but these things play out over a long term.
we're certainly really happy about the fact that we have invested in water ahead of these critical investments in infrastructure because water is going to matter a lot. clean water, water management in terms of flooding or storage of water, wastewater processing, all these things, water is going to be a big deal. so we're going to see our engagement in water projects probably increase over the next couple of years. but i want to make sure that we're all clear that we don't build these into our numbers right now, and we want to -- we're going to wait and see how these things play out over the next couple of years, but we will absolutely see some of our investments in road, rail and water pay off over a multiyear period here.
and we're pretty excited about it. this bill was a long time coming. and i think the emphasis on digital transformation inside the infrastructure industry is going to be an important catalyst to modernizing and expanding what's happening in our infrastructure and growth in the united states.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
very helpful. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from adam borg of stifel. your line is open.
adam borg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hey, guys, thanks so much for taking the question. andrew, i'd love to kind of just go maybe another step deeper on what saket was talking about encino. you know, for much of the year, we've talked about this unwinding of uncertainty, and we talked about several factors today of where it sounds like certainty has -- uncertainty has kind of gone higher again. could you just talk maybe a little bit more about like an example or two of how supply chain issues or even pricing is impacting -- or inflation is having a direct impact on the ability to close deals? just kind of help give an example like what's happening from that, that would be really great.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. yeah, adam, it was an excellent question. so, let's look kind of like back up to three months ago, and set some of the context, too, so that we kind of get a sense for this. so three months ago, we were heading into the quarter seeing strong renewal rates, projecting strong renewal rates heading in, we saw those strong renewal rates.
we're at record renewal rates. we're continuing to see those things. we also saw monthly active usage increasing robustly heading into the quarter. as the quarter progressed, that increase in monthly active usage decelerated a little bit.
it continued to grow. it's just the second derivative kind of went negative on us, and it didn't continue to accelerate at the pace we expected to see. so what's driving that? for a lot of our customers, the book of business they're seeing is robust. they have more demand than they're actually able to fulfill on right now.
and you can see it in all the indices and all the indicators. what you also saw during the quarter, these supply chain backlogs and these inflationary pressures peaked in the quarter and continued persistently throughout the quarter. so while they have this big book of business, or they have existing ongoing projects, if you're on the aec side and say you're on a fixed bid contract, you're going to see margin pressure because your cost of goods to deliver the projects that you're working on is going up, as is your cost of labor and actually your labor pool is tight and constrained. so, you're seeing all these factors increase -- pinching your margins, and it's affecting your buying behavior at some times.
so even in this environment, where we saw all of these forces, including the labor shortages and things associated with that, we actually continued to grow robustly, just not where we expected to. now if you're on the manufacturing side, which you noticed we did very well especially relative to our competitors. even there, they're not able to fulfill on all of the demand they have heading into their businesses. so they're not collecting cash as fast because they're not shipping the products that they're getting ordered from their customers.
so all of these things are playing out. it didn't stop people from buying technology, but it certainly slowed down some of the activity relative to our expectations around people buying and investing in their technology portfolio. does that make sense?
adam borg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yeah, that was really helpful. and maybe just as a quick follow-up. obviously, you know, at analyst day, we talked about some changes around billing terms, and you referenced it a little bit earlier in the call. just curious how kind of early receptivity has been with customers as you kind of explain to them to changes that are coming? thanks, again.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. so look, our moves with regards to changing billing terms and smoothing out our free cash flow trajectory over multiple years are unchanged by any of this. we believe those are right for the business. we believe it's right for our customers.
customers are generally positive around these things because they prefer annual billings for -- in most cases, they don't want to have to pay upfront if they don't have to. also, you know, a lot of these things we've been talking about with regards to supply chain pressures, our viewed as pretty transient by us. you know, these are not going to be persistent types of things. so customers view these fairly well.
our partners are getting themselves around some of these activities right now. but those plans are completely unchanged relative to anything we're seeing right now, and it's all full steam ahead on that transition. 
adam borg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thanks again for the color. i appreciate it.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you, adam.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jay vleeschhouwer of griffin securities. please go ahead.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
thank you. good evening. andrew, let me start with the circumstantial question. and that is, are there any operational changes that you foresee having to make? you just said that the circumstances are perhaps transitory.
but in terms of, let's say, what you call your early warning system, your usage telemetry, anything along those lines that you feel needs to be updated, modified, amended in some way to at least take account of the current circumstances. and then the points you made with regard to customers having a robust pipeline themselves, do you expect to be able to recoup at some point or over time the delta in the billings guidance that you've given now for fiscal '22. do you think that amount of billings can come back to autodesk? then a follow-up for you.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. so, first off, let me comment on the tracking. so we believe our tracking is good because it actually showed us the outcome as the quarter progressed. we saw the mean over the growth in monthly active usage and the associated impact there.
so it wasn't lifting the way we expected it to in the second half. in fact, like i said, the second derivative changed and lean over a little bit. so these predictors, these tracking mechanisms we have, i think are still valid. they're powerful.
they actually gave us indications of things that were going on. i think we're also, frankly, tracking the inflationary environment a bit more right now, trying to make sure what's happening with the goods and labor pool that our customers are engaging with. we're going to be paying attention to that. there's hopeful signs out there, that some of this is loosening up in some respects, but, you know, we're going to be watching that.
now with regards with some of the business coming back, it is absolutely possible that that's the case. our customers are definitely looking at a backlog of projects and a backlog of orders and all the things associated with that. i think it's prudent at this point for us to kind of -- with the information we have right now, assume that we're just going to see kind of an ongoing kind of impact from these things until something changes. but it is possible that some of this could come back as a result of releasing pressure.
but it's not. i don't think it's prudent right now to declare that. i think we should watch this because, you know, we were all kind of surprised by the pace at which these supply chain pressures put pressure on our customers. 
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
right. understood. now for the longer term, looking past these circumstances, i'd like to ask you about something you said in your remarks at au last month. you said, ""autodesk will fundamentally shift how the company delivers value."" and my question for that is, was that another way simply of referring to subscriptions and consumption at flex? or were you referring to something else besides just the licensing model in terms of how you're thinking about delivering that fundamental value over time? 
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. actually, jay, that statement was not related to the business models. while the business models will help facilitate delivering some of that value, what we were really talking about was how the platform and the tools are going to become these co-designers with our customers. how we're going to be driving much more facilitated action with our customers through our products.
there's going to be a lot more real-time data visibility, real-time option visibility, real-time collaboration between the system and the designer or the engineer. that's the major value driver change that we're talking about. it's not the business model changes per se. those are enablers.
they allow us to get some of this capability more effectively to a broader set of customers, which we're actually pretty happy about. but it's that fundamental relationship with the product, this notion of co-designing with a computer and with a system that's really going to change the way we deliver value.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
understood. thank you very much.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from gal munda of berenberg. please go ahead.
gal munda -- berenberg bank -- analyst
hey. thank you for taking my questions. the first one, i'd just like to kind of focus on the reduced free cash flow outlook in '22 and then how that potentially translates in '23. the way i read your -- or listened to your remarks was that fy '23 risk, not the change in outlook, so the risk is kind of all to do with the fx rates rather than the impact that you're seeing on the lower billings for fy '22.
is that correct to understand it that way? or do you think there is a carry-on momentum from lower billings of fy '22 based on supply chain shortage and all that stuff into free cash flow for '23?
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, gal, the answer is, it's a bit of a --
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
[inaudible]
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
it's a bit of a mix. go ahead, andrew. ok. the answer is that it's a bit of a mix.
so the way to think about it, i highlighted risk of approximately $100 million to $200 million based on what we know today. and part of it relates to the subscription basis of our business model. so given that billings are falling short of our expectations for this year, we're flowing through that risk into the free cash flow that we're talking about next year. and the other part of it is fx.
so it's roughly half and half. 
gal munda -- berenberg bank -- analyst
that's really helpful and very clear. thank you. and then i just want to really focus on the different drivers of that kind of changed outlook, especially for this year. you know, the long-term deferred revenues of a portion of total deferred revenue falling kind of just below that mid- whatever we say, mid-20s in terms of like, let's say, 23% is kind of toward the lower end of that.
is that something you'd expect in q4 to kind of pick up toward the 25%? or do you think that the acceleration of the transition away from multiyear billings is also something that is really driving the outlook for the billings itself because the revenue numbers seem to be strong? 
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
yeah. so the way that we think about deferred revenue and the long-term contribution to deferred revenue being in roughly that mid-20s is not going to change. so what we're seeing here is an impact from macro on our billings outlook for this year that we're then highlighting risk as we get into next year. but the proportion of our business from multiyear contracts billed up front for this year and into next year is in line with our expectations.
we've been monitoring the multiyear cohort this year. and even in q3, it was quite strong. and so that's not something that's changing. and so the follow-on impact of deferred revenue is that that wouldn't change as well.
we still would see roughly 20% being that long-term deferred revenue. 
gal munda -- berenberg bank -- analyst
ok. so it doesn't -- so the multiyear billings contribution change didn't have any impact on the billings outlook change that you have? 
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
yes, that's correct. yes.
gal munda -- berenberg bank -- analyst
ok, perfect. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from matt hedberg of rbc capital markets. your question, please.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yeah, thanks for taking my questions. debbie, maybe just a clarification for you. i think you noted in your script that you believe the fiscal '20 to fiscal '23 revenue cagr will be at the lower end of the 16% to 18% guide. if i do some quick math, does that imply fiscal '23 revenue will grow about 17% per your comment? 
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
well, you are interpreting correctly that i said that if the risk materializes that we're seeing today, in our numbers next year, we would be at the low end of the revenue cagr of 16% to 18% that we talked about at our investor day. and while we're not providing specific guidance on revenue for next year, directionally, your math computes. 
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. ok. and then maybe just one other. you know, i think we're all kind of looking at crpo as a helpful metric, kind of judge the business as well, you know? and i know you don't guide to crpo, but any sort of commentary on how that might trend into 4q. 
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
yeah. so let's start with q3. the crpo growth decelerated mainly because of declining contribution from multiyear eba deals that closed in fiscal '20 which are entering the final year of their term. that growth deceleration was in line with our expectations, and it's something that we signaled on our last earnings call.
we anticipate over time that the growth rates for crpo and revenue will gradually converge over time. but also that, that rpo growth rate is going to continue to be influenced by the timing and volume of ebas. and so given that q4 is a big eba quarter for us, that's going to have a big impact on the growth rate next quarter.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. thanks very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from phil winslow of credit suisse. please go ahead.
phil winslow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, yeah. thanks for taking my question. andrew, i just wanted to dig in a little bit on where you're seeing those changes in the second derivative, particularly in the aec side of the house. one of the things you talk about a lot is that autodesk has solutions in different parts of the life cycle in the aec world planning, actually putting the nail in the wood, et cetera.
when you look at those second derivatives, where do you see that in the life cycle? and how are you thinking about that in q4? 
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
so, again, i want to make sure that we're clear on some of these things. the business was very strong. and that second derivative was a slowing down of the acceleration that we were expecting to see coming into the second half of the year. so it's a slowing down, it's not a decline.
i just want to be super clear on that so that we can get all positioned on that. now in terms of where we think this is going to head out, we continue to think that these monthly active usage rates are going to continue to grow and that we're going to continue to see increases associated with these things. we're just prudently assuming that what we saw in q3 continues into q4 because based on what we wanted to see was like this uplift in monthly active usage at a higher rate than what we saw, it's probably a safe bet to just assume this is going to coast into q4. if something changes, if these pressures start to relieve and start to relax, we could absolutely see an improving environment.
but the business is strong. the renewal rates are strong, the underlying fundamentals of the business are strong. the net retention revenue rates are strong. the slowdown was rather broad brushed except for the country-specific issues that we highlighted in china.
so there was no one product area that saw a slowing. but i want you to note something pretty important here. look at the competitive position that we came out of this year, particularly in manufacturing and other places. we're growing much more robustly than any of our competition in the space.
it's just we have high expectations and we wanted to see some of those high expectations fulfilled. so that's how we view this right now, and that's how we're viewing it heading into the rest of the year. does that answer your question? or did you want to clarify something? 
phil winslow -- credit suisse -- analyst
no, no, that's helpful. thank you. and then also just help me by you drilling just in the markets by geography. i mean, obviously, we have the reported numbers, but anything you'd sort of call out within that whether it be by vertical, by geography, or how you're thinking about q4? and then i'll go back in the queue.
thanks.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
you know, the one thing i'll just highlight, say, we talked about the softness in china that was specifically in aec. we actually did well in manufacturing in china. so not -- the softness was not uniform in china across all of our businesses. but in general, what we saw was a kind of a broad-brushed impact.
so i couldn't point to onesie, twosies in any particular country that was kind of different or offset from anything else we were seeing. it was kind of a broader impact in kind of the slowing down of the acceleration that we saw. 
phil winslow -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. i'll go back in the queue.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from joe vruwink of baird. your question, please.
joe vruwink -- baird -- analyst
great. hi, everyone. i'm curious is the persona of customer that you think about as being kind of key to autodesk new business growth. is that customer more susceptible to some of the macro issues you're calling out? if i'm understanding all the detail right, the established base is growing nicely.
there is moderation on the incremental growth. so i suppose a question might be, are the risks of the latter starting to impact the former and starting to maybe trickle into the installed base at the same time. 
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
that's not what we're seeing. if that's what we were seeing the net revenue retention rate trend that we saw during the quarter would have been different. so i want to focus you back on. remember, we came in at the high end of our range on net revenue retention.
and what that does is it shows a strong -- a kind of a strong affinity and willingness to keep upping their game with regards to our products and offering. and that did not often, ok? if anything, that's continuing to strengthen. so that feels really good. so there's really -- it really was affecting the new book of business, which kind of bleeds into the long tail of our business at some point into some level, which is to be expected in environments like this.
those who are most cash flow constrained, tend to slow their buying down the most. so i don't see any bleed over potential. in fact, in a lot of our newer businesses, we saw robust growth associated with some of these things. so i do not see a crossover or a bleed over between these things.
in fact, we continue to expect continued strengthening of net revenue retention rates in the base. 
joe vruwink -- baird -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then on the supply chain topic. this was addressed at the investor day as maybe being a risk area, but also an opportunity perhaps for technology adoption.
even recently, it seems like engineering firms are acknowledging that hiring support, bigger backlogs might be tough, but technology, again, could be an opportunity. so i guess the question is, how do you think about the new seat contribution for your growth algorithm in the context of double digits being sustainable? would you expect a bigger contribution from the application and content side of the growth model and how to think about seats, given the current macro backdrop? 
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. so we absolutely think that we continue to see digitization tailwinds here. customers are absolutely turning to technology to wrestle with some of these problems and solve some of these things. and if you look at the strategy around double-digit growth and where we're going, you see a lot of things working.
first off, let's just pause and -- i don't want to say this too many times, but the business is doing strong and that's setting a floor on some of our growth. also, i wanted you to notice some of the things that happened with noncompliant revenue. we grew 50% year over year, reflecting the compare to kind of the slowdown we did in the covid year -- in the 2020 and around the pandemic, and we normalized the kind of like a 20-year -- 20% growth over the two-year period, which shows nice steady growth in some of these things. so if you look at the business, you see a lot of things working really well.
now if you look at the long-term trends that are going to contribute and be additive in terms of driving the double-digit growth, the digitization is there, the tailwinds continue, customers are telling us more and more, they want to go deeper, deeper, deeper in digitization. and we're seeing strong adoption -- like for instance in construction with our largest eba customers and some of our largest gcs, we're seeing strong adoption of construction cloud or integrating construction cloud more deeply into some of these relationships. if you look at some of the incremental drivers, we were talking about with regards to business model capabilities and some of the things associated we're continuing to see strong growth there in terms of new types of subscription models, noncompliant users. and then when we talk about the long tail.
while it's really early days with the flex model, and i want to make sure that we always say it's early days with the flex model. one of the things we're seeing with flex is exactly what we expected to see. we're seeing a large percent of flex business coming in is net new. another chunk of flex business coming in is these occasional usage buyers.
people that classically bought network licenses previously. and another chunk of business where people trying and using more advanced products, products they weren't going to use previously. those trends are exactly the kind of trends we want to see with offerings like this. and as time goes on and we get more experience with flex, we expect those trends to continue.
so all of the things that we're pursuing to drive double-digit growth are working right now. and that's what gives us confidence as we move forward into the fy '23, '24 and '25 and beyond, is that everything we're doing right now is working. if something was showing softness or not working, then i wouldn't have the confidence i have right now, but everything is working in terms of the things we're pursuing. is transient impacts that we're seeing right now, they're obvious, they're systemic.
everybody is seeing them. you can measure them systematically in terms of what's going on out there. these will pass. the question is when will they pass.
joe vruwink -- baird -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from sterling auty of jpmorgan. your question, please.
sterling auty -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
yeah, thanks. hi, guys. andrew, if you put yourself in the seat of the investor, we're all seeing the headlines of the supply chain constraints, et cetera. but what if you were an investor, would you be looking at to help us monitor to possibly get a handle on when some of these pressures are alleviating and your business is starting to inflect upward again. 
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. ok. so you're asking me to kind of be the predictor of when some of these supply chain pressures are going to unwind. look, i'll tell you what, we --
sterling auty -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
no, i'm not asking for a time. i'm asking for what are some of the data points that would signal that it's getting better time. 
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. ok. so look, one of the data points we look at is the cost of freight. so for instance, people are just -- the cost of freight has been going up and up and up as you've been seeing this capacity compaction with regards to moving things.
so that's one metric you just sit there and look at and say, hey. if the cost of freight goes down, that's a sign that flow-through and throughput is starting to soften up. that's one thing that's out there. another thing is some of the costs of the core commodities that our customers use, i mean, let's face it, wood.
i mean, i know that sounds true, but the cost of wood in some of our aec, it's a big deal. if you -- if your cost of wood or wood-based materials goes up 20%, 30%, 40% on a fixed bid contract, what is that doing to your ability to execute? so you look at cost of freight, you look at cost of wood and the things associated with that and those have direct impact. the cost of any commodity going into manufacturing is going to have impacts. so the last thing that i think is really interesting with regards to manufacturing is some of these chip shipments starting to loosen up and allowing people to kind of finish their machines and make sure all the electronics are actually assembled and together.
so these are some of the things that all of us can look at to see how things are going. the cost of freight being right up there, the cost of wood and commodities associated with building things being out in front. we're going to continue to look at the monthly active usage because for us, that's a predictor of people doing more with the products, and that will probably follow some of these other indicators changing. does that make sense, sterling? 
sterling auty -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst

and now i will turn the call over to andrew. 
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you, simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. our third quarter results were strong driven by one of our best ever quarters for new subscriptions, record subscription renewal rates, a net revenue retention rate toward the high end of our range and a solid competitive performance. we also grew rpo and billings 18% and 16%, respectively, despite a tougher compare versus last year. relative to the first and second quarters, the rate of improvement decelerated during the third quarter more than we expected.
while demand is robust, we believe supply chain disruption and resulting inflationary pressures, a global labor shortage, making it harder for our customers to staff new projects and the ebb and flow of covid are contributing to the deceleration, as well as documented country-specific disruption to aec in china. our conversation with customers and channel partners reinforces our view. we're encouraged that embracing digital transformation to drive efficiency and sustainability remains a priority for our customers. our end-to-end solutions, business model flexibility and platform position us well competitively and enable more customers to enter and remain in our ecosystem.
as you heard at our recent investor day at autodesk university, we are rapidly innovating and optimizing our business to increase and realize the opportunity ahead. notable milestones during the quarter included the launch of our flex consumption model and our plans to combine technologies, connect processes, automate workflows, and unlock valuable insights for customers through our forge platform. the recent report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change and the united nations climate change cop26 meeting in glasgow, both underscore the urgency of reducing carbon in earth's atmosphere and the role that everyone, including corporations needs to play. sustainability needs to be designed, made and, in many cases, retrofitted in construction and manufacturing.
this cannot be achieved efficiently or effectively without end-to-end software like ours to drive the process. this organizing principle affects not just how we deploy capital, for example, through our investments to develop sustainable tools and our recent acquisition of innovyze, but also how we source capital. many of our largest equity holders already aligned to our sustainability goals. in the third quarter, we began to align our debt holders by issuing our first sustainability bond linked to our sustainability goals.
now let me turn the call over to debbie to take you through the details of our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. i'll then come back to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives. 
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
thanks, andrew. as andrew said, our third quarter results were strong. several factors contributed to that, including robust growth in new product subscriptions, rapidly expanding digital sales and increasing subscription renewal rates. total revenue growth in the quarter accelerated to 18% and 17% in constant currency with subscription revenue growing by 21%.
looking at revenue by product, the growth we saw was broad-based. autocad and autocad lt revenue grew 14%. aec revenue grew 22% and manufacturing revenue grew 16%, m&e revenue grew 17%. across the globe, revenue grew 18% in the americas, 19% in emea, and 18% in apac.
direct revenue increased 34% and represented 35% of our total revenue, up from 31% last year due to strength from both enterprise and e-commerce. as you heard at our investor day, about three-quarters of new customers autodesk are now generated through our digital channels, reflecting the strength of our simplified buying experiences. our product subscription renewal rates reached record highs, and our net revenue retention rate was toward the high end of our 100% to 110% range. billings increased 16% to $1.2 billion, reflecting robust underlying demand and a tough comparison versus last year when we signed two of our largest ever ebas including a 9-digit deal.
total deferred revenue grew 14% to $3.3 billion. total rpo of $4.2 billion and current rpo of $2.9 billion grew 18% and 21%, respectively. turning to the p&l. non-gaap gross margin remained broadly level at 92%, while non-gaap operating margin increased by 2 percentage points to approximately 32%, reflecting strong revenue growth and ongoing cost discipline.
we delivered healthy free cash flow of $257 million during the quarter against a tough comparison from last year, which benefited from pandemic-related payment term extensions. consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we continue to repurchase shares to offset dilution from our equity plans. during the third quarter, we purchased 980,000 shares for $287 million at an average price of approximately $293 per share. year to date, we've repurchased 1.66 million shares at an average price of approximately $287 per share for total spend of $476 million.
looking forward, as andrew said, we're rapidly innovating and optimizing our business to realize the opportunities ahead. as we discussed last quarter, the shift of multiyear contracts to annual billings as we move into fiscal '24 will drive more predictable free cash flow and better price realization over time, which will make autodesk a more valuable company. this quarter, we took steps to optimize our capital structure by issuing our first sustainability bonds, which aligns our capital strategy with our sustainability goals, while also extending our debt maturity profile by almost two years and reducing our weighted average cost of debt by 40 basis points. as we enter q4, we intend to take steps to reduce our real estate footprint because the pandemic has spurred changes in the way we work, and we've moved to a hybrid workforce.
as a result, we anticipate we will reduce the square footage of our facilities portfolio by approximately 20% worldwide and that we will take a gaap-only charge of up to approximately $180 million. the bulk of which will be recognized over the next several months as we execute our plans. optimizing our facilities costs will allow us to better deploy capital to further our strategy and drive growth. now let me finish with guidance.
demand was robust in q3, and we expect it to remain so in q4. however, as andrew said, macroeconomic headwinds, such as supply chain disruption and resulting inflationary pressures, a global labor shortage, the ebb and flow of covid and aec in china are impacting the pace of our recovery. as an example, the growth in new product subscription volumes decelerated from approximately 30% in the first half to mid-20s percent in q3, which is more than normal seasonality and a tougher comparison versus last year would suggest. this dynamic drove strong billings growth in q3 that, nonetheless, fell short of our expectations.
in light of this macroeconomic uncertainty, as we enter q4, we're taking a pragmatic approach and are assuming that the supply chain, labor, covid and country-specific challenges will persist. as a result, we're reducing the midpoint of our billings and free cash flow guidance by approximately $150 million and $100 million, respectively, for full year fiscal '22. given the nature of our subscription business model and the greater degree of near-term visibility it provides to us and our expectation of continued strong spend discipline, the midpoint of our full year revenue and margin guidance is broadly unchanged. we continue to target $2.4 billion of free cash flow in fiscal '23 in constant currency because we believe the current macro headwinds, we're seeing are transient.
but if the growth deceleration and strengthened dollar continue through next year, we could see potential risk to that target of about $100 million to $200 million based on what we know today. fx volatility is a big factor. rate moves in the first half of the year created about $55 million in potential headwind to fiscal '23 cash flow. since then and in the last 90 days alone, further rate moves created about another $45 million in potential headwind to cash flow.
we're obviously watching fx rates closely, but it's clear that if the current rates persist through next year, that risk could materialize in free cash flow. beyond cash flow, if you further take the risk into account, revenue growth could end up at the low end of the cagr we talked about at investor day. and fiscal '23 margin could be impacted by about 1 point. we will, of course, update you on our next earnings call when we expect to have more visibility into any impact from macro or fx movements on our fiscal '23 outlook.
we remain optimistic about our growth potential beyond fiscal '23, continue to target double-digit revenue growth, non-gaap operating margins in the 38% to 40% range and double-digit free cash flow growth on a compound annual basis. these metrics are intended to provide a floor to our revenue growth ambitions and a ceiling to our spend growth expectations. andrew, back to you.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you, debbie. now let me turn to our strategic growth initiatives. sustained and purposeful innovation to enable digital transformation in the industries we serve has changed our relationship with our customers from software vendor to a strategic partner, and that is enabling us to create more value through end-to-end cloud-based solutions that connect data and workflows and through business model evolution. our model is scalable and extensible into adjacent verticals, from architecture and engineering through construction owners, and from product engineering to product manufacturing, and product and data life cycle management.
by helping our customers grow and navigate their digital transformation, we will grow, too. for example, bouygues construction and colas are leading construction and infrastructure firms based in france with over 100,000 construction employees operating in 60 countries across the globe. in the third quarter, they significantly increased their commitment to autodesk products such as revit, autocad and civil 3d following an accelerated move to bim and digital workflows over the last three years, which significantly increased monthly average users. similarly, obayashi corporation, one of the largest construction firms in japan, which operates in 16 countries worldwide, is accelerating its global consolidation around bim and a unified 3d technology platform to enable greater efficiency and sustainability.
in the third quarter, it expanded its eba with us. over the last two years, it has more than doubled the number of revit users and expanded its usage of autodesk construction cloud to connect workflows from design through construction. we are further extending our reach into the construction mid-market with the recent launch of autodesk build, introduction of an account-based pricing business model and distribution through our channel partners. for example, this quarter, jacobsen construction company, an enr 400 general contractor in the united states, was looking for a long-term technology partner and to consolidate around a single project management solution that would increase the efficiency of its field teams, while also seamlessly integrating with its accounting solution.
while it had previously used a competitor solution for some projects, jacobsen ultimately chose autodesk construction cloud because of autodesk build's robust field and cost management functionality, and the opportunity to integrate it smoothly with existing technology. with new autodesk build features and capability launched every two months or so and the recently launched acc bundles for preconstruction and construction operations, we remain optimistic about the opportunities ahead. we're connecting the dots in infrastructure, too. for example, the administrator of railway infrastructures in spain, or adif selected autodesk products over competitor offerings to support its digital transformation.
backed by our common data environment, adif will leverage the autodesk construction cloud to collaborate on project information, on-site development, and model coordination to ensure efficient and accurate construction of their railway network. infrastructure remains an important opportunity for autodesk across the globe. our end-to-end solutions, which boosts the efficiency and sustainability of customers like adif, as well as our ability to seamlessly integrate vertical and horizontal design and construction give us a competitive advantage. much needed additional investment in infrastructure in the united states and across the globe will restore aging infrastructure and increase the productivity of the economy.
perhaps more consequentially in the long term, provisions in the u.s. infrastructure bill which encourages department of transportation to digitize their processes, should accelerate adoption of digital workflows and enable all infrastructure investment to become more efficient and sustainable. turning to manufacturing. we sustained strong momentum in our manufacturing portfolio this quarter.
in automotive, we continue to grow our footprint beyond the design studio into manufacturing and connected factories as automotive oems seek to break down work silos at shorten handoff and design cycles. ford, one of the largest automotive oems in the world, renewed and expanded its eba with autodesk during the third quarter, growing users in alias and vred in design and autocad inventor and navisworks in manufacturing, while adding autodesk construction cloud and autodesk build in facilities and manufacturing to enable field access to plant drawings during maintenance and operations and equipment changeover. fusion 360 commercial subscribers again grew strongly without any systematic sales promotion, ending the quarter with 175,000 subscribers. while still early days, our new extensions, including machining, generative design and nesting and fabrication are performing well, and there is major interest in our upcoming simulation and design extensions.
fewer promotions and growing demand for fusion 360's extensions are enabling us to capture more of the potential market opportunity and accelerate our growth. fast radius is a leading digital manufacturing and supply chain company. the company's proprietary cloud manufacturing platform combines software and advanced micro-factories that enable its customers to flexibly design, make and move certified products. fast radius already uses several autodesk products.
this quarter, it added fusion 360 with a machining extension to support its in-house cnc operation and integrate it alongside its existing additive manufacturing offering. fusion 360 enables fast radius to program a wide variety of parts more quickly, resulting in faster product cycle times. outside of commercial use, there is a large and rapidly growing ecosystem of users that are taking fusion 360 from education and home into the workplace. these will fuel commercial usage in the future.
as one measure of this ecosystem, we ended the third quarter with 1 million monthly active users, up over 50% year over year, and they are doing some amazing work. on september 12, the technical university of munich's tum boring team beat more than 400 applicants and 12 finalists to win the inaugural, not-a-boring competition. as haokun zheng, one of the five leads responsible for project operations said, ""fusion 360's cloud-based solution enables our 60-member team to collaborate remotely during the pandemic and design and build an award-winning 40-foot long, 22-ton tunneling machine. throughout the year, we were repeatedly told by industry experts that the timeline we were aiming for was borderline impossible.
the fusion 360's ease-of-use and integrated cad, cam and fem enabled rapid simulation and improve the speed and efficiency of the design workflow."" and finally, we continue to enable more users to participate in our ecosystem more productively through business model innovation and our license compliance initiatives. for example, a sustainable building engineering design solutions consultant in australia, which has been an autodesk aec customer for more than a decade, added our premium offering in the third quarter to enable it to better manage its subscriptions and provide more secure single sign-on across multiple offices. across autodesk, the number of premium subscribers increased more than 500% year over year. and in the middle east, large telecoms company undertaking its own digital transformation was seeking to increase efficiency and sustainability by adopting bim standards and streamlining digital workflows, while also ensuring license compliance across a fragmented employee base.
during the process, we become the trusted partner of choice, resulting in a significant investment in aec collections, autocad, revit, and 3ds max. year to date, license compliance billings across autodesk as a whole are up 20% when compared to the same period two years ago and almost 50% year over year. in speaking with customers, partners, and employees, we are very optimistic about the future. they have demonstrated grit and determination, inspiration and innovation, and agility and transformation during the pandemic.
and while there will certainly be twist and turns on the road ahead, in many ways, the pandemic has accelerated the future and increased my confidence that we are on the right path. we are executing well in challenging times and believe we have only significant opportunities ahead of us. i am reminded again that autodesk's purpose has never been more important or urgent. empowering innovators with design-and-make technology so that they can achieve the new possible also enable them to build and manufacture efficiently and sustainably.
together, we can meet the challenges posed by carbon, water, and waste, while also advancing equity and access to the in-demand skills of the future. autodesk's central role in meeting these challenges underpins my confidence this year and my confidence in the future. operator, we would now like to open the call for questions. 
",2022-Q3,ADSK
1.0,1.0,,,":
operator
certainly. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of phil winslow from credit suisse. your question, please.
philip winslow -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. andrew, just a question on you -- to you about the supply chain and the labor disruptions you talked about on the last call. i wonder if you could just give us an update on that.
just sort of what were you hearing from customers over the course of the past -- in three months? and then really, if you could particularly focus on the aec vertical because one of the things you obviously did call out in the slides was record construction property news and accelerating growth there. thanks.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, philip. good to hear from you. so yeah, so first, let me kind of frame it this way.
what we saw was the kind of improvement we expected to see when we talked to you about this in q3. so we saw some nice improvement. our customers are saying they're feeling like they're coming out of some of these supply chain constraints. our partners are echoing some of these things.
we didn't see off too much stick expectations we had at the beginning of the fiscal year when we expected to see acceleration in the second half. but what we saw was consistent with what we told you in q3 in terms of the improving climate, all right? so i think with regards to aec, in particular, which, by the way, i highlighted last quarter as being the key place that was feeling the most supply chain and cost pressure in terms of in-flight projects, that's where we saw the improvement. and yeah, we did have a record quarter in construction, and we did end the quarter with some nice acceleration and momentum heading into next year. but consistent with what we said in q3, all right?
philip winslow -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. and then just in terms of the backlog of projects you've been talking about for, you know, a couple of years now. you know, any thoughts on what sort of the customers are telling you about that? do you think they're going to get unstick and sort of taken care of, call it, over the next 12 months? or how are they thinking about that backlog?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. so what i can tell you is that we monitor bid board activity and we monitor the growth in active projects on construction cloud and bim 360 docs. and what we're seeing in bid board is we're seeing consistent growth in bidding activity, and we're seeing an increasing number of monthly active projects on our cloud applications around construction cloud and bim 360 docs. those are usually leading indicators of project activity and backlog getting turned into active projects.
so we consider those good signs, all right, in terms of how the environment is moving.
philip winslow -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks, guys. appreciate it.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of saket kalia from barclays. your question, please. 
saket kalia -- barclays capital -- analyst
ok, great. hey, andrew. hey, debbie. thanks for taking my questions here.
andrew, maybe for you, a big renewal year here in fiscal '23. as we start to see maybe some more of those three-year product subscriptions come up for renewal this year, what's the data sort of showing, the preliminary data maybe, on sort of customers' willingness to renew at that same duration. and perhaps just as importantly, their willingness to sort of expand their usage from prior levels. does that make sense? 
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah, it does make sense. and the short answer to this, saket, is that the willingness to renew is the same, or in some cases, better than the willingness to renew the shorter duration contracts. so customers who like long-duration contracts, who like the price lock tend to continue to grab the price lock and move on. that's what we've seen this -- so far.
now in terms of their willingness to buy more during these things, well, that's going to depend on their individual circumstances. so i'm not going to give you any kind of specific numbers on how we're doing around their willingness to buy more. however, the net revenue to retention rates for the company are indicative of kind of how the global cohort of the company works with regards to this. so debbie, would you like to add anything to that or comment on it? 
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
no, i think you covered it, andrew.
saket kalia -- barclays capital -- analyst
got it. got it. debbie, maybe for my follow-up for you. i mean, understanding that we're just starting out fiscal '23, i was wondering if you have any thoughts on how we'll be phasing out the multiyear product subscriptions in fiscal '24? and maybe just philosophically, how you think about the shape of that impact on cash flow now that we have a sort of revised fiscal '23 view.
and again, i understand it's early, but any thoughts on kind of how you think that works? and the best way to think about modeling that? 
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure. so we aren't giving specific guidance today for fiscal '24 and beyond as you know. but as you can imagine, it's a big area of focus for us. and we are retaining the framework that we set out at investor day, so let's just recap that again.
it is double-digit revenue growth through fiscal '26, non-gaap operating margins in the 38% to 40% range and double-digit compound annual growth in free cash flow through fiscal '26. now that's after that expected decline in fiscal '24 when we institute our transition to annual billings for multiyear contracts. and as i mentioned in the prepared remarks, these metrics are intended to provide a floor to our revenue growth ambitions and a ceiling to our spend growth expectations. now in terms of the decline for free cash flow, specifically in fiscal '24, i know there's a lot of interest in both the magnitude of it and the slope of it.
and while we're not providing specifics today, here's how i think you should think about it. if i start with the slope, the slope of the free cash flow decline, and then its recovery is going to depend on the pace at which our customers adopt annual billings. right now, we intend to offer our customers a choice, but we're still working through the programmatic details. our bias is going to be to go as quickly as possible.
but we have customer, partner, and operational constraints that we're working through as we navigate the transition. and then to give you an order of magnitude, i'd say, look at long-term deferred as a percent of total deferred back in fiscal '20. it was in that high 20s percent zone, and we should see something similar in fiscal '23 because it's that same cohort that's coming up for renewal. and so then as we move to annual billings, eventually that long-term deferred will go away.
and again, our bias is to move as quickly as possible, but we're still working through the operational details. we'll give you updates on all of this as we progress through fiscal '23. 
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
you know, saket, one thing that -- oh sorry, saket.
saket kalia -- barclays capital -- analyst
no, no, no. please go ahead, andrew. no, please.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
one thing that excites me about this post annual billings transition is that the free cash flow starts tracking to the long-term strategic drivers that i really like talking about. the digital transformation drivers that we talked about at investor day, including in the adjacent industries we were going in, these things are going to be what tracked and drives the growth and the behavior of the free cash flow going forward, as well as labeling all those -- leveraging all those growth enablers around business models and around noncompliance. and also, don't forget, long term, our whole effort to monetize the long tail with not only with offerings like flex, but with new types of digital channels that reach deeper into places where we might not be reaching customers today. so that's the exciting thing about getting through this for me is the free cash flow tracks with those long-term strategic drivers.
that's going to be a really great outcome for us.
saket kalia -- barclays capital -- analyst
makes a lot of sense. thanks for the color, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of jay vleeschhouwer from griffin securities. your question, please.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
thanks. good evening. andrew, debbie, your slide deck is interesting in disclosing the 6 million subscribers at the end of the fiscal year, which indicates an increase of about 700,000 from the end of fiscal '21. is it contemplated in your guidance for fiscal '23 that you might be able to add a similar, if not larger number to the sub space this year? second question, your disclosure about the digital sales revenue rate is very interesting.
having grown now apparently to be the plurality of your direct revenue, is it your view, andrew, that the digital sales could become perhaps evenly split with the named accounts and eba business? or do you think named accounts and eba remains the majority of the direct business?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. all right. so first, let me address your first question. as you recall last year, and this was on me, we had those up too much stick assessments of accelerating new business growth into the second half of the year, right? we're not assuming any of that moving into this year.
we're assuming things stay exactly as they are and as the conditions that we see right now are. the exception i'll give to that is that in our guidance, we did not factor in war in ukraine, how that might affect our business is completely unclear. i mean, i thought -- probably all of you heard president biden's speech earlier today about some of his positions on this. but when it comes to looking at next year, we're assuming that current things move forward the way they are, right? and also, just remember, that some of those subscriber increases that you saw were a result of multiuser trade-ins as well, ok? i just want to make sure that we factor some of those things.
but current course and speed is the general assumption here, right? now with regards to digital sales. digital sales is -- it's a great example. it's our fastest-growing channel. it's not growing at the expense of our partners.
our partners are growing robustly as well. it's also a great example of what we're doing with digital productivity for ourselves and for our sales force. the digital channel reaches customers that we believe we have not historically been serving well. and they have -- they are not only finding us and buying our existing offerings, they're also engaging on some of our more forward-looking offerings like fusion 360.
so that channel is going to continue to become more powerful. and as i've said many times before, as we look out to our long-term goal of half of our revenue being direct, half of that direct revenue is going to come from this digital channel. and clearly, you can see from the way -- what we've disclosed and the growth rates here, there is line of sight to those numbers over multiple years. and that channel is going to continue to help us reach deeper into the long tail.
it's going to continue to benefit from the digital productivity tools we're building just to make our general overall sales force more productive. and i have high hopes for that channel in the future. now debbie, did you want to add anything about, for instance, since i mentioned the ukraine situation, anything around the specifics about our exposure there? or anything related to that? or anything about the digital channel?
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure. i'll cover russia and the ukraine. just to be explicit, russia and the ukraine, they represented a bit less than 2 percentage points of our total revenue in fiscal '22. and we have similar assumptions in our fiscal '23 roll-up.
obviously, events are unfolding live. that's a very fluid situation. it's a coincidence that our earnings call is today. so we haven't baked anything, any potential risk that might occur there into our guidance.
we're going to be watching things closely because at this point, we don't know if there's any impact at all. we don't know if there is impact, if it would be localized to russia and the ukraine specifically or whether or not it becomes a broader impact across europe and beyond. it's just too early for us to tell. what i would say, though, is that as we pointed out at our investor day, our business is more resilient now after the business model transition.
so that's one positive in the midst of all this. but as you can imagine, it's obviously a situation that we're watching really closely, and we'll continue to update you as we know more.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
thank you very much.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
the net headline is, jay, we've assumed that things are going to continue as they are current course and speed. there's no accelerations, no anticipated uplift, or anything that we were looking for in the coming guidance or moving forward guidance.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
understood. thank you.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of adam borg from stifel. your question, please.
adam borg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hey, guys, and thanks so much for taking the question. maybe just on the new product subscription growth in the quarter. last quarter, you talked about that moderating to the mid-20s after kind of being in the 30% range in the first half of the year. i guess, how did that play out in 4q? and i'm assuming, based on your prior comments, andrew, that whatever you saw in the back half of the year, you're assuming that going forward.
but i'd love to hear a little bit more color, if you can, about how that played out in 4q? 
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
i'm going to let debbie take that question, adam.
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
yeah. sure. i'll go ahead and take this. so adam, yes, we have been talking quite a bit about new volume, and it is a metric that we monitor very closely.
our new volume growth decelerated a few points in q4, and that's because of a tough comp versus q4 last year, but the growth was very healthy, and it was in line with our expectations. and so that growth is effectively what we're considering as we build our guidance into next year and to just reiterate what andrew has been saying, we're assuming that the demand environment, including that new volume growth, is built into our guidance and that there is no changes to the upside or the downside as we look ahead. but the bottom-line answer is that the volume growth decelerated a few points, but it was as we expected and still with very healthy growth.
adam borg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. that's really helpful. and maybe just as a quick follow-up. it's great to see the growing traction with autodesk construction cloud.
and kind of as you look forward a few years, maybe for you, andrew, how expansive do you view the acc opportunity relative to the current portfolio? and do you have any interest at all to go deeper into the financials aspects? thanks so much.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. certainly, at some point, yes. but look, i've always said that we believe the construction business is autodesk's next billion-dollar business. and i'd like to add just for those of you who are looking at these things, you're probably using make -- the make revenue growth as a proxy for what we're doing.
i want to make sure that you remember that because we have a diversity of business models and we offer consumption models, account-based models, subscription models that we blend the actual acc business between our design bucket and our make bucket. so if you look at -- if you account for eba impact on the make side of the business, the make side of the business grew about 30%, right? so we're looking at good robust growth here. i expect that growth to continue, and i continue to say that construction is autodesk's next billion-dollar business, and that should be the expectation in our group.
adam borg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great, thanks again.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of matthew hedberg from rbc capital markets. your question, please.
matthew hedberg -- rbc capital markets --- analyst
oh hey, thanks, guys. andrew, obviously, it's great to hear the results on the construction cloud side. i'm wondering on the manufacturing side of your business, maybe using a baseball analogy, where do you think we are at in sort of the build-out of the manufacturing cloud business relative to maybe where you wanted to get to at some point?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah, it's a great question, matt, because we're kind of in this transitional phase now, where we built out the technology, we've gotten to the early adopter audiences. we've established a strong stronghold, a strong base for the product, a strong kind of early market for fusion. i mean, you heard in the opening commentary about the 189,000-plus subscribers. we're now moving into the phase of kind of trying to drive the acceleration of the growth in that space.
i think we're early on. it's probably the third inning-or-so in the process, all right? we're starting off on a good base that's -- the threshold that we've got with subscribers here is, for those of you who know the history of this whole space, that is an excellent threshold to build on. that's usually where you start to cross the threshold of getting more and more material to the business. and we've had a leadership transition recently with scott reese taking a great job off to go work for ge, one of our customers, by the way, which is always good, really happy for him.
and jeff kinder is stepping in as part of the succession planning process there. and jeff kinder cares a lot about scaling and scaling growth and scaling transformation. and i think his skill set is going to provide some excellent capabilities in this next phase, but it's still really early, all right? it's still third inning-ish in this game. and i think we should expect that to look like that.but over the next five years, again, this is going to be a significant driver of that growth that we've been talking about beyond fiscal '24.
matthew hedberg -- rbc capital markets --- analyst
that's great. and then, you know, maybe just as a quick follow-up. you know, i think it was about a year ago, maybe when some of the supply chain questions first started coming up. we talked to a number of your partners who suggested that people were using autodesk as a way to reduce waste and just become more efficient with tight supply markets.
as you reflect back on the last year, i mean, do you think that actually played out? and do you think that remains a pretty critical driver, especially in the world of supply chain or just broad esg concerns?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. absolutely. it's only going to become more important. so we actually have really compelling stories of old line industrial companies using fusion 360, for example, at its generative capability to actually lightweight and take out mass from products and reduce their material usage for things as simple as hydraulic equipment, all right? real-world examples, and we're seeing more and more of that.
with regards to construction, every redo that you eliminate is a waste -- is a reduction in waste and carbon footprint for that particular project. and as you know, more and more, it's not becoming a choice for construction firms. it's becoming a requirement. there are more and more mandates about what the carbon footprint of a particular project has to be both this embedded carbon footprint and its lifetime carbon footprint.
so this capability to reduce energy, select the right materials, reduce the amount of materials used is going to become a critical differentiator for lots of people. and it's really exciting to see some of these companies that you would never expect adopting some of our newest technology simply because it helps them address that key challenge for their businesses to be more sustainable and to be greener.
matthew hedberg -- rbc capital markets --- analyst
super exciting. thanks.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of joe vruwink from baird. your question, please.
joe vruwink -- baird -- analyst
great. hi, everyone. first question was just more of a fact check on my part. but i'm wondering if the only change in the formal guidance you're providing today versus the preliminary view you provided last quarter, the only difference is just the strengthening in the dollar and the incremental fx headwind, is that correct?
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
that's correct. the overall headline is that the numbers are consistent with what we talked about last call. we've just adjusted them for our latest fx assumptions. and that's causing about 1 point of headwind to revenue growth and another about $30 million in incremental headwind to free cash flow, and that's been baked into the guidance.
joe vruwink -- baird -- analyst
ok. thank you. and then second question, andrew, i know you've said that autocad maybe isn't the leading indicator that it once was, but nevertheless, it did accelerate pretty nicely here at year-end. it might have been your fastest-growing business, if you've removed the upfront contribution from media, so i'm just wondering if there's anything to kind of read between the lines there?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
all right. i think it's commensurate with an increase in monthly active usage, which i still think is becoming a better proxy. so for instance, our total monthly active usage of all our products increased over 10% in q4 year over year. so those two things correlate pretty closely.
and i think that's still the proxy. but you're right, i think the autocad performance is a result of that strong monthly active usage performance that we're starting to see heading into the fiscal year.
joe vruwink -- baird -- analyst
great, thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of steve koenig from smbc. your question, please.
steve koenig -- smbc nikko securities -- analyst
ok, great. hey, thanks for taking my question. was wondering about your -- in q4, the kind of the elimination toning down the multiyear discounts. kind of what was the reaction to that? and kind of how do you gauge what that will look like going forward? and then just for housekeeping, i missed the comment at the very start of the call about what drove -- the other line did very well.
and i think there was some upfront revenue there. could you just provide me that color again? thanks very much.
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
thanks, steve. just lots to unpack there, but let's start at the top on multiyear. so yes, we did see a discount change from 10% to 5% in the past quarter. and obviously, when we adjust pricing, we do see some customers take advantage of the window and buy ahead of that when the price change goes into effect.
we saw a similar behavior with this price adjustment, and that's as expected. we're always going to be looking at ways to optimize our business. this is just one example of that. and i'd also say that the multiyear renewal rates remained firm even after that discount reduction.
and then in terms of other revenue, yes. other revenue tends to be a little bit of a mixed bag, but the other revenue is in part what drove the beat in our q4 revenue. and a piece of that -- the big piece of that is noncloud-enabled products that we sell through our ebas that are recognized upfront. we typically see our highest eba volume in q4.
and depending on the composition of those deals, it can sometimes drive a slight surge in upfront revenue as a result, and that's what we saw in q4 in the beat in and what you're seeing in other. we continue to expect, however, that upfront and other is going to be a relatively small part of our business over time, and that recurring revenue should be 95% or greater. 
steve koenig -- smbc nikko securities -- analyst
terrific. great. thanks a lot, debbie. congrats on the quarter.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of sterling auty from j.p. morgan. your question, please.
sterling auty -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah, thanks. hi, guys. debbie, i want to circle back to cash flow. you had made the mention that there are some constraints from customers and partners on shift to annual billings.
can you give us maybe a quick example of what some of those constraints might be? and why you might not just be able to rip off the band-aid and move quicker to annual billings now?
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
yeah. so as i mentioned back at the investor day, we do -- the first part is operational. so we are upgrading our systems to be able to handle this volume of multiyear contracts with annual billings at scale our systems don't provide for that capability today, and it's a major system overhaul that we're working on, and it's going to take us some time. and we're looking at how fast we can create that capability and over what time period.
again, i'd say that our bias is that we execute on this transition right away when we get to fiscal '24, but it is going to take us time and continued investment in both dollars and people to make sure that our systems are set up for that. and so we're looking at that right now. the second piece that we talked about at investor day that still is important to us is that our partners are very important to autodesk, very important to our growth, very important to -- in our ability to drive breadth and depth across the globe and engaging with customers. and our partners, we want to make sure that we work with them as we execute on this transition to make sure that we optimize not only for us and for our customers, but also for those partners that are important to us.
and so we're going to be looking at the programmatic details of that over the next year with an eye toward making sure that we've set ourselves up for success in the entire ecosystem as we get to that start of fiscal '24. 
sterling auty -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
understood. makes sense. and then maybe one follow-up. outside of the $30 million fx headwind on free cash flow for fiscal '23, how else would we kind of think about the bridge from the guidance that you've given to the previous long-term target that was there?
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
sure. so the previous long-term target was $2.4 billion. and on the last call, we talked about a couple of hundred million in risk to that, that was broken down roughly equally between the macro backdrop and fx. and then we have an incremental $30 million in fx now given the continued strengthening of the dollar in the last 90 days.
so net-net, it's about $100 million in macro or business risk. again, that we highlighted on the last call, and then a total of $130 million risk from fx and that continued strengthening of the dollar, and that's why you see the midpoint of the guide right there at that $2.17 billion. 
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of jason celino from keybanc capital. your question, please.
jason celino -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for letting me. maybe just a couple for andrew. i kind of want to go a little deeper on the architecture side of your business, and this is obviously your bread and butter.
how would you describe kind of the end market environment right now for that segment? and then what kind of growth initiatives should we be thinking of for this year and long term?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. so architecture is coming out of this situation as coming out of pandemic, you've seen that there -- the index that drives our architecture activity is going up consistently. so architects are feeling better about the future and architects are also investing more in bim, which is the critical part of their transition from 2d-based practices to 3d-based practices. so that trend is going to continue.
that's part of the bigger long-term digitization trend that we're seeing in architecture, in particular. more and more people are moving to 3d processes, 3d bim and they're looking to adopt revit and tools like revit more aggressively so that they can stay competitive in the new world of the market. it's also a lot of increased labor productivity for them. so they're going to be looking at some of these new tools that allow them to do more with the labor pool they have, especially in the tight labor market.
so that's where we're looking at with construction. the ongoing digitization move to bim, that's going to accelerate as architects continue to get more optimistic about their project pipeline. but all the data is out there saying that we're seeing a better pipeline for the architecture segment. 
jason celino -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
yup. and then when i kind of just think about the architecture job, is it unfair to think that maybe that role, in particular, has been hit maybe harder than some of the other jobs within aec? 
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
it certainly was hit harder early on. there's no doubt about it, all right? it was the least prepared for remote work because it was essentially an office-type profession. it has adapted. they have certainly adopted our cloud-based tools at a rate significantly higher than prior to the pandemic.
so they've gotten on to bim collaborate and bim collaborate pro at higher rates than we ever saw previously. so they're adapting, but yes, early on in this, the pandemic, and in the last few years, they were hit relatively harder. but they're coming back and they're adapting. they still have to build up their book of business, they still have to build up their cushion, but that segment is absolutely coming back.
and it's coming back in the cloud too. 
operator

andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you, simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. today, we reported record fourth quarter and full year revenue, non-gaap operating margins, and free cash flow. our strong results and competitive performance were underpinned by some perennial factors. our ability to deliver greater value to our customers and partners through consistent investment in our technology, workforce and business model and customer experience.
let me talk briefly about each of these as they are just as important to our future growth as they have been to our growth in the past. all of our technology investments, be it in 3d and bim, enabling workflows in the cloud in generative design, in make, and in newer verticals like water and construction. all of them connect siloed adjacent workflows in the cloud and lead our customers to new, more efficient and sustainable ways of working. at autodesk university, we announced we were moving from products to platforms and capabilities, and bringing those capabilities to any device anywhere to the cloud.
fusion 360 is the leading edge of this transition and our recent acquisitions of prodsmart and cimco will enable us to further digitize and connect shop floor processes and manufacturing to help build connected factories while providing additional on-ramps into and usage of our manufacturing platform. similarly, our acquisitions of moxion and loupe enable us to connect media and entertainment workflows and data from postproduction to preproduction. with media and entertainment signing its largest-ever eba in the fourth quarter, the ability to connect preproduction workflows further expands our addressable tam. we're also continuing to invest in our workforce, attract and retain the best talent in our industries and cultivate a shared sense of purpose and of diversity, and belonging.
we recently received recognition for that work with inclusion on the corporate knights index of the world's most sustainable companies and the highest possible score on the human rights foundation's corporate equality index. we are proud of our purpose and unique culture, one consequence of which is relatively low attrition compared to our technology peers. this is another source of competitive advantage in tight labor market. it also means that when gifted leaders like scott reese and pascal di fronzo decide to climb their next mountains, we have a deep bench of internal talent like jeff kinder and rebecca pearce; and alumnae, like ruth ann keene, to step into their shoes.
and finally, business model and customer experience optimization. this includes the shift from perpetual licenses with maintenance to tiered subscription, the shift from desktop multiuser licenses to named user subscriptions and consumption. the shift from indirect to direct, the shift from front-end to back-end payments to channel partners. and most recently, the shift from upfront to annual billing, all of which enable us to better serve more customers in flexible and customized ways.
as of february 1, we unified all customer and partner-facing activities, marketing, go-to-market, customer success, and customer operations under our coo, steve blum to give us a better end-to-end view of the customer experience and to drive sustainable competitive advantage and growth. while the pandemic and its aftershocks mean we will fall narrowly short of the financial targets set more than five years ago, we have made tremendous progress through consistent investment in our technology, our workforce, and our business model and customer experience, which have added adjacent use cases and usage in our ecosystem, growing our addressable market and our ability to realize it. importantly, the pandemic has accelerated the structural growth drivers underpinning our future growth. we have robust momentum as we enter fiscal '23 and over the long term.
now let me turn the call over to debbie to take you through the details of our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. i'll then come back to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives.
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
thanks, andrew. in an extraordinary year, we performed strongly across all metrics, perhaps best summarized by the sum of revenue growth and free cash flow margin for the year, which was 49%. our fourth quarter results were strong. several factors contributed to that, including robust renewal rates, strong growth in subscriptions and rapidly expanding digital sales.
total revenue grew 17% or about 2 percentage points less in constant currency, with subscription revenue growing by 18%. looking at revenue by product. autocad and autocad lt revenue grew 20%, aec revenue grew 17% and manufacturing revenue grew 4%. recall that vault became ratable in fiscal '22, and that manufacturing also benefited in q4 last year from a strong performance in automotive ebas, which included significant upfront revenue.
excluding these impacts, manufacturing revenue grew in double digits in q4. m&a revenue grew 38%, which included some upfront revenue from its largest-ever eba. even if you exclude upfront revenue, m&e grew more than 20% in q4. across the globe, revenue grew 18% in the americas and 16% in both emea and apac.
direct revenue increased 27% and represented 38% of total revenue, up from 34% last year due to strength from both enterprise and e-commerce. we had our best ever revenue quarter for digital sales, which helped annual e-commerce sales surpass $0.5 billion for the first time. our product subscription renewal rates remained at record highs. and our net revenue retention rate remained strongly within our 100% to 110% target range.
billings increased 13% to $1.7 billion, reflecting robust underlying demand, but also a tough eba comparison from last year. total deferred revenue grew 13% to $3.8 billion. total rpo of $4.7 billion and current rpo of $3.1 billion grew 12% and 15%, respectively, and as expected, reflecting billings growth and the timing and volume of multiyear contracts, which are typically on a three-year cycle. turning to the p&l.
non-gaap gross margin remained broadly level at 93%, while non-gaap operating margin increased by 5 percentage points to approximately 35%, reflecting strong revenue growth and ongoing cost discipline. gaap operating margins declined by 6 percentage points to 12%, primarily due to lease-related charges of approximately $100 million, which reflects the progress we've made to reduce our real estate footprint and to further our hybrid workforce strategy as we announced on our last call. we delivered record-free cash flow in the quarter and for the full year of $716 million and $1.5 billion, respectively. having completed our first sustainability bond last quarter at historically attractive rates, we continued to optimize our capital structure in q4 by accelerating our share repurchase activity.
given the recent pullback in our share price, we opportunistically repurchased shares at a higher rate than previous quarters, which allowed us to offset dilution in fiscal '22 and to get ahead of a sizable amount of our estimated dilution in fiscal '23. the net result was a slight reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the year. during q4, we purchased 2.3 million shares for $613 million at an average price of approximately $267 per share. for the full year, we repurchased nearly 4 million shares at an average price of approximately $276 per share for a total spend of just over $1 billion.
you'll see us continue to be opportunistic with share buybacks, but our capital-allocation strategy is unchanged. we'll invest organically and inorganically to drive growth, as well as purchase shares to offset dilution from our equity compensation plans over time. now let me finish with guidance. on our last call, we signaled that we saw fx headwinds and macroeconomic uncertainty due to supply chain challenges, labor shortages, and the ebb and flow of covid.
that perspective hasn't changed. so the risk we highlighted three months ago is now incorporated into our fiscal '23 outlook. beyond that, we did see further strengthening of the u.s. dollar, resulting in a slight incremental fx headwind to our fiscal '23 expectations.
to put it in numerical terms, our fiscal '22 revenue growth reflects a 2-percentage-point currency tailwind, which with fx movements in the last quarter, becomes a roughly 1-percentage-point headwind to fiscal '23 revenue growth. similarly, fx moves during the fourth quarter resulted in an approximately $30 million incremental headwind to fiscal '23 free cash flow. beyond fx, we are obviously keeping a close eye on the geopolitical macroeconomic and policy environment. but having said all that, our strong momentum and competitive performance in fiscal '22 set us up well for fiscal '23.
and we've assumed that market conditions in fiscal '23 are consistent with what we experienced in the second half of fiscal '22. we expect fiscal '23 revenue to be between $5.02 billion and $5.12 billion with growth of approximately 16% at the midpoint, and which reflects an incremental 1-percentage-point fx headwind, as i mentioned earlier. we expect non-gaap operating margins to be approximately 37% and free cash flow to be between $2.13 billion and $2.21 billion. the midpoint of that range, $2.17 billion, implies 47% growth and reflects the incremental $30 million fx headwind that i mentioned earlier.
the slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for q1 and full year fiscal '23. the pandemic has reinforced the structural growth drivers underpinning our strategy, and we remain confident in our long-term growth potential. we continue to target double-digit revenue growth, non-gaap operating margins in the 38% to 40% range, and double-digit free cash flow growth on a compound annual basis. these metrics are intended to provide a floor to our revenue growth ambitions and a ceiling to our spend growth expectations.
andrew, back to you. 
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you, debbie. our strategy is to transform the industries we serve with end-to-end cloud-based solutions that enable our customers to drive efficiency and sustainability. structural growth drivers underpinning the strategy have been reinforced by the pandemic, including increased workflow convergence and platform standardization, a growing focus on distributed working in the cloud, automation, and workforce productivity and also the growing importance of sustainability. our model is scalable and extensible into adjacent verticals from architecture and engineering, through construction and owners from product engineering through product manufacturing and product data management.
and as i stated earlier, with our consistent investment in our technology, our workforce, and our business model and customer experience, we are well-positioned to realize these opportunities. and so by both leading and partnering with our customers on new ways of working, we will grow too. for example, goldbeck is one of europe's largest commercial design and construction companies and a leading practitioner of industrialized construction, and they use inventor, revit, forge, and generative design on our platform to implement their precast and modular system concept. by standardizing the invisible and customizing the visible, goldbeck has been able to design and build highly customized and aesthetically pleasing buildings reliably, quickly, and efficiently.
having unified around bim, goldbeck is now seeking to grow and connect beyond the design process to further improve efficiency and reduce waste through design automation during capital planning, for which it is trialing spacemaker and great collaboration across design and build phases of construction using autodesk construction cloud. with the launch of autodesk build, the introduction of an account-based pricing business model and distribution through our channel partners, we are extending our reach into the construction market. for example, lee lewis construction, an enr 400 general contractor from texas, has been driving innovation through construction technology for over 45 years. in 2021, it began adopting capabilities of the autodesk construction cloud, beginning with assemble for virtual design and construction with the end goal of a full replacement of their product management software with autodesk build.
by having one platform for the full end-to-end construction workflow, lee lewis will be able to more efficiently deliver extraordinary results for their clients, from concept planning to ribbon cutting. with strong growth from autodesk build and the benefit of recently launched acc bundles for preconstruction and construction operations, autodesk construction cloud reported its best-ever quarter and accelerating growth in the fourth quarter, entering fy '23 with strong momentum. we continue connecting the dots in infrastructure too, most recently through the acquisition of innovyze. sustainable water is an area of opportunity for autodesk across the globe.
for example, thames water owns and operates one of the oldest and most complicated water supply networks in europe, supplying 9 million customers in london and the thames valley. with infoworks ws pro and iwlive pro from innovyze and an ongoing recruitment drive to double the size of their internal hydraulic modeling team, it is building a modeling center of excellence with a library of hydraulic models that can be run in near real time. when connected and compared with telemetry, these dynamic digital twins will become powerful planning tools, enabling thames water's teams to gain near real-time insight into system performance, leading to improved outcomes for the customers of today and tomorrow. i'm very pleased to report that innovyze had its best quarter ever.
turning to manufacturing. we sustained strong momentum in our manufacturing portfolio this quarter as we connect more workflows beyond the design studio and develop more on-ramps to our manufacturing platform. in automotive, we continue to grow our footprint beyond the design studio and into manufacturing-connected factories as automotive oems seek to break down work silos and shorten handoff and design cycles. for example, a multinational automobile company, which designs and jointly manufactures premium electric cars operates in four countries across the world and is currently in the process of expanding to a further 20.
with its new eba signed in the fourth quarter, it is not only adding additional users of alias and vred, it is also partnering with our consulting teams and product experts to both extend its in-house manufacturing capabilities with autodesk moldflow and working on the rollout of shotgrid globally to help seamlessly manage and collaborate across its end-to-end workflows. our platform approach gives new customers multiple on-ramps into our cloud ecosystem. for example, a european-based start-up that creates smart charging systems for evs worldwide use a competitor's product and design but was also running into collaboration challenges due to the rapid growth of its business. it shows upchain as its cloud data management system because it is easy to install, is up and running out of the box, and enables all users anywhere and on any device to collaborate on up-to-date data in real time.
and it is easy to add new users and scale with the hyper growth of the company. these are also all attributes of fusion 360, and we hope to earn the right to connect more workflows for upchain users in the future. fusion 360's commercial subscribers grew steadily, ending the quarter with 189,000 subscribers. early demand for our new extensions, including machining, generative design and nesting and fabrication has been strong and there has been significant interest in our upcoming simulation and design extension.
while we often think of education users taking fusion 360 with them into the workforce, our commercial customers are also taking fusion 360 into education to help train their future workforce. for example, lawrence equipment, as a member of the pasadena city college advisory board, showed the college how fusion 360 had helped innovate and improve its design and manufacturing workflows, resulting in greater operational efficiency, improved productivity, and higher quality production. upon adoption for its machine shop program, the college immediately found that students using fusion 360 are spending less time learning how to use the software and more time on the machines, learning important machining skills. the students also better understood how their work affected the company.
as a result, lawrence equipment can hire from a steady pool of highly qualified pasadena city college graduate, a win-win. with sustained demand for compelling content and growing pressure to produce that content more efficiently, there is increased demand for content creation tools and cloud-enabled production workflows in the media and entertainment industries. as a result, media and entertainment finished the year strong as companies emerging from the pandemic sought to connect siloed workflows and remote teams. for example, technicolor, a worldwide creative technology leader, has renewed its commitment to autodesk content creation and production management tools, such as maya and shotgrid.
by standardizing on common tools across its global studios, technicolor can unleash the creative potential of its remote and distributed workforce. by efficiently and securely connecting teams, technicolor can continue to serve the growing demand for compelling content, redefining what's possible for storytellers and audiences around the globe. and finally, we continue to enable more users to participate in our ecosystem more productively through business model innovation and our license compliance initiatives. with single sign-on for improved security and user-level reporting, our premium plan enables our customers to manage their software usage across distributed sites more safely and efficiently.
as we help our customers understand the details of how they use our solutions, the better we can ensure their success by efficiently and effectively implementing them. for example, the zeta group, with 17 subsidiaries worldwide, specializes in planning, automation, digitization, and maintenance of customized biopharmaceutical facilities for aseptic process solution. zeta was looking for better visibility into its employee software usage in either administration of subscribers. in q4, it doubled the number of premium plan subscriptions to gain comprehensive employee-level reporting for better insight and easier administration.
that visibility into employee software usage and easier administration of subscribers also makes premium plans an attractive solution for customers seeking to remain license compliant. for example, after identifying that a multinational consumer product company based in the u.s. had gaps in its account plan, we worked with its team to run a diagnostic scan to ensure it had access to the latest and safest versions of our software. this process identified gaps in software availability and license mix.
our collaborative helpful approach enabled more users to access the latest versions of our software and upgrading to our premium plan made it easier to administer and manage access in the future. during the quarter, we closed 16 deals over $500,000 of our license compliance initiatives, four of which were over $1 million. as i said earlier, by both leading and partnering with our customers on new ways of working, we will grow too. and while there will certainly be twists and turns on the road ahead, in many ways, the pandemic has accelerated the future and increased my confidence in our strategy.
empowering innovators of design-and-make technology to achieve the new possible also enables them to build and manufacture efficiently and sustainably. we continue to execute well in challenging times and look forward to autodesk's next 40 years of excitement and optimism. operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions.
",2022-Q4,ADSK
1.0,0.9983,,,":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of phil winslow of credit suisse. your line is open.
phil winslow -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a great strong start to the year. now, construction cloud delivered its best new business growth quarter ever. you signed your second largest eba ever with an infrastructure company. and i loved obviously the example of a manufacturing vendor getting current moving to subscription from a lapsed perpetual license.
but when you think about this, investors have been concerned about autodesk's exposure, specifically to these cyclical end markets, and the potential impact to your business. however, the numbers you just report, the large deals you highlighted clearly don't show this. so, my questions are, what are you hearing from customers about why autodesk is seeing sustained demand? and what gives you confidence in the durability of these drivers?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. so, phil, i think somebody wrote a report about us not being a cyclical business anymore. i can't remember who it was.
phil winslow -- credit suisse -- analyst
[inaudible] analyst, probably, yes.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
probably an incredibly bright analyst. so, look, a couple of things happened in the quarter, and we're projecting those forward through the year just consistently. and i think it's important to kind of just talk about this notion of diversification not only of geographical spread of our business but disciplined spread and also business model spread. and i'll talk about that on a couple of factors.
so, first off, let's just talk about what kind of highlighted in resiliency around our business. throughout the quarter, the monthly active usage that we track regularly continue to strengthen throughout the entire quarter. it continued to strengthen right up to the end. yes, we absolutely saw a pullback during the early part of the invasion of ukraine in europe, but that rebounded as the quarter progressed.
so, one, we have a strong demand environment, and we're selling into that demand environment from multiple vectors, construction, infrastructure, and general building design, as well as manufacturing. so, we're working across these things. and what was happening at the same time, and i think this is an important point about the underlying kind of health and resilience in our business, is even when we saw dips in our new business growth in europe during -- just as the invasion in the ukraine started, which, by the way, recovered as the quarter progressed, renewal rates strengthened broadly. so, we saw a broad strengthening in renewal rates.
so, that broad strengthening in renewal rate actually was able to offset some of the slowness in the new businesses. all of these things are things that we expect to see continue throughout the year and provide durability and stability for our business. now, the u.s. was strong during the year as well.
we did see some softness early on in apac because it was most sensitive to the currency effects. but if you take out some of the covid-effective regions like japan and china, or just japan specifically, we saw much higher growth rates in apac than are indicated by the overall results. all of this is a balance between new business and offsetting impacts from renewal businesses. so, between the diversity of -- our geographic diversity where we're kind of distributed across multiple spaces, the vectors of diversity we have around selling into infrastructure, construction, core design, manufacturing, and the offsetting of really strong renewal rates -- increasing renewal rates even in areas of weaker or at least some weakness in new business, that gives us confidence in terms of the durability for the rest of the year.
phil winslow -- credit suisse -- analyst
awesome. thanks. keep up the great work.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you, phil.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jay vleeschhouwer of griffin securities. your question, please.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
good evening. looking ahead into next year, first fiscal '24 cash flow, a question as to how you're going to work with the channel to get through that, five or six years ago, when you went through your first multiphase transition in the model, you were very conscientious about making sure you've got the channel through all the changes in terms of upfront, upgrades, maintenance and so forth. and so, when you look into next year and beyond, how are you thinking about preserving or managing channel margins, their cash flow, their recurring revenue streams as you go through that valley of your own cash flow next year and then look through a rebound in fiscal '25? that's the first question.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. all right. ok. so, let's start with that, jay.
so, first off, let's just back up and talk about the high-level principle that we're working toward here, right? we're trying to move away from these upfront multiyear deals to annualized billings. none of us want this. we don't like the way it creates a lumpiness in our cash flow. frankly, our partners don't like the way it creates the lumpiness in their cash flow as well, and they don't like discounting to get multiyear upfront deals closed.
so, you look at this, we're trying to create a more stable, reliable, and predictable cash flow build-out beyond -- fy '24 and beyond. ok. so, yes, fy '24 will be the trough. but after that, we're going to grow much more consistently double digits out and predictably moving forward, which is what we want, what you want.
we can't get there fast enough. and frankly, our partners can't get there fast enough. so, we do integrate programs to help them get there. one of the core programs here right now is we're encouraging them to work with us on conserving some of that upfront cash they are going to be collecting because that's cash flow directly into the partner's pockets, all right? and then we do adjust for early on some of their back-end incentives to ensure that they can transition smoothly from a cash flow basis and continue to do -- to work and support our business the way they have.
so, it's not that different from what we've done previously. but you're right, we have to support them through this dip. but once we're all through this dip, it's this nice predictable cash flow buildup that we all want and is going to create a stronger and more reliable business and more durable business. they like it.
we like it. and we're helping them through it.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
ok. thank you for that. shorter-term question. you mentioned a couple of times so far on the call usage rate, which is always useful to hear about.
could you speak about that, andrew, in terms of vertical or end markets? you spoke about it by geo and generally, but could you speak about it in terms of aec including, in particular, acc manufacturing and perhaps even what are you seeing in terms of stand-alone apps versus collection usage?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. here is what's interesting, all right? and this is another one of these things that's just really great about our portfolio is the increase in monthly active usage was broad-based. there wasn't any particular place that was stronger or weaker than the other, all right? so, we saw increases in monthly active usage of autocad, revit, inventor, fusion. and in fact, in construction cloud, we saw a 30% year-over-year increase in monthly active usage, which is a really nice surge on the construction cloud side.
so, there wasn't any particular standout or holdout in those monthly active usage numbers. they really were broad across the spectrum. now, when you talk about collection usage, we don't really look at it that way. i mean, we just look at adoption with -- adoption of the individual products.
we don't necessarily flag it according to a collection. but one thing we have consistently saw is multi-product usage continues to be robust in the collection environment. and actually, we've been slicing that data differently over time. so, we got a better sense for how multi-product usage was moving forward.
and it looks pretty solid. so, the people who buy collections really are engaged in multi-product usage, but no hot spots or cold spots in terms of this monthly active usage growth geographic or industry-wise. i remember there was a slowdown when russia invaded ukraine, but it came back as the quarter progressed.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
understood. thank you, andrew.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you, jay.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from saket kalia of barclays. your line is open.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
ok. great. hi, guys. thanks for taking my questions here.
debbie, maybe i'll start with you. autodesk did 34% operating margin this quarter, great to see. the guide is for 36% for the year. i know we're taking a point out of that for russia.
so, it's not a huge ramp through the year, but it's a question that we get, nonetheless. so, i'm just wondering for everyone's benefit, you could just go one level deeper into some of the moving parts around the margin expansion this year, particularly in this inflationary environment.
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
sure. thanks, saket. so, before i say anything, i want to let all of you guys know that i have a terrible cold. i say this now because i know my voice sounds gravelly.
so, i just figured i'd be upfront about it, so there weren't any questions. i also -- i don't want you to interpret my unusual sounding voice as a lack of enthusiasm. unfortunately, it's just a garden variety cold, not covid that i'm struggling with. so, anyway, just wanted to be upfront about it.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
i appreciate that.
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
on to your question, at the end of the day, the biggest driver of margin improvement over time is going to be revenue growth. and it's that revenue growth combined with our continued discipline with spend that's going to deliver that leverage. for this year's guide, the ramp to 36% is a little less peak because of the impact to the top line that we saw from russia, and we had that impact flow through to the margin. we think it's important to continue to invest to further our strategy.
we don't want to be doing any kind of knee-jerk reaction on spend because of russia. yes, the inflationary pressures that you mentioned are there. we're monitoring them closely. but right now, we feel it's all manageable.
i'd also point out that the margin target at 36% represents a 4-percentage-point improvement year over year. so, we're delivering considerable operating margin leverage at our scale. as we progress through fiscal '23, we're assuming a gradual improvement in margin as the revenue grows and as we continue to tightly manage our spend. that's a similar pattern to what we saw in fiscal '22.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
got it. very helpful. andrew, maybe for you for my follow-up. thanks for the macro commentary.
great to see the consistent renewal rates and the increase in monthly active users. i was wondering if you could just look at it from a different lens and wondering if you could just talk about your new business, sort of how that trended in q1 qualitatively, of course? and how you're thinking about that as part of the full-year guide?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. so, the new business trended pretty consistently in the u.s. throughout the quarter. it trended fairly consistently in apac throughout the quarter.
there was a slowdown during the ukrainian invasion at the beginning that recovered as the quarter progressed. and what we're doing right now is we're looking at those new business trends, and we're essentially carrying them forward into the year, expecting it to continue at kind of similar levels as we go through the year. obviously, we saw a complete evaporation of new business in russia and some impact in belarus. but like i said, europe recovered after -- shortly after the invasion progressed.
so, that's the way we're viewing these. that's the way they played out throughout the quarter, and we're assuming similar performance throughout the year.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
got it. very helpful, guys. thank you.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you, saket. have a good one.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from adam borg of stifel. your line is open.
adam borg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thanks so much for taking the question. maybe just for andrew, you spent a good -- as a matter of time in your prepared remarks talking about infrastructure, including the largest eba deal and just the breadth of your portfolio. so, i'd love to just get an update on your conversations with the industry, how you're thinking about the upfront or the existing infrastructure bill, latest thoughts on the impact to the industry, and ultimately the impact of autodesk.
any such timing there?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. so, you probably read recently that, no, not a lot of money has made it out yet. this is what we told you when the bill originally passed. it takes time for these things to make their way into the system.
most of our customers are in proposal mode right now. departments of transportation and other places are in proposal mode. some grants have been awarded, and the money will start flowing soon. so, we expect to see projects related to some of the infrastructure build spending to show up.
we are particularly interested in the $100 million that's being targeted to help departments and transportation drive digital technologies into their processes. and we've been talking to the department of transportation -- the u.s. department of transportation on how best to kind of drive that into the dot so that they can actually utilize that money to change their processes. but we haven't seen a lot yet.
but what we are seeing is customers like, for instance, what we saw with aecom when their eba renewals coming on, they are layering in construction cloud and infrastructure capability, specifically innovyze in the aecom deal to get ahead of some of this. water is going to be a big deal in the infrastructure spending, and it's showing up to be a big deal in a lot of places. i expect we're going to see that trend continue as we head into some of the contracts actually getting awarded and the money actually flowing out of washington, that people will buy, for instance, innovyze on some of their renewals and some of their kind of deal discussions with us to get ahead of some of the things that they are probably going to be bidding on.
adam borg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's really helpful. and maybe just a real quick follow-up on the macro, obviously, you guys are very clear about the diversity of the strength that you've seen. and maybe i'll just ask the diversity question slightly differently. in the past, you talked about a small end of the market, the mid-end, and the larger end by different customer sizes, by employees, or seats.
i'm just curious, any differentiation you saw across the installed base, looking that way in terms of macro, both the installed base and new business there? thanks again.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. no significant differentiation, actually. the low end of the business held up quite well, actually. and we have a standard clip of new customer acquisition that we see just about every quarter to manage our business.
it didn't change. it held steady and the new customer acquisition, generally speaking, the customers that have never been in our database before, generally come from the low end of our business. so, the low end held up well. you saw the high end held up well.
there was some pressure with regards to people kind of growing their installs, net revenue retention rate. so, new inside of existing accounts saw some pressure, but not a lot. and actually, that improved as well. so, no discernible strong difference worth noting between the various segments.
adam borg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
excellent. thanks again for the time.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from matt hedberg of rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks, guys. hey, andrew, maybe for you first. obviously, i think we all understand at least that this business is not as cyclical as autodesk of old.
and i think that's clear through the subscription transition here. now if the global economy works is slow, i just wanted to double-click on really the value of your subscriptions and why these renewal rates could be better than a lot of investors perceive even if there is a slowing.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
well, first off and foremost, they need these subscriptions to do their jobs, right. they have to -- they need the software to build their -- to do their book of business, right. and if you look at our customers and you talk to our customers, and i am sure you looked at some of the indicators and some of the things that are out there. our customers have a fairly robust book of business.
in fact, most of our customers are building up a backlog. and if you have a conversation with them, their biggest challenge right now is i can't hire, i am having trouble hiring, materials aren't showing up on time. like i told you last year, they were likely to price inflationary pressure into their bids. so, it's not so much that they are dealing with cost compression between bid price and cost price.
it has a lot more to do with labor and access to the materials for delivery. none of them are talking about pulling back anytime soon because of the backlog they are seeing in their business. so, they need the software. they need it.
they need it now. so, they are going to continue to renew this software in order to keep using it. and they are looking to hire more people. they just can't find them right now.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
that's super helpful. thank you for that. and then, debbie, we will see if your voice can hold up here. obviously, a big year for multiyear renewals that ramps throughout the year, but i am wondering, was there anything that surprised you about billings duration in 1q? and maybe how might that progress as the year unfolds?
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
hi. thanks, matt. nothing surprising, we continue, of course, to track the multiyear cohort closely. and the proportional volume that we have been seeing for multiyear was in line with our expectations for all of fiscal '22 and also in through q1 of fiscal '23.
so, that gives us confidence in our fiscal '23 outlook.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. well done, guys.
operator
our next question comes from joe vruwink of baird. your line is open.
joe vruwink -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
great. hi, everyone. one thing that stood out this quarter was the accelerating growth from the partner channel. how much would you credit some of the recent initiatives like opening up construction cloud or being able to get in front of customers with some of the new commercial formats as opposed to just kind of the general trends in the business that you have been talking about?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. that's an excellent question. i can't give you a particularly deep answer there. however, we did see significant growth in the partner channel with construction cloud, and we are starting to light up construction cloud in the channel, which is really important for us in terms of our mid-market expansion of that business.
so, it probably had an effect on certain key partners. but to give you the exact detail about how much of that was related to new business within the channel versus their -- the traditional business they are turning over, i can't really give you an exact breakdown on that. debbie, do we have any fidelity on that at all with regards to the channel business?
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
not at this point, i would say. i mean, we saw broad-based strengths through the channel -- through our channel partners during the quarter outside, of course, of russia. and then that immediate slowdown that we talked about in europe that then picked back up as we exited q1. and we did see that momentum as we exited q1.
but i wouldn't highlight anything specific. certainly, the success that we are seeing in construction is helping. but remember, construction, while it's an explosive growth area for us, on the whole, it's still a smaller part of our business. so, that strength is contributing to overall partner strength, but we are also seeing just broad-based strength through the core of our business as well.
joe vruwink -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
ok. great. and then i will ask another macro question. but can you maybe contrast the business environment we have been in late february onward? it sounds like, ultimately, trends have been good and stable.
contrast that with last fall. obviously, inflationary pressures still around. they haven't abated. we are layering on some incremental macro things, but it's stability now as opposed to some moderation last fall, maybe differences or what you see is contributing to the stability more recently.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. well, if you remember back in the fall, i talked a lot about some of our customers being caught off-guard by the rapid inflation and supply chain difficulties. so, some of our customers were on fixed bid contracts. and fixed bid contracts, when your cost of goods are going up, are really a serious issue for their businesses.
so, their businesses were feeling a lot of pinch. manufacturers were able to pass the cost through to their customers directly, aec customers less so. so, manufacturers suffered more from some of the supply chain things. what you are seeing now is customers -- they are not surprised by this.
they know how to bid the contract. so, there is a general kind of bidding parity out there, and people are building in inflationary impacts into their bids and into their projects. so, that creates a much more stable environment for them with regards to having a book of projects that are -- having their margins deteriorate rapidly and some that you want to get to that have better margins. so, what they are seeing right now is just a better spectrum of margins across the projects.
that's one key thing that contributes to the stability. does that make sense?
joe vruwink -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
it does. yes. thank you.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
and we fully expected them to do that.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from keith weiss of morgan stanley. your line is open.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. congrats, and thanks for taking the question. very nice quarter. maybe following on that last question, really a two-parter.
one, debbie, when you are talking to us about the full-year guidance, it seems like we are adjusting for currency. that's just about it. it doesn't sound like we are adjusting the forecast down for anticipation of any macro weakness or any further weakening of demand trends. so, one, i just wanted to clarify that side of the equation.
and then two, if demand does weaken and you do see the macro impacts kind of catching up with all -- in software land, what's the reaction on sort of the spending side of the equation? is the philosophy that we are looking to protect free cash flows, or is it the market opportunity is too big, and we really need to keep investing for growth, and we are going to look to sustain and take advantage of your balance sheet to be able to sustain that investment and get ahead of your competitors? i am trying to understand kind of your philosophy on how you view potential demand slowdown. thank you.
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
thanks. keith, lots to unpack there. so, if i got lost a little bit as i go, please keep me on it. let's start with the guidance.
the impact to the guidance that we are talking about today relates to fx and russia. you said fx, but it also includes russia. there is no change to the underlying business assumptions for the rest of our business, and that's because we haven't seen a change in the demand environment for the rest of our business. as a matter of fact, although we saw a bit of a slowdown focused mostly on europe at the onset of the invasion of ukraine, we saw a bounce back, and we really exited q1 with momentum.
and so, that gives us confidence as we look to the rest of this year. and we have built into our guidance assumptions that reflect the demand that we saw as we exited q1. and then when we think about margin, remember that with the subscription business model, we have a very resilient business model. even with the adjustment to revenue for russia, it was only about a point of our total revenue, we let that flow through to operating margins because we want to make sure that we are not doing any kind of knee-jerk reaction on spend.
we think it's important to continue to invest to make sure that we can further our strategy. i don't think -- i don't see a scenario at this point where if the world -- or the economy were to deteriorate even further that we would see substantial further pressure on operating margins because of that resilient business model. but of course, we are going to manage our business in the best way possible.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
and this is absolutely the right time to invest in the business. when you are a business of our size with our resilience and our footprint, and you are up against smaller, less resilient, more challenged competitors, you invest. you invest. you pull ahead of the competition.
you keep focused on the things you are trying to do. you expand your category leadership. you solidify category leadership in other places. we have got category leadership in 3d for bim, which is a very important growth segment in aec.
we have got category leadership for design through construction, in the construction space, deals like deals like bravida, aecom, besix. these are all people trying to buy into this connected ai-driven cloud-based design through construction environment. that's the category we are in, and we are kind of already the king. so, this is the perfect time to continue to invest.
it helps you lap the competition. the competition will be able to invest to the same degree. i think this is not the time you pull back, right, especially given the underlying strength of our business. it's solid.
you can see it. we have got the multiple vectors of resiliency here and the kind of nice portfolio of options that we can leverage. i am definitely in a mindset that investment is good for us.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. that's super clear, and long term, i think that makes sense.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from steve koenig of smbc nikko. your line is open.
steve koenig -- smbc nikko securities -- analyst
hey, andrew. hey, debbie. thanks for taking my question. debbie, i have a cold, too, and it's not covid.
so, we are in the same boat. so, hope you get better soon here. i wanted to -- i may have missed it and apologize if i did. but can you give us a little more specifics on when you saw business start to bounce back in emea, was it right at the end of the quarter? was it a week after? was it a little before? and yes -- and then i have got one more for you, debbie.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. actually, it was fairly short-term after the initial invasion. it was within weeks, all right. it wasn't like it was a long thing.
it fell off. it slowed down a bit as the invasion started. and then within a few weeks, it was rising back up again and back up to where it had started. so, it didn't take that long.
it surprised us, honestly.
steve koenig -- smbc nikko securities -- analyst
and was it -- i was trying to parse your earlier statements. was it kind of balanced between new business and renewals, or was it kind of more one or the other?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
renewal stayed strength -- strong throughout the entire cycle, all right. so, renewals kept building as the quarter progressed. there was never a slowdown in renewal momentum. a matter of fact, if anything, it just kept strengthening and strengthening, all right.
it was only in the new business part that we saw a slowdown post invasion that recovered. so, no, renewals just kept building.
steve koenig -- smbc nikko securities -- analyst
yes. got it. ok. great.
and then for my follow-up, and actually either of you are welcome to answer this as you see fit. so, you raised prices at the end of march, and i am sure that's all embedded in your guidance. and it allows you to invest appropriately and get to the margins you want. how do you think about in this inflationary environment your internal compensation trajectory and also what you are doing with partners? and how does inflation affect your plans there? what do you have to tweak or finesse to -- you have very high employee retention, you have very good rates.
so, how do you maintain that? thanks, and i appreciate taking my questions.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. so, let me -- because there is two questions there. first, let me comment on the price increases so that we are all on the same page here. the price increases were highly targeted to certain parts of the world where we had artificially suppressed the price below our long-term goal of having standard euro, u.s., and yen-denominated pricing.
so, what you are seeing is, in certain places, we are raising prices to equalize so that we can get to this kind of standard-based pricing that simplifies some of our go-to-market practices. so, we had some artificially suppressed prices in regions, and that's what was going on there, ok? it's -- there is no change in our standard pricing policy. in fact, places like europe did not see a price increase, all right. so, i just want to be clear, we are all on the same page with regards to pricing and the things associated with that.
now, with regards to inflationary pressures and uncertainty in employment area, but we are no different, all right. we see pressure in terms of employee compensation and trying to help our employees navigate an increasingly inflationary environment. we increased our raised pool. we increased our bonus this year.
and equally important, we are increasing our stock-based compensation, and you will probably see us continue to increase our stock-based compensation for our employee base. so, these moves were made and baked into the year well ahead of the start of the year to ensure that we were able to meet our employees or at least try to meet our employees where they were at. but we will certainly continue to look at our pay position. we will probably continue to see some pressure there in terms of staying competitive.
we are retaining employees at high rates. we will also continue to use stock-based compensation more robustly and more broadly within the organization, which we think is good for the company, good for investors, and good for employees.
steve koenig -- smbc nikko securities -- analyst
it sounds good. thanks very much, andrew.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from bhavin shah of deutsche bank. your line is open.
bhavin shah -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions and i will focus my question to andrew and say debbie both of course. andrew, just hoping to get to the call, you noted the robust competitive performance during the quarter. can you maybe just elaborate on this? what verticals or products are seeing better success or even improved win rates? and what's driving some of this?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. well, it's basically every sector. i mean, every one of our industries, we are growing faster than our competitors, all right. so, we are taking share as we are selling more seats in some highly competitive industries.
so, you are seeing us doing well in aec. you are seeing us doing well in manufacturing, both on seat counts and revenue counts, which i think is really important because you want to watch both of those performances. we even did quite nicely in media entertainment year over year. so, we are absolutely seeing broad-based competitive performance.
i mean, obviously, one of the places that we all watch is construction, too. in construction, if you look at the kind of the raw make numbers, we grew 24% year over year. but you got to remember, some of that construction that make opportunity is actually in the ebas, which are counted a design. so, when you look at our total make performance and taking that -- those eba impacts where we kind of put -- make components into the ebas, we grew into the mid-30s.
and construction cloud monthly active usage grew slightly north of 30%. this is all great, solid competitive performance. aec -- construction cloud of its best new business growth quarter. international growth for construction cloud was significantly higher than its regular growth.
we are lighting up the channel in the mid-market. we are kind of solidifying our category leader position in this design through construction position. essentially, anybody else in this player -- this space is kind of outside that category. they are very niche, or there is being -- waiting for the industry to move on and move past them.
so, i think we are in a very strong competitive position right now. i think it's our job to continue to maintain that. but it was across all the industries we serve.
bhavin shah -- deutsche bank -- analyst
super helpful. and thanks for that color. and just one quick follow-up. it was really interesting to see that large eba deal include innovyze, and these are good things here as well.
where are you on your integration plans just with this solution? and where are you in terms of evolving the product set here? and how do we just think about the pipeline of customers who are looking to leverage some of your water-based products?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yes. look, we have made really great progress integrating innovyze in. the company was fairly similar to us when we bought them. so, there is a lot of things that are rapidly getting integrated.
of course, there are some product integration pieces and some back-office systems that are still kind of working through some of the integrations. but in terms of integration, that's not a barrier right now to where we are at with innovyze. one of the things that's exciting about what innovyze does is it's already kind of fulfill the end-to-end vision for water that we have for construction and manufacturing. it goes everywhere from design all the way to operate.
and it has some fairly sophisticated cloud-based tools for water infrastructure operators, sewage treatment operators, other water infrastructure operators that allow them to actually manage the facilities once they have been put into operations. so, it's a very robust solution. it covers a very broad piece of it, and it fits incredibly nicely into our portfolio, both story-wise; strategy-wise; and, frankly, sales motion-wise.

thank you for standing by, and welcome to autodesk first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. after the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. to ask a question.
[operator instructions] i would now like to hand the call over to your host, vp, investor relations, simon mays-smith. please go ahead.
simon mays-smith -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, operator, and good afternoon. thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the first-quarter results of our fiscal '23. on the line with me are andrew anagnost, our ceo; and debbie clifford, our cfo. today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast.
in addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com/investor. you will find the earnings press release, slide presentation, and transcript of today's opening commentary on our investor relations website following this call. during this call, we may make forward-looking statements about our outlook, future results, and related assumptions, acquisitions, products, and product capabilities and strategies. these statements reflect our best judgment based on currently known factors.
actual events or results could differ materially. please refer to our sec filings, including our most recent form 10-k and the form 8-k filed with today's press release, for important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. if this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information.
autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. during the call, we will quote several numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance. unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. all non-gaap numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in our press release or excel financials and other supplemental materials available on our investor relations website.
and now, i will turn the call over to andrew. 
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you, simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. today, we reported record first-quarter revenue, non-gaap operating margin, and free cash flow fueled by strong demand and a robust, competitive performance. the structural growth drivers for our business that were critical to our performance during the pandemic, such as flexibility and agility, continue to support and propel us during elevated macroeconomic, geopolitical, and policy uncertainty. these growth drivers further cement the important role we play in our customers' digital transformation and increase our confidence in our strategy.
our steady strategy; industry-leading products, platform, and business model innovation; sustained and focused investment; and strong execution are creating additional opportunities for autodesk. by accelerating the convergence of workflows within and between the industries we serve, we create broader and deeper partnerships with existing customers and bring new customers into our ecosystem. a prime example of this is infrastructure. the combination of revit, civil 3d, navisworks, autodesk bim collaborate pro, infraworks, and more recently, autodesk construction cloud and innovyze delivers industry-leading end-to-end capabilities in transportation and water from planning and design to construction and operations.
and our customers can extend those capabilities through our partnerships with aurigo in capital planning and esri in geospatial mapping. this is important because governments and asset owners across the globe are investing growing amounts in next-generation infrastructure to meet the societal and environmental needs of the next century and are retooling now to do it. that equals opportunity for autodesk. for example, in the first quarter, we signed our second largest eba ever with a large global infrastructure company in a deal that included innovyze and autodesk build for the first time.
across autodesk, we are focused on unifying more common data and fluidly connecting more workflows in the cloud in ways that delight our customers and lead them to new, more efficient, and more sustainable ways of working. and by doing that, we will move beyond carbon neutrality for ourselves to transform our customers' carbon footprint. together, we can design and make a better world for all that advances equitable access to the in-demand skills of the future. before i turn the call over to debbie to take you through the details of our financial performance and outlook, i want to update you on important decisions we made about our business in russia.
you will recall that the invasion of ukraine occurred hours before our last earnings call. in light of the conflict, we halted all of our new and renewal business in russia on march 3. we strongly believe this decision was the right thing to do and that it is in our long-term interest, even though it comes at a cost, which debbie will detail in a moment. of course, our immediate focus remains on the safety and well-being of our employees in the region, and we continue to monitor the situation closely.
beyond the immediate impact in russia, other leading indicators trend positive. for example, usage remained steady in europe during the quarter and grew in america and asia-pacific region, building connected bid activity again hit record levels, and our partner channel remains optimistic. the strong momentum sets us up well for the remainder of the year. debbie, now over to you to take everyone through the details of our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year, i will come back afterwards to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives.
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
thanks, andrew. q1 was a strong quarter driven by broad-based strength across products and regions. if we compare the revenue result versus guidance, the outperformance was due to that strength, as well as the upfront revenue in a large eba, which we had forecasted would close later in the year. total revenue grew 18% and 17% in constant currency.
by product, autocad and autocad lt revenue grew 21%; aec revenue grew 17%; manufacturing revenue grew 14%; and m&e revenue grew 24%. by region, revenue grew 24% in the americas, 17% in emea, and 10% in apac. direct revenue increased 22% and represented 34% of total revenue, up 1 percentage point from last year due to strength in both enterprise and e-commerce. our product subscription renewal rates remained at record highs and our net revenue retention rate was comfortably within our 100% to 110% target range.
billings increased 16% to $1.1 billion, reflecting robust underlying demand. total deferred revenue grew 12% to $3.7 billion. total rpo of $4.7 billion and current rpo of $3.1 billion grew 11% and 10% respectively, reflecting strong billings growth, and as i flagged last quarter, the timing and volume of multiyear contracts, which are typically on a three-year cycle. turning to the p&l, non-gaap gross margin remained broadly level at 92%, while non-gaap operating margin increased by 6 percentage points to approximately 34%, reflecting strong revenue growth and ongoing cost discipline.
gaap operating margins increased by 4 percentage points to approximately 18%. as andrew mentioned, we delivered record first-quarter free cash flow of $422 million, up 34% year over year, reflecting strong billings growth in both q4 and q1. with the broad equity market pullback in q1 and our strong cash position, we again accelerated our share repurchasing during the quarter. we purchased 2.1 million shares for $436 million at an average price of approximately $212 per share, which contributed to a reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $2 million.
while our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged, you can expect that we will continue to invest organically and inorganically to drive growth. over the last two quarters, we have proactively used our strong liquidity to accelerate repurchasing and will continue to be opportunistic in doing so when market conditions allow for it. now, let me finish with guidance. the overall headline is that the underlying business conditions that we've been seeing are unchanged save for russia and the continued strengthening of the u.s.
dollar. our business continues to perform well and to post top-line growth ahead of our peers. as you can imagine, we are keeping a close eye on the geopolitical, macroeconomic, and policy environments. but against that backdrop in q1, renewal rates remain strong, multiyear billings were in line with our expectations, and we exited the quarter with strong momentum.
as we look ahead and as with previous quarters, we are assuming that market conditions in fiscal '23 are consistent with recent quarters. the decision to halt our new and renewal business in russia had a direct impact on our outlook. billings decreased by approximately $115 million, revenue by $40 million, and free cash flow by $80 million. of course, we are not satisfied with that outcome, and we will work hard to mitigate the impact by accelerating our channel evolution, customer retention, and digital growth initiatives and by doubling down on early successes from recent acquisitions like innovyze.
beyond russia, the u.s. dollar continued to strengthen during q1. while we benefit from a robust hedging program, the pace of fx volatility has been incredibly rapid, and it's having an impact on our fiscal '23 outlook, reducing billings, revenue, and free cash flow by approximately $80 million, $20 million and $50 million, respectively. bringing these factors together, we expect fiscal '23 revenue to be between $4.96 billion and $5.06 billion.
we expect non-gaap operating margin to increase 400 basis points year over year to approximately 36%, reflecting 1 point of impact from removing russia from our forecast. we expect free cash flow to be between $2.0 billion and $2.08 billion. the slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for q2 and full-year fiscal '23. the volatile global environment has reinforced the structural growth drivers underpinning our strategy give us confidence in our long-term growth potential.
we continue to target double-digit revenue growth, non-gaap operating margins in the 38% to 40% range, and double-digit free cash flow growth on a compound annual basis. these metrics are intended to provide a floor to our revenue growth ambitions and a ceiling to our spend growth expectations. andrew, back to you.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you, debbie. our strategy is to transform the industries we serve with end-to-end, cloud-based solutions that drive efficiency and sustainability for our customers. our business is scalable and extensible into adjacent verticals: from architecture and engineering through construction and owners, from product engineering to product data management and product manufacturing. it is also scalable and extensible between verticals with industrialized construction and into new workflows like xr.
by accelerating the convergence of workloads within and between the industries we serve, we are also creating broader and deeper partnerships with existing customers and bringing new customers into our ecosystem. for example, in aec, aecom is the world's most trusted infrastructure consulting firm that delivers professional services throughout the project lifecycle from planning, design, and engineering to program and construction management. with growing investment in infrastructure, customers are increasingly seeking both efficiency and sustainability to meet esg goals such as net-zero carbon, resiliency, quality of life, social impact, and safety. this aligns aecom and its customers closely with autodesk's values and capabilities.
in q1, aecom renewed and increased its eba with autodesk. the renewal promotes further platform standardization and now extends from design further into build with the addition of autodesk construction cloud and from bridges and tunnels to water with the addition of innovyze. across the globe, our customers are seeking to connect and streamline their workflows. as we enable our partner network to distribute autodesk construction cloud, we serve more of that growing demand.
for example, bravida, which is based in sweden, is a leading provider of technical end-to-end consulting design, installation, and service solutions across the nordic region, focusing on efficiency and sustainability. it is responsible for the installation of fire sprinklers, ventilation, electrics, and safety systems in the tunnels of the stockholm bypass project, the largest infrastructure project in sweden's history. having adopted autodesk's aec collection and realizing 50% cost savings and a significant reduction in carbon dioxide using revit in the design phase of the project, bravida was looking for a complementary system to seamlessly connect the build phase. adopting autodesk build enable it to connect office and field data and workflows in the cloud, standardize and track projects accurately and manage procurement and logistics, health and safety and cost more effectively and efficiently.
with the launch of autodesk build, the introduction of an account-based pricing business model, distribution through our channel partners, and giving subcontractors the ability to have their own instance of their data, we are connecting more workflows, both within construction and between adjacent workflows in design, preconstruction and operations and maintenance. after evaluating various project management solutions for more than a year, donohoe construction company, a top mid-market gc in washington, d.c., chose autodesk build to seamlessly connect project, site, and cost management workflows. autodesk's industry-leading cost management system, which is integrated into and included with autodesk build, is anticipated to enable donohoe to control change order management and reporting much more seamlessly with its project and site management workflows. we are excited to partner with donohoe to build a sustainable future together.
we are investing in autodesk construction cloud to do even more. for example, we launched bridge to enable subcontractors to have their own instance of their data, a critical factor in improving their business processes. we are also rapidly integrating proest so that estimates can be pushed to the cost module in autodesk build, enabling it to automatically create a budget. with strong growth from autodesk build and the benefit of recently launched acc bundles for preconstruction and construction operations, autodesk construction cloud reported its best-ever new business growth quarter, with an increasing proportion of that growth coming from emea and apac and growing contract size and renewal rates.
turning to manufacturing, we sustained strong momentum in our manufacturing portfolio this quarter as we connected more workflows beyond the design studio, developed more on-ramps to our manufacturing platform, and delivered new powerful tools and functionality through fusion 360 extensions. as we connect and develop new workflows in the cloud and provide more ways for customers to use our products, we have the opportunity to renew engagement with some of our legacy customers. for example, a high-tech manufacturer in germany, which has been using autodesk software since 1991, was using inventor software purchased in 2018. by updating from a perpetual license to a product design and manufacturing collection subscription in q1, the team will benefit from significant process and performance improvements, which alleviate mechanical engineering bottlenecks and better serve its high-demand periods.
because of its familiarity with autodesk, the customer enabled these improvements immediately and leveraged its existing ip without migration. we are happy to have them back on our latest and most secure software. in automotive, we continue to grow our footprint beyond the design studio into manufacturing as automotive oems seek to break down work silos and shorten handoff and design cycles. enovate motors, an electric vehicle manufacturer in china, added product design and manufacturing collections on top of its alias and vred subscriptions to achieve a seamless digital workflow across design and manufacturing.
enovate will be able to build higher quality cars more efficiently by connecting workloads in the cloud that enable more collaboration and better data integrity. our fusion 360 platform approach enables customers to seamlessly connect workflows while also delivering powerful tools and functionality to those that needed through extensions. for example, an educational toy manufacturer based in the u.s. started using fusion 360 about a year ago and quickly recognized the impact working on the cloud would have on its ability to collaborate across sites between product design and product engineering.
q1 was able to seamlessly activate manage, nesting, and product design extensions within the fusion 360 user interface, giving access to even more powerful tools and functionality to those that needed it. for example, the fusion 360 manage extension unlocks additional data management functionality to manage design changes at any stage of production with the click of a button using pre-built workflows. fusion 360's commercial subscribers grew steadily, ending the quarter with 198,000 subscribers with demand for our new extensions, including machining, generative design, and nesting and fabrication, continuing to grow at an exceptional pace. outside of commercial use, our education partnerships are helping students learn the in-demand skills of the future.
for example, government tool room and training center, or gttc, is a premier vocational institution in india, with 6,000 students across 28 campuses. q1 gttc adopted fusion 360 and its tool and die making courses, because it was easy for students to learn, spanned the entire course from conceptual design through simulation to fabrication, and gave students hands-on experience with next-generation workflows such as generative design, 3d printing for additive manufacturing and digital simulation and generation of g-code outputs. and finally, we continue to bring more users into our ecosystem through business model innovation and license compliance initiatives. besix is a multidisciplinary firm whose contracts in construction, infrastructure, and machine works often have a high level of complexity.
to support its standardization effort across all projects of regions, the besix group uses bim collaborate pro and docs to collaborate on revit projects in a secure common data environment. for additional security and efficiency, it now leverages our premium plan in flex. by better understanding its usage through the enhanced reporting functions within our premium plant, it can provide access to occasional users through flex while realizing the additional security benefits of single sign-on across its global employee base. we continue to work with our customers to maximize their access to current and secure versions of our software.
for example, an international research institution in europe, which is both students and employees, was mistakenly using education subscriptions for commercial use cases. by partnering with their leadership, we ensured the relevant departments had access to the necessary tools by combining subscriptions to our industry collections with flex tokens. the collaborative approach resulted in a compliance deal of over 1 million euros. during the quarter, we closed eight deals over $500,000 of our license compliances, two of which were over $1 million.
let me finish with the story. i recently visited the futures exhibition at smithsonian institution in washington. i highly recommend visiting if you are in the area this summer before it closes in mid-july. it is the smithsonian's first buildingwide exploration of the future.
autodesk partnered with smithsonian to create an interactive experience called future communities that brings visitors together to build a sustainable community block using analytics and goal-driven design with autodesk generative design technology. guests collaborate both with each other and ai, adjusting the input they deem most important. each guest takes on a different persona with specific goals and input factors, which include social, ecological, and economic considerations, ranging from availability of green space and low-carbon transportation to the reach of public services and employment opportunities. the evolving community block is displayed in real-time, and the technology showcases the types of trade-offs necessary to achieve various outcomes.
the exhibit structure was generally designed to be strong and lightweight, using sustainable materials and modular space frame components that can be easily assembled and disassembled for minimum construction waste. the exhibit not only represents autodesk vision of the future, that of collaborative and connected workflows and data in the cloud that designs and makes a better world for all, that meets the challenges posed by carbon, water, and waste, and that advances equity and access to the in-demand skills of the future. but in addition, the exhibit represents a very diverse set of visions for how the future may unfold. the one thing they share is an unwavering sense of optimism about what we can all accomplish together.
every day, our goal is to empower innovators with design and make technology that turns their vision into reality, helping them to achieve the new possible. i share this story because it gives me great confidence in the future of autodesk and our vision of a better world, design, and made for all. operator, we would now like to open the call for questions.

[operator instructions] please stand by while we compile the q&a roster. our first question comes from the line of saket kalia of barclays. saket kalia, your line is open.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
ok, great. hey, andrew, hey, debbie. thanks for taking my questions here.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
how are you, saket?
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
excellent. same here. andrew, maybe first for you. maybe we'll start [inaudible] i wondered if you could expand a little bit on the comment around moving from products to platforms that we can all talk about [inaudible] as the platform has evolved.
but maybe you can just walk us through what that looks like in the future in terms of a platform from your perspective?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. i want to be careful not to give away all the au tidbits in some of those discussions. but it's an important question. saket, i -- to put it in perspective, right now, we sell literally hundreds of products.
and the challenges for our customers is trying to find out which one of these products solves which problems for them and also the fact that a lot of these products don't talk to each other very easily. so when you're selling hundreds of products, it's really difficult to connect data flows across all those capabilities. it's also really difficult to uniformly deliver multi-platform support, multi-device support, cloud computing, and ai automation, which is really challenging. so what we're doing is we're moving away from this kind of disconnected portfolio of products to really a set of platforms to target each one of our industries with some underlying core technologies that support all of it.
that will enable us to actually deploy capabilities to our customers as they need them for particular types of process, right, advanced manufacturing capabilities on a time-bound basis or a consumption basis, accumulation capabilities on a time-bound basis or a consumption basis. so they get access to what they need when they need it, and it's all unified from a data flow point of view. this is kind of going to be revolutionary for a lot of our customers in terms of the evolution and where we're taking them. so it's really valuable for our customers in terms of connecting how they work and the value they get from each one of our products.
and it's really important to us in terms of delivering more layers of automation and power to them to the cloud. so it is a journey. it's not going to happen overnight, but fusion is an excellent example of where we're going and how we could deploy some of these things to our customers, especially when you look at the way extensions work, consumption works on top of the fusion platform. it's a good model for where we're taking industry platforms for each one of our industries.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
got it, got it. that's really helpful. and it sounds like it will be exciting at au. debbie, a follow-up for you.
can you just talk a little bit about the multiyear [inaudible] business? how are those renewals? i know they're starting to trickle in from three years ago in a bigger way. how are those renewals kind of coming in versus your expectations? and maybe looking forward, how do you plan on phasing that option out, i think, [inaudible]
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
sure. so, we continue to track the multiyear cohort closely. our proportional volume for multiyear has been in line with our expectations for the first half of fiscal '23, so that gives us confidence in our fiscal '23 outlook. we also saw long-term deferred revenue as a percent of total deferred revenue tick up.
that, too, was in line with our expectations. as we look ahead to the transition from upfront to annual billings, well, it hasn't started yet. we anticipate that the transition's going to start in early fiscal '24, and we continue to work through the programmatic and operational details to get there, things like a partner transition plan, back-office system upgrades. but i'll say again, it's our bias to go as quickly as possible.
in the meantime, obviously, we're focused on closing out this year, making sure that those multiyears come in consistent with historical patterns. and the fact that they are is giving us that confidence as we look to achieve our goals for this year.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
got it. very clear. thanks guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of phil winslow of credit suisse. phil winslow, your line is open.
phil winslow -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks for taking my question, and congrats on another quarter, reinforcing how autodesk grows is simply not as cyclical anymore. andrew, i wanted to focus on the aec side because this is the area that i get the most questions on in terms of cyclicality, with two questions of my own for you. firstly, what are you hearing from design customers in this segment about what continues to drive your incremental spending on autodesk despite the cloudier macro? and then secondly, the 45% quarter-to-quarter growth in autodesk build maus in the slide deck and your commentary on just the buildingconnected volumes also really stood out to us. similarly, what are you hearing from these construction customers about why they also continue to lean in on digitizing their workloads in spite of the macro? or is this becoming because of the macro volatility that they're digitizing? thanks.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
that was a multi-part question. i will address it. so first off, let's talk about what we're hearing from design customers. the no.
1 thing we're hearing from the design segment is the backlog of business, right? they have more business right now than they're able to effectively execute on. and the requirements of that business are increasing in terms of what kind of tools they need to use, how they need to approach the problems, owners, municipalities, all sorts of customers they deal with are putting more requirements on how they have to work. so they're all looking to kind of up their game in digital tools. the biggest challenge we hear from these customers is hiring, frankly.
we were hearing last year a lot of conversations about, oh boy, fixed bid contracts and inflationary pressures and all these things. as i've said previously, they bake these things now into their business bids and they're able to capture those costs in their contracts. but what they're struggling with is hiring. we're still growing even if they struggle to hire because they're getting people in but they have more demand for manpower and person power than they actually are able to capture at this point, ok? so that's something we're hearing really robustly.
now, let's go to the growth in construction. first off, i want to give you my quarterly disclaimer. when you look at the construction business, the make number does not capture the full story in the construction business. the eba growth in the design bucket.
so when you count how we're doing with our enterprise business agreements and the overall territory business, that we grew close to 30% in that business. so that's really quite nice growth. and what we're hearing, and i'm glad you picked up on the 45% growth on monthly active users, we're hearing a couple of things. one, first off, we've lit up our territory business, our partners in the territory.
this is driving a lot of really nice growth in the u.s. and in europe, and it's going to continue to drive that growth. and that's bringing us closer to certain customers lower down in the market, the mid-market and below, which i think is a really important point in our journey, ok? the other thing i want to talk about is when customers are starting to realize is they need a lot more than just a project management or a construction site management tool. they really are looking to their future where they're trying to connect the design and the build all the way together continuously.
and one of the big linchpins in all of that is preconstruction planning. the vast majority of the cost and complexity of a construction project is built in during the preconstruction planning phase. you get that wrong, you bid wrong, you come in with lower margins, you have more churn and complexity in your project. so this connection between design, preconstruction all the way to build is increasingly really important to their customers.
so customers are taking a lot more time to evaluate what they're trying to invest in. and i think you also probably noticed, at least a little bit in the introductory commentary, that infrastructure is a big play for us here. so department of transportation, and you saw indiana, the indiana department of transportation lean into our portfolio for looking at their future needs. we're hearing more and more from departments of transportation that are really looking to upgrade and modify their stack to be much more designed to build on a much more modern cloud infrastructure.
so there's a lot going on in construction, phil, and it's coming at us from multiple directions, and right now, it's all positive.
phil winslow -- credit suisse -- analyst
awesome. appreciate all the details. thank you, and keep up the great work.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thanks, phil.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of jay vleeschhouwer of griffin securities. jay vleeschhouwer, your line is open.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
good evening, andrew, debbie, and simon. andrew, you have, by our calculation, the largest r&d budget in your peer group, but you don't necessarily have the largest headcount in r&d. and so the question is, particularly given your earlier comment about the large number of products that you're currently developing and having to manage, how you see or how are you working on improving your r&d productivity or effectivity, if you will, in terms of your core platform, your applications technology and ultimately, product usability to drive maus and further enlarging the installed base? and then for debbie, you commented earlier with respect to your back-office as part of your initiatives over the next number of years. on that point, could you comment on where you are in terms of your operational capacity for the new licensing model and deliverables that you're going to have as you have an increasingly complex offering to customers in terms of flex and everything else you're doing, the platform andrew mentioned? are you, in fact, going to have the requisite back office to handle all of that?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
all right. so, jay, let me start with your questions. yeah, you are correct. we have the largest r&d budget but we don't necessarily have the largest headcount on r&d.
part of that is because of where we concentrate on r&d and what kind of talent we're pursuing. we're pursuing a lot of cloud talent, a lot of cloud-native talent, full staff development talent that allows us to build out the core cloud capabilities and continue to expand them. that talent resides in certain places, and it has certain costs associated with it and we think that's the right strategy. we don't hire a lot of r&d content headcount that's associated specifically with customer-specific development in, say, other parts of the world.
so we do hire in specific areas because of what we're trying to do. and when it comes to developer productivity, you hit on a really important aspect of why do we have platform services. why are we extending the depth and breadth of the things that we build in the platform services? one of the reasons we're doing that is to lift the burden away from some of these development teams on things like data flow, on things like visualization and capabilities that should be uniform across every platform or product that we -- or capability that we deploy. so more and more, as you see these -- the portfolio of platform capabilities not only mature but expand, it's going to increase the productivity of the teams that are looking at features that are facing particular industries and capabilities that are facing particular industries.
it's a big part of why we have these services, and we're already starting to see some of those benefits, especially with regards to data flow, which is an initiative driven primarily by the platform organization within autodesk. and it's being aligned across the various industries to make sure that we get the right kind of synergies and lift from our data apis and our data connectivity. so, yeah, you will see increasing productivity associated with this. we're definitely spending on quality over quantity, and i think that's the right strategy for where we're at right now.
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
and then jay, to answer your question about operational capacity for things like new business model, i would say that we are well on our way on this journey but we still have some ground to cover in order to be where we need to be. and i think that that's an appropriate place to be at this stage of the journey. now, of course, we don't launch new business models without the ability to support them, which is why, as one example, we are delaying the shift to annual billings until next year so that we can spend the time that we need to be able to invest in our back-office systems to make sure that we have a good customer experience and that we have the right controls and automated capabilities in the back office. i mean, ultimately, this is something that we focus on not only to make sure that we have the capacity to support new business models but also so we can scale.
if we want to achieve our long-term growth aspirations, we need to continue to invest in our back-office infrastructure in order to be able to scale efficiently, effectively and in an automated way to do it.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
ok. thank you very much.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you, jay.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of matt hedberg of rbc capital markets. your question please, matt hedberg.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hey, thanks, guys. andrew, for you, the growth in fusion 360 was really fantastic to hear. can you talk about sort of where those subs are coming from? are these greenfields? are they replacements? and maybe just a little bit more on sort of with a lot of alternatives, why fusion 360?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. so first half is a bit of a mix, all right? a lot of these are greenfield investors acquiring design software connected to manufacturing software for the first time. but there's a lot of rip and replace going on. i think you've probably heard me talk many times about how we're going into accounts where people might have a seat of solidworks and a seat of mastercam or some kind of other cam software and they're saying, ""well, fusion is all i need."" and we're -- we've been consistently creating and growing subscribers from that type of business.
but what we're seeing more and more, and i think this is one of the things that is important about the user growth you're seeing, is that where we've gone in and we've started some department or part of a particular company, we're starting to grow the installed base within those companies. so we're still bringing in new customers, primarily along this design to make vector, but we're starting to grow within the accounts we've captured. this is the kind of flywheel you'd like to see as you start to mature a business, and we're starting to see some of that. the reason people buy is there is there's three kind of vectors here that people pay attention to: one, of course, is the price.
the pricing model for fusion is disruptive. it's native subscription-based. it's not a reimagining of an existing perpetual business. it's a native subscription-based business.
it has extensions and things and consumptive models that allow people to pay for what they use and manage how much it costs from the use of software. they love that. two, they love the design to make integration, the end-to-end integration from the design process all the way to actually programming and driving the machine on the shop floor. this kind of merger and convergence of design and make something that's really valuable to a lot of people.
and the third thing might surprise you a little bit. it's our youtube community. it's the amount of content that's out there on youtube, which by the way, exceeds even much more mature products that are out there in the market, where people cannot only learn how to do something in fusion, they can learn how to do it exceptionally in fusion. it's a very passionate, very engaged, and really very knowledgeable community that's publishing all this content.
and people really buy for those reasons. they buy for the disruptive business model, they buy for the design make integration and they buy for the fact that they can find just a tutorial about just about anything you can think of to get really expert level in the product.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
that's super, super helpful. and then debbie, the consistency is obviously really good to see. the macroenvironment, this is not easy, clearly, but the consistency was great. i'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the linearity in the quarter.
and maybe what are you seeing thus far in august?
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
so the linearity that we saw during the quarter is consistent with what we've seen in previous periods. i would say nothing newsworthy to report there. and obviously, at this point, we're not commenting on what we're seeing in august.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from adam borg of stifel. your line is open, adam borg.
adam borg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
guys, and thanks so much for taking the question. maybe just first for andrew on the infrastructure bill. i know that's something we talked about in the past and the positive tailwinds that could have for autodesk. so maybe just a quick update here.
and then as i think about the recently passed inflation reduction act, there's a lot of language in there about clean energy and sustainability. i'd love to hear how you think about that impacting autodesk over time as well.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. and so first, let's talk about the infrastructure bill. as with any of these goals and like i've said in the past, the money is slowly trickling out, all right? and what you're seeing is people are actually starting to begin the process of planning around particular types of projects. but more importantly, what's happening is a lot of the recipients of some of these funds, particularly departments of transportation, are starting to rethink how they're approaching their design processes.
and by the way, energy efficiency and sustainability play into how they think about some of these things. so remember, there was a seed money in that bill to enable departments of transportation to explore and expand digital transformation in their processes. this is bringing about a lot of introspection and thought within these departments. and they're starting to look at their next 10-year portfolio of tools.
and they're looking to buy ahead of their ability to plan and execute some of these infrastructure projects. we are absolutely seeing that early activity with regards to our relationship with large firms like aecom that engage in the infrastructure and how they're going to engage over the next 10 years and departments of transportation that have similar challenges and similar needs over the next 10-year period, ok? so that's something we're seeing live. now with regards to the inflation reduction act, the jury is out on that, all right? anything that drives energy efficiency and sustainability is ultimately going to trickle down into what the requirements are for some of our customers, especially when electrification is becoming so important. so you're going to see a lot more electrification and efficiency spec for our customers.
but unclear where that will fall with regards to impact on our business.
adam borg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great. and maybe just a quick follow-up, even on matt's question on fusion 360. just on manufacturing more broadly, we'd love to hear more about upchain and how that fits in the broader strategy you've been talking about here with fusion 360 today. thank you, guys.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. so upchain is the data management layer that's cloud-native that allows us to actually not only manage the flow of fusion information environment but any other heterogeneous data that might exist in the environment. all of our customers live in a heterogeneous world. we will never have a customer that is uniformly using just an autodesk product or just autodesk's portfolio.
so not only does upchain bring us cloud-native data management but it also brings us heterogeneous management of this data and the ability to manage this flow and reconcile things in the cloud, which has huge power for how people use data management in the future. if you look at the evolution of upchain, it's going to more and more just merge with some of the fusion life cycle and fusion managed capabilities we already have and will become the native cloud data management platform for fusion. so that's where upchain plays. it's basically a deep and wide native data management platform in the cloud for us.
adam borg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
excellent. thanks, again.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
you're very welcome.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from joe vruwink of baird. your question please, joe vruwink.
joe vruwink -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
great. thank you. i guess i'll stick on manufacturing because i think to get 16% growth there, the desktop products have to be contributing at a pretty high level. what's been the driver of success there? and then you shared an interesting anecdote just in automotive and seeing broader usage.
how much can that same playbook be used in process or some of your other discrete sectors where you have exposure?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. so you picked up on something, we're growing faster than any of our competitors so we continue to take share in manufacturing. and yes, you're right, it's our whole portfolio that's continuing to grow the share in manufacturing. and why is that? so there's a couple of reasons.
one, we keep introducing new technologies, all right? and we bring these new technologies to our customers in a way that if you buy the present, you get the future, right? so if you're buying, you get fusion. and that allows you to not only feel good about the product you're using today but know that you're hooked up to where the company is going over the next five to 10 years. and i think that's a real competitive advantage for us in terms of how we bring technology to market. but you're also seeing us blend new types of technologies into the workflows that our customers are trying to do in automotive and other places.
i think one of the things that was interesting about what i said in my opening commentary was the blending of both the wild and vred which is -- the wild was a very early acquisition and then we have vred, which is an existing mature technology. people are exploring the intersections of various technologies that we have. and you've probably picked up on the fact that our strength in manufacturing has extended more into facilities management with large manufacturers and looking to manage their actual factory assets. so there's overlap associated with those things and there's some overlap with our aec business with regard to that.
but those are the things that are kind of driving our growth in manufacturing. you're right, it's the whole portfolio. the whole portfolio is moving forward and you're also seeing obviously tremendous growth with fusion, right? we have to maintain that. we like what we see, but customers like what we're doing.
joe vruwink -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
ok, that's great. and then just trying to put the pieces together with guidance. so you're raising the organic forecast by a bit. this still sounds like it assumes the same underlying macro assumptions.
so ultimately, it's autodesk's execution that's driving the organic raise. i guess what is the driver of better-than-expected performance there?
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
ultimately, it is about execution but it's the momentum in the business that we saw, particularly as we exited q2. so here's how we're thinking about guidance. we had that slight lead in q2. but of course, we kept our full year guidance flat [inaudible] of the currency headwinds.
the guidance does reflect the demand environment that we saw as we exited q2. that's consistent with what we've done with previous quarters. the business continues to perform strongly. we have that resilient subscription business model, which is durable during a potential economic downturn and we exited q2, as i said, with strong momentum.
so these are all the factors that are baked into our guidance. i also want to point out that we did retain a range of $50 million on revenue. that gives us some flexibility, especially with that subscription business model, which is more predictable and a significant portion of our future revenue is already on the balance sheet.
joe vruwink -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jason celino of keybanc capital markets. jason celino, your line is open.
jason celino -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great, thanks. it's good to hear the strong bidding activity through buildingconnected. with customer backlogs still lengthened and these hiring challenges that you keep hearing about, is there any change to the lead time on the projects being bid on? i guess what i'm asking is, is the strong activity you're seeing for next year, following year, how does that kind of pan out?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
you know what, that is an excellent question. i'm not sure i can answer it in a satisfying way. but here's what i will say. current bidding activity is a predictor of future build activity, right? bidding with contractors and other things is an early process in actually executing a project.
so when you see an increase in bid activity on buildingconnected, what you're actually seeing is an increase in the book of business of projects that will actually get executed downstream, right? so this is a good predictor of ongoing activity as you close a bid, you actually then move into execution with that particular subcontractor and some of the things associated with that. so it does give us a forward indication of how much site activity is going to be happening and how much actual real building is going to be going on. and that's one of the reasons why we highlighted one of the reasons we value that connection to the bid activity so much. not exactly what you asked but that's the depth that i can answer at this point.
jason celino -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok, perfect. and then on innovyze, i think you mentioned it kind of in one deal in your prepared remarks, but how is it performing? any change to win rates since you've acquired it? and then i think at some point, there was going to be some sort of subscription effort transition for the existing base. any worthwhile update there?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. so innovyze continues to perform well. it's doing particularly well in terms of our eba businesses. a lot of our enterprise business agreement customers are looking to incorporate innovyze into their contracts with us, which is exactly one of the big synergies we expected when we acquired innovyze.
they have begun their business model transformation. they're in the throes of that right now. it's going quite well. we expect to finish that in a reasonable amount of time.
so that's going quite well. but the business is doing well, and we continue to get a lot of interest not only in water in general from our customers, but also in the owner side of innovyze where they're building solutions that actually manage the operation of the water facilities.
jason celino -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
perfect. thanks, andrew.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you, jason.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from michael funk of bank of america. michael funk, your line is open.
michael funk -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. thank you for the question this evening. a couple if i could. just back to the comments of the uniformity of products as you move to a platform or saying you don't want to tip your hand here.
but how heavy of a lift is this? and what is the timing involved? and then in addition to the increased attractiveness for customers, are there efficiencies that will accrue to autodesk as well by adding more uniformity across the platforms?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. so first off, let's be super clear. this isn't something that we're just suddenly starting out of the blue, right? it's been going on for quite some time in various forms. it is the most mature in its journey in the manufacturing space with what we're doing with fusion 360.
and that gives you a lot of visibility to what happens and how the portfolio is consolidated over time. a lot of capabilities that exist as separate products have shown up as extensions and native capabilities in the fusion environment. and that absolutely gives us long-term synergies where we're building on one environment versus trying to support the multiple products and their multiple needs. so you actually do get a lot of synergies.
right now, of course, we're double spending on a lot of things and we will double spend for some time. but the journey is not new to us. fusion is quite mature. aec is beginning its journey, seated with some of the cloud-native acquisitions we did particularly around what we did with spacemaker, a team that has been very much focused on the future of how people do building information model on a cloud platform, building information modeling on a cloud platform.
and we have other things that we'll be showing up in the media and entertainment space, again not wanting to tip my hand for some of the discussions we'll have later. but yeah, there are long-term synergies here. we are absolutely and will continue to double spend for a period of five to 10 years on some of these. products overlap for a long time.
we've been through several transformations of products, autocad and revit, mechanical desktop and adventure in the past for those of you who are familiar with some of those names. and yes, the overlap takes a while but eventually, what happens is most of the engineering effort and capability goes to the new platform and we evolve away in that direction.
michael funk -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
understood, yes. long-term complex project. and then the earlier comments on the delay and shift to annual billing. just want to make sure i completely understood.
was the comment that you wanted to make sure that the processes were better than they are now and the back office is better than it is right now? and if that's correct, i guess what were the issues that you were seeing that you wanted to streamline just to make that a more enjoyable process for the customers?
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
yeah. so first, let's level set on our intention to move from a multiyear upfront annual billings was always intended to start at the beginning of next year. so that's not any change that we've made on our side. and the reason why we did that was twofold: one, we needed to invest in our back-office systems infrastructure to make sure that we could execute on this transition at scale in an automated way, such that our customers would have a good customer experience, and we would have the controls and automated processes in place that we need in our back office.
so that's point number one. maybe more importantly is point number two. our partners are a really important part of our ecosystem. and so it was important to us to give them advanced notice, getting back to our last investor day, that we intended to embark on this journey so that we could work together with them to build the program, policies and all the things that we needed to do to make sure that they were along with us on the journey and that the entire ecosystem benefits from the shift to annual billings because just like it will be predictable for us to have an annual billing cycle, so too will it be for our customers and our partners.
but our partners needed time to plan. and so we wanted to make sure that we were collaborating with them in a healthy way as we move toward this transition.
michael funk -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes, that's pretty helpful color. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from bhavin shah of deutsche bank. bhavin shah, your line is open.
bhavin shah -- deutsche bank -- analyst
andrew, we continue to hear very good things about bim collaborate pro within the architecture and engineering customer base. can you maybe better help us understand where we are in terms of adoption of collaborate pro within like the revit customer base? and how we should think about the adoption curve going forward?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. it's an excellent question. look, it's still actually really early. i mean, bim collaborate pro continues to grow robustly.
as you recall, when we were -- during the pandemic, we saw quite a surge in the adoption of that product, and the adoption of it has continued post the pandemic period as more and more people become aware of the capabilities of bim collaborate pro. in terms of total penetration into the revit base, it's still really early days in terms of penetrating the vast majority of the revit base. in fact, interestingly enough, one of the biggest requests we get is to make bim collaborate pro work as robustly with civil 3d as it does with revit. and that's something that we're addressing, which is another vector where collaborate pro is going to be able to penetrate the infrastructure space as well.
still, really early days though in total penetration of the revit base. continues to grow. it's an on-ramp to digital preconstruction and autodesk construction cloud in many ways. and we're really happy with the way customers are adopting that.
it was one of the unexpected silver linings of the turmoil and tragedy of the pandemic that customers finally realize that that is a utility that is valuable to them now and in the future.
bhavin shah -- deutsche bank -- analyst
makes a ton of sense. and i guess along those lines and you kind of intimated at this a little bit, like in terms of adoption here, have you seen that accelerate customers' journeys toward some of your other cloud-based solutions that you guys offer?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. it absolutely does. it's a -- i hesitate to call it an on-ramp to our full portfolio of cloud solutions. but what it does is it gives customers a lot of confidence in how the cloud actually changes their processes.
they actually start to understand that, wow, this isn't just better. it's actually different and better. and it allows them and empowers them and encourages them to explore some of the other capabilities. oh, maybe i should be doing a preconstruction planning in the cloud.
oh, if i'm doing preconstruction planning in the cloud, i should be doing online site management in the cloud as well. so it absolutely demystifies the cloud for them and shows some of the core benefits. it really does educate a lot of our customer base on why the cloud matters and why it's so important to their distributed and highly collaborative future.
operator
we'll go to our next question, which comes from the line of gal munda of wolfe research. gal munda, your line is open.
gal munda -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you for taking my question. and maybe, andrew, just for you to start. you are calling out the noncompliant users again, and it seems like you're running roughly at a run rate that you were pre-pandemic again. how much of that is just having a flex model as well as being able to go more effectively toward your accounts that already pay you but maybe not pay enough and now you have a tool in order to monetize that? and maybe just how big flex could be in the future as you embark on that opportunity?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. so actually, gal, you're picking up on something that was implied in the opening commentary that flex is a highly valuable tool when you go and you reach the noncompliant users. in a lot of cases, what you're finding in a noncompliant usage situation is it's a multiuser situation gone bad, all right, where they've over-installed software or they've tried to use software in unlicensed ways. and what they're really trying to do is distribute usage, enable occasional usage, and some of the things associated with that.
flex is an excellent way to walk into some of those accounts and, in a collaborative manner, get them exploring other ways of engaging with autodesk. and it absolutely will have some positive impacts on how we do license compliance business. now as we look broadly at flex, again, it's still really early days with flex. we continue to see growth and we continue to see a lot of new users coming in with flex.
one of the growth vectors for flex that i'm particularly excited about is in the long tail of our business. because what flex allows you to do, if you're in a smaller company, say you're in a five-person company and you want to occasionally use revit for some of the projects you bid on, but the vast majority of your projects are autocad or you want to engage in structural simulation for a particular product, the flex model lets people dabble. it lets people engage with advanced functionality and advanced capabilities on a pay-per-use basis. and they don't have to commit to an annual subscription or a multiyear subscription to get some of these capabilities.
so i think there's a lot of long-term growth capabilities built into the long tail of our business that flex will likely unlock. the jury is still out. we're early on the journey so we'll see where that heads. that's one of the areas that i think is very interesting for flex.
operator
and as that is all the time we have for questions, i'd like to turn the call back over to simon mays-smith for any closing remarks.

thank you for standing by, and welcome to autodesk's second quarter fiscal 2023 earnings conference call. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. after the speaker presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the call over to simon mays-smith, vice president, investor relations.
please go ahead.
simon mays-smith -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, operator, and good afternoon. thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the second quarter results of our fiscal '23. on the line with me are andrew anagnost, our ceo; and debbie clifford, our cfo. today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast.
in addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com/investor. you can find the earnings press release, slide presentation, and transcript of today's opening commentary on our investor relations website following this call. during this call, we may make forward-looking statements about our outlook, future results, and related assumptions, acquisitions, products, and product capabilities and strategies. these statements reflect our best judgment based on currently known factors.

and now i will turn the call over to andrew. 
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you, simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. today, we reported record second quarter revenue, non-gaap operating margin, and free cash flow. end market demand remained strong during the quarter, resulting in robust new business activity. renewal rates were again excellent.
all of this and our strong competitive performance more than offset the direct and indirect impact of geopolitical, macroeconomic, policy, and covid-19-related factors. growing commercial usage outside china, russia, and ukraine, record bid activity on buildingconnected, and continued channel partner optimism leave us well placed to achieve our fy '23 goals. as i said last quarter, the structural growth drivers for our business that were critical to our performance during the pandemic, such as flexibility and agility, continue to support and propel us during this period of elevated uncertainty. these growth drivers further cement the important role we play in our customers' digital transformations and increase our confidence in our strategy.
our steady strategy, industry-leading products, platform, and business model innovation, sustained and focused investment and strong execution are creating additional opportunities for autodesk. by accelerating the convergence of workflows within and between the industries we serve, we create broader and deeper partnerships with existing customers and bring new customers into our ecosystem. in pursuit of these goals, we announced at autodesk university last year that we were moving from products to platforms and capabilities and bringing these capabilities to any device anywhere through the cloud. over the coming weeks, months, and years, you will hear a lot more from us about our plans and progress to build a world-class customer experience, catalyze our customers' digital transformation and establish industry-leading platforms for design and make.
as evidence of the progress we have made already, fusion 360 flew past 200,000 subscribers during the second quarter and signed its first million-dollar contract, both important milestones and indications of the opportunities ahead. i will now turn the call over to debbie to take you through the details of our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. i'll then come back to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives.
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
thanks, andrew. q2 was a strong quarter across products and channels. our end markets were broadly consistent with last quarter, with our strongest growth in north america and growth in europe and apac impacted by the war in ukraine and covid lockdowns in china. total revenue grew 17%, both as reported and at constant currency.
by product, autocad and autocad lt revenue grew 13%, aec revenue grew 18%, manufacturing revenue grew 16% and m&e revenue grew 20%. by region, revenue grew 22% in the americas, 15% in emea and 10% in apac or 13% at constant currency. by channel, direct revenue increased 18%, representing 34% of total revenue while indirect revenue grew 16%. our product subscription renewal rates remain strong, and our net revenue retention rate was comfortably within our 100% to 110% target range.
billings increased 17% to $1.2 billion, reflecting robust underlying demand. total deferred revenue grew 12% to $3.7 billion. total rpo of $4.7 billion and current rpo of $3.1 billion grew 13% and 10%, respectively, reflecting strong billings growth and, as we've highlighted in the last two quarters, the timing and volume of multiyear contracts, which are typically on a three-year cycle. multiyear contract volume remained strong during the quarter, as expected and as you can see from the uptick in long-term deferred as a percent of total deferred.
turning to the p&l. non-gaap gross margin remained broadly level at 92%, while non-gaap operating margin increased by 5 percentage points to approximately 36%, reflecting strong revenue growth and ongoing cost discipline. gaap operating margins increased by 6 percentage points to approximately 20%. we delivered record second quarter free cash flow of $246 million, up 32% year over year, reflecting strong billings growth in both q1 and q2.
we continued our accelerated share repurchasing during the quarter. we purchased 1.4 million shares for $257 million at an average price of approximately $182 per share, which, when compared to last year, contributed to a reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding by approximately 3 million to 270 million shares. while our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged, you can expect that we will continue to invest organically and inorganically to drive growth. we've proactively used our strong liquidity to repurchase 3.5 million shares in the first half of this year, front-loading the offset of next year's dilution.
now let me finish with guidance. the underlying business conditions we've been seeing are broadly unchanged. as i mentioned earlier, we're seeing strength in north america and continued healthy growth in europe and asia, outside of russia and china, due to the geopolitical situation in both regions, as well as the covid lockdowns in china. our renewals business continues to be a highlight, reflecting the ongoing importance of our software and helping our customers achieve their goals.
as we look ahead and as with previous quarters, our fiscal '23 guidance assumes that market conditions remain consistent for the remainder of fiscal '23. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar during the quarter generated slight incremental fx headwinds, which reduced full year billings, revenue, and free cash flow by approximately $20 million, $5 million, and $5 million, respectively. bringing these factors together, the overall headline for guidance is that it is unchanged at the midpoint across all metrics, with the underlying momentum of the business offsetting those incremental fx headwinds.
we are narrowing the fiscal '23 revenue range to be between $4.99 billion and $5.04 billion. we continue to expect non-gaap operating margin to be approximately 36% and free cash flow to be between $2 billion and $2.08 billion. the slide deck and updated excel financials on our website have more details on modeling assumptions for q3 and full year fiscal '23. while the challenges our customers face are changing, the growth drivers underpinning our strategy have only been reinforced, which gives us confidence in our long-term growth potential.
we continue to target double-digit revenue growth, non-gaap operating margins in the 38% to 40% range, and double-digit free cash flow growth on a compound annual basis. these metrics are intended to provide a floor to our revenue growth ambitions and a ceiling to our spend growth expectations. andrew, back to you.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you, debbie. our strategy is to transform the industries we serve with end-to-end cloud-based solutions that drive efficiency and sustainability for our customers. our business is scalable and extensible into adjacent vertical, from architecture and engineering through construction and operations, from product engineering to product data management and product manufacturing. it is also scalable and extensible between verticals, with industrialized construction, and into new workflows like xr.
by accelerating the convergence of workflows within and between the industries we serve, we are also creating broader and deeper partnerships with existing customers and bringing new customers into our ecosystem. for example, kimley-horn, one of the nation's premier planning and design consultants, expanded its eba in q2, broadening and deepening its long-standing partnership with autodesk. in addition to increasing its utilization of civil 3d and revit and driving further operational efficiency gains through bim and cloud collaboration, it also chose to expand use of innovyze in its rapidly growing water practice to help drive more growth opportunities and productivity gains. as we highlighted last quarter, digital workflows are being adopted across the infrastructure life cycle from asset owners, architects, and engineers to construction to drive improved efficiency and sustainability.
the indiana department of transportation, which was looking for an efficient solution to simplify its document management and field collaboration, is another good q2 example. by adopting autodesk build and acc connect, it will improve communication and coordination throughout the construction process and streamline the documentation of citizen issues, resulting in less waste and more return per taxpayer dollar. across construction, the industry continues to look to connect workflows from planning and design to preconstruction, construction, and ultimately, operations and maintenance. and we are enabling our customers to connect those workflows on a single platform.
for example, a commercial real estate and property management company focused on owners, investors and occupants was tired of having multiple platforms across the project life cycle, resulting in inconsistencies, rework, and poor handoffs. in q2, it adopted the full autodesk construction cloud to connect preconstruction with project management. it added quantification estimating to buildingconnected and bim collaborate pro in preconstruction and autodesk build for project management to give themselves a competitive advantage and increase profitability through improved collaboration and data management. across the globe, our customers seek to connect and streamline their construction workflows, and we are enabling and accelerating that through our partner network, launching autodesk build in new markets like japan, enabling more data formats on more devices, and delivering more value to our customers through account-based pricing.
we're also giving our customers control of their data through bridge, leveraging the power of machine learning to anticipate project risk and seamlessly connecting workflows like takeoff, estimating, and budgeting to delight our customers and improve their productivity. with monthly active users growing more than 45% quarter over quarter, autodesk build is being rapidly adopted by existing and new customers to connect and streamline their construction workflows. turning to manufacturing. we sustained strong momentum in our manufacturing portfolio this quarter as we connected more workflows beyond the design studio, developed more on-ramps to our manufacturing platform and delivered new powerful tools and functionality through fusion 360 extensions.
customers continue to expand their adoption of the fusion platform beyond design and engineering. this quarter, a u.s. supplier of metal cutting tools chose to create a state-of-the-art collaboration tool on fusion to enable its sales organization to demonstrate its digital manufacturing technology to customers. by enabling customer customization to be immediately reflected in factory manufacturing instructions, the tool will be a competitive advantage during the selling process.
for autodesk, it adds a significant new persona group to fusion's addressable market opportunity. in automotive, we continue to grow our footprint beyond the design studio into manufacturing as automotive oems seek to break down the work silos and shorten the handoff and design cycles. for example, a top-tier commercial vehicle manufacturer renewed and increased its partnership with autodesk as part of its strategic focus on building a sustainable product and service portfolio, which leverages new technologies and digital innovation to accelerate electrical vehicle solutions. in addition to alias, which it already uses for surfacing work of all its vehicles, it is utilizing vr technology from the wild in combination with vred and navisworks to drive innovation and visualization from design and engineering through factory design.
our fusion 360 platform approach enables customers to seamlessly connect workflows and push the boundaries of innovation through the advanced design and manufacturing technologies and extensions. for example, a global leader in seat manufacturing, which works with many major automakers worldwide, engaged autodesk consulting to develop a blended workflow across design, product engineering, and manufacturing. the result was a seat that proves passenger comfort and safety while reducing the weight and number of parts. using autodesk design tools like alias conceptual design and fusion 360 design, it was able to redefine the seat design with thinner seat sections and improved comfort and safety.
fusion 360's commercial subscribers grew steadily, ending the quarter with 205,000 subscribers, and demand for our new extensions, including machining, generative design, and nesting and fabrication continuing to grow at an exceptional pace. in education, engineering students are using fusion 360 to learn the skills of the future in institutions like grwp llandrillo menai, the largest further education college group in wales. students there are applying their studies to benefit local industry partners and businesses. for example, students recently used fusion 360's cloud-based data management and advanced 3d machining to help a local rv manufacturer improve its output by about 50%.
the college is now planning to integrate fusion 360 across its 11 campuses due to its ease of use, modern user interface, accessibility across devices, and ability to collaborate on team projects and share data. and finally, we continue to bring more users into our ecosystem through business model innovation and license compliance initiatives. when one of our emea customers realized that some usage from its international offices was noncompliant, it needed time and data to better understand its users before purchasing subscriptions. by purchasing our first-ever 100,000-pack of flex tokens, the customer gained instant access to autodesk's portfolio of products and usage data to make informed decisions on its future subscription purchases while also opening up new competitive opportunities for autodesk.
during the quarter, we closed seven deals over $500,000 with our license compliance initiatives, three of which were over $1 million. flex and premium are also helping customers transition from multiuser to named user contracts. a leading supplier of concrete formwork and scaffolding systems in europe has been unifying internally around bim to accelerate its digital transformation. it added premium plan to its transitions and named trade-ins to centralize software management, enable user-based analytics and license optimization and benefit from single sign-on security.
it can also purchase flex token to cover its occasional user needs. let me finish where i started. strong demand and robust competitive performance delivered excellent q2 results. our subscription business continues to demonstrate its growth potential and resilience.
by accelerating the convergence of workflows within and between the industries we serve, we are accelerating the digital transformation of our customers and creating broader and deeper partnerships with them. and by moving from products to platforms and capabilities and bringing those capabilities to any device anywhere through the cloud, we are expanding our opportunity horizon. look for us to talk more about that over the coming weeks, months, and years. we look forward to seeing many of you at autodesk university in a few weeks.

yeah. i want to be careful not to give away all the au tidbits in some of those discussions. but it's an important question. saket, i -- to put it in perspective, right now, we sell literally hundreds of products.
and the challenges for our customers is trying to find out which one of these products solves which problems for them and also the fact that a lot of these products don't talk to each other very easily. so when you're selling hundreds of products, it's really difficult to connect data flows across all those capabilities. it's also really difficult to uniformly deliver multi-platform support, multi-device support, cloud computing, and ai automation, which is really challenging. so what we're doing is we're moving away from this kind of disconnected portfolio of products to really a set of platforms to target each one of our industries with some underlying core technologies that support all of it.
that will enable us to actually deploy capabilities to our customers as they need them for particular types of process, right, advanced manufacturing capabilities on a time-bound basis or a consumption basis, accumulation capabilities on a time-bound basis or a consumption basis. so they get access to what they need when they need it, and it's all unified from a data flow point of view. this is kind of going to be revolutionary for a lot of our customers in terms of the evolution and where we're taking them. so it's really valuable for our customers in terms of connecting how they work and the value they get from each one of our products.
and it's really important to us in terms of delivering more layers of automation and power to them to the cloud. so it is a journey. it's not going to happen overnight, but fusion is an excellent example of where we're going and how we could deploy some of these things to our customers, especially when you look at the way extensions work, consumption works on top of the fusion platform. it's a good model for where we're taking industry platforms for each one of our industries.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
got it, got it. that's really helpful. and it sounds like it will be exciting at au. debbie, a follow-up for you.
can you just talk a little bit about the multiyear [inaudible] business? how are those renewals? i know they're starting to trickle in from three years ago in a bigger way. how are those renewals kind of coming in versus your expectations? and maybe looking forward, how do you plan on phasing that option out, i think, [inaudible]
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
sure. so, we continue to track the multiyear cohort closely. our proportional volume for multiyear has been in line with our expectations for the first half of fiscal '23, so that gives us confidence in our fiscal '23 outlook. we also saw long-term deferred revenue as a percent of total deferred revenue tick up.
that, too, was in line with our expectations. as we look ahead to the transition from upfront to annual billings, well, it hasn't started yet. we anticipate that the transition's going to start in early fiscal '24, and we continue to work through the programmatic and operational details to get there, things like a partner transition plan, back-office system upgrades. but i'll say again, it's our bias to go as quickly as possible.
in the meantime, obviously, we're focused on closing out this year, making sure that those multiyears come in consistent with historical patterns. and the fact that they are is giving us that confidence as we look to achieve our goals for this year.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst

thank you. our next question comes from the line of phil winslow of credit suisse. phil winslow, your line is open.
phil winslow -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks for taking my question, and congrats on another quarter, reinforcing how autodesk grows is simply not as cyclical anymore. andrew, i wanted to focus on the aec side because this is the area that i get the most questions on in terms of cyclicality, with two questions of my own for you. firstly, what are you hearing from design customers in this segment about what continues to drive your incremental spending on autodesk despite the cloudier macro? and then secondly, the 45% quarter-to-quarter growth in autodesk build maus in the slide deck and your commentary on just the buildingconnected volumes also really stood out to us. similarly, what are you hearing from these construction customers about why they also continue to lean in on digitizing their workloads in spite of the macro? or is this becoming because of the macro volatility that they're digitizing? thanks.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
that was a multi-part question. i will address it. so first off, let's talk about what we're hearing from design customers. the no.
1 thing we're hearing from the design segment is the backlog of business, right? they have more business right now than they're able to effectively execute on. and the requirements of that business are increasing in terms of what kind of tools they need to use, how they need to approach the problems, owners, municipalities, all sorts of customers they deal with are putting more requirements on how they have to work. so they're all looking to kind of up their game in digital tools. the biggest challenge we hear from these customers is hiring, frankly.
we were hearing last year a lot of conversations about, oh boy, fixed bid contracts and inflationary pressures and all these things. as i've said previously, they bake these things now into their business bids and they're able to capture those costs in their contracts. but what they're struggling with is hiring. we're still growing even if they struggle to hire because they're getting people in but they have more demand for manpower and person power than they actually are able to capture at this point, ok? so that's something we're hearing really robustly.
now, let's go to the growth in construction. first off, i want to give you my quarterly disclaimer. when you look at the construction business, the make number does not capture the full story in the construction business. the eba growth in the design bucket.
so when you count how we're doing with our enterprise business agreements and the overall territory business, that we grew close to 30% in that business. so that's really quite nice growth. and what we're hearing, and i'm glad you picked up on the 45% growth on monthly active users, we're hearing a couple of things. one, first off, we've lit up our territory business, our partners in the territory.
this is driving a lot of really nice growth in the u.s. and in europe, and it's going to continue to drive that growth. and that's bringing us closer to certain customers lower down in the market, the mid-market and below, which i think is a really important point in our journey, ok? the other thing i want to talk about is when customers are starting to realize is they need a lot more than just a project management or a construction site management tool. they really are looking to their future where they're trying to connect the design and the build all the way together continuously.
and one of the big linchpins in all of that is preconstruction planning. the vast majority of the cost and complexity of a construction project is built in during the preconstruction planning phase. you get that wrong, you bid wrong, you come in with lower margins, you have more churn and complexity in your project. so this connection between design, preconstruction all the way to build is increasingly really important to their customers.
so customers are taking a lot more time to evaluate what they're trying to invest in. and i think you also probably noticed, at least a little bit in the introductory commentary, that infrastructure is a big play for us here. so department of transportation, and you saw indiana, the indiana department of transportation lean into our portfolio for looking at their future needs. we're hearing more and more from departments of transportation that are really looking to upgrade and modify their stack to be much more designed to build on a much more modern cloud infrastructure.
so there's a lot going on in construction, phil, and it's coming at us from multiple directions, and right now, it's all positive.
phil winslow -- credit suisse -- analyst
awesome. appreciate all the details. thank you, and keep up the great work.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer

thank you. our next question comes from the line of jay vleeschhouwer of griffin securities. jay vleeschhouwer, your line is open.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
good evening, andrew, debbie, and simon. andrew, you have, by our calculation, the largest r&d budget in your peer group, but you don't necessarily have the largest headcount in r&d. and so the question is, particularly given your earlier comment about the large number of products that you're currently developing and having to manage, how you see or how are you working on improving your r&d productivity or effectivity, if you will, in terms of your core platform, your applications technology and ultimately, product usability to drive maus and further enlarging the installed base? and then for debbie, you commented earlier with respect to your back-office as part of your initiatives over the next number of years. on that point, could you comment on where you are in terms of your operational capacity for the new licensing model and deliverables that you're going to have as you have an increasingly complex offering to customers in terms of flex and everything else you're doing, the platform andrew mentioned? are you, in fact, going to have the requisite back office to handle all of that?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
all right. so, jay, let me start with your questions. yeah, you are correct. we have the largest r&d budget but we don't necessarily have the largest headcount on r&d.
part of that is because of where we concentrate on r&d and what kind of talent we're pursuing. we're pursuing a lot of cloud talent, a lot of cloud-native talent, full staff development talent that allows us to build out the core cloud capabilities and continue to expand them. that talent resides in certain places, and it has certain costs associated with it and we think that's the right strategy. we don't hire a lot of r&d content headcount that's associated specifically with customer-specific development in, say, other parts of the world.
so we do hire in specific areas because of what we're trying to do. and when it comes to developer productivity, you hit on a really important aspect of why do we have platform services. why are we extending the depth and breadth of the things that we build in the platform services? one of the reasons we're doing that is to lift the burden away from some of these development teams on things like data flow, on things like visualization and capabilities that should be uniform across every platform or product that we -- or capability that we deploy. so more and more, as you see these -- the portfolio of platform capabilities not only mature but expand, it's going to increase the productivity of the teams that are looking at features that are facing particular industries and capabilities that are facing particular industries.
it's a big part of why we have these services, and we're already starting to see some of those benefits, especially with regards to data flow, which is an initiative driven primarily by the platform organization within autodesk. and it's being aligned across the various industries to make sure that we get the right kind of synergies and lift from our data apis and our data connectivity. so, yeah, you will see increasing productivity associated with this. we're definitely spending on quality over quantity, and i think that's the right strategy for where we're at right now.
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
and then jay, to answer your question about operational capacity for things like new business model, i would say that we are well on our way on this journey but we still have some ground to cover in order to be where we need to be. and i think that that's an appropriate place to be at this stage of the journey. now, of course, we don't launch new business models without the ability to support them, which is why, as one example, we are delaying the shift to annual billings until next year so that we can spend the time that we need to be able to invest in our back-office systems to make sure that we have a good customer experience and that we have the right controls and automated capabilities in the back office. i mean, ultimately, this is something that we focus on not only to make sure that we have the capacity to support new business models but also so we can scale.
if we want to achieve our long-term growth aspirations, we need to continue to invest in our back-office infrastructure in order to be able to scale efficiently, effectively and in an automated way to do it.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
ok. thank you very much.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of matt hedberg of rbc capital markets. your question please, matt hedberg.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hey, thanks, guys. andrew, for you, the growth in fusion 360 was really fantastic to hear. can you talk about sort of where those subs are coming from? are these greenfields? are they replacements? and maybe just a little bit more on sort of with a lot of alternatives, why fusion 360?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. so first half is a bit of a mix, all right? a lot of these are greenfield investors acquiring design software connected to manufacturing software for the first time. but there's a lot of rip and replace going on. i think you've probably heard me talk many times about how we're going into accounts where people might have a seat of solidworks and a seat of mastercam or some kind of other cam software and they're saying, ""well, fusion is all i need."" and we're -- we've been consistently creating and growing subscribers from that type of business.
but what we're seeing more and more, and i think this is one of the things that is important about the user growth you're seeing, is that where we've gone in and we've started some department or part of a particular company, we're starting to grow the installed base within those companies. so we're still bringing in new customers, primarily along this design to make vector, but we're starting to grow within the accounts we've captured. this is the kind of flywheel you'd like to see as you start to mature a business, and we're starting to see some of that. the reason people buy is there is there's three kind of vectors here that people pay attention to: one, of course, is the price.
the pricing model for fusion is disruptive. it's native subscription-based. it's not a reimagining of an existing perpetual business. it's a native subscription-based business.
it has extensions and things and consumptive models that allow people to pay for what they use and manage how much it costs from the use of software. they love that. two, they love the design to make integration, the end-to-end integration from the design process all the way to actually programming and driving the machine on the shop floor. this kind of merger and convergence of design and make something that's really valuable to a lot of people.
and the third thing might surprise you a little bit. it's our youtube community. it's the amount of content that's out there on youtube, which by the way, exceeds even much more mature products that are out there in the market, where people cannot only learn how to do something in fusion, they can learn how to do it exceptionally in fusion. it's a very passionate, very engaged, and really very knowledgeable community that's publishing all this content.
and people really buy for those reasons. they buy for the disruptive business model, they buy for the design make integration and they buy for the fact that they can find just a tutorial about just about anything you can think of to get really expert level in the product.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
that's super, super helpful. and then debbie, the consistency is obviously really good to see. the macroenvironment, this is not easy, clearly, but the consistency was great. i'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the linearity in the quarter.
and maybe what are you seeing thus far in august?
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
so the linearity that we saw during the quarter is consistent with what we've seen in previous periods. i would say nothing newsworthy to report there. and obviously, at this point, we're not commenting on what we're seeing in august.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst

operator
thank you. our next question comes from adam borg of stifel. your line is open, adam borg.
adam borg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
guys, and thanks so much for taking the question. maybe just first for andrew on the infrastructure bill. i know that's something we talked about in the past and the positive tailwinds that could have for autodesk. so maybe just a quick update here.
and then as i think about the recently passed inflation reduction act, there's a lot of language in there about clean energy and sustainability. i'd love to hear how you think about that impacting autodesk over time as well.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. and so first, let's talk about the infrastructure bill. as with any of these goals and like i've said in the past, the money is slowly trickling out, all right? and what you're seeing is people are actually starting to begin the process of planning around particular types of projects. but more importantly, what's happening is a lot of the recipients of some of these funds, particularly departments of transportation, are starting to rethink how they're approaching their design processes.
and by the way, energy efficiency and sustainability play into how they think about some of these things. so remember, there was a seed money in that bill to enable departments of transportation to explore and expand digital transformation in their processes. this is bringing about a lot of introspection and thought within these departments. and they're starting to look at their next 10-year portfolio of tools.
and they're looking to buy ahead of their ability to plan and execute some of these infrastructure projects. we are absolutely seeing that early activity with regards to our relationship with large firms like aecom that engage in the infrastructure and how they're going to engage over the next 10 years and departments of transportation that have similar challenges and similar needs over the next 10-year period, ok? so that's something we're seeing live. now with regards to the inflation reduction act, the jury is out on that, all right? anything that drives energy efficiency and sustainability is ultimately going to trickle down into what the requirements are for some of our customers, especially when electrification is becoming so important. so you're going to see a lot more electrification and efficiency spec for our customers.
but unclear where that will fall with regards to impact on our business.
adam borg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great. and maybe just a quick follow-up, even on matt's question on fusion 360. just on manufacturing more broadly, we'd love to hear more about upchain and how that fits in the broader strategy you've been talking about here with fusion 360 today. thank you, guys.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. so upchain is the data management layer that's cloud-native that allows us to actually not only manage the flow of fusion information environment but any other heterogeneous data that might exist in the environment. all of our customers live in a heterogeneous world. we will never have a customer that is uniformly using just an autodesk product or just autodesk's portfolio.
so not only does upchain bring us cloud-native data management but it also brings us heterogeneous management of this data and the ability to manage this flow and reconcile things in the cloud, which has huge power for how people use data management in the future. if you look at the evolution of upchain, it's going to more and more just merge with some of the fusion life cycle and fusion managed capabilities we already have and will become the native cloud data management platform for fusion. so that's where upchain plays. it's basically a deep and wide native data management platform in the cloud for us.
adam borg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
excellent. thanks, again.

operator
thank you. our next question comes from joe vruwink of baird. your question please, joe vruwink.
joe vruwink -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
great. thank you. i guess i'll stick on manufacturing because i think to get 16% growth there, the desktop products have to be contributing at a pretty high level. what's been the driver of success there? and then you shared an interesting anecdote just in automotive and seeing broader usage.
how much can that same playbook be used in process or some of your other discrete sectors where you have exposure?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. so you picked up on something, we're growing faster than any of our competitors so we continue to take share in manufacturing. and yes, you're right, it's our whole portfolio that's continuing to grow the share in manufacturing. and why is that? so there's a couple of reasons.
one, we keep introducing new technologies, all right? and we bring these new technologies to our customers in a way that if you buy the present, you get the future, right? so if you're buying, you get fusion. and that allows you to not only feel good about the product you're using today but know that you're hooked up to where the company is going over the next five to 10 years. and i think that's a real competitive advantage for us in terms of how we bring technology to market. but you're also seeing us blend new types of technologies into the workflows that our customers are trying to do in automotive and other places.
i think one of the things that was interesting about what i said in my opening commentary was the blending of both the wild and vred which is -- the wild was a very early acquisition and then we have vred, which is an existing mature technology. people are exploring the intersections of various technologies that we have. and you've probably picked up on the fact that our strength in manufacturing has extended more into facilities management with large manufacturers and looking to manage their actual factory assets. so there's overlap associated with those things and there's some overlap with our aec business with regard to that.
but those are the things that are kind of driving our growth in manufacturing. you're right, it's the whole portfolio. the whole portfolio is moving forward and you're also seeing obviously tremendous growth with fusion, right? we have to maintain that. we like what we see, but customers like what we're doing.
joe vruwink -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
ok, that's great. and then just trying to put the pieces together with guidance. so you're raising the organic forecast by a bit. this still sounds like it assumes the same underlying macro assumptions.
so ultimately, it's autodesk's execution that's driving the organic raise. i guess what is the driver of better-than-expected performance there?
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
ultimately, it is about execution but it's the momentum in the business that we saw, particularly as we exited q2. so here's how we're thinking about guidance. we had that slight lead in q2. but of course, we kept our full year guidance flat [inaudible] of the currency headwinds.
the guidance does reflect the demand environment that we saw as we exited q2. that's consistent with what we've done with previous quarters. the business continues to perform strongly. we have that resilient subscription business model, which is durable during a potential economic downturn and we exited q2, as i said, with strong momentum.
so these are all the factors that are baked into our guidance. i also want to point out that we did retain a range of $50 million on revenue. that gives us some flexibility, especially with that subscription business model, which is more predictable and a significant portion of our future revenue is already on the balance sheet.
joe vruwink -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jason celino of keybanc capital markets. jason celino, your line is open.
jason celino -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great, thanks. it's good to hear the strong bidding activity through buildingconnected. with customer backlogs still lengthened and these hiring challenges that you keep hearing about, is there any change to the lead time on the projects being bid on? i guess what i'm asking is, is the strong activity you're seeing for next year, following year, how does that kind of pan out?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
you know what, that is an excellent question. i'm not sure i can answer it in a satisfying way. but here's what i will say. current bidding activity is a predictor of future build activity, right? bidding with contractors and other things is an early process in actually executing a project.
so when you see an increase in bid activity on buildingconnected, what you're actually seeing is an increase in the book of business of projects that will actually get executed downstream, right? so this is a good predictor of ongoing activity as you close a bid, you actually then move into execution with that particular subcontractor and some of the things associated with that. so it does give us a forward indication of how much site activity is going to be happening and how much actual real building is going to be going on. and that's one of the reasons why we highlighted one of the reasons we value that connection to the bid activity so much. not exactly what you asked but that's the depth that i can answer at this point.
jason celino -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok, perfect. and then on innovyze, i think you mentioned it kind of in one deal in your prepared remarks, but how is it performing? any change to win rates since you've acquired it? and then i think at some point, there was going to be some sort of subscription effort transition for the existing base. any worthwhile update there?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. so innovyze continues to perform well. it's doing particularly well in terms of our eba businesses. a lot of our enterprise business agreement customers are looking to incorporate innovyze into their contracts with us, which is exactly one of the big synergies we expected when we acquired innovyze.
they have begun their business model transformation. they're in the throes of that right now. it's going quite well. we expect to finish that in a reasonable amount of time.
so that's going quite well. but the business is doing well, and we continue to get a lot of interest not only in water in general from our customers, but also in the owner side of innovyze where they're building solutions that actually manage the operation of the water facilities.
jason celino -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst

thank you. our next question comes from michael funk of bank of america. michael funk, your line is open.
michael funk -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. thank you for the question this evening. a couple if i could. just back to the comments of the uniformity of products as you move to a platform or saying you don't want to tip your hand here.
but how heavy of a lift is this? and what is the timing involved? and then in addition to the increased attractiveness for customers, are there efficiencies that will accrue to autodesk as well by adding more uniformity across the platforms?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. so first off, let's be super clear. this isn't something that we're just suddenly starting out of the blue, right? it's been going on for quite some time in various forms. it is the most mature in its journey in the manufacturing space with what we're doing with fusion 360.
and that gives you a lot of visibility to what happens and how the portfolio is consolidated over time. a lot of capabilities that exist as separate products have shown up as extensions and native capabilities in the fusion environment. and that absolutely gives us long-term synergies where we're building on one environment versus trying to support the multiple products and their multiple needs. so you actually do get a lot of synergies.
right now, of course, we're double spending on a lot of things and we will double spend for some time. but the journey is not new to us. fusion is quite mature. aec is beginning its journey, seated with some of the cloud-native acquisitions we did particularly around what we did with spacemaker, a team that has been very much focused on the future of how people do building information model on a cloud platform, building information modeling on a cloud platform.
and we have other things that we'll be showing up in the media and entertainment space, again not wanting to tip my hand for some of the discussions we'll have later. but yeah, there are long-term synergies here. we are absolutely and will continue to double spend for a period of five to 10 years on some of these. products overlap for a long time.
we've been through several transformations of products, autocad and revit, mechanical desktop and adventure in the past for those of you who are familiar with some of those names. and yes, the overlap takes a while but eventually, what happens is most of the engineering effort and capability goes to the new platform and we evolve away in that direction.
michael funk -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
understood, yes. long-term complex project. and then the earlier comments on the delay and shift to annual billing. just want to make sure i completely understood.
was the comment that you wanted to make sure that the processes were better than they are now and the back office is better than it is right now? and if that's correct, i guess what were the issues that you were seeing that you wanted to streamline just to make that a more enjoyable process for the customers?
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
yeah. so first, let's level set on our intention to move from a multiyear upfront annual billings was always intended to start at the beginning of next year. so that's not any change that we've made on our side. and the reason why we did that was twofold: one, we needed to invest in our back-office systems infrastructure to make sure that we could execute on this transition at scale in an automated way, such that our customers would have a good customer experience, and we would have the controls and automated processes in place that we need in our back office.
so that's point number one. maybe more importantly is point number two. our partners are a really important part of our ecosystem. and so it was important to us to give them advanced notice, getting back to our last investor day, that we intended to embark on this journey so that we could work together with them to build the program, policies and all the things that we needed to do to make sure that they were along with us on the journey and that the entire ecosystem benefits from the shift to annual billings because just like it will be predictable for us to have an annual billing cycle, so too will it be for our customers and our partners.
but our partners needed time to plan. and so we wanted to make sure that we were collaborating with them in a healthy way as we move toward this transition.
michael funk -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes, that's pretty helpful color. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from bhavin shah of deutsche bank. bhavin shah, your line is open.
bhavin shah -- deutsche bank -- analyst
andrew, we continue to hear very good things about bim collaborate pro within the architecture and engineering customer base. can you maybe better help us understand where we are in terms of adoption of collaborate pro within like the revit customer base? and how we should think about the adoption curve going forward?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. it's an excellent question. look, it's still actually really early. i mean, bim collaborate pro continues to grow robustly.
as you recall, when we were -- during the pandemic, we saw quite a surge in the adoption of that product, and the adoption of it has continued post the pandemic period as more and more people become aware of the capabilities of bim collaborate pro. in terms of total penetration into the revit base, it's still really early days in terms of penetrating the vast majority of the revit base. in fact, interestingly enough, one of the biggest requests we get is to make bim collaborate pro work as robustly with civil 3d as it does with revit. and that's something that we're addressing, which is another vector where collaborate pro is going to be able to penetrate the infrastructure space as well.
still, really early days though in total penetration of the revit base. continues to grow. it's an on-ramp to digital preconstruction and autodesk construction cloud in many ways. and we're really happy with the way customers are adopting that.
it was one of the unexpected silver linings of the turmoil and tragedy of the pandemic that customers finally realize that that is a utility that is valuable to them now and in the future.
bhavin shah -- deutsche bank -- analyst
makes a ton of sense. and i guess along those lines and you kind of intimated at this a little bit, like in terms of adoption here, have you seen that accelerate customers' journeys toward some of your other cloud-based solutions that you guys offer?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. it absolutely does. it's a -- i hesitate to call it an on-ramp to our full portfolio of cloud solutions. but what it does is it gives customers a lot of confidence in how the cloud actually changes their processes.
they actually start to understand that, wow, this isn't just better. it's actually different and better. and it allows them and empowers them and encourages them to explore some of the other capabilities. oh, maybe i should be doing a preconstruction planning in the cloud.
oh, if i'm doing preconstruction planning in the cloud, i should be doing online site management in the cloud as well. so it absolutely demystifies the cloud for them and shows some of the core benefits. it really does educate a lot of our customer base on why the cloud matters and why it's so important to their distributed and highly collaborative future.
operator
we'll go to our next question, which comes from the line of gal munda of wolfe research. gal munda, your line is open.
gal munda -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you for taking my question. and maybe, andrew, just for you to start. you are calling out the noncompliant users again, and it seems like you're running roughly at a run rate that you were pre-pandemic again. how much of that is just having a flex model as well as being able to go more effectively toward your accounts that already pay you but maybe not pay enough and now you have a tool in order to monetize that? and maybe just how big flex could be in the future as you embark on that opportunity?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. so actually, gal, you're picking up on something that was implied in the opening commentary that flex is a highly valuable tool when you go and you reach the noncompliant users. in a lot of cases, what you're finding in a noncompliant usage situation is it's a multiuser situation gone bad, all right, where they've over-installed software or they've tried to use software in unlicensed ways. and what they're really trying to do is distribute usage, enable occasional usage, and some of the things associated with that.
flex is an excellent way to walk into some of those accounts and, in a collaborative manner, get them exploring other ways of engaging with autodesk. and it absolutely will have some positive impacts on how we do license compliance business. now as we look broadly at flex, again, it's still really early days with flex. we continue to see growth and we continue to see a lot of new users coming in with flex.
one of the growth vectors for flex that i'm particularly excited about is in the long tail of our business. because what flex allows you to do, if you're in a smaller company, say you're in a five-person company and you want to occasionally use revit for some of the projects you bid on, but the vast majority of your projects are autocad or you want to engage in structural simulation for a particular product, the flex model lets people dabble. it lets people engage with advanced functionality and advanced capabilities on a pay-per-use basis. and they don't have to commit to an annual subscription or a multiyear subscription to get some of these capabilities.
so i think there's a lot of long-term growth capabilities built into the long tail of our business that flex will likely unlock. the jury is still out. we're early on the journey so we'll see where that heads. that's one of the areas that i think is very interesting for flex.

and now i will turn the call over to andrew. 
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you, simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. today, we reported record second quarter revenue, non-gaap operating margin, and free cash flow. end market demand remained strong during the quarter, resulting in robust new business activity. renewal rates were again excellent.
all of this and our strong competitive performance more than offset the direct and indirect impact of geopolitical, macroeconomic, policy, and covid-19-related factors. growing commercial usage outside china, russia, and ukraine, record bid activity on buildingconnected, and continued channel partner optimism leave us well placed to achieve our fy '23 goals. as i said last quarter, the structural growth drivers for our business that were critical to our performance during the pandemic, such as flexibility and agility, continue to support and propel us during this period of elevated uncertainty. these growth drivers further cement the important role we play in our customers' digital transformations and increase our confidence in our strategy.
our steady strategy, industry-leading products, platform, and business model innovation, sustained and focused investment and strong execution are creating additional opportunities for autodesk. by accelerating the convergence of workflows within and between the industries we serve, we create broader and deeper partnerships with existing customers and bring new customers into our ecosystem. in pursuit of these goals, we announced at autodesk university last year that we were moving from products to platforms and capabilities and bringing these capabilities to any device anywhere through the cloud. over the coming weeks, months, and years, you will hear a lot more from us about our plans and progress to build a world-class customer experience, catalyze our customers' digital transformation and establish industry-leading platforms for design and make.
as evidence of the progress we have made already, fusion 360 flew past 200,000 subscribers during the second quarter and signed its first million-dollar contract, both important milestones and indications of the opportunities ahead. i will now turn the call over to debbie to take you through the details of our quarterly financial performance and guidance for the year. i'll then come back to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives.
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
thanks, andrew. q2 was a strong quarter across products and channels. our end markets were broadly consistent with last quarter, with our strongest growth in north america and growth in europe and apac impacted by the war in ukraine and covid lockdowns in china. total revenue grew 17%, both as reported and at constant currency.
by product, autocad and autocad lt revenue grew 13%, aec revenue grew 18%, manufacturing revenue grew 16% and m&e revenue grew 20%. by region, revenue grew 22% in the americas, 15% in emea and 10% in apac or 13% at constant currency. by channel, direct revenue increased 18%, representing 34% of total revenue while indirect revenue grew 16%. our product subscription renewal rates remain strong, and our net revenue retention rate was comfortably within our 100% to 110% target range.
billings increased 17% to $1.2 billion, reflecting robust underlying demand. total deferred revenue grew 12% to $3.7 billion. total rpo of $4.7 billion and current rpo of $3.1 billion grew 13% and 10%, respectively, reflecting strong billings growth and, as we've highlighted in the last two quarters, the timing and volume of multiyear contracts, which are typically on a three-year cycle. multiyear contract volume remained strong during the quarter, as expected and as you can see from the uptick in long-term deferred as a percent of total deferred.
turning to the p&l. non-gaap gross margin remained broadly level at 92%, while non-gaap operating margin increased by 5 percentage points to approximately 36%, reflecting strong revenue growth and ongoing cost discipline. gaap operating margins increased by 6 percentage points to approximately 20%. we delivered record second quarter free cash flow of $246 million, up 32% year over year, reflecting strong billings growth in both q1 and q2.
we continued our accelerated share repurchasing during the quarter. we purchased 1.4 million shares for $257 million at an average price of approximately $182 per share, which, when compared to last year, contributed to a reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding by approximately 3 million to 270 million shares. while our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged, you can expect that we will continue to invest organically and inorganically to drive growth. we've proactively used our strong liquidity to repurchase 3.5 million shares in the first half of this year, front-loading the offset of next year's dilution.
now let me finish with guidance. the underlying business conditions we've been seeing are broadly unchanged. as i mentioned earlier, we're seeing strength in north america and continued healthy growth in europe and asia, outside of russia and china, due to the geopolitical situation in both regions, as well as the covid lockdowns in china. our renewals business continues to be a highlight, reflecting the ongoing importance of our software and helping our customers achieve their goals.
as we look ahead and as with previous quarters, our fiscal '23 guidance assumes that market conditions remain consistent for the remainder of fiscal '23. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar during the quarter generated slight incremental fx headwinds, which reduced full year billings, revenue, and free cash flow by approximately $20 million, $5 million, and $5 million, respectively. bringing these factors together, the overall headline for guidance is that it is unchanged at the midpoint across all metrics, with the underlying momentum of the business offsetting those incremental fx headwinds.
we are narrowing the fiscal '23 revenue range to be between $4.99 billion and $5.04 billion. we continue to expect non-gaap operating margin to be approximately 36% and free cash flow to be between $2 billion and $2.08 billion. the slide deck and updated excel financials on our website have more details on modeling assumptions for q3 and full year fiscal '23. while the challenges our customers face are changing, the growth drivers underpinning our strategy have only been reinforced, which gives us confidence in our long-term growth potential.
we continue to target double-digit revenue growth, non-gaap operating margins in the 38% to 40% range, and double-digit free cash flow growth on a compound annual basis. these metrics are intended to provide a floor to our revenue growth ambitions and a ceiling to our spend growth expectations. andrew, back to you.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you, debbie. our strategy is to transform the industries we serve with end-to-end cloud-based solutions that drive efficiency and sustainability for our customers. our business is scalable and extensible into adjacent vertical, from architecture and engineering through construction and operations, from product engineering to product data management and product manufacturing. it is also scalable and extensible between verticals, with industrialized construction, and into new workflows like xr.
by accelerating the convergence of workflows within and between the industries we serve, we are also creating broader and deeper partnerships with existing customers and bringing new customers into our ecosystem. for example, kimley-horn, one of the nation's premier planning and design consultants, expanded its eba in q2, broadening and deepening its long-standing partnership with autodesk. in addition to increasing its utilization of civil 3d and revit and driving further operational efficiency gains through bim and cloud collaboration, it also chose to expand use of innovyze in its rapidly growing water practice to help drive more growth opportunities and productivity gains. as we highlighted last quarter, digital workflows are being adopted across the infrastructure life cycle from asset owners, architects, and engineers to construction to drive improved efficiency and sustainability.
the indiana department of transportation, which was looking for an efficient solution to simplify its document management and field collaboration, is another good q2 example. by adopting autodesk build and acc connect, it will improve communication and coordination throughout the construction process and streamline the documentation of citizen issues, resulting in less waste and more return per taxpayer dollar. across construction, the industry continues to look to connect workflows from planning and design to preconstruction, construction, and ultimately, operations and maintenance. and we are enabling our customers to connect those workflows on a single platform.
for example, a commercial real estate and property management company focused on owners, investors and occupants was tired of having multiple platforms across the project life cycle, resulting in inconsistencies, rework, and poor handoffs. in q2, it adopted the full autodesk construction cloud to connect preconstruction with project management. it added quantification estimating to buildingconnected and bim collaborate pro in preconstruction and autodesk build for project management to give themselves a competitive advantage and increase profitability through improved collaboration and data management. across the globe, our customers seek to connect and streamline their construction workflows, and we are enabling and accelerating that through our partner network, launching autodesk build in new markets like japan, enabling more data formats on more devices, and delivering more value to our customers through account-based pricing.
we're also giving our customers control of their data through bridge, leveraging the power of machine learning to anticipate project risk and seamlessly connecting workflows like takeoff, estimating, and budgeting to delight our customers and improve their productivity. with monthly active users growing more than 45% quarter over quarter, autodesk build is being rapidly adopted by existing and new customers to connect and streamline their construction workflows. turning to manufacturing. we sustained strong momentum in our manufacturing portfolio this quarter as we connected more workflows beyond the design studio, developed more on-ramps to our manufacturing platform and delivered new powerful tools and functionality through fusion 360 extensions.
customers continue to expand their adoption of the fusion platform beyond design and engineering. this quarter, a u.s. supplier of metal cutting tools chose to create a state-of-the-art collaboration tool on fusion to enable its sales organization to demonstrate its digital manufacturing technology to customers. by enabling customer customization to be immediately reflected in factory manufacturing instructions, the tool will be a competitive advantage during the selling process.
for autodesk, it adds a significant new persona group to fusion's addressable market opportunity. in automotive, we continue to grow our footprint beyond the design studio into manufacturing as automotive oems seek to break down the work silos and shorten the handoff and design cycles. for example, a top-tier commercial vehicle manufacturer renewed and increased its partnership with autodesk as part of its strategic focus on building a sustainable product and service portfolio, which leverages new technologies and digital innovation to accelerate electrical vehicle solutions. in addition to alias, which it already uses for surfacing work of all its vehicles, it is utilizing vr technology from the wild in combination with vred and navisworks to drive innovation and visualization from design and engineering through factory design.
our fusion 360 platform approach enables customers to seamlessly connect workflows and push the boundaries of innovation through the advanced design and manufacturing technologies and extensions. for example, a global leader in seat manufacturing, which works with many major automakers worldwide, engaged autodesk consulting to develop a blended workflow across design, product engineering, and manufacturing. the result was a seat that proves passenger comfort and safety while reducing the weight and number of parts. using autodesk design tools like alias conceptual design and fusion 360 design, it was able to redefine the seat design with thinner seat sections and improved comfort and safety.
fusion 360's commercial subscribers grew steadily, ending the quarter with 205,000 subscribers, and demand for our new extensions, including machining, generative design, and nesting and fabrication continuing to grow at an exceptional pace. in education, engineering students are using fusion 360 to learn the skills of the future in institutions like grwp llandrillo menai, the largest further education college group in wales. students there are applying their studies to benefit local industry partners and businesses. for example, students recently used fusion 360's cloud-based data management and advanced 3d machining to help a local rv manufacturer improve its output by about 50%.
the college is now planning to integrate fusion 360 across its 11 campuses due to its ease of use, modern user interface, accessibility across devices, and ability to collaborate on team projects and share data. and finally, we continue to bring more users into our ecosystem through business model innovation and license compliance initiatives. when one of our emea customers realized that some usage from its international offices was noncompliant, it needed time and data to better understand its users before purchasing subscriptions. by purchasing our first-ever 100,000-pack of flex tokens, the customer gained instant access to autodesk's portfolio of products and usage data to make informed decisions on its future subscription purchases while also opening up new competitive opportunities for autodesk.
during the quarter, we closed seven deals over $500,000 with our license compliance initiatives, three of which were over $1 million. flex and premium are also helping customers transition from multiuser to named user contracts. a leading supplier of concrete formwork and scaffolding systems in europe has been unifying internally around bim to accelerate its digital transformation. it added premium plan to its transitions and named trade-ins to centralize software management, enable user-based analytics and license optimization and benefit from single sign-on security.
it can also purchase flex token to cover its occasional user needs. let me finish where i started. strong demand and robust competitive performance delivered excellent q2 results. our subscription business continues to demonstrate its growth potential and resilience.
by accelerating the convergence of workflows within and between the industries we serve, we are accelerating the digital transformation of our customers and creating broader and deeper partnerships with them. and by moving from products to platforms and capabilities and bringing those capabilities to any device anywhere through the cloud, we are expanding our opportunity horizon. look for us to talk more about that over the coming weeks, months, and years. we look forward to seeing many of you at autodesk university in a few weeks.
operator, we would now like to open the call for questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] one moment, please. our first question comes from saket kalia of barclays. your line is open.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
ok, great. hey, andrew. hey, debbie. thanks for taking my questions here.
debbie, maybe we'll start with you. i don't want to put you on the spot here. but i guess just given the evolving macro and some of the other factors that we spoke about, is there anything that you want us to know high level on kind of how you're thinking about fiscal '24 as we maybe fine-tune our models looking out?
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
thanks, saket. hope you're doing great. so, we'll give formal guidance for fiscal '24 in february when we report on next quarter's results. but here are some things to think about.
first, on revenue. at this point, we expect some exogenous headwinds out of the gate. we'll have about a 5-point-or-so incremental fx headwind. that's because of the continued strengthening of the u.s.
dollar and then another point of incremental headwind from exiting russia. that's going to make it tough for us to grow revenue beyond double digits. on margin, the revenue headwind creates margin growth headwinds, which likely means limited progress on reported margins in fiscal '24. put another way, margins will look better at constant exchange rates.
and then on free cash flow, factset consensus right now is a range of $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion. there's a couple of important things to consider. the first is the rate at which our customers transition to annual billings. and the second is the overall macroeconomic environment.
we continue to be focused on executing on that transition as fast as possible because while the change is good for us, and it's good for our customers, from a financial standpoint, we really want the noise behind us. so, remember, the faster that we move the multiyear-based annual billings, the greater the free cash flow headwind we'll see in fiscal '24. on macro, we will, as usual, give our fiscal '24 guidance based on the macro conditions that we see as we exit fiscal '23.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
got it. got it. that makes a lot of sense. andrew, maybe for my follow-up for you, a lot of helpful commentary just on retention rates and sort of the pace of new business.
i was wondering if you could just go one level deeper. and maybe we could just talk about how demand fared through the quarter? most of the business, as i think we all know, is pretty high velocity. but i'm curious if you saw changing trends in pipeline or close rates or duration preferences toward the end of the quarter versus earlier. any commentary there would be helpful.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. look, q3 was very much like q2 and that the quarter was fairly consistent, right? what was different between q3 and q2 was the slowing down in europe taking russia out. and that was definitely something that was different about the quarters. but that was consistent across the entire quarter.
there was no acceleration or change of that as you proceeded across the quarter. europe was weak throughout the quarter. as were -- some of the preferences with regards to multiyear billings, there was no kind of trend of more and more reluctance as you headed further and further down the quarter. so, it's a fairly consistent quarter with regards to all of those things and fairly consistent performance of the business across the quarter.
so, nothing that fundamentally changed in the quarter. look, one of the things -- another thing that was different about q3 over q2 is that we had some currency fluctuations toward the end. and that really is probably the only thing that was different, and those currency fluctuations were responsible for the majority of the small revenue miss.
saket kalia -- barclays -- analyst
got it. very helpful, guys. thanks a lot for taking my questions here. 
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of phil winslow of credit suisse. one moment, please. our next question comes from the line of jay vleeschhouwer of griffin securities.
your line is open. 
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
thank you. good evening. andrew, for you, first, to follow up on some comments you made regarding your strategy at au and then allow a follow-up for debbie. so, at au, you made some comments with regard to the various clouds that you've introduced, and you made an important distinction between the aec cloud and the manufacturing cloud, namely that manufacturing cloud is more mature.
it's been out in the market perhaps longer. so, what is your expectation for the maturity or development of the aec cloud to get it to where you think it needs to be so it'll be comparably mature or capable, the way the manufacturing cloud is, the way you described it at au? and then for debbie as a follow-up since the door was open to an fy '24 discussion, apart from everything else you're doing programmatically, could you talk about some of the things that you're going to be doing with regard to channel compensation in terms of margin structure, comping on annual versus multiyear and all those various things that you're planning to implement? and if those are going to have any effect on your margins and your cash flow?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
all right, jay. so, i'll start with regards to the forma evolution. it's going to be kind of similar to what happened with fusion, all right? and i'll kind of tell it this way. when we started fusion, we actually anchored fusion on two things.
we started fusion upfront in the design process. you probably don't remember the early days of fusion, fusion was actually a conceptual design application. it was highly focused on consumer products design and upfront design processes. and we started just bolting onto it downstream processes close to the shop for manufacturing, and we started building cloud-based connections between those two and basically filling off the middle between those two bookends of manufacturing and conceptual design.
think of the evolution of format is very similar to that, right? the cloud -- the forma cloud is going to start off focusing on the upfront conceptual phases of design, helping architects, planners, developers, all types of people that have to deal with early conceptual decisions about utilization, space utilization, aligning and distributing various aspects of development or an individual building and helping them make some better decisions far upfront in the design. but it's also going to work to integrate downstream to what we're doing in construction cloud. so, construction cloud will start getting very close to some of the early bits of what forma does. and over time, what's going to happen is forma and construction cloud, construction cloud representing the downstream example of manufacturing, all the bits in between are going to be filled out on the same platform, similar to the evolution that we walked through with fusion.
and that will basically bring the entire process to the cloud over time, but continuously adding value to what our customers are doing today throughout the entire development and evolution of that cloud.
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
and jay, to your second question, channel compensation, the details, they're still in the works. but ultimately, how we think about engaging with our channel partners, engaging with our customers, how we think about the compensation programs, everything is about delivering value to our customers, driving adoption, driving customer satisfaction. so, examples of some of the things that you've seen us do historically are things like moving more front-end incentives to back-end incentives that mandate some kind of adoption metrics, things like that, again, all in service of trying to deliver value. and in terms of the impact on margins, well, we haven't guided to margins next year, we haven't guided specifically to anything next year other than some of the breadcrumbs that i just left you guys.
but i would say that as we've said before, we're committed to achieving our margin target in that 38% to 40% range in the fiscal '23 to '26 window.
jay vleeschhouwer -- griffin securities -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. one moment, please. our next question comes from the line of phil winslow of credit suisse.
phil winslow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thank you for taking my question. i'm not sure what happened earlier, but andrew, a question for you, then a follow-up for debbie. one of the questions i think is about the cyclicality of the aec industry.
and as you mentioned, the industry entered this year with a backlog from 2020 and frankly, even 2019. but as you pointed out, the macroeconomic environment has obviously deteriorated. so, my question is what are you seeing and hearing from this vertical, especially about sort of the go-forward pipeline, as you think about the software that autodesk sells in the various spaces here, the design, plan, build and maintain? and then i'll just wait to ask the question to debbie. thanks.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. so, first off, one thing continues to pressure the industry more than the demand, and it is the labor shortages and the capacity to execute. construction companies still have a backlog of business. they're still struggling to execute through the business that they have.
i'm sure you saw that some of the leading indicators of architectural buildings have gone or entered into a shrinking territory, which means that architects are going to see some decline in some of their buildings moving forward, but they also still have a backlog of business. so, we're still seeing customers saying, look, you know what, i have a pretty big pipeline of business that i haven't executed on a queue of projects, and i still have capacity problems of getting through it. they're labor-related, they're material-related, they're execution related. so, we still have an overhang of backlog that's going to continue into next year for a lot of our customers, and that's what we're hearing from our customers.
that's not to say they're not seeing pressure, and that's not to say that they're not seeing some pressure in various segments. but they're still seeing a pretty good book of business for the next 12 to 18 months. now as things continue, they'll start to see kind of downward pressure in some of that backlog. but right now, they're all much more concerned about their ability to execute than they are about the book of business that they're accumulating.
phil winslow -- credit suisse -- analyst
awesome. thanks for that. and then debbie, just a follow-up on billings. at the beginning of the year, you talked about long-term deferred revenue, i think, being in the high 20s as a percentage of toll as you exit this year.
i wonder if you could give us an update on that. and then in terms of next fiscal year, as you move toward one-year billings, help us maybe quantify sort of the drawdown of long-term deferred revenue and the impact of that? because obviously, you flagged the sell-side range right now of $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion, but obviously, that's pretty broad. so maybe some color on the impact of long-term deferred next year would be helpful, too. thanks.
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, overall, our messaging in these two areas hasn't changed. so, we were talking about long-term deferred as a percent of total deferred in that 20s range, and it's going to continue to be there. the impact of our guidance adjustment for billings, a little over $100 million on a $5 billion number is not significant.
and so, we're not anticipating that they will have a major impact on the metrics that you described. as we think about next year, i don't have anything additional to share on how to think about the decline or what have you, other than to reiterate what i said before, and that is to think about the fact that consensus that's out there right now, that range of $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion. and then to reiterate that it's really our goal to move as fast as possible because we really like to get this financial noise behind us.
phil winslow -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks a lot.
operator
thank you. one moment, please. our next question comes from the line of adam borg of stifel. your line is open.
adam borg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hey, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. first for andrew, and then a follow-up for debbie. so just given the macro, are you seeing any trends of customers either -- not necessarily upgrading to collections that otherwise or doing so earlier in the year? or conversely, any trade downs from collections to point solutions or even lt? and then i have a follow-up.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. ok. great. adam.
no, actually, there's no change in those demand preferences with regards to collections and what people are buying. the mix of state essentially is same, the renewal rate of the states pretty steady. if anything, what we're seeing is softness in the low end of our business, which is what you would expect in a climate like this. lt growth has lowed, lt renewal rates have seen some pressure.
that's where we're seeing things. the collections percentages, the collections renewal rates, these have remained steady throughout the year and throughout the quarter.
adam borg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
awesome. and maybe just for debbie. so -- and i don't know if this is a harder question to answer, but if the multiyear mix came in line with your original expectations, how we think about the billings guide or even the billings results in the year, right? if it was the original mix that going into the quarter.
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
if i understand your question correctly, if the proportion of our business that had been multiyear was in line with our expectations then we would have hit our original guide. and the fact that we're seeing some in that cohort choose to move to annual billings or annual contracts, that's making it so that we're reducing the billings and free cash flow guide. but maybe -- did i understand your question correctly?
adam borg -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
super clear. thanks again.
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
ok.
operator
thank you. one moment, please. our next question comes from the line of stephen tusa of j.p. morgan.
your line is open.
stephen tusa -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, good evening, guys. how are you?
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
good.
stephen tusa -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks. so, i'm just -- maybe i'm an idiot, but just like reading between the lines, the faster you guys move in the transition, all else equal, the lower the free cash flow next year will be, correct? or are there other things moving around?
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
the faster the transition -- well, first, i want to continue to characterize that the impact of the numbers is relatively small, and it would have a minor follow-on implications to next year. but ultimately, what was built into our guidance was an expectation of a certain proportion of the business that was going to be multiyear upfront. a small portion of those customers have elected to be annual. so rather than it being a negative impact to next year, it would be a very slight positive impact to next year because we would have annual billings next year that weren't in the form of a multiyear upfront transaction this year.
but i want to continue to reiterate that the impact is relatively small. the impact to our billings guidance this year is relatively small. and if you think about the scale of the free cash flow number next year, i want to go back to that range that i was talking about that fact that consensus range of $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion. and our goal really is to move the totality of the multiyear base to annual billings as fast as possible.
and the faster we go, the greater that headwind is going to be to free cash flow next year.
stephen tusa -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah, exactly. i was asking about '24. basically, you're kind of telling us $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion and then you're reiterating that you're going to try and move as fast as possible. so, i will use it much more of a '24 question, which you just, i think, answered.
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
ok. great. 
stephen tusa -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
right. the faster you move, the more impact you have next year. 
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
correct. yeah. that's fair.
stephen tusa -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. ok. that's super helpful. and any color on kind of the i guess, the drop-through on bookings -- or sorry, billings when i look at free cash flow, it's like 85% to free cash flow.
that's, i guess -- just it drops through with your gross margin. i would assume you don't really manage that on a quarterly basis. so, it makes some sense. i am i looking at that the right way? or is there something on the cost line that moves around and mitigates that decline in billings?
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
no. i think you're thinking about it in a directionally accurate way. the billings reduction then has a follow-on implication to the free cash flow reduction. there's nothing else going on there.
stephen tusa -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. ok, great. thanks a lot for the color. really appreciate it. 
operator
thank you. one moment, please. our next question comes from the line of michael funk of bank of america. your line is open.
michael funk -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. thank you for the questions tonight. so, you mentioned a few times trying to incentivize the shift from multiyear to annual. so, first, what are you doing to incentivize that? i guess second, what drove the different customer behavior this quarter than expected with the shift? and i guess, third part, same question, is how quickly do you believe that you can transition your base over to annual as we think about trying to model out the free cash flow impact?
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
ok. so, let's -- taking detailed notes. so, in terms of the incentives, the incentives for both our channel partners -- well, for our channel partners are still in place. so that's part of the programmatic details that we're working through right now as we engage with our partners and we execute on the transition.
remember, a substantial majority of that transition is going to be next year in our fiscal '24, and that's why those details are still in flight. on the customer side, what they've historically had a discount of anywhere from 10% to 5% to have a multiyear contract that's invoiced and collected upfront, and that discount goes away. so, the incentive is not there necessarily in the future for those customers to be trying to pay for upfront. and we think based on the feedback that we've been getting from our customers that they want to have multiyear contracts with annual billings.
it's good for them in managing their cash flow just like it's good for us. it removes the volatility that we see. and as you can see from our guidance this quarter, the volatility that we see with those multiyear upfront contracts. in terms of what drove the behavior that we saw this past quarter, well, the end of the multiyear discount is coming at the start of next year.
and so, we were anticipating more demand for multiyear upfront contracts. and in the end, we're seeing slightly less demand than we expected. in the current macroeconomic environment, that's not surprising. the trade-off of the discount versus the cash up front, it's not as enticing for some customers right now.
we've assumed that the behavior that we saw with respect to the materials in q3 persists through q4. and that's what's built into our guidance. it's consistent with our overall guidance philosophy. and we really think that it reinforces our strategy to move to annual billings.
we're hopeful that it's a positive sign for the transition next year. and then, finally, in terms of what we can do in order to drive the pace. well, a lot of that's going to come down to our internal capabilities being available. i've mentioned before that we're investing in systems to set us up to manage all these contracts at scale, and we're on pace.
with those system changes, ultimately, it's going to come down to what's on our price list and how we work through these programmatic details with our partners. and these are all decisions that are very much under discussion right now, and that you'll hear more from us over the next couple of months.
michael funk -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok, great. thank you for the question.
operator
thank you. one moment, please. our next question comes from the line of gal munda of wolfe research. your line is open.
gal munda -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. the first one is just around fusion 360 and what you guys are seeing there. i know that when we visited autodesk university with us, really, really good feedback. at the same time, the macro environment in manufacturing is kind of going a little bit slow.
is there anything particularly that makes you potentially see any sort of slowdown in that? or do you think your fusion 360 throughout the cycle is going to perform better than what you've seen in the past in your manufacturing portfolio? thank you.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. so first off, gal, manufacturing grew 13%, 14% on constant currency, that's still best-in-class for our space. so, we continue to believe that we're taking share in that respect. look, you can't have a slowdown in europe, where we're very strong, without seeing some slowdown in new user acquisition with regards to fusion.
however, we still continue to acquire more new users than any of our competitors in the space. so even in the face of some headwinds where we see some slowing, we're outpacing our competitors, which is kind of the important metric here in terms of the appetite and desire for fusion. it continues to be the disruptive player, the disruptive price point, the disruptive capabilities. and our customers continue to embrace the solution even in the environment of headwinds.
so, we're not concerned because customers really need the efficiency of an end-to-end connected solution, and they really want what they get at the kind of price points that we deliver with fusion. so, we continue to be the preferred solution. i continue that -- i expect that to continue, and i expect our relative performance to remain strong.
gal munda -- wolfe research -- analyst
that's perfect. thank you. and then just as a follow-up, thinking about the opportunity. i know when covid happened and we talked about the noncompliant user opportunity, you kind of posed a little bit of everything, and you said we're going to come back when the environment, especially macro, is a little bit stronger.
you've done that over the last year. if i'm thinking about heading into another macro weakness, how much of an opportunity is coming from the noncompliant users? or how much more lenient you might be maybe for a year or two until that plays out? thank you.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think we've got a good rhythm in our compliance business right now. i mean i think covid was a very unique situation where there was a sudden and precipitous impact on our customers. i think we're heading into kind of a different environment in many respect.
of course, manufacturers are seeing increased costs in terms of energy and material costs and things associated with that. so, the pressures are real. but i think the rate and pace that we're on right now with regards to license compliance makes sense. like i've always said, this isn't something that we're going to slam the accelerator on and try to move faster.
but right now, i don't see us actually changing our pace or slowing down in any kind of way. i think we're at a nice clip right now, and i think we'll be able to maintain it through any kind of bumpiness that we might see as we head into the winter.
gal munda -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks, andrew. appreciate that.
operator
thank you. one moment, please. our next question comes from the line of matt hedberg of rbc. your line is open.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question, guys. debbie, i wanted to come back to the cash flow breadcrumbs that you gave. sort of -- you keep talking about the range of $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion and wanting to progress as fast as possible.
i mean does that effectively imply that that low end of factset consensus is at play? just sort of curious on why phrase it as a range like that. 
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, matt. so, we're not guiding on the call today. we're trying to provide some insight into how to think about it.
and that range is in the realm of possibility, and there are a couple of factors that we want to continue to emphasize that are going to impact that. and that is the rate at which our customers transition to annual billings and the overall macroeconomic environment. but as i said, we will provide specifics on the next earnings call.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. thanks. and maybe just one on the expense side. i appreciate the currency headwinds next year and sort of the reiteration of kind of the long-term margin framework.
are there things that you guys are doing right now from a spend perspective, whether it's hiring or just sort of like general cost consciousness as we get into more economic uncertainty?
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks. so first, i want to say that we've been focused on ensuring that we don't spend ahead of top-line growth. we've delivered considerable operating margin expansion over the last couple of years.
we've exhibited a spend discipline that we now benefit from as the market conditions continue to evolve. if we focus on the near term, we've delivered on our margin goals for the year-to-date. we're on track to do so through the end of the year. you can see that from no change in our operating margin guidance.
our hiring plans at the beginning of the year reflected really what is a solid balance between proactive investment and the discipline required to achieve our margin targets. as we look ahead to next year, we're in the planning process right now, but we're focused on ensuring that we continue this pattern of disciplined spend. we're looking to ensure that we can invest in the right areas to drive the strategy. so things like purposeful and strategic rather than broad-based investing in areas like our industry clouds and shared services, but all against a backdrop of delivering a healthy margin.
i also want to say that we want to ensure that we're not too short term in our thinking. we have a strong balance sheet. we want to make sure that we strike that right balance as we navigate these macro waters. we want to capitalize on the downturn to continue to invest, but all while keeping that watchful eye on operating margin.
and as we said before, we are committed to achieving a margin target in the 38% to 40% range in that fiscal '23 to '26 window.
matt hedberg -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks, tim.
operator
thank you. one moment, please. our next question comes from the line of tyler radke of citi. your line is open.
tyler radke -- citi -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. andrew, so at au, you obviously announced the product announcements on forma and flow. i'm curious how, if you could talk a little bit about the plans to accelerate the engineering velocity, specifically, is this is going to require more hiring? or is it just kind of reprioritization of your engineers? and then just kind of comparing it to the timeline that you saw fusion play out in that monetization cycle. just help us understand how you're expecting kind of the product to roll out and the monetization trend over time.
thanks.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. so first off, one of the things we did to just start forma, as you might recall at the beginning of the pandemic, we acquired a norwegian company called spacemaker. and we've continued to invest in that team, and we'll continue to expand that team either by repurposing existing resources to work with that team or by adding additional resources to that team to make sure that we're on track. but one of the foundational investments that supports all of the things we're trying to do with our investment in data.
and that's an ongoing investment in trying to break up revit files and make them more accessible in the cloud as granular data. forma and -- by nature is built net native on the cloud and it has granular data at its core. so, that's one of the kind of core vectors that we'll be doing. but we will be incrementally investing to ensure that we're heading on the right path with this solution, but we have done some of that already, and we've kind of absorbed some of those investments today.
now i think the question about the timeline is a really good one because this kind of transformations -- what we're doing with forma is different, right? what we're doing with revit to improve its performance and improve its capabilities based on what our customers are asking us to do is making their current tools better. but what forma is doing, especially with the connection -- its native connections to downstream processes is different. it takes time for differences to penetrate the industry, just like differences took time with fusion. it was -- we've been working on fusion for over a decade, all right, roughly speaking a decade.
so, you can expect that it's going to take five years for forma to mature and even longer for it to totally replace what our customers are doing. however, our goal is to incrementally add value to the process as time goes on, just like we did with fusion. fusion, we added incremental value with the connection to downstream manufacturing. in forma, we're going to add incremental value with regards to the data platforms and the connection to the downstream construction processes.
so that's all connected, but it is going to take time similar to what we saw with fusion.
tyler radke -- citi -- analyst
that's helpful. and debbie, maybe a question for you. so just on the current rpo, it looked like that did pick up a bit quarter over quarter if you back out the currency. can you just help us understand i guess, first, do you kind of view that as the best leading indicator given the headwinds in billings? and just remind us how you're thinking about the puts and takes on that just as you do -- renew these large eba customers in the coming quarters.
just anything we should be mindful of there? thank you. 
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure. so yes, i mean, current rpo is a very important metric in monitoring our business performance. and you're right, particularly when you normalize for the currency impacts that growth was in a healthy zone. so, i want to just continue to stress that fx has been really volatile, and that's going to continue to impact the growth rate.
so, definitely look at the constant-currency growth rates over time. also, the timing and volume of our ebas impact the growth rate period to period. and so, sometimes what you see is that when we have large cohorts of our ebas coming up for renewal, it tends to be back-end loaded in our fiscal years and most often in our q4, we start to see growth impacts as the year progresses, in many cases, deceleration q1 to q3 that would tick back up as those cohorts for ebas come back up for renewal. so, growth rate should tick back up over time, given consistent historical -- given patterns consistent with our historical patterns.
but again, remember the constant currency has just been a zinger that's going to impact growth rates for quite a while here. so -- but it is an important metric for us, and we monitor it closely.
tyler radke -- citi -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. one moment, please. our next question comes from the line of jason celino of keybanc. your line is open.
jason celino -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi. thanks for squeezing me in. just two quick ones. so, when we look at the fourth quarter guidance, it looks like you'll exit the year at 8% growth at the midpoint, pretty big decel from third quarter.
i guess what is the fx headwind built into here? and are there any other factors that we should think about for q4?
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, jason, the biggest impact is currency. we've seen a growing currency headwind during the year, and that's gradually showing up in the growth rates as the year progresses. it's about a 3-point headwind in q4.
it was a 1-point headwind in q3 and was neutral in the tailwind at the beginning of the year. so, you can see that it's gradually having a significant impact on our growth rate. that's the biggest driver of the implied growth rate that you're talking about. also, to a lesser extent -- but andrew did mention that we saw a modest deceleration in our new business, particularly in europe during q3, that does have a slight follow-on impact to revenue in q4.
jason celino -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. great. thank you. and then the last multiyear appetite, it sounds like, to some extent, some of this is macro-related.
i guess where do you see that dynamic most prevalent? was it with your larger customers, your smaller customers, international versus domestic? just trying to understand kind of the puts and takes.
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
yeah. it tends to be larger deal sizes, not surprisingly. i think that when our customers start to exhibit cash conservation behavior, that behavior does tend to be more prevalent with some of the larger deal sizes. and remember, they're still signing multiyear contracts, they're just signing multiyear contracts and asking for annual billings, which for those larger deals, we are going to accommodate while we continue to invest in the back-office infrastructure to be able to handle the totality of the multiyear base with annual billings at scale.
jason celino -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok, perfect. thank you.
operator
thank you. one moment, please. our next question comes from the line of keith weiss of morgan stanley. your line is open.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. thank you so much. [inaudible] the comments on the stable renewal rates, and i'd just like to dig into the expansion motion. and it's not like never tension stayed within the historical range.
but curious if you're seeing any changes on just the expansion behavior with the shift in macro? and should we expect a similar range into 2024? is there any risk that we could fall outside of those ranges just given the broader macro headwinds? thank you.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
so, with regards to retention rates, look, retention rates continue to be strong and maintain steadiness. i think we're going to continue to see us steadiness in the next year. the one area where we expect to see softness with macro headwinds is at the low end of our market. so, the low end of the market is low asps, but high volume.
so, the retention rates can move around on a volume basis when there's headwinds like this. but generally speaking, broadly across our business, we see retention rates holding up. our products are mission-critical to what our customers do. they need them.
but at the low end of our business, we'll probably see some headwinds there, but they won't be material to the larger business.
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
i would just add that our net revenue retention rate was comfortably within the target range of 100% to 110%. and in the short term, our expectation is that it will stay in that range. 
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. and then just following up on kind of the comments about the strong balance sheet and willing to invest. wanted to see if you're seeing any change in behavior in the competitive landscape, especially from some companies that may not have as strong a balance sheet. so, any changes you're seeing in the behavior overall? thank you.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
so, with regard to -- i just want to give a clarification on that question. with regards to the competitive environment in what way in terms of how does it -- just give me a clarification on your question a little bit there. i didn't quite understand it.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah, sure. so, you guys have a strong balance sheet kind of willing to invest in the current environment, just even though there may be some macro headwinds. but you likely have some peers out there that may not be as well funded or has strong balance sheets. so, curious if you're just seeing any sort of changes in behavior across the competitive landscape.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
yeah. ok. ok. good.
i just wanted to make sure that i [inaudible] so we're in better shape than some of our competitors that are not profitable. in certain situations, people are going to be chasing, i think, long-term things that kind of boost revenue or pull revenue forward. they'll be doing customer unfriendly things to try to pull things forward. we're not in that position right now, especially in certain types of sectors.
we're maintaining customer-friendly practices, we're focusing on the long term. we're investing in the long term. and that will actually provide competitive advantage as we move out of the slowdown. it's always great to be in a position to invest during a slowdown and to not have to pull short-term levers to try to achieve profitability, maintain profitability, or get in the way of things.
we'll probably have more dry powder for inorganic activity than some of our competitors as we head through this. so, yeah, strong balance sheet actually helps us invest ahead of the curve while we go through these things. so, i'm pretty confident that we're ahead of the game in a lot of places.
operator
thank you. that is all the time that we do have for question. so, i'd like to turn the call back over to simon mays-smith for any closing remarks.

operator
thank you for standing by, and welcome to the autodesk q3 fiscal '23 earnings conference call. at this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. after the speakers' presentations, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.
i would now turn the conference over to your host mr. simon mays-smith, vice president of investor relations. please go ahead.
simon mays-smith -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, operator, and good afternoon. thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the third quarter results of our fiscal '23. on the line with me are andrew anagnost, our ceo; and debbie clifford, our cfo. today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast.
in addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com/investor. you can find the earnings press release, slide presentation, and transcript of today's opening commentary on our investor relations website following this call. during this call, we may make forward-looking statements about our outlook, future results and related assumptions, acquisitions, products, and product capabilities and strategies. these statements reflect our best judgment based on currently known factors.
actual events or results could differ materially. please refer to our sec filings including our most recent form 10-q and the form 8-k filed with today's press release for important risk factors and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements during the call are being made as of today. if this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information.
autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. during the call, we will quote several numerical growth changes as we discuss our financial performance. unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. all non-gaap numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in our press release, or excel financials, and other supplemental materials available on our investor relations website.
and now, i'll turn the call over to andrew. 
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you, simon, and welcome, everyone, to the call. we again reported record third quarter revenue, non-gaap operating margin, and free cash flow. encouragingly, the business is performing as we'd expect given secular growth tailwinds and macroeconomic, geopolitical policy, and covid-19-related headwinds. subscription renewal rates remain resilient.
our competitive performance remains strong. outside of russia and china, new business growth slightly decelerated in the quarter, most notably in europe, but overall growth remains good. and we see less demand for multiyear upfront and more demand for annual contracts than we expected. we're hopeful this is a positive signal for our transition next year to annual billings for multiyear contracts.
overall, our leading indicators are consistent with these trends. channel partners remain optimistic, but with hints of caution. usage rates continue to grow modestly in the u.s. and apac, excluding china, but are flat in europe, excluding russia.
and bid activity on buildingconnected remains robust as the industry continues to work through its backlog. we are reinforcing the secular tailwinds to our business by accelerating the convergence of workflows within and between the industries we serve, creating broader and deeper partnerships with existing customers, and bringing new customers into our ecosystem. our strategy is underpinned by disciplined and focused investments through the economic cycle, which enables autodesk to remain well-invested to realize the significant benefits of its strategy while mitigating the risk of having to make expensive catch-up investments later. in september, we hosted more than 10,000 customers and partners at autodesk university.
there was incredible energy, excitement, and optimism for being together in person for the first time in three years. there was also palpable momentum behind the digital transformation of the industries we serve. at au, we announced fusion, forma, and flow, our three industry clouds, which will connect data, teams, and workflows in the cloud on our trusted platform. by increasing our engineering velocity, moving data from files to the cloud, and expanding our third-party ecosystem, they will enable autodesk to further increase customer value by delivering even greater efficiency and sustainability.
i will now turn the call over to debbie to take you through our third quarter financial performance and guidance for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. i'll then come back to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives. 
debbie clifford -- chief financial officer
thanks, andrew. in a more challenging macroeconomic environment, autodesk performed in line with our expectations in the third quarter, excluding the impact of in-quarter currency movements on revenue. resilient subscription renewal rates, healthy new business growth, and a strong competitive performance were partly offset by geopolitical macroeconomic policy, and covid-19-related headwinds, foreign exchange movements, and less demand for multiyear upfront and more demand for annual contracts than we expected. total revenue grew 14% and 15% at constant exchange rates.
by product, autocad and autocad lt revenue grew 10%. aec and manufacturing revenue both grew 13% and m&e revenue grew 24%, partly driven by upfront revenue growth. by region, revenue grew 17% in the americas, 10% in emea, and 14% in apac. at constant exchange rates, emea and apac grew 12% and 18%, respectively.
by channel, direct revenue increased 14%, representing 35% of total revenue, while indirect revenue grew 13%. our product subscription renewal rates remain strong, and our net revenue retention rate was comfortably within our 100% to 110% target range. billings increased 16% to $1.4 billion, reflecting continued solid underlying demand, partly offset by foreign exchange movements and a shift in mix from multiyear upfront to annual contracts versus expectations. total deferred revenue grew 13% to $3.8 billion.
total rpo of $4.7 billion and current rpo of $3.1 billion grew 11% and 9%, respectively. at constant exchange rates, rpo and current rpo grew approximately 15% and 13%, respectively. turning to the p&l. non-gaap gross margin remained broadly level at 93%, while non-gaap operating margin increased by 4 percentage points to approximately 36%, reflecting strong revenue growth and ongoing cost discipline.
gaap operating margin increased by 3 percentage points to approximately 20%. we delivered robust third quarter free cash flow of $460 million, up 79% year over year reflecting strong revenue growth, margin improvement, and a larger multiyear upfront billing cohort. turning to capital allocation. we continue to actively manage capital within our framework.
as andrew said, our organic and inorganic investments will remain disciplined and focused through the economic cycle. we will continue to offset dilution from our stock-based compensation program and to accelerate repurchases opportunistically when it makes sense to do so. year to date, we purchased 4.4 million shares for $873 million at an average price of approximately $200 per share, which compared to last year contributed to a reduction in our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by approximately 5 million to 217 million shares. we also announced today that the board has authorized a further $5 billion for share repurchases.
and in december, we plan to retire a $350 million bond when it comes due. recall that we effectively refinanced this bond last october at historically low rates when we issued our first sustainability bond. and related to that new sustainability bond, we published our first sustainability bond impact report about a month ago, which updates our progress. you can find the report on our investor relations website.
now let me finish with guidance. andrew gave you a readout on the business and our markets at the beginning of the call. our renewal business continues to be a highlight, reflecting the ongoing importance of our software in helping our customers achieve their goals. new business growth continues to be relatively stronger in north america with growth in emea and apac outside of russia and china, slightly decelerating, but overall growth remains good.
and we've seen less demand for multiyear upfront and more demand for annual contracts than we expected. as we look ahead and as we've done in the past, our q4 and fiscal '23 guidance assumes that market conditions remain consistent with what we saw as we exited q3. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar during the quarter generated slight incremental fx headwinds, reducing full year billings and revenue by approximately $10 million and $5 million, respectively, for the remainder of fiscal '23.
bringing these factors together, the overall headline is that our fiscal '23 revenue, margin, and earnings per share guidance remained close to the previous midpoint at constant exchange rates and comfortably within our previous guidance ranges. our lower fiscal '23 billings and free cash flow guidance primarily reflects less demand for multiyear upfront and more demand for annual contracts than we expected. we're narrowing the fiscal '23 revenue range to be between $4.99 billion and $5.005 billion. we continue to expect non-gaap operating margin to be approximately 36%.
and we expect free cash flow to be between $1.9 billion and $1.98 billion. the slide deck and updated excel financials on our website have more details on modeling assumptions for the full year of fiscal '23. the challenges our customers face continue to evolve that reinforce the need for digital transformation, which gives us confidence in our long-term growth potential. we continue to target double-digit revenue growth, non-gaap operating margins in the 38% to 40% range, and double-digit free cash flow growth on a compound annual basis.
these metrics are intended to provide a floor to our long-term revenue growth ambitions and a ceiling to our spend growth expectations. andrew, back to you.
andrew anagnost -- chief executive officer
thank you, debbie. our strategy is to transform the industries we serve with end-to-end cloud-based solutions that drive efficiency and sustainability for our customers. fusion, forma, and flow connect data, teams, and workflows in the cloud on our trusted platform, making autodesk rapidly scalable and extensible into adjacent verticals from architectural and engineering to construction and operations, from product engineering to product data management and product manufacturing. our platform is also scalable and extensible between verticals with industrialized construction and into new workflows like xr.
by accelerating the convergence of workflows within and between the industries we serve, we are also creating broader and deeper partnerships with existing customers and bringing new customers into our ecosystem. in aec, our customers continue to digitally transform their workflows to win new business and become more efficient and sustainable. for example, to support the city of chongqing smart city ambitions, the chongqing architectural design institute, which operates across architecture, municipal engineering, and city planning, is standardizing on aec collections and developing features to revit apis, which automate modeling, drawings, and specification inspection. these will leverage the design institute's expertise in bim and enable faster and higher quality design, reduce error, and waste during construction and build the digital twins for post-construction operation and maintenance.
in a challenging market environment, the design institute has been able to win new business and capture new market through digital transformation. in construction, we are seeking to eliminate waste at the source rather than simply automating the process around it. by seamlessly connecting construction data and workflows both upstream with preconstruction and design and downstream to hand over, operations and maintenance bases to our digital twin, we are enabling a more connected and sustainable way of building. for example, after a leading mechanical contractor in the united states purchased a competitor's construction management product a few years ago, communication and workflows between the design and field teams were disconnected, resulting in data fragmentation, less insight, more complicated reporting, and ultimately low adoption of the process.
to resolve these issues, it chose to consolidate all of its design to build workload on the integrated autodesk platform, turning to autodesk build to streamline handoffs between detailing, the fab shop, and the field. our momentum in construction continues to grow. across construction, we added almost 1,000 new logos with autodesk build's monthly active users growing more than 60% quarter over quarter and becoming autodesk's largest construction product. in infrastructure, we see greater appetite from owners to accelerate their digital transformation to connect workflows from design to make on the autodesk platform.
for example, to transform the speed, efficiency, and sustainability of its network, one of the leading electricity network operators in europe is accelerating its transformation from 2d to bim and digital twins. in the third quarter, it signed its first eba with autodesk, adding revit and docs to enable it to upgrade the capacity of its substations and incorporate renewable power generation rapidly and safely. to accelerate maintenance workflows and reduce costs, the customer is in-sourcing the production of maintenance parts and using fusion 360 as a platform for 3d printing. turning to manufacturing.
we've sustained good momentum in our manufacturing portfolio this quarter as we connected more workflows from design through to the shop floor, developed more on-ramps to our manufacturing platform, and delivered new powerful tools and functionality to fusion 360 extension. we continue to drive efficiency and sustainability for our customers and provide further resilience and competitiveness in uncertain times. for example, de nora is an italian multinational company specializing in electrochemistry and is a leader in sustainable technologies in the industrial green hydrogen production chain. it has been a longtime user of autocad and revit.
over the last few years, it accelerated its cloud strategy by replacing a competitor's on-premise plm solution with an integrated vault and fusion 360-managed solutions and improve the security of its data, enables seamless collaboration between product design and manufacturing and more easily onboard and integrate acquisitions. in q3, it took another step in its digital transformation by firstly transitioning to named users and adding premium for better usage reporting, insights, and single sign-on security. and secondly, by adding flex to optimize consumption for its occasional users. heineken is on a mission to become the best-connected brewer as part of its evergreen strategy and is undergoing a digital transformation to ensure is prepared for the unforeseen challenges in an ever-changing world.
to help, autodesk has been supporting heineken's 3d printing initiative with an expanded adoption of fusion 360 across a number of breweries. by designing and manufacturing their own equipment parts in-house, heineken has been able to see a reduction in the replacement times of a number of parts from over six weeks to just four hours, significantly reducing downtime and lessening the carbon impact of shipping new parts when necessary. scanship as, a vow group company is a great example of how our customers are using our fusion platform to generate sustainable outcomes efficiently and transparently for customers. it has developed technology that processes waste and purified wastewater providing valuable, sustainable, and circular resources and clean energy to a wide range of customers.
by consolidating on fusion 360 managed with upchain, scanship as will be able to connect data and workflows in the cloud to manage processes and collaborate more easily and efficiently, while also gaining greater transparency on its supply chain to deliver decarbonized products to its customers. fusion 360's commercial subscribers grew steadily, ending the quarter with 211,000 subscribers, with demand for extensions continuing to grow at an exceptional pace. outside of commercial use, a rapidly growing ecosystem of students and hobbyists learning next-generation technology and workflows will take those skills with them into the workforce. we'd like to congratulate students from over 57 countries who recently competed in the finals of the worldskills competition, aptly referred to as the olympics for vocational skills.
students used the latest workflows and technologies from fusion 360 and autodesk construction cloud to compete in vocational disciplines such as mechanical engineering, additive manufacturing, and digital construction. sit shun le from singapore, who won the gold medal for additive manufacturing, used fusion 360 to find the optimum structure and then minimize the amount of materials used through additive manufacturing. all participants were able to hone their skills using next-generation technology. i'm inspired by their ingenuity and optimistic about the innovation they will bring to the workforce of the future.
and finally, we continue to work with customers to provide access to the most current and secure software through our license compliance initiatives. for example, we worked collaboratively with a large multinational manufacturing company seeking to adhere to the same software standards and ensure access to the latest and safest software for all its employees across the globe. we helped customers conduct a self-audit that identifies gaps in its operations in china and then crafted and optimized a bespoke subscription plan. as a result, we agreed to approximately 5 million contracts in q3, our largest-ever license compliance agreement.
during the quarter, we closed eight deals of $500,000 and four deals over $1 million. to close, subscription renewal rates and net revenue retention continue to compound. new business growth remains good, and our competitive performance remains strong. the business is performing as we'd expect given secular growth tailwinds and macroeconomic geopolitical policy and covid-19 headwind.
our capital allocation will remain disciplined and focused through the cycle with organic investment and acquisitions accelerating our growth potential and competitive intensity and share buyback offsetting dilution. the breadth and depth of the market opportunity ahead of us is substantial, and our platform investments will expand that opportunity and realization of it. operator, we would now like to open the call for questions.
