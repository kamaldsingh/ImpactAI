thank you, sir. [operator instructions]. your first question comes from the line of andrew steinerman from jpmorgan. please go ahead.
andrew steinerman -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, keith. it's a big picture question about small businesses, and surely, i follow nfib just like you've suggested the -- these favorable trends reported there. kind of going through this recession, i was worried about robert half's dependence on small and medium-sized businesses. and maybe it's about the types of small and medium-sized businesses that you serve, i assume you're not serving a lot of restaurants. my question is do you agree with the trends that nfib are suggesting that they've really kind of made it through this recession favorably? do you think it's really dependent on more stimulus for them and how are your small and medium-sized business customers feeling?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
so we would definitely agree that the trends are improving. but as you started, it's also true that smb clients are more nimble than mid and large-cap companies. they've cut more and they've added back more conservatively. that's very apparent in our own numbers. we've talked in the past that about 80% of our business is smb, which we define by the way, 50 to 100 employees on average, and 20% is mid-cap, mid to large, mostly mid. that has actually changed during the post-pandemic period such that the mid-cap number is almost 30%. clearly, our mid-cap and larger clients have been more resilient than have been our smb clients, but we are encouraged.
if you look at our weekly trends beginning in early june, they've consistently improved. in fact, we've seen accelerating monthly sequential growth during the quarter. we expect that to carry over into q4 with one big caveat. it's been widely reported that most companies' employees have not taken their paid time off so far this year. that's true at robert half. that's true at many of our client companies. we, therefore, think december will be more holiday-impacted, holiday/paid time off-impacted. we'll have less plant capacity as our employees take that time off. our clients will have less plant capacity to close deals. so we're expecting a bigger than normal december impact. but that said, adjusted for that, we do feel good about the progression of our smb clients, which is now 70% of the total. and history shows that once they do get comfortable, which we would define as probably closer to the post-pandemic period, that we'll participate in an outsized way going forward. and yes, we do think the stimulus would be helpful. and hopefully that gets resolved pre- or post-election.
andrew steinerman -- jpmorgan -- analyst
perfect. and just to make sure i got the point right, the december holiday effect, that is already included in the midpoint of your fourth quarter guide, right?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
that's correct.
andrew steinerman -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of mark marcon from robert w. baird & company. please go ahead.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
good afternoon, keith, and mike. i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the differences that you're seeing with regards to the needs for finance and accounting professionals between what you're seeing on the accountemps side versus protiviti. we've had some discussions with some investors who are concerned that maybe accounting isn't going to come back as strongly. obviously, on the protiviti side, you're clearly doing very, very well there. but i'm wondering if you could compare and contrast and how should we -- how we should think about it as we start coming out of this downturn when we eventually do have a vaccine?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
and so at a high level, finance & accounting particularly at the accountemps level has staff accounting positions that are very transactional or volume driven. and as our clients' volume levels and transaction levels are down, so is that business. that's no different than every downturn we've been through. and as you know, i've been here over 30 years. so we fully expect as transaction volumes to improve. accountemps will participate nicely there. i'll also say that what transaction volume there is, generally speaking, those type of positions are less conducive to remote work than the project-driven positions, which also impacts accountemps negatively relative to protiviti and/or management resources.
protiviti has been doing great. as we've talked about, it has multiple service offerings due to its diversification efforts. for the first time ever, technology consulting within protiviti is the largest practice area, which i think is incredible. so they've done well in their technology consulting. they've done well with risk and compliance, particularly in financial services. we've talked about anti-money laundering. we've talked about credit risk enforcement actions that they're involved with certain of their clients. and then while internal audit at protiviti is somewhat impacted, it's not as impacted as the transaction-driven accountemps-type positions. so we're very optimistic about how accountemps will participate when things get more back to normal from a covid standpoint.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
that's terrific. and can you talk a little bit about your stance with regards to how much excess capacity you have currently and how you're thinking about potential additions or subtractions with regards to internal personnel? there is some chatter going on with regards to what your internal hiring profile is like. and so i'm wondering if you could clarify that.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. and so, first of all, i'd say, if you compared the first quarter, so let's call that pre-pandemic, with the third quarter, our revenues are down 21% and our income is down 21%. it's a quite frankly -- i think it's pretty incredible that given the type of impacts covid had that we effectively got through that with no net negative leverage, principally because we aggressively cut our cost. we're cautiously optimistic that when we get that 20% revenue back that we'll do better and we'll actually leverage in a positive way. our current workforce is more tenured, because our less tenured workforce is the piece of the workforce that we had to part ways with. we are very focused on the productivity levels of our internal staff. we have better data to measure that. we have very consistent buy-in internally across the organization. frankly, our people internally make more money, as we let their productivities rise versus adding more people such that you got you're spreading your revenues over more people. they're more profitable if you spread it over fewer. so we have very good internal alignment that we're going to let our productivity levels drive up, which will be good for their individual profitability and will be good for our corporate profitability. but we're optimistic we're going to do better of the next new percent up than we did on the 20% down. having said that, again, we are super pleased that 20% down at the top line no more than 20% down at the bottom line.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
that was impressive. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of jeff silber from bmo capital markets. please go ahead.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thanks so much. just a follow-up on that answer to mark's last question. are you starting to ramp up internal hiring on a net basis? and if not, what do you need to see to start doing that?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, because we're talking staffing now.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yes.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
because we think we have a lot of unused capacity with this -- the more tenured staff that we currently have, we don't think we need to do much hiring in the short term. we've got to replace turnover. and by and large, we've done that largely with furloughs, but that's pretty much all behind us now. so if you're looking at our job postings online as some indication as to our level of confidence in the future, i would say don't, because we're happy with the staffing levels we have and we're happy that there is inherent upside in their productivity levels, particularly tenure-adjusted, which is the best it's ever been.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
all right. that's helpful. i appreciate that. and this question, the second question might be for mike. regarding the change in the sg&a presentation, i'm just curious why now? is it because of the volatility that you might have seen in these trust assets? and if you can give us some color on that, i'd appreciate it. thanks.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
and so let me talk at 50,000 feet and then mike can be more practical. so, first of all, understand we've had these plans for over 10 years. understand, we've got over 2,300 participants. as we said earlier, as mike said earlier, it doesn't impact earnings, doesn't impact cash flow. we've disclosed these numbers on our footnotes. we've got no net cost. there is no net economic costs from doing this. and the simple answer for why now is because the sec believes it's more appropriate that we take the -- take one side of the equation out of sg&a and make it its own line item. but simply putting those two line items together, you have the same sg&a that you typically had or it used to have. i mean, one over-simplified way of thinking about is, is that we have to mark-to-market every quarter our obligation to employees under these plans. and we also have to mark-to-market the underlying assets and the mark-to-market adjustment for both of those is exactly the same thing in opposite amounts -- in opposite directions the same amount. so economically, it's 0 and we've had this forever, 10-plus years. and the short answer again, the sec has asked us going forward to take what we had put in our footnotes, and instead, put it on the face of the income statement. and i was [speech overlap]
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
so just i understand -- i'm sorry, go ahead.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
it has been disclosed in the footnotes. and so it's really just the geography movement.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
got it. and so the presentation that we see in this quarter's press release is the same presentation we're going to be seeing going forward, is that correct or is there something different?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's just what you're seeing, and we'll do our best to help you get back to -- do our best to help you not have to change your model, because if you look on the face of the income statement that's attached to the press release, there is two rows right next to each other, and if you put those two together, you will have exactly the same sg&a you would have gotten historically. we can't tell you to do that, but we could suggest if you did that, that the combination of two rows would be exactly the same as the sg&a you've had traditionally in your model.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. i appreciate the suggestion. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of manav patnaik from barclays. please go ahead.
manav patnaik -- barclays capital -- analyst
yeah. hi. good evening. keith, my first question was just, you talked about the work from home, virtual world, your talents and go beyond, i guess, where they're geographically located. and i agree with that high level and i would think that the flexibility with the larger firms probably benefits from that, but i was just curious with your smb clients, are you seeing that? like is the smaller 50 to 100 person shop willing to hire someone across the country?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, and so there's -- suddenly, there is two different questions here. one is remote versus on-site and the remote could be in the same geography. it's not just in the office. and then there is remote as in a different geography altogether. and i'd say, clearly smb has shown that they're willing to have not on-premise, but largely in the same local geography or as bigger businesses not only are amenable to that. they're also amenable to particularly for project work going outside the local market. but we've been very pleased that depending on line of business that you're talking, sometimes 70%, 80% of the people we have on assignment are not working in the client's premises. they're working remotely, either in the same geography or in a distant geography.
manav patnaik -- barclays capital -- analyst
got it. and maybe just on protiviti, can you give us a flavor of kind of where the engagements are the strongest, like in which areas are you seeing the growth and maybe which areas are either idle or declining right now?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, the area where they are the strongest and frankly, the area that we're probably really proud is the joint success protiviti and staffing are having in the public sector. we've got joint pursuit teams selling the work. by and large, the resources get provided by staffing, but protiviti manages them. if you think about it, process management, process optimization is right in protiviti's wheelhouse. in fact, it's the wheelhouse of their wheelhouse. if you look at states, they're overwhelmed with volumes on unemployment claims, eligibility for unemployment payments processing. they're dealing with housing assistance claims. their call-in volumes are off the charts. and additionally, you've got school districts that can't keep up with the technical support requirements of all the virtual learning models. so the public sector has made a meaningful difference to both staffing and protiviti this quarter.
you will notice in schedules attached to the press release for the first time ever, we've actually shown you how much revenue is billed by staffing to protiviti. we've shown you the growth rates. and we're pleased to report that for this quarter, staffing revenues from protiviti grew by 28% year-on-year and public sector activities were a big piece of that. that said, that's not the total picture. the strongest part of activity at the moment is technology consulting, it's cyber, it's cloud, it's transformation, but also risk and compliance, anti-money laundering, the retail operational risk, all those are strong as well. so protiviti very well, very good. the internal audit has been a little impacted. more discretion in client budgets. there is some fee pressure there. it's down 8% or 10% while everything up is up even more than that to get to where you see it overall.
and as i said last quarter, remember protiviti's fees are actually up more than their revenues, because they've got less reimbursable expenses because they're not traveling. and if you looked at a fee level versus a revenue level, you can add another 4 percentage points to that. so protiviti doing very well and protiviti together with staffing doing very well as well. and we actually show you that both in numbers and in growth rate percentages in the schedules that we attached to the press release.
manav patnaik -- barclays capital -- analyst
got it. thanks, keith.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of hamzah mazari from jefferies. please go ahead.
mario cortellacci -- jefferies llc -- analyst
hi. this is mario cortellacci filling in for hamzah. could you just give us a quick update on what the bill-pay spread was in the quarter? and maybe you can even give us a sense how that trended throughout the quarter and into the first few weeks of october.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, so, adjusted for mix to get apples and apples, the bill rates were up 3%. and that's versus 5% a quarter ago and 6% the quarter before that. so not surprisingly, given the overall environment, there is some pressure on our bill rates, but we're still increasing them. and as you know, this all starts with the pay rates we have to attract the right talent to a given client's assignment.
mario cortellacci -- jefferies llc -- analyst
great, thanks. and then on, i guess, historically perm has improved faster than temps. and i guess you're starting to see that now already, but i'm just curious to know, i mean, because of how extreme and unique the situation is, do you see anything different about this cycle that it could cause maybe the temps portion of that rebound to lag a little more? i know that we've had obviously an early v-shaped recovery. but since june, if you like, the economy has had a slower pace of improvement. so i didn't know if given the dynamic you're seeing with smbs and your mid-cap customers, and then also, this, like i said, this v-shape followed by slower pace could maybe drag out the temp portion of the rebound longer than it normally would in a regular recession.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
and the short answer would be we don't think so. it's true perm has recovered well off the trough. not unusual. many of our clients cut too deep and as they need staff, they come to us. they're upgrading staff, including out-of-market remote resources that they haven't done before. but also remember, they're coming off a lower trough. that is the case for temp. all of which is normal. so i would say based on everything we've seen so far, the relationship of temp versus perm, there is very little surprises us. officeteam actually rebounded nicely off their trough, because they're actually participating disproportionally in this public sector work that i talked about earlier and call centers are a big part of the demand from the states, from the reasons that i talked about.
mario cortellacci -- jefferies llc -- analyst
great. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of kevin mcveigh from credit suisse. please go ahead.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great, thanks. hey, keith, you talked about furloughs a little bit, but any sense of how that dynamic has been playing out in this recovery, whether it's internal robert half or just as your clients are maneuvering through the furlough process as opposed to perm? because it seems like the perm is coming a little bit stronger than what you would have expected, given how aggressive firms are with furloughs this cycle?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, a, i think furloughs have largely played their way out in a major way, given we're several months from when those people were furloughed. and i'd also say if you look to peak to trough, perm fell a little less than it would traditionally. so there is no evidence that furloughs impacted that. and further from the trough, perm is coming back nicely as you observed. and so as we talked about extensively on the last call, i don't think furloughs are having any meaningful negative effect on the demand for our services.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. and then just to follow up on the wage, keith, is any of that -- is it just the environment we're in or is any of that maybe just to sourcing the candidates from a wider spread geographically than you would historically see? i guess, said another way, if you're going to maybe more cost-efficient regions, is that pressed in the wage rate at all?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
i would say, generally speaking, we started this disruption period with tighter unemployment than ever. and so you started from a very strong place. and further, because it's event-driven, i think, by and large, clients see the end of the tunnel more clearly than they typically would. and the fact that it happened more quickly than in prior downturns where there's like water tortured over 18 months, this happened over a few. i think all of those are relevant to this business about what happens to pay rates and what happens to bill rates. but the pay rates are not up as much as they were, but they're still up. bill rates are not up as much as they were, but they're still up. while it might be impacted a little bit by the remote work phenomenon, by and large, i don't think that's the driver.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
very helpful. thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of gary bisbee from bank of america. please go ahead.
gary bisbee -- bank of america -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thanks. so i just wanted to ask within the temp staffing business, when we look at the sub-segments, the technology and management resources obviously the growth rate curating from last quarter, is that just sort of the lag typically we see with professional, maybe longer engagements took a while to roll off? or is there anything else you'd point to? and is it fair to say that those two businesses have also seen the trend of week-to-week revenue improvement that you discussed earlier?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
and so as you observe, the facts are that assignment links are longer in management resources and tech and so they had in-flight assignments that they rode longer than our other divisions it hit. meaning, they were impacted later. happy to report that once they got to that period, they have begun to improve week to week, although it was a bit later than early june. they have had several weeks of consistent growth as well. the other thing that i talked about earlier was that because they're focused more on project work and transactional work, project work is more remote-friendly than transactional work. so that if you look cumulatively at kind of peak to trough during pandemic of our accountemps office team, and you compare that to management resources tech, there is less impact to management resources tech than there is to the former, because of the project and it seems to be more resilient than the transactional or partly because it's more remote-friendly.
gary bisbee -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. that makes sense. and then within the cost reductions that you've delivered, particularly at the sg&a level, it's interesting to me that protiviti, which is doing -- holding up better and continuing to grow, has seen pretty similar, in fact, it looks like more larger percentage than a temp reduction in sg&a. was there anything in particular to the quarter and i guess, how should we think about that trending? i know you commented on next quarter a bit, but trending over the next few quarters or anything you'd point out there. thank you.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, first of all, remember that protiviti's principal payroll cost are in direct costs, not in sg&a. but for those costs that are in sg&a, i think they've certainly been -- because there is less travel overall, including non-billable travel, that's a factor. they've reduced their marketing cost just because of the impacts primarily to their internal audit practice during the year. having said that, if you notice for the fourth quarter, we are calling for their sg&a costs to increase and that's driven by the same reasons. they're going to turn the marketing spigot back on, and they've got some training cost attached to all the people that they've added. but protiviti's profitability for 2020, calendar 2020 will be the largest it's been in many, many years, which in and of itself is also incredible. so they're growing the fastest and are the most profitable of any of our lines of business, which is a really good place to be.
gary bisbee -- bank of america -- analyst
yeah, for sure. thanks.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of tobey sommer from truist securities. please go ahead.
jasper bibb -- truist securities -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. this is jasper bibb filling in for tobey. i was hoping you could speak to what you've been hearing from customers kind of regarding reshoring or onshoring of outsourced labor and what that might mean for your business? thanks.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
we hear a little bit of it, primarily on the protiviti side. i wouldn't say it's a major theme or trend, but clearly some companies aren't happy to have a heavily reliance on their supply chain offshore and their bringing some of that back. and so again, we have a few engagements. but it's not moving the needle.
jasper bibb -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks. and then as volume is kind of coming back here, i was hoping you could speak to what you're hearing from clients on kind of the split between flexible and perm labor needs and whether that dynamic might vary from what you've seen in kind of the early stages of prior cycles.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, which is always the case, and in prior cycles, most of our very nimble smb clients get really lean during the downturn. and at the first hint of optimism and more transaction volume, they need help. and frankly, if you look for the last couple of downturns and recoveries thereafter, temp and perm have recovered pretty much together, because perm has a deeper trough. it typically has higher growth rates coming out of that trough. but by and large, just economic incentives to keep your costs variable are just as true at the beginning of a recovery as they are any other time. on the other hand, to the extent they over-cut or got extra lean and want to take advantage of one of the best labor markets they're going to see, because it's early in a recovery. many of them choose to tap into that market and upgrade their talent. so frankly, we don't see anything different in impact of downturn, early stages of recovery, that different than in the past other than it was condensed into a much smaller time frame.
jasper bibb -- truist securities -- analyst
i appreciate it. thanks for taking the questions, keith.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of george tong from goldman sachs. please go ahead.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, thanks. good afternoon. temp staffing gross margins contracted 40 bps year-over-year due to lower conversion revenues for the most part. can you talk about how you expect the recent slowdown in temp wage growth that impact temp bill pay spreads?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, first of all, i'm glad you mentioned temp gross margins, because frankly it's one of the things we're most proud of and how we've managed during the pandemic period. typically, peak to trough during a downturn, we'd be down 300 basis points in our temp gross margins. and as we stand here out now, we are significantly less than that. meaning, we've done significantly better. as to slowing temp wage growth, that's not going to have much impact on our spread, because we're going to take to the extent there are lower temp wages in an absolute way. we're going to take that amount and apply the same margin to it that we would otherwise. so compression with wage growth doesn't mean compression in margin.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then i wanted to dive in into your assumptions around your 4q guide. can you elaborate on what you're assuming with covid infection rate and lockdowns in your outlook?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, the assumption is that just like has been the case in the last few months, there are going to be ebbs and flows. there are going to be hotspots. there is going to be partial lockdowns, partial restrictions. it's just all part of the calculus and that that's a reason why we only have modest sequential growth in the midpoint of our guide. so it doesn't assume a major country complete shutdown and does assume that there will continue to be ebbs and flows. got it. very helpful. thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of mark marcon from baird. please go ahead.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
i just had one quick follow-up. keith and mike, you've talked about the public sector and i was wondering if you could talk about to what extent your -- that has plateaued or if you're seeing continued growth and how long do you think those projects are going to go on for? it certainly seems like if -- given how far behind the public sector is that it would continue for a while, but love to hear your perspective.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, clearly some of the current demand is bulge demand, because of unemployment rates, because of need for housing assistance. there is no question that there is a bulge component to it. but we believe we're building relationships for the first time ever that are going to have lags as we go forward. and as i said earlier, protiviti loves to show up when process optimization is the objective. and for many of these state and local governments, their processes could use some optimization. and we believe that lives past this bulge period. but the bulge period certainly is nice to have as we bridge ourselves to the other side of covid.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
would you use initial unemployment claims as kind of a proxy for that bulge period and this tracking that? or how are you thinking about how long the bulge period lasts?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, if our penetration rates among the states, we're only dealing with a handful of states. and so, if we were dealing with every single state and this surge related primarily to their surge, i would say, yes. but the fact that we're continuing to go to new states and referencing the states where we already are, that itself as a source of growth such that we're growing share, if you will, in addition to just the surge on unemployment and housing assistance claims.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst

",0.975,0.9998,2020-10-22 17:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
hello, and welcome to the robert half third quarter 2020 conference call. our hosts for today's call are mr. keith waddell, president and chief executive officer of robert half, and mr. michael buckley, chief financial officer. mr. waddell, you may begin.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
hello, everyone. we appreciate your time today. before we get started, i'd like to remind you that the comments made on today's call contain forward-looking statements, including predictions and estimates about our future performance. these statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds. however, they are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements. these risks and uncertainties are described in today's press release and our most recent 10-k and 10-q filed with the sec. we assume no obligation to update the statements made on today's call.
during this presentation, we may mention some non-gaap financial measures and reference these figures as 'as adjusted.' reconciliations and further explanations of these measures are included in a supplemental schedule to our earnings press release. in addition, we have modified our presentation of revenues and the related growth rates for accountemps, officeteam, robert half technology and robert half management resources to include their intersegment revenues from services provided to protiviti in connection with the company's blended staffing and consulting solutions. this is how we measure and manage these divisions internally and from now on, it's how we will report them externally. the combined amount of divisional intersegment revenues with protiviti is also separately disclosed. for your convenience, our prepared remarks for today's call are available in the investor center of our website at roberthalf.com.
we are very pleased that third quarter and early october results reflect consistent weekly and monthly sequential gains across our divisions. protiviti had another outstanding quarter reporting its 12th consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue gains, leveraging a strong pipeline of diversified service offerings, including particularly robust growth with the blended solutions with our staffing operations. we're also pleased with the quarter-on-quarter growth in our staffing divisions, led by our permanent placement and officeteam divisions.
2020 continues to be an unprecedented year. i'm extremely proud of the resourcefulness and commitment exhibited by all of our employees as we maintain high levels of service to our clients and candidates.
companywide revenues were $1.19 billion in the third quarter of 2020, down 23% from last year's third quarter on a reported basis and down 24% on an as-adjusted basis. net income per share in the third quarter was $0.67 compared to $1.01 in the third quarter a year ago.
cash flow from operations during the quarter was $139 million and capital expenditures were $7 million. in september, we distributed a $0.34 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record, for a total cash outlay of $38 million. we also acquired approximately 450,000 shares during the quarter for $24 million. we have 1 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan. return on invested capital for the company was 25.8% in the third quarter.
now, i'll turn the call over to our cfo, mike buckley.
michael c. buckley -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, keith, and hello, everyone. let's start with revenues. as keith noted, global revenues were $1.190 billion in the third quarter. this is a decrease of 23% from the third quarter one year ago on a reported basis and a decrease of 24% on an as-adjusted basis.
also on an as-adjusted basis, third quarter staffing revenues were down 31% year-over-year. u.s. staffing revenues were $666 million, down 32% from the prior year. non-u.s. staffing revenues were $203 million, down 29% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. we have 326 staffing locations worldwide, including 88 locations in 17 countries outside the united states.
in the third quarter, there were 64.3 billing days compared to 64.1 billing days in the third quarter one year ago. the current fourth quarter has 61.7 billing days equivalent to the fourth quarter of one year ago.
currency exchange rate movements during the third quarter had the effect of increasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $4 million. this increased our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 0.3 percentage points.
now, let's take a closer look at the results for protiviti. global revenues in the third quarter were $321 million. $260 million of that is from business within the united states, and $61 million is from operations outside the united states. on an as-adjusted basis, global third quarter protiviti revenues were up 6% versus the year-ago period, with u.s. protiviti revenues up 10%. non-u.s. revenues were down 8% on an as-adjusted basis.
exchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year protiviti revenues by $2 million and increasing its year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.7 percentage points. protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 28 countries.
during the quarter, we changed our presentation of sales and general -- of sg&a expenses to exclude gains and losses on investments held to fund our obligations under employee deferred compensation plans. under these plans, employees direct the investments of their account balances, and the company makes cash deposits into an investment trust consistent with these directions. as realized and unrealized investment gains and losses occur, the company's deferred compensation obligation to employees changes accordingly. however, the value of the related investment trust assets also changes by an equal and offsetting amount, leaving no net cost to the company.
going forward, changes in the company's deferred compensation obligations noted above will continue to be included in sg&a or, in the case of protiviti, direct cost. however, the offsetting changes in the investment trust assets will be presented separately, below sg&a and outside of operating income. this does not change the reported level of pre-tax or after-tax income or cash flows provided -- previously provided. going forward, we will replace the discussion of consolidated operating income with the non-gaap measure of combined segment income. this will be calculated as consolidated income before income taxes adjusted for interest income and amortization of intangible assets.
turning now to gross margin. in our temporary and consultant staffing operations, third quarter gross margin was 37.5% of applicable revenues compared to 37.9% of applicable revenues in the third quarter one year ago. the year-over-year decline in gross margin percentage is primarily due to lower conversion revenues.
our permanent placement revenues in the third quarter were 10% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 10.7% of consolidated staffing revenues in the same quarter one year ago. when combined with temporary and consultant gross margin, overall staffing gross margin decreased 80 basis points compared to the year-ago third period to 43.8%.
for protiviti, gross margin was $87 million in the third quarter or 27.1% of protiviti revenues. this includes $3.4 million or 1.1% of protiviti revenues of deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment accounts. one year ago, gross margin for protiviti was $88 million or 29.4% of protiviti revenues, including $200,000 of deferred compensation expense related to investment trust activities.
companywide sg&a costs were 32.8% of global revenues in the third quarter compared to 31.2% in the same quarter one year ago. deferred compensation expenses related to increases in underlying trust investments had the impact of increasing sg&a as a percentage of revenue by 1.9% in the current third quarter and 0.1% in the same quarter one year ago.
staffing sg&a costs were 40.2% of staffing revenues in the third quarter versus 34.8% in third quarter of 2019. included in staffing sg&a costs was deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets of 2.6% and 0.1% respectively. the increase in staffing sg&a as a percentage of revenues is primarily the result of continued negative leverage resulting from the decline in revenues. third quarter sg&a costs for protiviti were 13% of protiviti revenues compared to 16.2% of revenues in the year-ago period.
operating income for the quarter was $77 million. this includes $26 million of deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying investment trust assets. combined segment income was therefore $103 million in the third quarter. combined segment margin was 8.6%. third quarter segment income from our staffing divisions was $54 million, with a segment margin of 6.2%. segment income for protiviti in the third quarter was $49 million with a segment margin of 15.2%.
our third quarter tax rate was 26% compared to 28% a year ago. the lower third quarter tax rate is primarily due to annual adjustments made to reconcile our tax accounts to prior year's tax returns as actually filed. our nine-month year-over-year tax rate of 28% is in line with what we expect for the full year.
moving on to accounts receivable, at the end of the third quarter, accounts receivable were $690 million and implied days sales outstanding or dso was 52.3 days.
before we move to fourth quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the third quarter and so far in october, all adjusted for currency and billing days. our temporary and consultant staffing divisions exited the third quarter with september revenues down 29.3% versus the prior year compared to a 30.7% decrease for the full quarter. revenues in the first two weeks of october were down 27% compared to the same period one year ago.
permanent placement revenues in september were down 30.1% versus september of 2019. this compares to a 35.7% decrease for the full quarter. for the first three weeks in october, permanent placement revenues were down 31% compared to the same period in 2019. we provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we saw during the third quarter and into october. but, as you know, these are very brief time periods. we caution against reading too much into them.
with that in mind, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance. revenues of $1.155 billion to $1.255 billion; income per share $0.55 to $0.75. the midpoint of our guidance implies a year-over-year revenue decline of 22% on an as-adjusted basis inclusive of protiviti. the major financial assumptions underlying the midpoint of these estimates are as follows. revenue growth on a year on year basis, staffing down 27% to 30%; protiviti up 5% to 7%; overall down 21% to 23%.
on the gross margin percentages, temporary and consultant staffing 37% to 38%; protiviti 27% to 29%; overall 39% to 40%.
sg&a as percentage of revenues, excluding deferred compensation investment impacts, staffing 36% to 38%; protiviti 14% to 16%; overall 30% to 32%. segment income, staffing 6% to 8%; protiviti 12% to 15%; overall 8% to 10%. we expect our tax rate to be between 27% and 29% and shares to be 113 million. we limit our guidance to one quarter. all estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in the sec filings.
now, i'll turn the call back over to keith.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
so thank you, mike. as is evidenced in the growth of our newly reported inter-segment revenues. the partnership between protiviti and our staffing operations continues to be an accelerating source of growth for our enterprise. we have also seen particular strength in our services to the public sector and financial services clients. in addition, we've experienced increased demand for services and solutions in cloud technology, online security, data privacy and digital transformation as enterprise client companies have continued to strategically invest in these areas.
the significant reductions we made to our cost structure in the second quarter have also benefited the third quarter and will continue to benefit future quarters. remote and hybrid working models will continue long after the pandemic ceases to require them. access to talent is no longer limited to time zones or geographies. with our global network of talent and world-class technology tools, we can provide the right match for clients and candidates regardless of location. while uncertainty remains in the overall economic environment as the pandemic continues, there is much to be optimistic about. as the fourth quarter progresses, the nature, timing and amount of any additional fiscal stimulus should be known. medical solutions to the covid-19 virus move ever closer to reality, and the nfib continues to report improving trends in the small business community. a recent study showed that more than half of small businesses are hiring or trying to hire, with the vast majority reporting few or no qualified applicants. we continue to believe in our positioning for future growth with the unique strengths of our brands, people, technology and professional business model.
now, mike and i'd be happy to answer your questions. please ask just one question and a single follow-up, as needed. if there's time, we'll come back to you.

[operator instructions]. our first question comes from the line of mark marcon with baird. your line is open.
mark s. marcon -- robert w. baird & co. inc. -- analyst
good afternoon and congratulations. wondering, can you talk about the opportunities that you're seeing across protiviti. obviously you're accelerating. it seems like there would be a lot of opportunities in a lot of different areas within it including cyber security audits, particularly in the wake of solarwinds, and you did make the acquisition with regards to identropy. so i was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the areas of growth that you're seeing there? and kind of what inning you think protiviti is gaining and then i've got a follow-up for the staffing side.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
so the good news for protiviti is that its success is broad based. it's led by technology consulting and managed solutions, on the tech side, which we've talked about for a few quarters now; its cloud, its cyber, its privacy, its digital transformation and the managed solutions with staffing, its public sector led by unemployment, housing, education, vaccine. fsi continues to lead with anti-money laundering and consumer lending, regulatory actions leading that way. internal audits down 8% to 10% year-on-year, some more got delayed, some scopes got produced. there is a little bit of fee pressure. as we've talked about now for a few quarters, protiviti's pipeline remains very strong as to which inning we're in. it's clearly not a late-inning because not only do we have macro coming back and discretionary spending is that will benefit particularly internal audit. you've also got a new administration in united states that's viewed to be more regulatory friendly, which is a better thing than not as it relates to protiviti. so we feel great about where they are. we feel great about our prospects and we feel like it's early innings.
mark s. marcon -- robert w. baird & co. inc. -- analyst
that's terrific. and can you talk a little bit about the fit with the most recent acquisition and the opportunities there? i know it's really small and just 40 people, but it seems like it would be a really good fit in terms of -- but any sort of it audits that you're doing.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. and identity access management is clearly an important sub-component of cyber security and we've got a team very expert in a certain platform, a leading platform in that space. so we're happy to have part of the family. we feel like we can leverage our existing database, while we also grow theirs and we feel good about that as well.
mark s. marcon -- robert w. baird & co. inc. -- analyst
terrific. and then can you talk a little bit about the staffing side. as we come out of this, keith and mike, obviously we're just in the early stages of inflecting and nobody knows how long this cycle is going to be. but you're really seeing a nice improvement in terms of productivity. your headcount was down 32% on the staffing side, revenue down a lot less than that. you've put in place a number of different tools to increase productivity. so how should we think about the productivity over the course of the current cycle as we continue to come out of this? and what i'm wondering is, it looks like you picked up you're hiring, but it's not at a super robust pace yet. so just how should we think about that?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, as we've talked for a few quarters now, we've retained our tenured staff. their productivity is always greater than the less experienced staff. we feel like we've got additional capacity with that group. we think we can leverage that capacity as we grow without adding in an outsized way to heads. there is a little bit of an offset in that our incentive plans, our graduated rate plans, hockey stick, if you will. so as these more tenured people get further and further up the hockey stick, some of that leverage will go back to them appropriately, so, but we'll still benefit overall and we expect to have some profitability upside as we continue to grow relative to where we were at same revenue points in the past.
mark s. marcon -- robert w. baird & co. inc. -- analyst
perfect, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from andrew steinerman with jpmorgan. your line is open.
andrew steinerman -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
hi guys. two questions. the first one is, when thinking about that year ago first quarter of 2020, obviously, the month of march was that covid affected quarter. i mean, covid affected months. how did you take into that kind of year-over-year consideration when giving first quarter of '21 staffing and when i say staffing, i mean, both flex and perm revenue guidance. that's my first question.
i am going to give you my second question at the same time. and my second question is, how should we think about the flex staffing revenues sequentially in the first quarter of '21, recalling that our first quarter is a slower, seasonal time for flex staffing.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
so your two questions are related. we effectively took our fourth quarter actual results superimposed a typical sequential progression into the first quarter and that was the basis for our q1 guidance. and the year-on-year, andrew, fell out to whatever it was, because we felt like using where we currently are i.e. fourth quarter as the baseline for our forecast rather than a year ago, which did had the impacts of that march month in it. we felt like q4 was a better baseline and the sequential embedded in our forecast is typical first quarter sequential patterns temp and perm.
andrew steinerman -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
okay. yeah. no, that answers my question. could you just give us a sense of, if you think temp or perm will do better in the first quarter.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
we hope they both do better, and we're just coming off a quarter where they both did a lot better. so we were happy about the momentum that we've had. our people will tell you, it's one of our best restarts to a new year in a long time. so anecdotally i can assure you the enthusiasm level is very high. that said, we thought it prudent to given the big step up we had in q4 to confirm that into q1 with normal patterns, but not be more aggressive than that.
andrew steinerman -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
well, thank you. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jeff silber with bmo capital markets. your line is open.
jeffrey silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thanks so much. appreciate you guys giving the headcount numbers like you typically do at the end of every year. and i wanted to focus on the internal staff and staffing. it was down pretty substantially. but again, your revenues weren't down as bad, so we saw some productivity there. what do you need to see to start hiring internal staff in your staffing division, when you think that will happen.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, as we've said, because we have a more tenured staff and because they have productivity capacity as we speak, we're going to utilize that capacity before we aggressively add more heads. it's good for them, it's good for their compensation, it's good for us. so we don't think, certainly in the next quarter or two, that will have to add to staff in a meaningful way but can still grow nicely as we just showed we could do with the existing staff. our staff cutbacks were primarily in the second quarter. and so the increases we saw in the third quarter were without any additional staff and we think there is room to go with who we already have. so i certainly wouldn't take our lack of hiring either as evidenced by our job postings or otherwise as any indication that we're not bullish and we don't think we can grow. instead, we believe there is significant unused capacity of our current tenured staff.
jeffrey silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. that's really helpful. as a follow-up, you pointed out at the end of your prepared remarks about your services to, you know mid-cap clients now about a third of their revenues. can you talk about that what have you've been doing there differently and what do you think that could be over-time. thanks.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, i'd say, what we've done differently is a few things. one, we focused on it. we've had success with it. two, with protiviti with many of those companies and even larger cap companies, we come through the consulting door rather than the staffing door. and by so doing, it's not margin dilutive that it might otherwise be. so the combination of the focus, the success and the ability to leverage protiviti and its relationships and its contractual relationships, all plays a part. we continue to believe there is upside there, as you know, traditionally we've been principally smb. and trust me, we're not walking away from smb. we're not de-emphasizing smb to the contrary, we feel like it's the perfect time in the cycle to be smb the last couple of quarters they've been more impacted than mid cap and beyond. so we've endured the bad side of that, if you will. so now it's time to endure the good side of smb and we're excited about how well we can leverage our smb client base as we've demonstrated in the past. that said, we do think mid cap is incremental to that. we've done well. we've done it without any net margin dilution and we continue to invest in that.
jeffrey silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. that's really helpful. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from hamzah mazari with jefferies. your line is open.
mario cortellacci -- jefferies llc -- analyst
hi, this is mario cortellacci filling in for hamzah. i appreciate the time. maybe you can just touch on or remind us of your exposure to the travel and leisure industry from a temp staffing perspective and maybe you can talk about outside of that, how do you think the impact of the vaccine will have on your business?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
so we have very little exposure to travel and leisure. clearly, that industry is most impacted by the shutdowns and restarts and shutdowns. and so just looking at numbers, there's really no correlation between geography shutdowns, because we have so little exposure to travel and leisure. and clearly the impact of the vaccine can be nothing, but positive. while on the one hand, our clients have by and large adjusted to the current environment and have become very virtual. on the other hand, i think everybody is excited about the possibility of not being virtual. and on that score, i thought it was interesting. this week we were recognized as a top 20 company in the fortune 500 for embracing remote work. so we thought that was pretty cool.
mario cortellacci -- jefferies llc -- analyst
great, thank you. and then on the gross margin, maybe you can help us understand or maybe give us a sense for how we should think about gross margins going forward. obviously in the quarter, you had some fringe benefits, insurance, things like payroll. but could you give us a sense for some of the puts and takes that you are expecting in 2021.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
okay, let's talk a little bit about gross margin. because, first of all, if you look at prior downturns, peak to trough, we've lost 300 basis points in gross margin. happy to report that this time around, we lost a third of that, a 100 basis points. and i'm even further happy to report that we're now back this most recent quarter, we're now back to peak gross margins in our temp businesses. for 2021, given that we are already back while there might be some upside as we move through the year, we certainly had modeled a lot of upside remembering that we have the highest gross margins in the industry by leaps and bounds as it is. but trust me, i think one of the things we're most proud of is how we've managed our gross margins. a, during the pandemic, the height of the pandemic. how we've gotten them back and how we intend to sustain that in to 2021.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from kevin mcveigh with credit suisse. your line is open.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks so much and congratulations. hey keith, any sense of how the bill rates have been trending in the quarter versus prior quarter and maybe year-on-year. if you could break that out maybe by segment.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, we said in our prepared remarks that they were up 2% year-on-year adjusted for mix. that was down a little bit from the prior quarter. it all starts with pay rates and with higher unemployment, we aren't paying quite as much, still more than we were a year ago. but the rate of wage inflation has subsided to some degree. but all things considered to still have a little bit of low single digit, wage inflation and then bill rate inflation and protect the margins for the differential is where we are and where we're happy to be.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
i understand. and then just real quick, what's the tax rate assumed in q1 and then for the full year 2021, if you have that.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, i think it's for 27.5%, mike.
michael c. buckley -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, and it's going to be the about the same for the full year.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, between 27% and 28%.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from gary bisbee with bank of america. your line is open.
gary bisbee -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. just wanted to ask another one about protiviti. so a quarter ago, you told us your expectation was 5% to 7% revenue growth and it did 18%, and obviously you're calling for even further acceleration in q1. what sort of happened in the last three months and what is -- i understand all the areas of strength you've frankly been discussing for several years now, but like what changed there? what's happening and how maybe durable or sustainable are the drivers of that recent acceleration.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
the thing that changed the most as we had more public sector demand right till the end of the year than we expected. we service that primarily with contractors, which is why when you look at the supplemental schedules where we break out the inter-segment revenues, you see there was a $30 million spike between quarters three and four. and the lion's share of that was public sector related.
as to sustainability, the jury is out. that said, we have relationships, we've never had before. we've certainly got a look into many local, regional, state governments and their business processes and we certainly are excited at the opportunity to improve those processes, be it overpayments, lot in the press about some fraud as it relates to payment of unemployment claims. and so, again, there is no question that there is some spike in that as it relates to elevated unemployment claims that the states are having to process as same for housing assistance, same for remote learning support for school systems. that said, we do believe we're confident and we've got teams put together whose objective is just what you described as far as ensuring the sustainability and leveraging these new relationships that we have never had. traditionally, our revenues from government-related entities was less than 1% of revenue. so it was almost nothing. so everything we're doing today is virtually incremental.
gary bisbee -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks. and then is -- do you feel like either through that last discussion you gave or just more broadly, how you've gone to market and leverage the staffing business of protiviti, like who are you gaining share from? you're outgrowing almost everyone else in any kind of consultative type approach we see. does it or is there a certain place you're taking that from?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, i think it's somewhat in the -- on the staffing side and it's somewhat on the consulting side, because neither have the full picture. and there are many staffing firms that can provide customer support people, where their client manages them. there are virtually none that do that where we also provide the management and not only is it the management, it's with a view toward constant optimization which has been quite the winner. and so -- but for us, who would have gotten that work, my guess is, some of it would have gone to the consulting firms, the accounting firms. some of it would have gone to the staffing firms. but none of those players have what we have and it's actually pretty incredible how well it's done. it grew 82%, 82% this quarter, 82%. that's a big number.
gary bisbee -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
[indecipherable] for sure. but yeah, no, it was outstanding. thank you. i appreciate the color.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from tobey sommer with truist securities. your line is open.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you. could you tell us what you think the increased exposure to mid cap clients goes to your tam?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, there's no question that staffing at mid-and large cap companies is many times the size as the opportunity with smaller businesses. traditionally, we haven't focused there because margin pressures or such that we felt like we were better off -- offering our better candidates to small businesses that would pay us for them. but as i said earlier, it's a whole new world, when we go hand in hand with protiviti and there is the umbrella of an honest to god consulting arrangement, with honest to god deliverables such that we do think it's a new day and clearly the addressable market is much larger which is why we're investing. think about just during the pandemic, our exposure to mid-cap has gone from low 20%, today it's 34%. that's huge. that's huge and it is in a small period of time and it was done in a period where we didn't dilute our margins.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
right. as my follow-up, i wanted to ask you a question on the cost side of delivering your service. every call we start with talking about the number of locations that you deliver your services to particularly on the staffing side, but also protiviti. are there any meaningful opportunities from the experience in 2020 and now into this year to adjust the cost structure, so as to favorably impact margins over the course of the whole cycle?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, our biggest cost is our internal payroll cost and we've talked earlier about, we think we've got with a large assist with the technology we've developed in the last three to four years, we think our internal staff can inherently be more productive across this entire cycle. real estate is more nuanced. on the one hand, traditionally, our real estate is very dense. we put a lot of people in our space. there is not a lot of square footage traditionally per person in today's world of distancing even post-pandemic query whether we'll have to relax that somewhat and offset what we would otherwise save if we're on a hybrid model where everybody doesn't come in every day.
so the jury is out on that. i mean, our current thinking is probably more of push than anything, but it's early days and we don't know. we don't know, ultimately how many people are going to want to work remotely versus come in, excuse me, and further we don't know whether the density we've traditionally had which kind of creates an electricity and energy level in an office, which has been helpful. we don't know whether we're going to have to spread people out more for obvious reasons. it's kind of interesting, australia has some of the fewest number of cases. and so i would argue they're most along post pandemic and they've been surprised how much people want to come in and don't want to work remotely. and in fact, they talk about it is 90% to 95% of the staff want to come back into the office. that surprises me. whether that's sustainable in australia itself or whether you can replicate that in other places, i don't know, but that's what they report.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you very much.

thank you. our next question comes from george tong with goldman sachs. your line is open.
george tong -- goldman sachs & co. -- analyst
hi, thanks. good afternoon. revenue trends in officeteam stepped up pretty meaningfully in the quarter. what were the main drivers of that improvement? and were there any one of new benefits you'd call out in the quarter in that particular business?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
i'd say a couple of things. so first of all, fourth quarter george, officeteam always benefits from e-commerce customer support and they got some fourth quarter lift from that again. they also get open enrollment support lift in the fourth quarter. they got some of that again, traditional. but this public sector work with protiviti that i've been talking about, a lot of that has been customer service driven, call center driven, and officeteam is the beneficiary of that. officeteam had an incredible couple of three quarters. who would have believed that officeteam and protiviti would have gone to market together best at anytime much less during the pandemic.
george tong -- goldman sachs & co. -- analyst
got it. very helpful. you mentioned that revenues in the first three weeks of january were down 23% year-over-year compared to down 21% in december. in which areas did you see the most moderation in growth, moving from december to january?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, first thing, you need to zoom out from that and consider what january post quarter results mean and what they don't mean. and in fact, if you go back in time and you compare january post quarter to what with hindsight, you learn about the entire quarter. it's one of the least predictive post quarter periods that we have because of the holiday impacts. and so i would tell you that we tend to discount january post quarter more than most. and therefore, the fact that the year-over-year growth rates change by 3 percentage points, we don't ascribe much importance to.
george tong -- goldman sachs & co. -- analyst
got it. very helpful. thank you.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer

great. hey keith or mike, just one follow-up. when you talk about the public sector work, is that primarily covid related work where you're hoping there'll be some follow through or is there any way to frame maybe how much of it is kind of covid related that you're looking to extend once things start to normalize and to more normal relationships?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well. and so it's helping states deal with their unemployment claims, customer service, claims processing, claims adjudication, its housing, processing assistance claims, its customer service call centers into that, education, its helping school systems deal with tech support for remote learning, the vaccine, again customer service call center, people calling in wanting to register, its helping with checking in, its helping with the government reporting once it's done. and so it's a whole host of things that clearly are initially related to covid, if you will. but as i said earlier, it's given us a look into their internal systems and we think it's a target rich environment to do follow-up work, which we are very focused on doing.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
that's helpful. and that's all state and federal or a combination of both?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's more state and local, more state and local.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
is there any way to maybe frame how much that was in the quarter, like in terms of revenue.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, we've disclosed to you the staffing, protiviti revenue magnitude between the two. so this quarter going back, we've told you there was a $30 million lift and we've told you that a large part of that lift relates to what i just described. so you can kind of use those puzzle pieces and come back to what you're looking for.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
very helpful. thank you.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
okay. operator, i think that's our last question. thank you very much everyone for participating on the call.

operator
hello, and welcome to the robert half fourth quarter 2020 conference call. our hosts for today's call are mr. keith waddell, president and chief executive officer of robert half and mr. michael buckley, chief financial officer.
mr. waddell, you may begin.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you. hello, everyone. we appreciate your time today. before we get started, i'd like to remind you that the comments made on today's call contain forward-looking statements, including predictions and estimates about our future performance. these statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds. however, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. these risks and uncertainties are described in today's press release and in our most recent 10-k and 10-q filed with the sec. we assume no obligation to update the statements made on today's call. during this presentation, we may mention some non-gaap financial measures and reference these figures as as adjusted. reconciliations and further explanations of these measures are included in a supplemental schedule to our earnings press release.
in addition, we would like to remind you that beginning last quarter, we modified our presentation of revenues and the related growth rates for accountemps, officeteam, robert half technology and robert half management resources to include their inter-segment revenues from services provided to protiviti in connection with the company's blended staffing and consulting solutions. this is how we measure and manage these divisions internally. the combined amount of divisional intersegment revenues with protiviti is also separately disclosed. the supplemental schedule just mentioned also include our revenue schedule showing this information back for 2018, 2019, as well as 2020. for your convenience, our prepared remarks for today's call are available in the investor center of our website at roberthalf.com.
fourth-quarter results for both our protiviti and staffing operations were very strong and exceeded the top end of our guidance range. protiviti reported its 13th consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue gains, with particular strength in its technology consulting practice and managed solutions with staffing. our staffing operations reported broad-based, double-digit, quarter-on-quarter sequential revenue growth on an as-adjusted basis. i could not be more proud of how our teams have managed through this extraordinary year. over the last several months, they have made significant impacts helping our clients succeed and job candidates find meaningful work.
companywide revenues were $1.304 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, down 15% from last year's fourth quarter on a reported basis, and down 16% on an as-adjusted basis. net income per share in the fourth quarter was $0.84, compared to $0.98 in the fourth quarter one year ago.
cash flow before financing activities during the quarter was $85 million. in december, we distributed a $0.34 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record, for a total cash outlay of $39 million. we also acquired 1.1 million robert half shares during the quarter for $63 million. we have 9.9 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan. return on invested capital for the company was 31% in the fourth quarter.
now, i'll turn the call over to our cfo, mike buckley.
michael c. buckley -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, keith. and hello, everyone.
let's start with revenues. as keith noted, global revenues were $1.304 billion in the fourth quarter. this is a decrease of 15% from the fourth quarter one year ago on a reported basis and a decrease of 16% on an as-adjusted basis. on an as-adjusted basis, fourth quarter staffing revenues were down 24% year-over-year. us staffing revenues were $723 million, down 25% from the prior year. non-us staffing revenues were $219 million, down 23% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. we have 326 staffing locations worldwide, including 88 locations in 17 countries outside the united states.
in the fourth quarter, there were 61.7 billing days, equal to the number of billing days in the fourth quarter one year ago. the current first quarter has 62.3 billing days, compared to 63.1 billing days in the first quarter one year ago. the billing days for 2021 by quarter, are 62.3 days, 63.4 days, 64.4 days and 61.7 days for a total of 251.8 days, which is approximately one day less than 2020 due to it being a leap year. currency exchange rate movements during the fourth quarter had the effect of increasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $8 million. this increased our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 0.7 percentage points. temporary and consultant bill rates for the quarter increased 2% compared to a year ago, adjusted for changes in the mix of revenues by line of business. this rate for q3 2020 was 3.1%.
now, let's take a closer look at results for protiviti. global revenues in the fourth quarter were $362 million; $294 million of that is from business within the united states, and $68 million is from operations outside the united states. on an as-adjusted basis, global fourth quarter protiviti revenues were up 18% versus the year-ago period, with us protiviti revenues up 23%. non-us revenues were down 2% on an as-adjusted basis. exchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year protiviti revenues by $3 million and increasing its year-over-year reported growth rate by 1 percentage point. protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 28 countries.
turning to sg&a presentation. as first noted last quarter, changes in the company's deferred compensation obligations are now included in sg&a or in the case of protiviti, direct cost, with offsetting changes in the investment trust assets presented separately below sg&a. as a reminder, our historical discussion of consolidated operating income has been replaced with the non-gaap measure of combined segment income. this is calculated as consolidated income before income taxes, adjusted for interest income and amortization of intangible assets.
for your convenience, we've added another supplemental schedule to today's earnings release on pages 12 and 13, highlighting the impact of changes in the deferred compensation accounts to the summary of operations for the fourth quarter and full year 2020 and 2019. this is a non-gaap disclosure, so we also show a reconciliation to gaap.
turning now to gross margin. in our temporary and consultant staffing operations, fourth quarter gross margin was 38.5% of applicable revenues, compared to 38% of applicable revenues in the fourth quarter one year ago. the year-over-year increase in gross margin percentage is primarily due to lower payroll taxes, insurance and other fringe costs. our permanent placement revenues in the fourth quarter were 9.7% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 10.3% of consolidated staffing revenues in the same quarter one year ago. when combined with temporary and consultant gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 10 basis points compared to the year-ago fourth quarter, to 44.4%.
for protiviti, gross margin was $96 million in the fourth quarter or 26.5% of protiviti revenues. this includes $5 million, or 1.5% of protiviti revenues, of deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets. one year ago, gross margin for protiviti was $90 million or 29.7% of protiviti revenues, including $2 million of deferred compensation expense or 0.7% of protiviti revenues, related to investment trust activities.
companywide selling, general and administrative costs were 32.6% of global revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 32.8% in the same quarter one year ago. deferred compensation expenses related to increases in underlying trust investments had the impact of increasing sg&a as a percent of revenue by 2.7% in the current third quarter and 1.2% in the same quarter one year ago. staffing sg&a costs were 39.7% of staffing revenues in the fourth quarter versus 36.7% in the fourth quarter of 2019. included in staffing sg&a costs was deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets of 3.7% and 1.5%, respectively. we ended 2020 with 7,800 full-time internal staff in our staffing divisions, down 32% from the prior year. fourth-quarter sg&a costs for protiviti were 14.1% of protiviti revenues, compared to 17.1% of revenues in the year-ago period. we ended 2020 with 7,300 full-time protiviti employees and contractors, up 34% from the prior year.
operating income for the quarter was $89 million. this includes $41 million of deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying investment trust assets. combined segment income was therefore $130 million in the fourth quarter. combined segment margin was 9.9%. fourth quarter segment income from our staffing divisions was $79 million with a segment margin of 8.4%. segment income for protiviti in the fourth quarter was $51 million with a segment margin of 13.9%.
our fourth-quarter tax rate was 27% for both the current and prior period years. accounts receivable at the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable was $714 million, and implied days sales outstanding or dso was 49.4 days.
before we move to first-quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the fourth quarter of 2020 and so far in january 2021, all adjusted for currency and billing days. our temporary and consultant staffing divisions exited the fourth quarter with december revenues down 20.8% versus the prior year, compared to a 23.8% decrease for the full quarter. revenues for the first three weeks of january were down 23% compared to the same period one year ago.
permanent placement revenues in december were down 25.4% versus december of 2019. this compares to a 28.5% decrease for the full quarter. for the first three weeks of january, permanent placement revenues were down 20% compared to the same period in 2020. we provide this information so that you have an insight into some of the trends we saw during the fourth quarter and into january. but, as you know, these are very brief time periods. we caution against reading too much into them.
with that in mind, we offer the following first-quarter guidance. revenues; $1.29 billion to $1.37 billion, income per share; $0.74 to $0.84. the midpoint of our guidance implies a year-over-year revenue decline of 11.7% on an as-adjusted basis, including protiviti and eps returning to prior-year levels. the major financial assumptions underlying the midpoint of these assumptions are as follows. revenue growth on a year-over-year basis, staffing down 19% to 21%, protiviti, up 23% to 25%, overall, down 11% to 13%. gross margin percentages; temporary and consultant staffing, 37% to 38%, protiviti; 25% to 26%, overall; 38% to 39%.
sg&a as percent of revenues, excluding deferred compensation investment impacts: staffing: 35% to 36%, protiviti: 14% to 15%, overall: 29% to 30%. segment income, staffing: 8% to 9%, protiviti: 10% to 12%, overall: 8% to 10%. 2021 capital expenditures and capitalized cloud computing costs for the year: $85 million to $95 million, with $15 million to $20 million in the first quarter. tax rate: 27% to 28%, shares: 113 million.
we limit our guidance to one quarter. all estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our sec filings.
now, i'll turn the call back over to keith.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, mike. we enter 2021 with renewed optimism about robert half's positioning for future growth. we have retained our key staff, and they are committed to driving our success as the backbone of the enterprise. our aggressive go-to-market strategy during the pandemic with clients in the public sector and financial institutions of all sizes has yielded meaningful wins and new relationships.
our technology investments have facilitated remote working models internally and with our advanced ai- driven capabilities are providing clients with real-time choices of candidates from outside their local market area. owing to its diversified solution offerings, protiviti continues its record of multiyear double-digit revenue growth and very positive pipeline. the collaboration between protiviti and staffing is at an all-time high as evidenced by the 82% year-on-year growth rate this quarter from the unique blend of consulting and staffing solutions. staffing services provided to our mid-cap clients now approaches one-third of our revenues and growing and this is incremental to our traditional focus on smb clients and prospects.
with multiple vaccines now rolling out throughout the world and fiscal and monetary policy support expected to continue globally, economists are increasingly expecting gdp growth to follow. gdp driven early cycle growth is traditionally particularly robust for smb clients that are lean and nimble from the downturn and have pent-up demand to restore and upskill their workforce as they return to growth. more than ever, we believe the strength of our brands, our people, our technology and our professional business model position us for future success in 2021 and beyond.
now, mike and i would be happy to answer your questions. please ask just one question and a single follow-up, as needed. if there's time, we'll come back to you for additional questions.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of andrew steinerman with j.p. morgan.
andrew steinerman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, it's andrew. keith, i wanted to ask you if you felt the u.s. has entered a brand new economic expansion, which bodes for particularly strong years of revenue growth at robert half, or is there something about the 2020 recession that was just different than past recessions and it really kind of lands us more where we were in 2019 in terms of the economy, which really only supported mid-single-digit revenue growth on our ongoing basis for robert half?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, andrew, we would say that it feels very traditional early cycle and just to quantify that a little bit, we looked at the first three quarters post trough for the recovery post-dot-com, for the recovery post-financial crisis and for the recent. and as an example, three quarters post trough, first time, temp up 13%, perm up 18%, after the financial crisis temp up 9%, perm up 34%, and this time temp up 18%, perm up 56%.
further, if you look at the peak to trough decline, those declines on the temp side are pretty consistent across those three cycles. our people would tell you that the recovery feels very classic, that there is improving demand broadly across all the dimensions that i talked about that, as always, clients cut deep, they've got lean staff. as transaction volumes improve, as projects restart, they need more help, they need to restore their workforce, many times upskill. and so, for us, it feels very classical. traditionally, we've got a nice three to five year runway once we get into recovery, which we believe we're well under way as we've spoken about.
andrew steinerman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
perfect. thank you.
operator
your next question is from mark marcon with robert w. baird.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
good afternoon, keith and michael. first of all, congratulations on the stellar results. i'd like to talk about protiviti. specifically, wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on the stellar results that they ended up having. as you mentioned, 14 straight quarters, 35% growth. if we take a look at the -- what you're forecasting here going into the second quarter, can you just dimensionalize how much of the uplift is because you're getting more opportunities broadly speaking, more adept versus an improvement in terms of the win rate and really gaining share.
and then can you also talk a little bit about what are some of the drivers -- you did say it was broad based, but i'm wondering if you could give us some commentary with regards to the public sector work, the it work, spacs, and obviously, we can see the results in terms of staffing in terms of what's being eliminated for the intersegment revenue, so obviously, that continues to go well, but just wondering if you can give some more color there?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. and so, as you said, we're very proud with the 35% growth rate and it splits pretty evenly between what i'll call core -- the core solutions, tech, risk and compliance, internal audit, which grew 18% year-on-year totally exclusive of public sector and blended solutions. blended solutions then grew 124% adding 17 points to the growth rate. so you've got 18 points of the growth rate coming from core, you've got 17 points of the growth rate coming from blended solutions. and, by the way, those blended solutions then split about 50-50 between public sector and non-public sector. so that sizes, if you will, the contribution to public sector.
if you then look at their core solutions, in tech, which they've been very strategic about picking their shots as to practice areas, they've been very strategic about making the right hires at the right levels including very senior levels. and so they're in cyber, they're in privacy, they're in digital transformation, data analytics. as i've talked before, tech consulting is now the largest core solution area for protiviti. risk and compliance remains very strong, anti-money laundering, consumer lending regulatory enforcement, regulator exam preparation, all very good. internal audit, as you spoke about, clearly benefiting from ipos and spacs. further, they've got clients reinstating their internal audit budgets that have been cut last year during the pandemic, which also lead to our very aggressive -- conservatively aggressive, we would call, for q2 with the budget for the guidance.
the interesting thing about the public sector is it's -- in blended solutions with staffing generally, it's not just u.s. and we now have some sizable engagements outside of the u.s., which are contributing. so we're very pleased with that. as we've talked before those public sector engagements are around unemployment, housing assistance. a new and large opportunity we're seeing is in the education. there's a lot of funding going to k through 12 and higher level, college level institutions that are going to get a lot of funding, that are going to need help distributing and accounting for those funds. we've been pleased about the renewals that we've gotten where we already are and we are organizing or mobilizing as we speak to take advantage of this education opportunity.
so it's one of those times where virtually every core solution area as well as the additional work we're getting in blended solutions, not only from public sector but from non-public sector as well, so that we've got a q2 revenue guide for protiviti for up 40%.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
that's great. thank you for the color. just to be 100% clear, i mean it sounds like you're obviously getting all sorts of different opportunities. can you comment a little bit just on the win rate relative to the big four because i suspect you are continuing to win those but just wanted to confirm that, number one. and number two, on the public sector, one of the things that we sometimes hear pushback on is the incentives. well, those are just temporary, they're only going to be here for another few months to a year and then they're going to fade, what's your sense?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, on big four win rates, understand that the big four are frenemies. on one hand, we compete with them on the other hand when they're conflicted because of their external audit engagements, we're the first party they refer to because we don't compete with them on external audit like the other big four. so i'd say our win rate is consistent and rising, particularly in the blended solutions area where they simply don't have the capabilities that we have.
and on this issue of sustainability with public sector, i guess, transitory is a word that our fed reserve chairman likes to use. we've been very transparent that clearly there is a bulge dimension to the transaction volumes we're helping with. but we've also been clear that we believe we're building new relationships that we can leverage as they improve their processes, as they improve their controls, as they modernize their technology. so we're certainly aware that there is a window of time where we're going to have a very intense relationship with these state and local government and even local school districts and we're working very hard to extend those. we've been very positively surprised or pleased with the extensions we're seeing, sometimes into the second and third quarter with this -- the work that we're already doing.
so clearly there is a bulge element to what's going in public sector but it's not only bulge and we think there's an opportunity. and the point i've tried to make is -- and oh, by the way, totally excluding it, protiviti's still growing 18%. and so, that other 17 points of growth in gravy and we love it and we think we can leverage it for longer term but their core business is growing 18%, that's a big number.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
totally agreed. thank you.
operator
your next question is from jeff silber with bmo capital markets.
jeffrey silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thanks so much. i wanted to shift the discussion over to the perm segment, which really had a really good quarter, much better than i think most people expected. can we get a little color where you're seeing that trade either in the type of clients or the type of jobs they could place in?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
the great news, jeff, is that it's our cross clients and i would say perm placement is more smb than the temporary side and we are overall. so almost by definition, if it's perm it's smb. but as i referred to earlier, it's by functional area, meaning it's accounting and finance, and it's technology, and it's legal, and it's marketing and creative. it's by skill level, so it's for the transactional level people, accounts payable, accounts receivable, payroll, general ledger as well as the higher senior accountants, accounting managers, controllers. so it's very broad. it's broad across geographies, not only within the united states but outside the united states as well.
good news is candidates are getting more confident to make job changes plus being at home frankly, makes it easier for them to confidentially interview with our recruiters, so that's good for perm. very broad, very robust. we've got huge momentum going into the quarter, we gave you our post-quarter numbers, which were triple-digit growth. so perm, as our people would say, is white-hot at the moment.
jeffrey silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay, that's great to hear. can we shift over to the international piece of your business? can you just give us a little bit of color by country and also, do you have any exposure in mexico? thanks.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, the latter part is easy. we do not have exposure to mexico and we don't do a lot of country-by-country discussion. i would call out that germany and the u.k. had particularly good quarters. but frankly, there was nice recovery across our geographies in europe and in asia, so...
jeffrey silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
all right.
jeffrey silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
all right, that's great to hear. thanks so much.

your next question is from manav patnaik with barclays.
manav patnaik -- barclays plc -- analyst
the piece of the early cycle recovery has been faster than you've seen but, i guess, i was just curious if you could compare it a bit to 2019 levels. i guess what i'm trying to get an idea of is, how much more is just left in terms of just pure catching up to pre-pandemic before we start thinking about what the future growth looks like?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
right. a good question. so we are about just over 20% below 2019 for the temp side, and we're about 15% below 2019 on the perm side. and at our current pace, we fully expect to blow by 2019 sooner rather than later.
manav patnaik -- barclays plc -- analyst
okay. and it just -- the other question i had quickly was in terms of competition. are you seeing any changes in the competitive behavior just given obviously is this big catch-up going on and i'm wondering if things are the same or if dynamics have changed?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
and is your question regarding our contract employees we put on engagements or our internal staff?
manav patnaik -- barclays plc -- analyst
no, i meant just more from competition with the on assignment and yeah, other vendors as well.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, i'd say, on assignment is a competitor in a very specific and relatively small part of our business, particularly since they focus on mid and large-cap companies. even in tech, we focus a lot on smbs as well. so there's not a lot of apples and apples there. but i'd say, the competitive landscape as to pricing vis-a-vis our competitors generally hasn't changed much at all.
manav patnaik -- barclays plc -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
your next question is from kevin mcveigh with credit suisse.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse group ag -- analyst
great. thanks so much and congratulations on the results. keith, you talked about all-time-high earnings, things like that. do you think with the way the business is geared, you're positioned for structurally high margins or is it may be some inability to hire or excess capacity among the staff? how are you thinking about the margin trajectory of the business relative to where your staffing levels are internally?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well -- and so when we talk about profitability, those discussions have to start with gross margins. and as we've talked before, traditionally in a downturn, peak to trough, we're down 300 basis points. this time, we were only down 100. we're now back to pre-pandemic levels, pay bill spreads have recovered, we've got lower fringe rates because our higher pay rate divisions make up more of our mix meaning more of the payroll isn't subject to payroll tax. and we've also got this tranche of full-time contractors we've talked about that have higher margins and that's growing as well.
temp to hire conversions currently 3.1%. they got -- they were 3.5% in 2018, 2019, they've been as high as 4% to 5%, so there is some up -- so there's an upside there. we would caution in the short term like for q2, q3, we are projecting some sequential reduction in temp gross margin up to 40 basis points because we've got to pay our temporary or contract staff for time-off to get their vaccine and time-off to recover from that, if needed. but that's a short term or hopefully transitory thing.
on the sg&a front, from a headcount level, given we're still below even 2019 as i just said, we still think we've got capacity with existing staff, which on average is more tenure than it's been in the past. that said, particularly on perm and replacement because of its very rapid growth rates, we're going to be -- we're going to begin to slowly add to internal staff there as well.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse group ag -- analyst
super helpful. and, keith, it sounds like from sourcing candidates there is no issue there, is that right or is -- how is it from a candidate perspective?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
i'd say the candidate supply is more nuanced than meets the eye. on one hand, they're resistant for onsite opportunities either because they're concerned about covid, they don't like the commute times, they don't have child care, they've got school uncertainty for their children, they've got unemployment benefits. they've also got out-of-market opportunities as well as local opportunities and many times, if they don't live in a big city, they live outside of a big city but they've got an opportunity now to get big city pay without even having to move there. so it's a very nuanced situation with candidates.
but the good news is it allows us to add more value because it's more complicated for clients themselves to source candidates, particularly outside their local markets. so the combination of our experienced recruiters and the technology that we've developed give us an opportunity to add value, i would argue, in a new way and in an increased way because of all these candidate nuances. i think clients are understanding as they try, as they always do to some degree, add people on their own. it's a different world, it's a more complicated world and i think relative to clients doing it themselves and relative to our traditional competitors, which are local regional firms, they just don't have the capabilities, they don't have the recruiter relationships, particularly out-of-market such that if anything, our competitive positioning is better than ever.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse group ag -- analyst
thanks so much.

your next question is from gary bisbee with bofa securities.
gary bisbee -- bofa securities, inc. -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. so the first one on the blended staffing, tremendous success you continue to have. does that have any discernible impact on gross margins in the temp staffing business either up or down or is it generally relatively representative of what they are when you're staffing those people out to an external client?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, so first of all, the staffing temp gross margins we report are not impacted at all by that because it's been pushed over to protiviti. if you're asking how the gross margins on the business with clients that's serviced by both compares to our general -- our normal gross margins, i'd say they're at or maybe a little above, which is fantastic given that the client base skews much larger and typically staffing by itself going to those larger clients would have some margin pressure that's been avoided by going to market together with protiviti.
gary bisbee -- bofa securities, inc. -- analyst
but, so it -- is it safe to then say, hey, temp gross margin 10 points roughly above protiviti, so the revenue growth there is helping protiviti margins because of that delta or is that the way you price it?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well -- and so, i would say the blended solutions reported in protiviti are accretive to protiviti's margins in large part because there's no pitch time or utilization reduction because these people are 100% utilized. they're only paid when they are working, by and large. so that utilization differential makes them accretive for protiviti's gross margin because the large portion of protiviti's workforce is full-time and utilization management has a huge impact on their margin structure.
gary bisbee -- bofa securities, inc. -- analyst
got it. and then even you gave a sense of public sector versus non-public sector. even if we back out portion of public sector, it really feels like the blended solutions have gained tremendous momentum in the last year, but even the last several quarters, i guess what...
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
absolutely. right. you take half of total blended solutions away.
gary bisbee -- bofa securities, inc. -- analyst
right.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
and what you have left is blended solutions that are non-public sector.
gary bisbee -- bofa securities, inc. -- analyst
right. are they half of...
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
and those are doing quite well too.
gary bisbee -- bofa securities, inc. -- analyst
half of year-to-year growth, i think. so it's $30 million or similar to what you said the last few quarters, the rest of it would be traditional, is that a...
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
correct. the rest of it's doing very well.
gary bisbee -- bofa securities, inc. -- analyst
and why has the momentum picked up? is it just you're selling it more aggressively or the clients are responding. just trying to think about the durability of the drivers of that momentum? thank you.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, i'd say we're selling it more aggressively, we're consciously adding to developers that focus on selling just that service, we're adding to subject-matter expertise on the protiviti side that manages those projects. and so, with the success we've had, success to get success, as i said earlier, it's now gone international, which is really great. it's not just a u.s. thing, we've got some wonderful wins outside of the u.s. so globally, people on the staffing side and the protiviti side, they just see that it works and they also see that nobody else has it.
gary bisbee -- bofa securities, inc. -- analyst
right. okay, that sounds great. thank you.

your next question is from tobey sommer with truist securities.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you. given the sort of odd nature of the decline and robust rebound to date, how do you think about bill rates and sort of compensation inflation in this cycle?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
it's -- i would say, wage inflation is usually our friend and as the candidate side tightens, which it's already doing and is expected to further that, not only do we traditionally pass through the higher pay rate, but it also gives us an opportunity to also widen our spread a bit. so you can look back 25 years and you can see the wage inflation is our friend. i think any reasonable person would project that there's going to be some wage inflation as things improve.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
good. on the social costs that typically dampen gross margins exiting recession and then provide a nice tailwind for subsequent years of recovery, how is this cycle perhaps different?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, interesting one is on the state unemployment and this time around, the states to get the federal subsidies had to agree not to charge the claims to individual company accounts, but instead to keep them in a general pool. and i could make the case that we're not going to benefit by that because the general pool increase will likely or could be argued to be less than what the increases would be had all the claims have been charged to our account. i mean it's been forever the case across the staffing industry that during downturns the previously working temporary employees file a lot of unemployment claims that stay with us for three to five years as the state's average that into their rates.
so i'm cautiously optimistic that because the elevated claims that we read about every day, by and large, haven't been charged to our individual accounts that the one-pool concept will benefit us more than it will hurt us. but only time will tell, i don't know that.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you.

your next question is from hamzah mazari with jefferies.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies group llc -- analyst
over the past few calls, there's been questions about just your capacity and you mentioned it a little bit earlier on in the call about having capacity remaining in the business. i guess just maybe ask it slightly differently, i guess, at the current capacity levels and given the trends in the business that you're seeing right now, how long do you think you can go without having to hire internally? it sounds like you're doing a little bit in perm or expect to, but i guess in the overall business, when should we expect that to ramp, or at what point in the cycle would you want to ramp hiring?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, clearly on the temp side we think we've got a couple of quarters anyway that we'll be just fine with existing staff. and understand that there is a productivity benefit to us with internal remote work because we no longer have to staff every single office for peak demand but instead one office can be assisted by a neighboring office or a distant office remotely when they have peak demands.
my point is, we should be more efficient going forward than we've been in the past because we can share our internal resources across larger areas. so it's not just a matter of because we are recovering, given prior productivity levels we need x number of staff. as i've also talked about, the average tenure of our existing staff is much longer than normal, which also impacts our need to hire.
so long story short, as you referenced, we're beginning to hire internally, we're probably a couple of quarters from starting in temp. but even there it will be at a slower pace than it might otherwise have been because we've got the benefits of remote work, we've got the benefit of our technology tools that we've seen really pay off from us for the last three or four quarters.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies group llc -- analyst
great. thank you. i'll just -- one more and i'll turn it over. just on m&a, i know you've done some smaller deals within protiviti. is there anything specific to protiviti that you guys are looking at currently, are there any chunkier deals or should we expect any smaller deals throughout the remainder of 2021?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, i'd say that protiviti is always looking for solution areas for practice groups that fit culturally and strategically with what they're trying to do. they did the identity management deal last quarter and so, i'd say stay tuned but it's just -- it's part of ordinary course of business that they're looking for the practice areas, smaller consulting firms many times that have the same kind of cultural big four background that they have.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies group llc -- analyst
great. thank you very much.

your next question is from george tong with goldman sachs.
george tong -- goldman sachs group, inc. -- analyst
hi, thanks. good afternoon. you mentioned that public sector work lifted protiviti growth by 17% in the quarter. how much did it benefit temp staffing growth by?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
virtually zero. and it's a very important point and i'm glad you asked the question. the public sector work while it starts in the lines of business on staffing, it gets eliminated. so that intersegment elimination line you see eliminates all of that work. so the growth rates for temp staffing are not impacted by the public sector work, it's ex-public sector. the public sector is over on the protiviti side and as i just mentioned, you just mentioned, it's about half of their growth rate but half of 35% is still a really big number.
george tong -- goldman sachs group, inc. -- analyst
got it. very helpful. and then, if you look at performance in the temp staffing business in the u.s. and compare that to europe, how would you compare the various trajectories of the recovery?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
amazingly consistent. if you look at temp and perm and we disclose u.s. versus non-u.s., i would say they're amazingly consistent. it's amazingly consistent.
george tong -- goldman sachs group, inc. -- analyst
got it. very helpful. thank you.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
okay, i think that's our last question. thanks, everyone, for joining.

operator
hello, and welcome to the robert half first quarter 2021 conference call. our hosts for today's call are mr. keith waddell, president and chief executive officer of robert half, and mr. michael buckley, chief financial officer.
mr. waddell, you may begin.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
hello, everyone. we appreciate your time today. before we get started, i'd like to remind you that the comments made on today's call contain forward-looking statements, including predictions and estimates about our future performance. these statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds. however, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. these risks and uncertainties are described in today's press release and our most recent 10-k and 10-q filed with the sec. we assume no obligation to update the statements made on today's call.
during this presentation, we may mention some non-gaap financial measures and reference these figures as, as adjusted. reconciliations and further explanations of these measures are included in a supplemental schedule to our earnings press release.
our presentation of revenues and the related growth rates for accountemps, officeteam, robert half technology, and robert half management resources include their intersegment revenues from services provided to protiviti in connection with the company's blended staffing and consulting solutions. this is how we measure and manage these divisions internally. the combined amount of divisional intersegment revenues with protiviti is also separately disclosed. the supplemental schedules just mentioned also include a revenue schedule showing this information for 2018 through 2021. for your convenience, our prepared remarks for today's call are available in the investor center of our website roberthalf.com.
we are extremely pleased that our first quarter results exceeded the high end of our guidance and reflect a broad-based recovery that's well under way. protiviti's revenues grew 35% year-on-year reflecting continuing momentum across its wide array of service offerings, including very strong managed solutions with staffing. this is protiviti's 14th consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue gains. our staffing operations significantly outperformed their historical sequential trends, led by small and medium-sized businesses and permanent placement, which grew 22% sequentially.
i continue to be impressed with the adaptability of our teams in navigating the new hybrid and remote work models with our clients and candidates, helping them grow and find meaningful work. companywide revenues were $1.398 billion in the first quarter of 2021, down 7% from last year's first quarter on a reported basis, and down 8% on an as adjusted basis. net income per share in the first quarter was $0.98, increasing 24% compared to $0.79 in the first quarter a year ago.
cash flow from operations during the quarter was $68 million. in march, we distributed a $0.38 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record, for a total cash outlay of $44 million. we also acquired approximately 797,000 robert half shares during the quarter for $61 million. we have 9.2 million shares available for repurchase under our board approved stock repurchase plan. our return on invested capital for the company was 37% in the first quarter.
now, i'll turn the call over to our cfo, mike buckley.
michael c. buckley -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, keith, and hello, everyone. let's start with revenues. as keith noted, global revenues were $1.398 billion in the first quarter. on an as adjusted basis, first quarter staffing revenues were down 18% year-over-year. u.s. staffing revenues were $759 million, down 19% from the prior year. non-u.s. staffing revenues were $242 million, down 15% year-over-year on an as adjusted basis. we have 322 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the united states.
in the first quarter, there were 62.3 billing days compared to 63.1 billing days in the first quarter one year ago. the current second quarter has 63.4 billing days equivalent to the second quarter one year ago. currency exchange rate movements during the first quarter had the effect of increasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $17 million. this impacted our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 1.4 percentage points.
now, let's take a closer look at results for protiviti. global revenues in the first quarter were $397 million. $316 million of that is from business within the united states, and $81 million is from operations outside the united states. on an as adjusted basis, global first quarter protiviti revenues were up 35% versus the year-ago period, with u.s. protiviti revenues up 37%. non-u.s. revenues were up 26% on an as adjusted basis. exchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year protiviti revenues by $6 million and increasing its year-over-year reported growth rate by 2 percentage points. protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 28 countries.
we remind you that changes to the company's deferred compensation obligations are classified as sg&a or, in the case of protiviti, cost of services with completely offsetting changes in the related trust investment assets classified separately below sg&a. previously, they were both classified as sg&a. our historical discussion of consolidated operating income has been replaced with the non-gaap measures of combined segment income. this is calculated as consolidated income before income taxes, adjusted for interest income and amortization of intangible assets.
for your convenience, we've included a supplemental schedule to today's earnings release on page 7, highlighting the impact of changes in the deferred compensation accounts to the summary of operations for the first quarter of 2021 and 2020. this is a non-gaap disclosure, so we also show a reconciliation to gaap.
turning now to gross margin. in our temporary and consultant staffing operations, first quarter gross margin was 38.8% of applicable revenues compared to 37.8% of applicable revenues in the first quarter one year ago. our permanent placement revenues in the first quarter were 11.2% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 9.9% of consolidated staffing revenues in the same quarter one year ago. when combined with temporary and consultant gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 160 basis points compared to the year-ago first quarter to 45.6%.
for protiviti, gross margin was 26.5% of protiviti revenues compared to 27.6% of protiviti revenues one year ago. adjusted for the effect of deferred compensation expense related to changes in the underlying trust investment assets as previously mentioned, gross margin for protiviti was 26.9% for the quarter just ended compared to 26.3% one year ago.
companywide sg&a costs were 30.3% of global revenues in the first quarter compared to 29.4% in the same quarter one year ago. changes in deferred compensation obligations related to increases in underlying trust investments had the impact of increasing sg&a as a percent of revenue by 0.8% in the first quarter and decreasing sg&a by 2.4% in the same quarter one year ago. when adjusted for these changes, companywide sg&a costs were 29.5% for the quarter just ended compared to 31.8% one year ago.
staffing sg&a costs were 37.3% of staffing revenues in the first quarter versus 32.3% in the q1 -- in q1 2020. included in staffing sg&a costs was deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets of 1% in the first quarter compared to income of 3% related to decreases in the underlying trust investment assets in the same quarter one year ago. when adjusted for these changes, staffing sg&a costs were 36.3% for the quarter just ended compared to 35.3% one year ago. first-quarter sg&a costs for protiviti were 12.5% of protiviti revenues compared to 17.3% of revenues in the year-ago period.
operating income for the quarter was $139 million. this includes $12 million of deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets. combined segment income was therefore, $151 million in the first quarter. combined segment margin was 10.8%. first quarter segment income from our staffing divisions was $93 million with a segment margin of 9.3%. segment income for protiviti in the first quarter was $57 million with a segment margin of 14.4%. our first quarter tax rate was 26% compared to 32% a year ago. the 2020 rate was elevated based upon the estimated lower coverage of non-deductible tax items due to lower pandemic-impacted revenues.
moving on to accounts receivable. at the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable was $800 million, and implied days sales outstanding or dso was 51.4 days. before we move to second quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the first quarter and so far in april, all adjusted for currency and billing days.
our temporary and consultant staffing divisions exited the first quarter with march revenues down 12.5% versus the prior year, compared to an 18.9% decrease for the full quarter. revenues for the first two weeks of april were up 9% compared to the same period one year ago. permanent placement revenues in march were up 24.2% versus march of 2020. this compares to an 8.1% decrease for the full quarter. for the first three weeks of april permanent placement revenues were up 154% compared to the same period in 2020.
we provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we've seen during the first quarter and into april. but as you know, these are very brief time periods and we caution against reading too much into them. with that in mind, we offer the following second quarter guidance. revenues $1.435 billion to $1.515 billion. income per share $1 to $1.10. the midpoint of our guidance implies a year-over-year revenue increase of 31% on an as adjusted basis including protiviti. midpoint eps of $1.05 would represent an all-time high for the company.
the major financial assumptions underlying the midpoint of these estimates are as follows. revenue growth on a year-over-year basis, staffing up 23% to 26%, protiviti up 47% to 49%, overall up 30% to 32%.
on the gross margin percentages, temporary and consultant staffing 38% to 39%, protiviti 27% to 29% and overall 40% to 41%. sg&a as percent of revenues, excluding deferred compensation investment impacts, staffing 35% to 37%, protiviti 12% to 14%, overall 29% to 30%. and segment income, staffing 9% to 10%, protiviti 14% to 15%, and overall 10% to 11%. full year capital expenditures and capitalized cloud computing costs, $85 million to $95 million with $15 million to $20 million in the second quarter. our tax rate, 26% to 27% and shares at 112 million. we limit our guidance to one quarter. all estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our sec filings.
now, i'll turn the call back over to keith.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, mike. our staffing results accelerated during the quarter, indicating a faster early cycle pace of recovery than we've experienced in the past. this was very broad based and seen across geographies, lines of business, client size, and skill levels. as i mentioned earlier, small and medium-size businesses led the way after being more negatively impacted during the peak of the pandemic. the nfib recently reported that 42% of small businesses had job openings they could not fill, which was a record level. this bodes well for us.
our investments in advanced ai technologies have allowed us to adapt quickly to a new marketplace, where remote and hybrid work has become commonplace. together with our people, these technologies enable us to find solutions to meet the critical talent and consulting needs of our clients across broader resource pools. protiviti continues to thrive with multi-year double-digit growth and a pipeline that is highly diversified across both solution offerings and client segments. our blended solutions, complementing protiviti's offerings with contract talent, allows us to be extremely nimble and cost effective in response to client needs, and we expect this offering to be an increasing part of our business going forward.
we're excited about our current momentum and our prospects for the balance of 2021 and beyond, buoyed by the strength of our brands, our people, our technology, and our professional business model. we'd also like to thank our employees for making possible two recognition awards we've received just in the last few days. these are fortune's 100 best companies to work for in 2021 and forbes' best employers for diversity 2021.
now, mike and i would be happy to answer your questions. please ask just one question and a single follow up as needed. if there's time, we'll come back to you for additional questions.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of mark marcon with robert w. baird.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird -- analyst
good afternoon, keith and mike. obviously, outstanding results. i'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about protiviti. specifically, you mentioned $100 million in revenue that came from the public sector programs, how sustainable do you think those programs are? how many kind of started up in the second quarter? what's the pipeline look like? or how should investors think about that portion? and then if we subtract out the $100 million from the intersegment revenues, it looks like you're also growing your non-public managed solutions business. so can you talk a little bit about that and the traction you're seeing there?
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
sure. and so again, to size this, it was $100 million in revenues for the quarter. that's only 6% of our overall revenues that added 8 points to our growth rate and it's $0.07 a share. it was again led by unemployment and housing assistance. the good news is there's still a backlog of demand. many states have already extended us into q3 and q4. the tail is expected to last well into 2022. our forecast is flat for q3 sequentially and for a modest decline in q4. so the pipeline for non-transactional rfps increased eight-fold during the last 90 days, projects such as performance improvement, data analytics, controls, modernization. so we're cautiously optimistic that our win rate will be good, but those opportunities given the strength of our new relationships.
as you mentioned, not only did we grow the public sector portion of intersegment, but we also grew the balance of intersegment, which is managed business solutions, managed technology solutions between staffing and protiviti. so that grew 49% year-on-year as well, that had nothing to do with public sector. so bottom line is the transactional work we were doing has a longer tail than most expect and will likely last well into 2022. we're certainly ramping up our pipeline beyond that and stay tuned to see what our win rate is.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird -- analyst
that's great. and then related to that, can you just talk a little bit about who you're winning from? i mean, when you mentioned that eight-fold increase, where were those-where would those opportunities have gone previously? how would you characterize the win rates? like who are you winning from and how big is that potential tam do you think based on that strength?
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
i'd say most of those competing with us for the non-transactional work are other consulting firms, including the big four, not other staffing firms. for the transactional work, clearly the other staffing firms are in some of the states as well. so it's relatively new days for us with these public sector clients. as i've said before, we feel very good about the referrals we're getting from the relationships we've already wean-we've already established and therefore only time will tell what our win rate will be, but we're optimistic. and our win rate clearly rises when we have existing relationships.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird -- analyst
that's terrific. thank you.
operator
your next question is from jeff silber with bmo capital markets.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thanks so much. you've mentioned the temporary consulting billing rates. i was wondering if we could talk a little bit about wage rates and bill price spread. and are you doing anything different on the supply side to track or maybe there's constraints different from prior quarters or prior years? thanks.
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
so first of all, the wage rates are up a little less than the bill rates, and i gave you global rates. the u.s. rates are a little bit higher than the global rates. when we talk about candidate supply, it's tightest at the staff or transactional level, but it's manageable. we've successfully recruited in environments with much lower unemployment rates, while currently it's 5.9% overall and 3.5% for college grads. just in 2019, it was 3.5% overall and 1.9% for college grads. and frankly, if you adjusted the current rates for participation rates, that would be even higher.
i'd say that remote candidates have meaningfully expanded the pool. our technology, our footprint facilitate this. further, we do expect some relief at the staff and transactional level as unemployment benefits decline, and child care and schools reopen. we're passing through the wage inflation that we're having, and we've actually expanded our margin some. and clearly, candidates want more remote options and frankly want a premium if you want them to work onsite. but net-net, we think the supply is manageable. and we're not only at the staff and transactional level, but we are mid and higher skilled as well. and it's not near as tight there as it is at the staff and transactional level.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. that's really helpful. shifting gears a bit and talking about your internal hiring. if i remember correctly, last quarter you said, i think you said you had enough capacity to last at least for the next couple of quarters. given the strength that you saw last quarter, are you wrapping up your internal hiring?
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
and so we're clearly ramping perm more quickly than temp or contract for obvious reasons. and so we'll begin now to slowly add to our temp and contract internal staff, and we'll get even more aggressive on the permanent placement side, given how successful it's become.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. really helpful. thanks so much, keith.
operator
your next question is from andrew steinerman with jpmorgan.
andrew steinerman -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi. hi there, keith. i don't know if you're going to say this is the same type of question, but i want to know if you feel like robert half right now is set up for multiple years of strong, flexible staff and growth. usually there's multiple years of strong growth when you add a new economic cycle. i definitely heard you say, i feel like supply is manageable. but my question really stems from you said, hey, we've really seen faster pickup of demand here than typical. so my question is when you see this faster demand than typical, do you feel like it might not be as long as you typically see.
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
okay. so let's first talk about how much faster so far. and so we measure four quarters past trough, and we compare that against the 2008-2009 and the 2000-2001 downturns. and so this time four quarters past trough on the temp or contract side, we're up 38%, on the perm side, we're up 96%. and that compares 2008-2009 temp or contract up 14%, perm up 33%. 2000-2001 temp or contract up 23% for four quarters and perm up 41%. so clearly, it's just a fact that so far, we've recovered more quickly.
now further, if you look back to those same periods in time, for the 2008-2009 period, three years hints we had compound annual growth rates of 12% a year for a temp or contract and 24% a year for perm. and the 2000-2001 period was frankly double of that. and so history would say, and if anything, it's repeating even better than historically, history would say that once we start recovering, we have a three- to five-year runway of outsized growth. and there's nothing that would say otherwise as we sit here.
in fact, i want to make another structural point, which i think is relevant to when we're talking three to five years. we think this widespread adoption of remote work is a structural win for us. it's more difficult for clients to recruit remotely, particularly our smbs, which mostly have local footprints. clients want more experience when they're recruiting remotely because they want to minimize the training requirements from their new hires. we can deliver deeper skills, lower price points when we recruit outside local markets, particularly when we're recruiting for clients in large metro areas. our competitive position improves, particularly against our tougher, local and regional firms. we have a national candidate database with local candidate relationships because of our footprint.
our advanced ai matching algorithms provide real-time short lists, not only of local candidates, but national candidates for every single job order we get, we give our internal staff a national selection as well as local. our algos are trained with profiles of our most successful candidates across millions of actual engagements. and furthermore, these multi-state candidate administrative requirements that come with remote work, we access through a mobile app, which is number one rated in the industry, 4.8 out of 5. and we just processed our 1 millionth time record through that app. and quite frankly, our competitors don't have any of that.
and then to add further, if you look at our saas-based internal infrastructure that allows our staff to work remotely, it improves their job satisfaction, their productivity, their income potential, and allows us to balance our workloads across a much broader geographic area. so i would argue that not only do we have the traditional opportunity as business conditions improve, there's this structural shift to hybrid/remote gives us a lot of advantages we haven't traditionally had.
andrew steinerman -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thank you. that was great. appreciate the time.
operator
your next question comes from the line of manav patnaik with barclays.
manav patnaik -- barclays -- analyst
thank you. keith, maybe just some comments around the margins and with this, i guess, faster than expected recovery, should we expect more leverage or kind of the same? just any thoughts there would be appreciated?
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
well, as we look forward, in margins, i'd say, first, let's talk gross margins. on the one hand we're at all-time highs. and by the way, our contract to higher conversions this quarter were 3.4% of revenues, so that was up. but as we look forward, we think there's a upside with those conversions that have been as high as 4%, and that's all operating margin as well as gross margin, but there's also this mix shift to higher skill levels. and mix is our friend. we get higher gross margins as we move up the skill curve. they've been a big part of our margin expansion if you look back 10 years and our appetite to continue to move up that skill curve, if anything is greater, which is a great thing for our future gross margins.
further on the sg&a side, we have new opportunities to leverage. as i just talked about, as our people can fill jobs remotely, they all get more productive. we can leverage our technology spend, which has been significant. we can leverage our field infrastructure, which is now as only now returning back to 2019 levels. so we're bullish as we move forward in time, we can further expand our operating margins for the reasons i just mentioned.
manav patnaik -- barclays -- analyst
and maybe specific to protiviti, just to, how should we think of that given this massive growth helped by the government solutions, and as that comes down, like just the moving pieces there.
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
well, because an ever-growing portion of protiviti is this blended activity with staffing. we frankly think it's best to look at our enterprise margins rather than staffing alone or protiviti alone. and all the comments i just made apply to the enterprise.
manav patnaik -- barclays -- analyst
okay. all right. thank you, keith.

your next question comes from the line of hamzah mazari with jefferies.
ryan gunning -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, this is actually ryan gunning filling in for hamzah. you touched on it a little bit, but could you comment a little more on where you are in your technology journey, the use of ai to mass candidates and your digital footprint in general? and what's behind you and what's yet to come?
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
well, we've had significant accomplishments of the last few years. a, we've got a saas-based salesforce.com front office infrastructure; b, we've adopted workday, not only for our financials, but for payroll and hr, but financials as well. see as we've talked about ai before, we've spent significantly to create what we think is competitive advantage by having our matching engine trained based on the profiles of our most successful candidates based on actual work performance across millions of jobs.
we're further enhancing that by also trying to predict using data, using activity signals, likelihood to engage because predicting fit is important, but predicting fit and likelihood to engage is more than doubly important. so we'll continue to invest there. our mobile app, highly rated, very successful, talked about that. i'd say at 50,000 people we've long talked about this continuum of traditional staffing on the one side, talent platforms, self-service driven on the other with the latter given clients access to our technology, given access to our candidate database, which is second to none for professional level people.
we're still about building out that other side of that continuum. we've made significant progress. we hope in the next few quarters to have at least a minimum viable product ready to go to market there. but our vision is that clients not we should choose how much they want to interact digitally versus how much they want to interact traditionally. and quite frankly, our belief is that while many might first come to us thinking they want to do it digitally self-service, it will ultimately become lead gen as they find that they need more help closing candidates.
and therefore, benefiting the traditional side simply by having the talent marketplace, the self-service solutions that would be principally digital, it would start as all digital. so we feel great about the technology initiatives, the technology spending, the impact that they've had. i can assure you; we've made tens of thousands of placements on a remote basis using this technology that we simply couldn't have done five years ago. so we know it works. we know it's effective. and we strongly believe we can make it even better.
ryan gunning -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you. and then kind of switching over to the competitive landscape. can you just talk about whether you see someone like linkedin being a competitive threat at some point in the future or whether you see it as more complimentary to the business?
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'd say whether it's linkedin, whether it's indeed, whether its other job boards, we've often described them as frenemies. on the one hand, we use them all as part of our sourcing strategy. although, i'll tell you today, we source more candidates directly to our own website than all other digital sources combined. and that's a major movement from what i would have said five years ago.
so sure, we use linkedin. sure, we use indeed. sure, we use some of the other boards. we believe the brand combined with an ai driven outreach program where we invite candidates to apply for all our open positioning drive a lot of traffic straight to us. the numbers speak for themselves as i just described. so linkedin-isn't new linkedin doesn't have new game changing tools. they're one of many sources for us. but as i said, and as we're very proud, the traffic coming directly to us has never been greater and is growing.
ryan gunning -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. thanks.

your next question is from kevin mcveigh with credit suisse.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thank you. hey, congratulations on the results. keith or, mike, the level of beats the last two quarters has been significantly upsized relative to even cash recovery, things like that. i mean, what's been driving the incremental upside relative to the expectations you've been setting at the beginning of the quarter, because again, from leap year perspective, sizable beats. but if you think about that where the puts and takes been against the initial guidance you've been setting particularly against the last two quarters.
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
well, i would say the strength of the recovery has been much greater than expected and much greater than traditionally, because not only do we get the lift we've traditionally gotten as our clients who are lean, get more transaction volume, start new projects and need our help. incremental to that is this higher level of attrition or churn that increases demand. and further this appetite slash need for remote workers makes them less inclined to do it themselves and more inclined to use a third-party and why not america's best professional recruiting firm. and so you've got that traditional tranche of lift. you get early cycle. that's been added to by the higher attrition and the appetite for remote candidates. so it's been a wonderful thing. and we think sustainable.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
and then quick follow-up, keith, the $100 million of government protiviti, how much is that intersegment and revenue side as well?
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
i'd say it's 95% in protiviti, but remember now all of that's not intersegment. the intersegment is the contractor participation on those engagements. there's also protiviti professionals participating on those engagements and there's revenue there. so when we gave you a 100, we've been totally transparent. it's everything.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. and then just, if i could, one more, how much is in the q3 guidance for government?
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
q3 guide government is flat.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you.
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
sequentially flat.
operator
your next question is from tobey sommer with truist securities.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks. could you dig into the factors driving perm is high with such high growth and such a high percent of sales versus temp and maybe specifically, the extent to which your clients looking nationally to recruit is a contributor.
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
well, as i just said, as clients' transaction volumes pick up, because they're starting at a lean point, given what they've gone through as their transaction volumes pick up, they need people. as they start new projects or restart projects that they mothballed, they need new people. they also are having to deal with higher attrition. they need new people. many times they have to look outside the current market or want to look outside the current market either a, for a better price point. so if you're in a big city and you recruit outside of big city, there's usually a cost arbitrage and benefit to the client.
or if you're looking for really deep skills, you can't find locally, you look outside for that. you're more inclined to use a third-party for remote hiring than you are for a local market. so all of those things stack on top of each other, which provide for a wonderful environment for perm. and by the way, temp and contract benefit as well, because many times during the time, it takes to get a full-time person on board. it's a perfect opportunity for temp and contract to sell. hey, we'll give you a person until you make that full time hire. and in fact, we'll give you a person you may fall in love with, and you will want to hire them full time. so there's a nice little network effect.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
okay.
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
and it's the strongest combination we've ever seen. and as i said earlier, we believe this long-term shift to hybrid slash remote structurally positions us better than we've ever been positioned vis-a-vis clients doing it themselves, or going to our local competitors they don't have any of the capabilities or limited capabilities that i talked about earlier.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
right. thank you. with respect to bill rates and what this phenomenon means for them over the course of the cycle, how do you net out this potential labor arbitrage, which would be a decline in bill rate and/or comp whether you're talking about perm or contract and the natural the sort of normal wage inflation and the news that we're seeing with commodities in general inflation fears. how do you net that out when you look at the business over the medium-term?
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
well, we've got a multi-decade history of passing on whatever the wage inflation is for whatever the reason is. and this business about labor arbitrage, driving the desire to go out of market. i don't think our margins get squeezed because if anything, that, that arbitrage spread itself gives us an opportunity to participate in that. so i would argue there's a new opportunity. there's an incremental opportunity for us to expand our margins as we take a bit of that arbitrage margin.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
so i understand, but actually it's the bill rate growth.
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
well, bill rate growth, to the extent, it's muted somewhat by the lower aggregate bill rate. i think you more than make that up by expanding the margin on the arbitrage. so i certainly don't see it as a negative.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
okay. so a big-a bigger margin driver and would you make a different kind of revenue. okay. thank you so much for your help.
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
yes.

your next question comes from gary bisbee with bank of america.
gary bisbee -- bank of america -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. so interesting continued progress to this public sector work. i guess you've talked about the opportunity and pipelines, and obviously it's just been terrific the last few quarters. as you think about that as a segment of work, you've not done a lot in the past. are there any downsides to the public sector as a customer, whether that's visibility, funding cycles, anything particular about the work or the profitability. i understand some of that is either directly or indirectly pandemic related and some of that demand will fade at some point. but other than that, is there anything you'd call out about serving that sector relative to the corporate world, which has been your primary customer base?
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
well, i'd say first of all, for margins, we get normal margins on the public sector work. they're not really higher or they're not really lower. we get normal margins. so that's a good thing. clearly, the contract administration is different and a bit more bureaucratic than we get for a non-public sector work. but we benefit from protiviti having all these gsa schedules, which they've had for a very long time, which were principle used for federal work for protiviti's government services group. we've been able to leverage those for-with state and local groups. so that certainly helps.
but as a client, we find that particularly at the state level, because they don't really compete with each other. they-there's a lot of friendly relationships and a lot of friendly referrals from one state to another state. and so we found that kind of land and expand where you start with the control or upstate a, and you do a good job. they refer you to the controller for state b and so forth. and so if anything, because they're not directly competitive as compared to kind of commercial clients, if you will, where their equivalents would compete with them, they wouldn't refer you to them. it's actually better from that standpoint on the public side, but it's new ground for us. we've been very open about that. but we're optimistic. our clients generally speaking in the public sector are very happy with us, have referred already to us. as i said earlier, our pipeline grew eight-fold in 90 days, in 90 days, it grew eight-fold. and so now the onus is on us to deliver on some of that.
gary bisbee -- bank of america -- analyst
and that dovetails nicely to my follow-up, which is just given how fast revenues has gone and how strong your margins have been. it would seem likely to me that you're going to need to step up sg&a investment meaningfully to sell and serve all this business. i look at temp at all-time high, gross margins, the perm business, the operating margin is in a historical context at a level that rarely has persisted for long. obviously protiviti margins are off the charts. as we think over the next couple of years, if demand stays strong, do you think these profitability levels are sustainable or has your ability to invest not been as quick as the revenues come back such that you'd be more likely to put a lot more money to work and margins might be impacted as you did that.
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
again, as i said earlier, i think the best view is to take an enterprise margin view. and we think we have enterprise margin upside potential. after funding, the sg&a that you described also remember, as i said earlier, with technology, we've learned the last 15 months that we can fill jobs internally from non-local markets, which allows our entire workforce to be more efficient, because we can balance those workloads over a much larger group of people and effectively that's a permanent increase in the productivity level of our people and therefore a permanent reduction and sg&a certainly has a percent of revenue. so, focus on the enterprise. we believe that the operating margins, we just had this quarter, which i think we're at 12.9%, enterprise. we don't think those are peak. we think we have upside. we think we have gross margin upside as the mix continues to gravitate, because it's where we're focused up the scale curve. we think there's gross margin upside, and again, from an enterprise point of view, we think we can leverage the sg&a base from where we are.
gary bisbee -- bank of america -- analyst
great. that's helpful color. glad to hear. thanks.
operator
your next question is from david silver with cl king & associates.
david silver -- cl king & associates -- analyst
yes. hi, thanks very much. so, i had a couple of questions. i think the first one, keith, i was wondering if you could maybe comment on your strategies for your own staff retention. in other words, my recollection is that sometimes the best producers in an industry such as yours maybe take the opportunity during very robust periods or when their marketing marketability is the strongest to either, i don't know, hang up their own shingle or they're susceptible to poaching from some of your competitors. and i asked this, i guess when i think back about a year ago, i think keith, you purposely kind of adopted a very lean staffing strategy at the onset of the pandemic and then were comfortable running with lower staff levels. so, as we reopened here, i mean, how do you think about, the need to kind of retain your best producers to kind of hit your internal targets? thank you.
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
well, pertaining our best producers is everything. and the tenure of our best producers is second to none in the industry by leaps and bounds. and what we've learned in the last 15 months is they place a huge premium on flexibility, the ability to work from home. and so we've extended their individual choice to the end of the year. and we've already announced it'll be hybrid thereafter, hybrid to be defined with as much flexibility for them as we can do. and so we're committed to this new model for their benefit there it helps their job satisfaction. it helps their income levels. they appreciate these technology investments that we're making. it brings more clients; it brings more candidates. it brings national candidates as well as local candidates. i mean, i can't think of a time where our individual recruiters benefit more by being part of our organization then now given the technology investments that we've made. they're making more money, because we are leaner, we have hockey stick shaped incentive plans, where they get a larger and larger share of the incremental gross margin they produce, as they grow their own book of business. so it's a combination of all those things, but i can assure you controlling where they work, given they've proven how productive they can be at home is hugely important in all of the surveys we do with our employee base, which we do often.
david silver -- cl king & associates -- analyst
okay, great. and then last one other question, more philosophically, and it would be about your permanent staffing business. so, two parts, but the first part, just to clarification, but is the quarterly revenue this quarter and the $30 million plus ebit, or are those both all-time quarterly records for your company? and then just to kind of put that in context, when i took a labor economics in college, i mean, we were told that the decision to hire people permanently with something that happens as the economic cycle, let's say matures as opposed to being at an early stage. and to me, second quarter of 2021 we're far from a mature stage of the current economic reopening recovery, rebound, what have you. so, from your perspective, i mean, how would you characterize the current very healthy appetite from your customers for permanent hiring, as opposed to something a more temporary or project-based, and then can you may be project forward to maybe thinking about where perm revenues or perm demand might reach during as this current cycle matures? thank you.
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
well, i'd say first of all, early cycle perm, always outperforms temp or contract. and in fact, the last two cycles it cagr-ed pretty much double what temp or contracted for three and five years. and so what we're seeing from that standpoint is somewhat akin to what we've seen before. i'd say there's so much press every single day about how tight the candidate market, which frankly relates more to the transactional and staff level than across the board, but psychologically it impacts virtually every client. and to the extent the belief is labor is really tight. you want to buy it rather than to lease it for lack of a better way to say it. and there's all the more incentive for them to hire full time. and to remember from a permanent placement standpoint, churn is your friend. and there's a lot of churn as we speak. some of which has pent-up attrition because of there wasn't much in 2020, and as the sun's come out and candidates are more confident, they're making more changes that shows up into the national jones numbers.
david silver -- cl king & associates -- analyst
that's great. that's fine. we're right at the top of the hour. i appreciate the insight. thank you.

your next question is from george tong with goldman sachs.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, thanks. good afternoon. looking across accountemps, officeteam, rh technology, and rh management resources, your revenue performance in 2q 2021 versus 2q 2019 vary quite a bit among the segments. can you perhaps discuss what's driving that variation, namely the decline in accountemps and the growth in management resources, officeteam and technology versus 2q 2019?
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
well, so first of all, let me say that overall on the temp or contract side, where 2% below to q2 2019 on the permanent placement side were 2% above. so, essentially, we've returned to 2019 levels overall. now, our higher skilled divisions, robert half management resources, robert half technology are more project driven, they declined less. they're also more remote work friendly, which is a reason they declined less. so because of they declined less. they've recovered, not quite as quickly as the more transactional divisions, accountemps and officeteam. officeteam has been the largest beneficiary of the public sector work, which is why it's out performed accountemps at that leaves in accountemps with its staffing and transactional level work. that's more on premise, less remote, more impacted, but also recovering more quickly. but i think the bottom line is overall, we're back to 2019 levels and we're growing from there and we're growing quickly.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and historically your gross margins have been approximately 41.5% on a full year basis, based on temp wage trends today in bill pay spreads. when do you believe you'll return to historical gross margins?
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
well, so the gross margins, if we're talking consolidated staffing gross margins, which include tip contract and perm, we're actually higher than that. and so we're not below historical gross margins. so, let's look, first of all, at temp and contract only we were at but 39.7% this quarter that's the highest ever. permanent placement margins are pretty much in line with what they've always been. the mix of perm to the total is higher than it's ever been. so, when you put the two together, we have the highest staffing consolidated, gross margins in our history. and as i just said, we think we have upside from here, primarily as we continue up the skill curve and higher skills are our friend from a margin standpoint. so, today we have our highest gross margins ever, and we think we have upside as we continue to move up the skill mix.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
makes sense. thank you.
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
okay. so that was our last question. we appreciate everyone joining the call. thank you.

operator
hello, and welcome to the robert half second quarter 2021 conference call. our hosts for today's call are mr. keith waddell, president and chief executive officer of robert half, and mr. michael buckley, chief financial officer. mr. waddell, you may begin.
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
hello, everyone. we appreciate your time today. before we get started, i would like to remind you that the comments made on today's call contain forward-looking statements, including predictions and estimates about our future performance. these statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds. however, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. these risks and uncertainties are described in today's press release and our most recent 10-k and 10-q filed with the sec. we assume no obligation to update the statements made on today's call.
during this presentation, we may mention some non-gaap financial measures and reference these figures as, as adjusted. reconciliations and further explanations of these measures are included in a supplemental schedule to our earnings press release. our presentation of revenues and the related growth rates for accountemps, officeteam, robert half technology and robert half management resources includes their intersegment revenues from services provided to protiviti in connection with the company's blended staffing and consulting solutions. this is how we measure and manage these divisions internally. the combined amount of divisional intersegment revenues with protiviti is also separately disclosed. the supplemental schedules just mentioned also include a revenue schedule showing this information for 2019 through 2021. for your convenience, our prepared remarks for today's call are available in the investor center of our website, roberthalf.com.
we achieved record levels of revenues and earnings in the second quarter due to a broad-based, global acceleration in demand for our staffing and business consulting services. we were particularly pleased with the strength of our permanent placement and protiviti operations, which grew year-over-year by 102% and 62%, respectively. protiviti reached its 15th consecutive quarter of revenue gains with very strong growth in each of its solution areas. i am extremely proud of our staffing, protiviti and corporate services professionals who are the key to our success.
companywide revenues were $1.581 billion in the second quarter of 2021, up 43% from last year's second quarter on a reported basis, and up 40% on an as adjusted basis. net income per share in the second quarter was $1.33, increasing 227% compared to $0.41 in the second quarter a year ago. cash flow from operations during the quarter was $165 million. in june, we distributed a $0.38 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record, for a total cash outlay of $42 million. we also acquired approximately 717,000 robert half shares during the quarter, for $63 million. we have 8.4 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan. return on invested capital for the company was 49% in the second quarter.
now, i'll turn the call over to our cfo, mike buckley.
michael buckley -- chief financial officer
thank you, keith, and hello, everyone. as keith noted, global revenues were $1.581 billion in the second quarter. on an as adjusted basis, second quarter staffing revenues were up 33% year-over-year. u.s. staffing revenues were $855 million, up 34% from the prior year. non-u.s. staffing revenues were $267 million, up 31% on a year-over-year basis as adjusted. we have 322 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the united states.
in the second quarter, there were 63.4 billing days, unchanged from the same quarter one year ago. the current third quarter has 64.4 billing days, compared to 64.3 billing days in the third quarter one year ago. currency exchange rate movements during the second quarter had the effect of increasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $24 million. this impacted our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 2.9 percentage points. temporary and consultant bill rates for the quarter increased 3.7% compared to one year ago, adjusted for changes in the mix of revenues by line of business, currency and country. this rate for q1 2021 was 3.4%.
now, let's take a closer look at results for protiviti. global revenues in the second quarter were $459 million. $366 million of that is from business within the united states, and $93 million is from operations outside the united states. on an as adjusted basis, global second quarter protiviti revenues were up 59% versus the year ago period, with u.s. protiviti revenues up 63%. non-u.s. revenues were up 43% on an as adjusted basis. exchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year protiviti revenues by $8 million and increasing its year-over-year reported growth rate by 2.8 percentage points. protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 28 countries.
moving on to sg&a presentation. we remind you that changes in the company's deferred compensation obligations are classified as sg&a or, in the case of protiviti, costs of services, with completely offsetting changes in the related trust investment assets classified separately below sg&a. previously they were both classified as sg&a. our historical discussion of consolidated operating income has been replaced with the non-gaap measure of combined segment income. this is calculated as consolidated income before income taxes, adjusted for interest income and amortization of intangible assets.
for your convenience, we've included a supplemental schedule to today's earnings release on page 7, highlighting the impact of changes in the deferred compensation accounts to the summary of operations for the second quarter of 2021 and 2020. this is a non-gaap disclosure, so we also show a reconciliation to gaap.
turning now to gross margin. in our temporary and consultant staffing operations, second quarter gross margin was 39.7% of applicable revenues, compared to 37.1% of applicable revenues in the second quarter one year ago. our permanent placement revenues in the second quarter were 12.8% of consolidated staffing revenues, versus 8.6% of consolidated staffing revenues in the same quarter one year ago.
when combined with temporary and consultant gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 490 basis points compared to the year-ago second quarter, to 47.4%. for protiviti, gross margin was 29.1% of protiviti revenues, compared to 23.4% of protiviti revenues one year ago. adjusted for the effect of deferred compensation expense related to changes in the underlying trust investment assets as previously mentioned, adjusted gross margin for protiviti was 30% for the quarter just ended versus 25.7% one year ago.
transitioning to selling, general and administrative costs, company sg&a costs were 30.9% of global revenues in the second quarter, compared to 36.7% in the same quarter one year ago. changes in deferred compensation obligations related to increases in underlying trust investments had the impact of increasing sg&a as a percent of revenue by 1.5% in the current second quarter and increasing sg&a by 3.8% in the same quarter one year ago. when adjusted for these changes, companywide sg&a costs were 29.4% for the quarter just ended, compared to 32.9% one year ago.
staffing sg&a costs were 38.4% of staffing revenues in the second quarter, versus 44.2% in the second quarter of 2020. included in staffing sg&a costs was deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets of 2.1% in the second quarter, compared to an expense of 5.1% related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets in the same quarter one year ago.
when adjusted for these changes, staffing sg&a costs were 36.3% percent for the quarter just ended, compared to 39.1% one year ago. second quarter sg&a costs for protiviti were 12.5% of protiviti revenues, compared to 15.1% of revenues in the year-ago period. operating income for the quarter was $177 million. this includes $28 million of deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets. combined segment income was therefore $205 million in the second quarter.
combined segment margin was 12.9%. second quarter segment income from our staffing divisions was $125 million, with a segment margin of 11.1%. segment income for protiviti in the second quarter was $80 million, with a segment margin of 17.4%. our second quarter tax rate was 27%, compared to 20% one year ago. the comparative rate in 2020 was lower than normal due to adjustments made to the estimates of the pandemic impact on the 2020 tax rate. at the end of the second quarter, accounts receivable were $908 million, and implied days sales
outstanding or dso was 51.6 days.
before we move to third quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the second quarter and so far in july, all adjusted for currency and billing days. our temporary and consultant staffing divisions exited the second quarter with june revenues up 34% versus the prior year, compared to a 27% increase for the full quarter. revenues for the first two weeks of july were up 35% compared to the same period one year ago.
permanent placement revenues in june were up 83% versus june of 2020. this compares to a 97% increase for the full quarter. for the first three weeks in july, permanent placement revenues were up 83% compared to the same period in 2020. we provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we saw during the second quarter and into july. as you know, these are very brief time periods of time. we caution against reading too much into them.
with that in mind, we offer the following third quarter guidance. revenue $1.61 billion to $1.69 billion. income per share $1.35 to $1.45. the midpoint of our guidance implies new all-time high revenue and eps levels for the company. midpoint revenues of $1.65 billion are 37% higher than 2020 and 5% higher than 2019 levels on an as adjusted basis. midpoint eps of $1.40 is 110% higher than 2020 and 39% higher than 2019. the major financial assumptions underlying the midpoint of these estimates are as follows; revenue growth on a year-over-year basis; staffing up 33% to 35%; protiviti up 46% to 48%; overall up 36% to 38%.
gross margin percentage, temporary and consultant staffing, 39% to 40%. protiviti, 29% to 31%. overall, 41% to 43%. sg&a as percent of revenues, excluding deferred compensation investment impacts: staffing, 35% to 36%; protiviti, 12% to 13%; overall, 29% to 30%.
segment income for staffing, 10% to 11%; protiviti, 17% to 18%; overall, 12% to 13%. a tax rate up 26% to 27% and shares outstanding 111.5 million. 2021 capital expenditures and capitalized cloud computing costs, $65 to $75 million, with $15 million to $20 million incurred during the third quarter.
we limit our guidance to one quarter. all estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our sec filings.
now, i'll turn the call back over to keith.
keith waddell -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, mike. our staffing results continue to reflect a faster pace of recovery than we've experienced in the past. clients have lean staff levels as they begin to expand, which is exacerbated by generally higher levels of attrition. also, as they look remotely to fill their needs, clients are elevating the experience requirements for their job openings, which further adds to the demand for our services. the recovery is also very broad-based and spans across industries, client size, skill levels, geographies, and lines of business.
the national federation of independent business, nfib, recently reported that 56% of small businesses had few or no qualified applicants for open positions, and 46% had job openings that could not be filled. this speaks well of the ongoing demand environment.
protiviti's multiyear record of consecutive growth continues to benefit from a highly diversified suite of solution offerings and client base. blended solutions with staffing pair protiviti's world-class consulting talent with staffing's deep operational resources to provide a cost-effective solution to clients' skills and scalability needs. protiviti has also benefited from project work in the public sector resulting from various federal and state stimulus programs. approximately $100 million in revenue this quarter resulted from work related to these programs, or approximately $0.07 of our earnings per share.
growth in this public sector business contributed 32 points to protiviti's year-on-year growth rate of 62%, while the core business accelerated to a growth rate of 30%. core growth was strong across internal audit, technology consulting, risk and compliance consulting, and business process improvement with internal audit showing the most acceleration. public sector revenues represent 6% of total revenues and contributed 8 points to the company's overall 40%
growth rate.
a year ago, the world faced an uncertain future with extraordinary challenges ahead. along the way we have continued to invest in our tenured, high performing workforce. we also strengthened our investments in advanced ai technologies, enabling our professionals to help clients with critical talent and consulting needs and find solutions across broad resource pools. as a result, we closed the quarter with an employee base that is more engaged and productive than ever, with all-time high revenues, and strong momentum leading into the second half.
bolstered by the strengths of our brands, our people, our technology and our professional business model, we are excited about the continued ability to find meaningful and exciting employment for the people we place and provide clients access to the specialized talent they need to grow and the deep subject matter expertise they need to confidently compete in a dynamic world.
finally, we'd like to thank our employees for making possible another significant recognition received this quarter, as forbes named us america's best professional recruiting firm.
now, mike and i would be happy to answer your questions. please ask just one question and a single follow-up, as needed. if there's time, we'll come back to you for additional questions.

[operator instructions] and our first question comes from the line of andrew steinerman, jpmorgan.
andrew steinerman -- jpmorgan -- analyst
keith, could you just look at the fourth quarter guide with us on the staffing revenue side, up 27% to 30%? could you just break it down a little bit for us to give a sense of that fourth quarter guide of how much might flex revenues be versus perm? and then within flex, which sub-segments might grow faster than the average?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, andrew, we historically don't break out flex or contract versus perm. i think it would be logical to assume we would have perm continuing to outgrow contract consistent with the quarter, consistent with the exit of the quarter and consistent with the post-quarter start to the quarter that we're in. generally speaking, our higher-level contract practice groups or line of businesses are growing more quickly. they're project-based. the clients are more open to remote work.
they're more interested in pinpointing deeper skills that we can access through remote work. so not that, they all aren't growing, which they are, it's just that management resources and robert technology are growing faster. you can also see that, if you would compare quarter three revenues to quarter three of 2019, which is pre-pandemic, and you'll see that management resources and robert half technology have done better than the other divisions for all the reasons i just mentioned.
andrew steinerman -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question will come from the line of mark marcon with baird.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, mike and keith, and congratulations on a terrific quarter. i was wondering, if you could talk a little bit more about protiviti in the guidance. if we take the midpoint of the guidance, it looks like perhaps we might have a slight sequential decline in q4 relative to q3. and we've had that before in 2015 and 2016 in terms of going from q3 to q4.
so not a big deal, but it seems like there's probably some differences going on with regards to sequential trends on the government and public side relative to the private, with the private seeming to accelerate sequentially this last quarter. so i was wondering, if you could talk a little bit about that. like, what are you seeing on-how are you thinking about public versus private in protiviti as we go through the near term?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
okay. so we've got public versus private, and we've got a holiday impact to talk about. so first of all, let's talk a little bit about public. we disclosed $110 million overall. of that $110 million, $92 million relate to contractors. so-whereas the $172 million total for blended solution contractors, $92 million of that relates to public sector, which is just a little over half.
our expectation is that for the fourth quarter, that $92 million is down 5% to 10% sequentially in the fourth quarter; the balance of the $172 million, if you will, the other half. and again, while we're talking sequentially, in the third quarter, sequentially, about 80% of the growth in blended solutions overall came from commercial or non-public sector engagements. and so rather than focus just on the public sector half of our blended solutions, let's think about the whole and the other half, which is nonpublic sector engagements was 80% of the sequential growth.
now as we roll into q4, as i said earlier, we do expect some moderation, 5% to 10%, as unemployment claims processing moderates. on the other hand, housing and education assistance is growing. we do have a backlog of project work that's not transactional. they tend to be smaller projects, the sales cycle somewhat longer. so all of that was figured in when i said we expect down 5% to 10% for the half. that is public sector only.
the other point i will make is that many of protiviti's clients have a soft close in the fourth quarter. many of protiviti's internal staff take paid time off during the fourth quarter. and so just for time, they expect related to those two, there's a $14 million sequential revenue impact. and so we've talked many times about december. it's our hardest month to project, both on the staffing side as well as on the protiviti side because of the impact of downtime, holiday, vacation, whatever you want to call it, soft closes from clients.
but protiviti alone, with their own staff, projects that their revenue impact would be $14 million sequentially from that alone. and so we've been talking about sequentially, but if we talk about year-on-year, protiviti's comps were the toughest a year ago. much of that was public sector. together with the impact of soft close, paid time off, i think you get to where our projection is for our midpoint.
i'll also say this. protiviti's, the tone of protiviti's business has never been better. they are aggressively hiring people across their pyramid, meaning managing directors all the way down to consultants. so their issue is not, in any way, shape or form, demand. it's how quickly can they hire and onboard additional staff. the demand environment, frankly, has rarely been better than what protiviti sees today.
mark marcon -- baird -- analyst
okay. keith, that's great color. and then wondering, you did see that really strong sequential growth in the commercial side. and protiviti has been clearly ramping up with multiple commercial clients, including -- i think you're dealing with 70% of the fortune 500 now. wondering if you can talk a little bit about your expectations a little bit beyond just the current quarter on the commercial versus the government side. and also, what does the new delivery center in the americas mean as we think about the impact there?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, as i said earlier, 80% of our sequential growth in contractor blended solutions came from the commercial side, not the public sector side, such that now they're about 50/50 when you look at their impact overall. you have projects like accounting operation, processing backlogs, transformation, on-demand project management, erp implementation assistance, it operations modernization, help desk management. there are just a myriad of accounting and it related project demand that are a glove fit for the blended solutions of staffing and protiviti.
the delivery center is intended to be a space -- it's in ohio. that's a lower cost base where -- and it's also in a lower cost of living area. and the thought is the more routine assignments that we have, to some degree can be performed, can be delivered from that alternative delivery center, which is just one more alternative that protiviti has and another price-point choice that protiviti can provide to its clients. it's all good news, all good, early days. it's already doing better than we expected.
operator
thank you. and our next question will come from the line of hamzah mazari with jefferies.
mario cortellacci -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. this is mario cortellacci filling in for hamzah. i guess, maybe you can just touch on how you're thinking about labor availability and labor inflation, i guess, specifically and how that's being contemplated in your guide -- in your revenue guide and your margin guide?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
i'd say as to labor availability, we would say that candidate supply is manageably tight. we've successfully recruited at much lower unemployment rates. the current rate for those with a college degree of 2.5% is still well north of the high ones we got back in 2018, 2019 as an example. further, our ability to recruit beyond local markets meaningfully expands the candidate pool. we've taken full advantage of this, particularly in management resources and robert half technology. we have a very large percentage of our placements being sourced from people outside the local market where the client is.
further, as we've talked about before, we hire people full-time and then send them out on assignments as contractors to clients, which is another way we address candidate availability. but when you put all those together, we're cautiously optimistic that we're not going to have a supply issue as it relates to meeting demand. from an inflation standpoint, we're in the mid-5 level. that's not unusual in the early part of a cycle. we have a multi-decade track record of passing through our wage inflation.
if anything, wage inflation is our friend because we expand our gross margins. as we talked about earlier in mike's section, we have expanded our gross margins, again both sequentially and year-on-year. part of that is conversions, which rose to 3.7% of revenue. and part of that's pay-bill spreads that have widened as well in the presence of that wage inflation. so again, wage inflation is our friend. we think we can manage availability.
mario cortellacci -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. and then i mean you just mentioned the cycle a little bit. so, maybe you can just update us on what your view is of the employment cycle in the us versus international. and then you've said it before and i think you obviously just mentioned again that we're starting a brand-new cycle. how are you seeing the impact to your customer base in this new cycle? but given the new supply chain issues, is it really not an issue for you at all because it's more of a blue-collar issue than a white-collar issue? but any color you can provide there would be helpful.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, so us versus international, we've had very good results from germany, canada, united kingdom, australia, just to name a few. the growth rates aren't that different between the us and what we call iz. so i'm not sure there's a huge story there to -- our iz is a little more perm-focused than is the case in the us. and as perm outperforms contract or temp, that's to their benefit and our benefit. we do think it's a brand-new cycle. we have talked about once we get going, we cagr very nice double-digit growth rates for three to five years. we gave you the numbers earlier that five quarters into this recovery, our cumulative growth off the bottom is almost double this time what it was last. so we are bullish.
the other thing that's new that we talked about as well was this whole remote hybrid, the future of work. the combination of our global network, our local candidate relationships, our technology which can be location-agnostic when we decide who the best fitting candidates are for a given assignment. so we feel good about the cycle. we feel good about the incremental growth opportunities we have particularly with remote work that's in addition to the early cycle success we always have.
mario cortellacci -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you so much.
operator
your next question will come from the line of jeff silber with bmo capital markets.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you so much. i wanted to go back to the issue about the tight labor market. can you talk a little bit about how fill rates are tracking compared to either when you mentioned that the unemployment rate for college graduates were in the high 1% or a normal environment? i'm just wondering if it's more difficult even in this environment and even though you're managing it.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
no. i'm not sure it's more difficult. and the fact that we've got the new lever to recruit remotely, the fact that we're more willing than ever to hire professionals full-time and put them on the bench, if you will, also relieves some of that pressure. so the combination of all of those things and the fact that we aren't even back to 2018, '19 unemployment levels, all taken together, we think the labor -- the tight labor market is manageable from the standpoint of our supply.
it's at the transactional level, accounting operations, technology operations. clients are more apt for them to want them to be on site. for the higher-level management resources, for tech developers, database administrators, they're more inclined or more accepting of remote roles there. so it makes it easier for us with the latter than with the former. candidates actually want a premium today if you want them to be on site. and many clients will pay that. some won't.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yes. and actually, that's a good segue to my next question. just in terms of the overall market, you mentioned about 5.5% billing rate increases. are you seeing any client pushback in that area?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
so there's always some client pushback. and our people would tell you that one of the things they always have to deal with is a candidate's perspective on the labor market versus a client's perspective on the labor market. but it's helpful that virtually, every day in the news, there's some story about how tight the labor market is and how many unfilled jobs there are and how much attrition there is. and all of those make it easier for our staff to convince our clients that they need to pay, but it's just human nature that there's always some pushback.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. that's fair enough. thanks so much.
operator
our next question will come from the line of kevin mcveigh with credit suisse.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great, thanks so much. and congratulations on the results. keith, with one number question and then just one a little more relative to the cycle, can you just remind us what conversions were in the quarter?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. so conversions were 3.7% of revenue in the quarter. that's up a few basis points from last quarter. remember, we've been 4% and higher in the past. so we don't think we peak to 3.7%, and there's some margin upside there.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
that's helpful. and then, keith, it's been such a tricky cycle in terms of how quickly it decelerated and then the reacceleration. and i know no two cycles are the same, but do you think there's any pull forward of demand, not to say that it's not going to be a normal cycle, but do you think there's been any pull forward of demand? and maybe in the outer years, the sequencing may be not as robust? or do you think we continue to kind of build on just the good momentum you've had so far?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, we're now five quarters from trough and we've grown twice as quickly as we've done in the past. as i said earlier, we think this remote hybrid work, the future of work, improves our competitive position significantly. our clients themselves have a much harder time recruiting for their own account remotely. our competitors that, by and large, are local and regional don't have the office network, don't have the local candidate relationships, don't have the technology. and so we're very bullish, and we're very pleased at the investments we've made in network, in people, in technology. all come together in a beneficial way for us vis-a-vis our competitors as we move forward, which make us very bullish as we move forward in this cycle.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
makes a kind of sense. thank you.
operator
our next question will come from the line of gary bisbee with bank of america securities.
gary bisbee -- bank of america securities -- analyst
hey thanks. i guess i wanted to go back to the public sector for a second. when you first began discussing this, i guess, over a year ago, the initial focus was on the pandemic created these opportunities and you've alluded a couple of times. do you think that the relationships you see are creating maybe non-pandemic, longer-term, more durable opportunities? can you just give us any color on that? like what's the mix of stuff that you think is pretty much directly pandemic-related versus not? or how do the pipelines longer term -- and i'm obviously not asking about q4 but thinking into '22 or over time as you think about that opportunity? thank you.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
so the $92 million in contract were -- this quarter, that's a piece of the $172 million in total blended solutions, is largely pandemic-related. there's very little non-pandemic-related in there, and it's principally split between unemployment and housing. as we move forward, we have education coming on. that will be very helpful. that, we're very bullish about. and it's much more distributed by local school district, and we have hundreds upon hundreds of pre-existing relationships with local school districts.
but as it relates to non-pandemic assignments with the same pandemic state clients, we have talked about how the backlog has increased dramatically. it increased again this quarter. the sales cycle is different and longer. the procurement process is different. for the pandemic work, we did it pursuant to emergency authorizations, which were quick. for the non-pandemic work, you do it pursuant to blanket purchase agreements. we're happy to report we've secured those for multiple states, including in our largest state client, where we just got a blanket purchase agreement for it support, virtually anything it-related.
so it's early days. the sales cycle is longer. we're bullish that over time, we will net add because of those relationships. but my other point is let's not just focus on the half of our blended solutions that's public sector. let's also focus on the other half, and that other half was 80% of our sequential growth during the third quarter. public sector was 20% of our sequential growth for this quarter.
so let's think about both halves, not just the public sector half. as we said, we expect a modest fourth quarter decline, 5% to 10% in public sector. for 2022, we expect further modest declines. we do not expect a cliff decline in public sector across 2022. and then if we go to that other half of blended solutions, it's growing nicely, very nicely.
gary bisbee -- bank of america securities -- analyst
that's helpful, and i agree. that's a great story. i guess the follow-up, you said the last few quarters that, especially in the staffing businesses, you have some good capacity. but i just wanted to get an update on that given the continued robust growth. how are you thinking about ramping up hiring in those businesses? you clearly said you're doing that aggressively in protiviti today, but any update on your staffing business?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
sure. i'd say, we have the least capacity and are the most aggressive adding to staff and permanent placement. the growth rates speak for themselves. the cumulative progress off the trough speaks for itself. so we're aggressively adding permanent placement recruiters as we speak. we're also adding recruiters to this full-time contractor segment where we hire people full-time. we put them out as contractors.
that's something where we get very good margins, where we go up the skill curve in our accounting operations groups. and so we're being very aggressive there. we do still have some capacity in the other temporary contract practice groups lines of business, if you will. and so it will still be a quarter or two before we add to that head count. but when you put all the adds together, it's not going to be disproportionate to the revenue growth. so i wouldn't expect negative leverage. it will just be -- it will be just less positive leverage.
gary bisbee -- bank of america securities -- analyst
great. thanks.
operator
your next question comes from the line of tobey sommer with truist securities.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you. with respect to bill rates and sort of wage inflation, how do you expect that to unfold this cycle versus history? is there -- are there any key differences that you've cited and/or expect that would cause you to have a different expectation than normal?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, there's this whole transitory, not transitory argument that i don't have any better insight than any other person would have. typically, for us, for a three to five-year period, we would see mid-single-digit wage inflation that we would pass through and, in fact, expand our margins a bit. the only thing that's new this time that makes for interesting thought is this notion that we're going to place non-local candidates into local clients. and some of that's done as a labor arbitrage, better price point. other times, it's done so you can get a more pinpointed, deeper skill.
but potentially, that could take some pressure off wage inflation. but again, wage inflation is our friend. it's not something we fear, and we'll let the game come to us. but typically, for three to five years, early cycle -- early to mid-cycle, we see single-digit -- mid-single-digit wage inflation.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you. and then, my follow-up question is -- you answered, sort of, are we having any pull forward on the revenue side, and that was clear. in terms of the margin in a normal cycle, is there any difference in the way the social costs kind of dampened gross margins typically during a recession and for a while and over time, that's alleviated, contributing to ebitda margin expansion at the firm? anything different this time versus what might have happened in recent cycles?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, so this is a little esoteric. so bear with me. in prior down cycles, as unemployment claims for people that work temporary/contract for us, their claims got charged to our account. on a three-year look-back period, that then formed the basis for elevated charges to us for the next three to five years. what's different this time is that, for states to get federal assistance, they had to agree not to charge unemployment claims to specific company accounts. instead, it went into the general account. so the million-dollar question is, are we going to be better off or not to be part of the general pool only, rather than being primarily accountable to the individual claims of our former contract employees?
and as i sit here today, my sense is, it's going to be a little better, but it's never happened before. and the leisure, hospitality has been the lion's share of the unemployment, that's gone into that general pool. so we would share in that. so the good news is, we won't have to pay for our own claims. the not-as-good news is we're going to have to share in the leisure hospitality claims that are in the general pool. so i said it was going to be esoteric, and i've now just proven it. but it was a long-winded way of saying, i think it's going to be better, but i don't think it's going to be dramatically different.
tobey sommer -- truist securities -- analyst
that's helpful. i appreciate your answer.
operator
the next question will come from the line of george tong with goldman sachs.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, teams, good afternoon. supply chain disruptions have had a negative impact on multiple verticals, including many of the verticals that robert half serves. are there any signals that you're seeing that suggest there could be a shock to client demand perhaps further down the line?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, i'd say clearly, the supply chain disruptions have been most acute to manufacturing. we're not exposed to that vertical. in fact, our two biggest verticals, as we've talked before, are financial services and professional services. so george, there's nothing that would leave us -- lead us to believe there's some black swan shock because of supply chain as it relates to our client base.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. got it. you mentioned that protiviti declines next year should be relatively gradual, not a cliff. does that assume that the public sector work at -- in protiviti specifically as it relates to covid, some measure of it continues into 2022? is that baked into your assumption?
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
well, first of all, let me be clear. i did not say we expect protiviti overall to decline in 2022. i said the public sector portion of protiviti, which is half of 1/3 of their revenues, i'm saying that would decline modestly, which means some of the unemployment claims processing support, some of the housing rental assistance support would continue into 2022.
further, this educational assistance that's been coming on strong the last few months, that also continues into 2022, such that our current thinking is for all of 2022 for the public sector portion only of protiviti that it would be down modestly, 5% to 10%. but the rest of protiviti is growing quite well. the demand environment has rarely been better, and they are aggressively adding to staff all the way from new college grads to mds because of the robustness of that demand environment. so we absolutely expect protiviti overall year-on-year to grow nicely.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. i was referring to the public sector piece of protiviti. apologies for the confusion. and just to be clear, the part that is public sector that you expect a moderate decline, so you don't expect the public sector to completely go away.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
that's correct. my word was...
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's simply because you expect some lingering...
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
right. no cliff decline, no severe decline. it would modestly decline. and again...
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
that's -- we might surprise ourselves to the upside to the extent we get traction with this non-pandemic-related work with those states. it could be better. and our earlier point as well as -- let's not forget about the other half of our blended solutions. public sector is half of the 34%. there's the other half of that 34% that has nothing to do with public sector and has nothing to do with pandemic.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thank you.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
okay. operator, i think that was our last question. thanks, everyone, for joining.

the supplemental schedules just mentioned also include a revenue schedule showing this information for 2019 through 2021. for your convenience, our prepared remarks for today's call are available in the investor center of our website, roberthalf.com. we once again achieved a record level of both revenues and earnings in the third quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance and as a result of continued broad-based acceleration in the demand for our staffing and business consulting services.
our permanent placement and protiviti operations continued to show very strong results, growing year-over-year revenues by 79% and 56%, respectively. our temporary and consultant staffing operations also accelerated in the quarter with year-on-year revenue growth of 35%. overall, our total revenues were 10% higher than the pre-pandemic third quarter of 2019. i'm very grateful for the notable efforts of our staffing, protiviti and corporate services professionals who've continued to show an outstanding commitment to our success.
companywide revenues were $1.17 billion in the third quarter of 2021, up 44% from last year's third quarter on a reported basis and up 43% on an as-adjusted basis. net income per share in the third quarter was $1.53, increasing 129% compared to $0.67 in the third quarter one year ago. cash flow from operations during the quarter was $225 million.
in september, we distributed a $0.38 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record for a total cash outlay of $42 million. we also acquired approximately 740,000 robert half shares during the quarter for $75 million. we have 7.7 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan. return on invested capital for the company was 53% for the third quarter.
now i'll turn the call over to our cfo, mike buckley.
michael c. buckley -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, keith, and hello, everyone. as keith noted, global revenues were $1.713 billion in the third quarter. on an as-adjusted basis, third quarter staffing revenues were up 38% year-over-year. u.s. staffing revenues were $932 million, up 40% from the prior year. non-u.s. staffing revenues were $279 million, up 34% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis. we have 321 staffing locations worldwide, including 85 locations in 17 countries outside the united states. in the third quarter, there were 64.4 billing days compared to 64.3 in the same quarter one year ago.
the current fourth quarter has 61.7 billing days, unchanged from the fourth quarter one year ago. currency exchange rate movements during the third quarter had the effect of increasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $7 million. this impacted our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 0.8 percentage points. temporary and consultant bill rates for the quarter increased 5.4% compared to one year ago, adjusted for changes in the mix of revenues by line of business, currency and country.
this rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 3.7%. now let's take a closer look at results for protiviti. global revenues in the third quarter were $501 million. $400 million of this is from business within the united states, and $101 million is from operations outside the united states. on an as-adjusted basis, global third quarter protiviti revenues were up 55% versus the year ago period, with u.s. protiviti revenues up 54%. non-u.s. revenues were up 61% on an as-adjusted basis.
exchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year protiviti revenues by $3 million and increasing its year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.7 percentage points. protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 28 countries. moving on to sg&a and gross margin presentation. we remind you that changes in the company's deferred compensation obligations are classified as sg&a or, in the case of protiviti, cost of services with completely offsetting changes in the related trust investment assets classified separately below sg&a.
previously, they were both classified as sg&a. our historical discussion of consolidated operating income has been replaced with the non-gaap measure of combined segment income. this is calculated as consolidated income before income taxes, adjusted for interest income and amortization of intangible assets. for your convenience, we've included a supplemental schedule to today's earnings release on page seven, highlighting the impact of changes in the deferred compensation accounts to the summary of operations for the third quarter of 2021 and 2020.
this is a non-gaap disclosure. so we also show a reconciliation to gaap. turning now to gross margin. in our temporary and consultant staffing operations, third quarter gross margin was 40% of applicable revenues compared to 37.5% of applicable revenues in the third quarter one year ago. gross margins were positively impacted by expanding pay-bill spreads and higher conversion revenues. our permanent placement revenues in the third quarter were 12.9% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 10% of consolidated staffing revenues in the same quarter one year ago.
when combined with temporary and consultant gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 3.9 percentage points compared to the year ago third quarter to 47.7%. for protiviti, gross margin was 29.5% of protiviti revenues compared to 27.1% of protiviti revenues one year ago. adjusted for the effect of deferred compensation changes related to changes in the underlying trust investment assets as previously mentioned, adjusted gross margin for protiviti was 29.4% for the quarter just ended compared to 28.1% one year ago.
companywide sg&a costs were 28.9% of global revenues in the third quarter compared to 32.8% in the same quarter one year ago. changes in deferred compensation obligations related to changes in underlying trust investments had the impact of decreasing sg&a as a percentage of revenue by 0.1% in the current third quarter and increasing sg&a by 1.9% in the same quarter one year ago. when adjusted for these changes, companywide sg&a costs were 29% for the quarter just ended compared to 30.9% one year ago.
staffing sg&a costs were 35.9% of staffing revenues in the third quarter versus 40.2% in the third quarter of 2020. included in staffing sg&a costs were deferred compensation reductions related to decreases in the underlying trust investment assets of 0.1% in the third quarter compared to additions of 2.6% related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets in the same quarter one year ago. when adjusted for these changes, staffing sg&a costs were 36% for the quarter just ended compared to 37.6% one year ago.
third quarter sg&a cost for protiviti were 12.1% of protiviti revenues compared to 13% of revenues in the one year ago period. operating income for the quarter was $230 million. this includes $2 million of deferred compensation reductions related to changes in the underlying trust investment assets. combined segment income was therefore $228 million in the third quarter. combined segment margin was 13.3%. third quarter segment income from our staffing divisions was $141 million with a segment margin of 11.6%. segment income for protiviti in the third quarter was $87 million with a segment margin of 17.3%.
our third quarter tax rate was 25% compared to 26% one year ago. at the end of the third quarter, accounts receivable were $1 billion and implied days sales outstanding were 52.8 days. before we move on to fourth quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the third quarter and so far in october, all adjusted for currency and billing days. our temporary and consultant staffing divisions exited the third quarter with september revenues up 36% versus the prior year compared to a 34% increase for the full quarter.
revenues for the first two weeks of october were up 35% compared to the same period one year ago. permanent placement revenues in september were up 68% versus september of 2020. this compares to a 78% increase for the full quarter. for the first three weeks in october, permanent placement revenues were up 62% compared to the same period in 2020. we provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we saw during the third quarter and into october. but as you know, these are very brief time periods. we caution against reading too much into them.
with that in mind, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: revenues, $1.655 billion to $1.735 billion; income per share, $1.37 to $1.47. midpoint revenues of $1.695 billion are 30% higher than 2020 and 10% higher than 2019 levels on an as-adjusted basis. midpoint earnings per share of $1.42 is 69% higher than 2020 and 44% higher than 2019. the major financial assumptions underlying the midpoint of these estimates are as follows. revenue growth on a year-over-year basis: staffing, up 27% to 30%; protiviti, up 34% to 36%; overall, up 29% to 31%.
gross margin percentages: temporary and consultant staffing, 39.5% to 40.5%; protiviti, 27% to 29%; overall, 41% to 43%. sg&a as a percentage of revenue, excluding deferred compensation investment impacts: staffing, 35.5% to 36.5%; protiviti, 12.5% to 13.5%; overall, 29% to 30%. segment income: for staffing, 11% to 12%; for protiviti, 14.5% to 15.5%; overall, 12% to 13%.
tax rate, 25% to 26%. shares, 111.2 million. 2021 capital expenditures and capitalized computing costs, $15 million to $20 million for the fourth quarter. we limit our guidance to one quarter. all estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our sec filings.
now i'll turn the call back over to keith.
m. keith waddell -- vice chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, mike. the future of work increasingly includes flexible, hybrid and fully remote models, and we are uniquely positioned to benefit in this environment. we can deliver deeper skills and more price-point choices to our clients by expanding our candidate searches beyond local markets. we leverage our global office network and our advanced ai-driven technologies to deliver the best candidates for contract or permanent roles regardless of location, all while continuing to deliver the same superior customer experience our clients have come to expect.
this trend, together with elevated employee attrition rates at clients, has contributed to our staffing results recovering at a faster pace than we've experienced in the past. our permanent placement and temporary consulting staffing segments, including blended solutions with protiviti, have achieved cumulative sequential growth of 92% and 50%, respectively, during the first five quarters since the trough. similar numbers for the financial crisis and the dot-com recoveries were 41% and 23%, and 45% and 31%, respectively.
the national federation of independent business, nfib, recently reported that 62% of small businesses had few or no qualified applicants for open positions and had 51% job openings that could not be filled, a 48-year record high. and we are seeing the impact of this on demand for our services on a very broad basis, spanning industries, client size, skill levels, geographies and lines of business. protiviti continues to excel with multiple years of consecutive growth and a highly diversified client base and suite of solution offerings.
the collaboration between protiviti and staffing continues to be a strong differentiator, pairing protiviti's world-class consulting talent with staffing's deep operational resources to provide a cost-effective solution to clients' skills and scalability needs. growth remains strong across internal audit, technology consulting, risk and compliance consulting, and business performance improvement. protiviti also continues to benefit from project work in the public sector resulting from various federal and state stimulus programs.
approximately $110 million in revenue this quarter resulted from work related to these programs or approximately $0.07 of our earnings per share. growth in the public sector contributed 26 points to protiviti's year-on-year growth rate of 56%, while the core business maintained a growth rate of 30%. public sector revenues represent 6% of total revenues and contributed seven points to the company's overall 44% growth rate. we're excited about the opportunities ahead of us as the recovery continues with strong momentum and as the future of work continues to evolve.
as we've done historically, we will continue to invest in our people, our technology, our brands and our business model to strengthen our ability to connect people to meaningful new work and to provide clients with the talent and deep subject matter expertise they need to confidently compete and grow. finally, we'd like to thank our employees around the world for making possible another significant recognition received this quarter as forbes named us one of the world's best employers. we were also recognized by newsweek as one of america's most responsible companies for our esg efforts, many of which are outlined in our recently released corporate citizenship report. now mike and i'd be happy to answer your questions. please ask just one question and a single follow-up as needed.
if there's time, we'll come back to you for additional questions.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of mark marcon from r. w. baird and co. your line is open.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
good afternoon. i was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the divergence between the international trends relative to the domestic trends that is contrary to kind of the narrative that's out there in terms of international slowing. and i imagine it's primarily germany and belgium, but would love to hear a little more commentary with regards to that and in particular, with regards to the strength in protiviti international, which was a lot stronger than what we were looking for.
keith waddell -- vice chairman, president, and chief financial officer
ok. iz versus domestic trends, while there was some slowing in europe, it was slowing from a very high base with very tough comps. we still had double-digit growth in the international zone, which actually exceeded the growth rate in the u.s. so we're still doing quite well internationally.
as we've talked about for many quarters, we were led by germany, belgium. more recently, canada and australia have participated nicely. as to protiviti, internationally, it's been very strong in europe. it's strong in australia.
this quarter, it was also very strong in canada. the interesting thing and the very nice thing, not only protiviti international, protiviti u.s. as well, is how broad-based across their solution offerings it is. it's internal audit, it's technology consulting, cyber privacy.
it's also risk and compliance and financial services. so it's very broad-based by solution offering, and that's true both in the united states and in the u.s. as we talked about last quarter, we transferred some accounts that previously were in management resources on the staffing side, to protiviti that gets adjusted for in the pro forma non-gaap analysis that we provide. but absent that, protiviti's growth rates are also quite strong.
and i will add that in the international zone for protiviti as well as in the u.s., the go-to-market, together with staffing, also continues to be very robust and was a significant contributing factor to the outperformance that protiviti had during the quarter.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
great. as a follow-up, can i just ask with regards to, you added 9% to headcount on staffing in perm side and 18% on the protiviti side? can you talk a little bit about the plans for headcount investments as the current year unfolds?
keith waddell -- vice chairman, president, and chief financial officer
we've also talked about for several quarters, because the labor economy continues to be so strong that we intend to participate in that fully, and we do that by adding to headcount in line with our expected revenue growth. you'll notice that the growth rates you just quoted for 2018 closely mirrored the revenue growth rates for those lines of business. so we expect to continue to add to headcount in line with our expected growth rates in revenues.
mark marcon -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
great. thank you.

and our next question is from andrew steinerman from jpmorgan. your line is open.
andrew steinerman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, keith. could you just break down the 10% in the guide, the middle of the range on the guide on the same day constant-currency basis? how do you see that forming protiviti's staffing firm?
keith waddell -- vice chairman, president, and chief financial officer
well, we typically don't get that granular, our guidance. i will say that, frankly, if you take your major segment revenue growth rates for the fourth quarter and you roll them into the first quarter, they don't look that different. they are all within a point or two of each other at the midpoint of our guidance, so good momentum. we had one of the strongest reentries in january of this year that we've seen in many years.
you saw from what we disclosed that our growth rates in january actually accelerated. it had into the fourth quarter, so we're very pleased with the start we've had across our segments in january.
andrew steinerman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. thank you.

our next question is from dan dolev from nomura. your line is open.
dan dolev -- nomura -- analyst
hey, guys. thank you. i'm sorry if i missed it. i was in another call, but did you discuss the pricing and volume components of organic growth already?
keith waddell -- vice chairman, president, and chief financial officer
we have not. so our bill rates were up 5.2% year-on-year. that compared with 4.9% of the prior quarter. we expected that the prior quarters' rate increases would progress at 5% as we've talked about before.
we saw increases between 2004, 2008 annually for 5 straight years in the 5% range. we're just now getting into that range, which was reflective of the strong labor market that continues.
dan dolev -- nomura -- analyst
understood. great. thank you so much for taking my question.
operator
and our next question comes from jeff silber from bmo capital markets. your line is open.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thanks so much. i wanted to circle back to mark's earlier question about your internal headcount additions. can we get a little bit more color on the staffing side if they came more on the perm side than on the temp side? and within the temp side, any divisional color would be helpful as well.
keith waddell -- vice chairman, president, and chief financial officer
so generally speaking, our headcount changes mirror our revenue changes. and so because perm is growing significantly faster than temp, we added heads in perm significantly faster than we did in temp. within the various segments, you can look at the various segment growth rates and pretty closely predict what the headcount changes were.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
that's what i figured. i just wanted to hear that. i appreciate it. then, just my follow-up, just a little more color on guidance.
and i know you don't give annual guidance, but can you tell us what we should be modeling for tax rate and capital spending for 2019? and also billing days for the rest of the year would be great.
keith waddell -- vice chairman, president, and chief financial officer
ok. so tax rate, first of all, for the quarter, the range is 25% to 26%, which is lower than a year ago because a year ago, we had an adjustment to the tax act, deferred tax valuation that is not expected to repeat. for the full year, i'd broaden that range to 25% to 27%, with kind of 26% being in the middle. capex, we're predicting $60 million to $17 million.
that's up quite a bit from 2018. it's consistent with the run rate. we just reported $15 million in the fourth quarter, so the run rate is $60 million. i'd also add that if you look on a 10-year basis, on average, we've spent about 1.2% of revenue on capex.
and at the high end of $70 million, we'd be at 1.1%. so while it's somewhat higher than '18, it's pretty much in line with our traditional range. most of that additional spending is in the digital transformation area. as max mentioned earlier, we continue to focus on improving our client and candidate digital experience, both on the web and with the mobile app.
we're ever broadening our use of ai. we use it in recruiting for candidate discovery. we use it when we fill jobs with the matching engines. we use it in marketing where we micro target candidates and clients, where we individualize the message by candidate and by client.
we use it in sales where we prioritize for our field staff the leads using our scoring engines. remember that our algorithms are driven by proprietary data, which is based on post-placement performance. we analyze the candidates with the best outcomes, and we work backwards from there to determine our algorithms. we believe we have more accounting performance data than anybody on the planet that we use to inform those algorithms.
that said, you still need human beings to assess soft skills, to assess attitude, professionalism, demeanor. and you still need human beings to close candidates that have multiple opportunities. it's a long-winded answer to a pretty short question, but the point is, the $60 million, $70 million is somewhat higher than the $42 million we spent in 2018.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. i'm sorry, then billing days by quarter?
keith waddell -- vice chairman, president, and chief financial officer
ok. billing days by quarter: q1, 62.2; q2, 63.4, q3, 64.1; q4, 61.7. so as we talked about, reportedgrowth versus as-adjusted growth in our guidance, the 10% versus 7%, notice that we have one fewerbilling day in this year's first quarter, and we'll make that up in the third quarter, but it does impactreported versus same-day for the first quarter.
jeff silber -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. great. that's very helpful. thanks so much.
operator
your next question comes from gary bisbee from bank of america merrill lynch. your line is open.
gary bisbee -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, guys. good afternoon. i guess just the first question on the guidance. any more color you can provide on the trending of margins within the guidance? and was there anything you'd call out as unusual? i know you true up the workers' comp credits.
i don't know if that had any benefit to q4, but that would be helpful.
keith waddell -- vice chairman, president, and chief financial officer
yes. so on the margins. first of all, temp gross margins, we expect the momentum we've seen with our pay bill spreads to continue into the first quarter. we're thinking somewhere between 50 to 70 basis points increase year over year.
protiviti, the gross margins will be flat to down slightly because, remember, their staff gets their annual salary increases on january 1. and it takes some time over the course of the year to recover that, but that's ordinary. from the standpoint, was there anything unusual? so first of all, with workers comp, a year ago, we had $1 million credit. this year, we had virtually zero.
we did have and we always have in the fourth quarter where we true up our estimates for state unemployment, federal unemployment, fica, etc., so we did have a little, 20, 30 basis points, something in that range where we cleaned up all of those accruals and adjusted them to actual so that doesn't repeat into the first quarter. but again, that's very typical for the fourth quarter and the first quarter guidance. from an sg&a standpoint, as we talked about earlier, we're continuing to hire in line on headcount. note that, overall, the sg&a percentage for staffing will go up, call it, 50, 60 basis points.
half of that's because of mix. with perm growing faster than temp, and with perm having a higher sg&a, significantly higher sg&a percentage, mix alone impacts the overall reported rate. but when you put everything together, sg&a as a percent of revenue for the company, first quarter ought to be in line with what it was a year ago, plus or minus 10 or 20 basis points either direction. so operating margins overall for the first quarter don't look that different than the fourth quarter, which means they would be up 30 to 50 basis points versus a year ago, which we're very happy with.
we basically take a 7% -- at our midpoint, we take a 7% reported revenue increase to a 21% increase in earnings per share.
gary bisbee -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. that's very helpful. and then the perm sg&a sort of step up. this was just hiring in line with that strong revenue trend? or was there anything else within that you'd call out?
keith waddell -- vice chairman, president, and chief financial officer
no. so we hired just a touch heavier than the revenue trend. yes, it's all about hiring. i mean, it's not perfect to the person so we were a little strong.
but over time, it averages out for the year, just as our full-year headcount numbers indicated.
gary bisbee -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thanks very much.
operator
your next question comes from manav patnaik from barclays. your line is open.
ryan leonard -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
hey, this is ryan leonard filling in for manav. just a question on the 1q revenue guidance. at this time, last year, there were some storm-related headwinds from some east coast storms. is there any impact in terms of the growth rate on the first quarter of '19?
keith waddell -- vice chairman, president, and chief financial officer
well, so clear, we haven't had any storms of note although it's really cold in the midwest at the moment, but we haven't had any storms of note so far that impacts this year's first quarter. but last year's first quarter, january, if you look at the growth rates, the year-on-year growth rates, a year ago january, february, march, january had the smallest year-on-year growth rate. so if anything, january has the easiest compares versus a year ago as any of the three months.
ryan leonard -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
but for the quarter, it's no meaningful impact?
keith waddell -- vice chairman, president, and chief financial officer
no, no. and we said that, i believe when we had last year's quarterly call, no. we've never had a quarter in our history where there was a significant impact due to storms.
ryan leonard -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
fair enough. and then the pace of buybacks, it stepped up through all -- throughout 2018. i mean, is thatyou guys just getting more confident in deploying that cash? and should we expect that to continue?
keith waddell -- vice chairman, president, and chief financial officer
well, as things would turn out, for the full year, our free cash flow was $485 million, and our spending on buybacks and dividends was $490 million. so consistent with our long, long, long policy, we take our free cash flow. we return it to shareholders in dividends and repurchases and for the full year, that was the case as well. with the price coming off as it did in the fourth quarter, we were happy to step up the pace and get the full year in line.
operator
your next question comes from kevin mcveigh from credit suisse. your line is open.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thank you. nice color on the bill rate. keith, if you said it, i missed it, but just what was the wage inflation in the quarter? and what did the spread look like?
keith waddell -- vice chairman, president, and chief financial officer
well, the wage inflation trailed slightly the bill rate increase, such that we did increase the spread between the two a bit, but there wasn't a huge difference between the two. our bill pay spreads are at all-time highs. we're proud of that. with the wage inflation that we expect to continue, we expect to be, to pass that on and continue to widen our spreads a bit from here.
as i said, our guidance, there's 50 to 70 basis points of gross margin improvement year-on-year embedded in our first quarter guidance for temp staffing.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. and then just real quick. it doesn't look like you see as much of a seasonal step-down in the eps guidance relative to q4. is there kind of anything in there? or is that just a function of -- normally, i think it's a couple -- $0.05 or so.
it doesn't look like it's that pronounced. is there anything to kind of call out that kind of takes that out of what historical trends have been?
keith waddell -- vice chairman, president, and chief financial officer
well, i would say, one, we got a stronger start in staffing. it's the strongest reentry in january we've seen in quite a while. so sequentially, that would play out there. i mean, frankly, because of that candidate shortage, many a client, whereas in years past, when something ended toward the end of the year, our temporary would come back to us.
this year, because they were fearful, they couldn't get them back if they wanted, they extended and/or moved them into new projects. so very much a reflection of the tight labor market that played to our advantage for the reentry into this year. protiviti, the seasonal pattern, q4 to q1, as is always the case, internal audits quite strong in q4, but in q1, that gets crowded out to some degree as clients work with their external auditors to get their external audits done, and that has a seasonal impact on protiviti. so i would say if you compare the pieces sequentially, it's more about staffing strength relative to the fourth quarter than anything.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
helpful. thank you very much.
operator
your next question comes from tobey sommer from suntrust. your line is open.
tobey sommer -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
thanks. in robert half technology, when you look out this year, do you expect the faster rate of growth to continue kind of above some of the other lines of staffing? and if so, what are the top factors you think driving, tech demand?
keith waddell -- vice chairman, president, and chief financial officer
we do expect the momentum we have in tech staffing to continue, and we would expect that the growth rates that are elevated relative to our other lines of business, we would expect that to continue. tech demand, broadly, is strong. it's cyber, it's cloud, it's digital transformation, both from a consulting and a it operations point of view. we've talked in the past about how we broadened the focus of the positions we specialize in.
that's played nicely and our revenue growth rates have responded accordingly. further, we're having increasing success going to market in tech with both protiviti and with staffing, where protiviti manages the tech projects. and often, much of the staffing comes from robert half technology. so a factor of all of those, we would expect the growth rates in technology, robert half technology staffing, to continue to outpace the other lines of business.
tobey sommer -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
and for my follow-up, with respect to protiviti and staffing, where are you, you think, in the evolution of the joint go-to-market strategy? is it early days? or are you working together in the areas you think that are appropriate?
keith waddell -- vice chairman, president, and chief financial officer
we have said it's very early days. many of the solutions we haven't even rolled out to all of our locations, so we would argue it's very early days. where we have it, it's done very well. we're aggressively expanding that.
the view is that, ultimately, we'll offer everything everywhere. but particularly in technology, it's even newer where we go to market on the accounting and finance side with management resources and accountants, together with protiviti. but particularly in technology, it even lags going to market in accounting and finance together with protiviti.
tobey sommer -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
but particularly in technology, it even lags going into market in accounting and finance. thank you.

your next question comes from tim mchugh from william blair. your line is open.
tim mchugh -- william blair -- analyst
yes, thanks. just on protiviti, can you -- i guess, a few questions. one is, i guess, who are you competing with? is it still the big four? or has that changed at all? i know you talked about digital transformation work, which is a little different than i would've thought two or three years ago. secondly, i guess, also just at a high level, what's different this year? i mean, growth really just kind of accelerated.
so is this partnering with staffing the answer? is that truly moving the needle as much as we're seeing in the growth rate? or would you attribute it when look back at 2018 to something different?
keith waddell -- vice chairman, president, and chief financial officer
well, who we're competing with continues to be primarily the big four, and the big four have moved into the digital transformation space as well. so frankly, that hasn't -- while there are digital-only, digital-first competitors, by and large, protiviti's principal competitors are the big four. and what's different? clearly, the go-to-market with staffing and protiviti is different and more successful and more advanced, and success breeds success. both the staffing organization and the protiviti organization have totally bought into, we have something special, we have something no one else has under one roof.
we have world-class consulting and world-class staffing. nobody else has that. the clients understand it. the clients buy it.
the clients benefit not only from a quality point of view but from a price point of view as well because by blending staffing in, the average hourly cost goes down. so i would give a big assist to their acceleration, to the go to market, the combined go to market, together with protiviti having the confidence that they can sell engagements that they might have not the full-time internal staff for, that they have the confidence that they can find the staff on a just-in-time basis through our staffing organization, which also benefits the growth rates all across their service offerings. having said that, as i spoke to earlier, it's not just about one of their service lines, it's internal audit. it's technology consulting, and it's financial services regulatory compliance.
it's amazing how balanced it is, not only in the u.s. but outside the u.s. as well, so kudos to protiviti. and it's not just protiviti.
remember that we report revenue externally based on who has the contract with the client. so we have engagements where 80% of the hours are performed by our staffing organization, but what you see reported externally all shows up in protiviti. and in fact, if you looked at the outperformance in revenues for the quarter, at least based on our internal expectations, externally, it all says protiviti, but we know internally that 75% of that was performed by our staffing organization. and it's a beautiful thing because when it works together like that, it's almost magical.
tim mchugh -- william blair -- analyst
ok. great. and i guess you kind of touched on, given the diversity of it, it's a bull consulting business. i guess you worry about scaling in and comps, i guess, after you see consecutive periods of growth like this.
so i guess, any thoughts on that? i guess, does the diversity make you comfortable that there's no big, i guess, items you have to grow over?
keith waddell -- vice chairman, president, and chief financial officer
well, diversity in revenue sources helps. you know what, you worry about tough comps a year from now and enjoy the good quarter, at least for a day.
tim mchugh -- william blair -- analyst
fair enough. ok. thank you.

your next question is from george tong from goldman sachs. your line is open.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. thanks. good afternoon. your midpoint of guidance for revenue growth in 1q is 10%, which is consistent with the growth you've seen with the first two weeks of january.
can you talk about what conditions for bill rate growth and volume growth you need to see in order for you to deliver on the guidance of 10% growth this quarter, given more difficult year-ago comps?
keith waddell -- vice chairman, president, and chief financial officer
so george, you're right, that notwithstanding the more difficult comps, they get tougher by a couple of points, our midpoint projects no further slowing or no second derivative deterioration, if you will. the pricing versus volume expectations would be that the pricing would be at or slightly higher than what we've seen in this past quarter and what we've seen out of the gate so far in 2019 and the volume to be consistent as well. so pretty much the momentum we have into the fourth quarter, continuing into the first, notwithstanding the tougher comps, we still think we can hold our growth rates.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. you indicated that staffing sg&a as a percentage of revenue will be up 50 to 60 bps in 1q, half of which will be due to mix from perm. can you elaborate on the other expected drivers of increase in sg&a as a percentage of revenue?
keith waddell -- vice chairman, president, and chief financial officer
sure. it's headcount, to some degree, and it's spending all these digital initiatives that i talked about earlier. and we like to think in terms of our -- the lump, if you will, in sg&a due to our digital transformation strategies is measured in nickels per share per quarter, not in dimes or in quarters. and so given how important we believe that to be to the future of our company, we think investing in terms of nickels per quarter per share is frankly, pretty modest.
but when you look at sg&a as a percent of revenue, we do expect to turn, to spic it up in 2019, consistent with what i talked about earlier.
operator
your next question comes from hamzah mazari from macquarie capital. your line is open.
hamzah mazari -- macquarie capital -- analyst
good evening. thank you. my first question is just on the bill rate you talked about, 5% bill rate. when you compare the bill rate to what you're seeing in wage inflation in past cycles, is that 50 to 70 bps gross margin on temp, is that what you've seen normally in past cycles when your bill rate's 5%? or is this sort of abnormal, when we see temp gross margins move up?
keith waddell -- vice chairman, president, and chief financial officer
frankly, it's very normal. and the point i tried to make is that relative to this 5% and above range, we just got there in this cycle. and in the last cycle, we were there for five straight years. and during those five years, not only did we increase bill rates in an absolute sense, we widen gross margins as well.
but it's quite normal at 5% increases in bill rates, that you can do that and expand your gross margins at the same time. clients understand that it's a candidate-short market. again, as we've spoken to in the past, all you have to do is lose out on your first choice, then lose out on your second choice, settle on your third choice or settle for someone pretty significantly less experienced than you first hoped for, before you understand you have to pay more. that's not unusual.
we've seen it in every cycle. we, as a management team, individually, have all been here over 30 years. we've seen this before. this is very normal.
this is very typical. and the good news about our business where many companies worry about their input cost rising, and that's diluting their margins, our input cost are rising and we're expanding our margins, and that's normal. and that's a good thing.
hamzah mazari -- macquarie capital -- analyst
great, very helpful. and just my follow-up question, just around, you talked about january accelerating despite tougher comps. just curious as to how you think about visibility in your business? is it three months, six months, one month? and any change -- are your customers more positive, less positive versus last quarter? just any thoughts as to customer sentiment, how that's changing? i realize there's a lot of macro-uncertainty out there, but i also realize your customers are u.s. midsized companies, different than sort of multinationals.
but any color you can give as to what you're seeing there.
keith waddell -- vice chairman, president, and chief financial officer
well, so the facts of this business as to visibility are that there's very little, and that's always been the case. companies hire temporaries in part to have flexibility, so when they no longer need them, they no longer have to pay them, and that's been the case for 30 years. sometimes that's a good thing, sometimes that's not, but essentially no visibility. that hasn't changed.
as far as customer sentiment, as we alluded to earlier from a confidence standpoint, whether it's nfib, whether it's ceo vista, there's many, many, many studies that says their sentiment is not quite what it was, but on an absolute basis, it's still quite high. but what's key for us and what's kind of not open for dispute is that the labor markets stay very strong. supply and demand on the labor side is clearly still tight from a labor point of view. so our willingness to continue to invest in headcount, it's because we're in a very strong labor economy.
and we can all debate interest rates, tariffs, china, the fed, all of those are interesting discussion points but the point is, we're in a candidate-short market, not only in the united states but globally. and that benefits our business, and that's what we're investing in.
hamzah mazari -- macquarie capital -- analyst
great. thank you so much.

and your last question comes from gary bisbee from bank of america merrill lynch. your line is open.
gary bisbee -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey. just one quick follow-on and maybe you just answered it with that last statement, but the  you commented on the strength in overseas. i think the macro forecast for gdp, especially in europe, is for some real slowing. and historically, your business has followed that trend.
is there anything unique today in the professional staffing areas overseas that for the core staffing business are driving this strength or that are different, if you will? or is it just the candidate shortages in some of your key areas remain in place outside the u.s. in addition to here?
keith waddell -- vice chairman, president, and chief financial officer
well, and to be clear, we said we have seen some slowing in europe, but it's slowing off very high growth rates that's settling in, in growth rates that are still double-digit and that are still higher than the united states because, as you just alluded to, we still have candidate shortages. and you mentioned germany, or somebody mentioned germany, there are still candidate shortages in germany. there are still candidate shortages in europe generally. so notwithstanding brexit, notwithstanding german exports to china, there are still candidate issues that are more relevant to our business.
gary bisbee -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. thank you.
max messmer -- chairman and chief executive officer

hello, and welcome to the robert half fourth-quarter 2018 conference call. our hosts for today's call are: mr. max messmer, chairman and ceo of robert half; and mr. keith waddell, vice chairman, president and chief financial officer.
mr. messmer, you may begin.
max messmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, and hello, everyone. we appreciate your time today. before we get started, i would like to remind everyone that comments made on our call today contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. these statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds and include words such as forecast, estimate, project, expect, believe, guidance and similar expressions.
we consider these remarks to be reasonable. however, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. some of these risks and uncertainties are described in today's press release and in our sec filings, including our 10-ks, 10-qs and today's 8-k. we assume no obligation to update the statements made on today's call.
for your convenience, we've made our prepared remarks available on our website at roberthalf.com. from the homepage, click on investor center at the bottom left of the page. you will find the quarterly conference calls link in the investor center. now let's turn to robert half's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2018.
companywide revenues were $1.482 billion. this is up 10% on both a reported and same-day constant-currency basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. net income per share in the fourth quarter was $0.95 compared to $0.38 in the fourth quarter of 2017. you may recall that in the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a one-time, non-cash charge to our provision for income taxes related to the enactment of the u.s.
tax cuts and jobs act. the amount recorded was $34 million or $0.27 per share and resulted primarily from a revaluation of our deferred income tax net assets as of december 31, 2017. excluding this charge, our net income per share was $0.65 for the fourth quarter of 2017. accompanying the release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year net income and diluted net income growth on both a reported and as-adjusted basis.
the term ""as-adjusted"" reflects the impact to our 2017 and 2018 provisions for income taxes, resulting from the tax cuts and jobs act. cash flow from operations was $123 million, and capital expenditures were $15 million in the fourth quarter. in december 2018, we distributed a total of $34 million to shareholders in the form of a $0.28 per share quarterly cash dividend. we also repurchased 2.4 million robert half shares in the fourth quarter at a cost of $137 million.
we have 6.7 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan. we ended the year strongly with double-digit year-over-year growth in revenues and operating income on both a quarterly and annual basis. full-year 2018 revenues and operating income reached all-time high levels for the company with broad-based strength in our staffing and protiviti operations. u.s.
labor market remains very robust, with significant demand due to talent shortages across our professional disciplines. during the fourth quarter, return on invested capital for the company was 42%. i'll turn the call over to keith now for a closer look at our results.
keith waddell -- vice chairman, president, and chief financial officer
global revenues in the fourth quarter were $1.482 billion. this is up 10% from the year-ago period on both a reported and same-day constant currency basis. accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and as-adjusted basis. these figures are further broken out by u.s.
and non-u.s. operations. the term ""as-adjusted"", in this case, reflects the removal of the impact of billing days, currency fluctuations and certain intercompany adjustments in our international operations. this is a non-gaap financial measure designed to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
fourth-quarter total staffing revenues were up 9% on an as-adjusted basis. u.s. staffing revenues were $934 million, up 7% on a same-day basis. and non-u.s.
staffing revenues were $285 million, up 14% on an as-adjusted basis. we have 324 staffing locations worldwide, including 85 locations in 17 countries outside the united states. the fourth quarter had 61.7 billing days compared to 61.3 days in the fourth quarter of 2017. the current first quarter has 62.2 billing days compared to 63 billing days in the first quarter one year ago.
currency exchange rate movements versus the prior year had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $12 million in the fourth quarter, which reduced our year over year reported staffing revenue growth by 1%. fourth-quarter global revenues for protiviti were $263 million with $204 million coming from business within the united states and $59 million from operations outside the united states. protiviti revenues were up 19% year over year on an as-adjusted basis. on a same-day basis, u.s.
protiviti revenues were up 16% year over year in the fourth quarter, while non-u.s. revenues were up 30% on an as-adjusted basis. exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year protiviti revenues by $2 million in the fourth quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.9%. protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 83 locations in 26 countries.
now let's turn to gross margin in the fourth quarter. gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 38% of applicable revenues compared to 37% of applicable revenues in the same period a year ago. expanding bill pay spreads and higher temp-to-hire conversion fees contributed significantly to the increase. fourth-quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 10.3% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 9.9% of consolidated staffing revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017.
when combined with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased 120 basis points versus a year ago to 44.4%. for protiviti, gross margin in the fourth quarter was $80 million or 30.2% of protiviti revenues. one year ago, gross margin for protiviti was $64 million or 30% of protiviti revenues. fourth-quarter staffing sg&a costs were 34.5% of staffing revenues compared to 34.1% a year ago.
the higher mix of permanent placement revenues this quarter versus a year ago added 20 basis points to the quarter's overall sg&a ratio. we ended 2018 with 14,900 full-time employees in our staffing divisions, up 9% from the prior year. sg&a costs for protiviti were 17.3% of protiviti revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 17.9% of protiviti revenues in the year-ago period. we ended 2018 with 4,700 full-time employees and contractors, up 18% from the prior year.
fourth-quarter operating income from our staffing divisions was $120 million, up 16% from the fourth quarter of 2017. operating margin was 9.8%. our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $102 million in operating income, an increase of 20% from the fourth quarter of last year. this resulted in an operating margin of 9.3%.
in the fourth quarter, operating income for our permanent placement division was $18 million. this was down 2% from the prior year and produced an operating margin of 14.4%. operating profit for protiviti was $34 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 32% from the prior year's fourth quarter. this produced an operating margin of 12.9%.
at the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable were $794 million, and implied days sales outstanding, dso, was 48.1 days. before we move to first quarter guidance for 2019, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the fourth quarter of '18 and so far in january, all adjusted for currency and billing days. our temporary and consulting staffing divisions exited the fourth quarter with december revenues up 6.7% versus the prior year compared to an 8% increase for the full quarter. revenues for the first three weeks of january were up 10% compared to january of 2018.
december revenues for our permanent placement division were up 15.5% versus 2017 compared to 13.5% increase for the full quarter. for the first four weeks in january, permanent placement revenues were up 15% compared to the same period last year. this information provides a look into some of the trends we saw during the fourth quarter and in january. but as you know, they represent brief periods of time, and we caution against reading too much into them.
with that in mind, we offer the following first-quarter guidance: revenues, $1,460,000,000 to $1,525,000,000; income per share, $0.92 to $0.98. the midpoint of our first-quarter guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 10% on a same-day, as-adjusted basis or 7% on a reported basis before adjusting for billing day and currency drags and eps growth of 21%. we limit our guidance to one quarter. all estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our sec filings.
now i'll turn the call back over to max.
max messmer -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, keith. we ended the year with record results, and we continue to benefit from a very strong labor market. companies are having trouble locating the talent they need, and robert half is expert at doing this work for them. we are experienced in helping our clients find and, more importantly, hire candidates with hard-to-find skill sets, many of whom will have competing offers from other employers.
our success is due to our personalized approach, something we have done well for 70 years. i'd like to talk a little bit about the economy and how we view the current environment. if you look at main street, particularly the small and midsized companies that make up the majority of our staffing clients, they need people to continue their businesses. according to nfib research, business optimism remains near historically high levels for this group.
the vistage ceo confidence index, which also measures small business optimism, has recently shown a modest weakening in business confidence from a very high level, yet hiring plans remain robust. this tells us that small business owners are moving forward with hiring plans. in fact, the nfib reported a record number of job openings last month. not being able to fill these jobs fast enough is the biggest barrier to growth.
60% of business owners said they are hiring or trying to hire, and 90% of those reported few or no qualified applicants. these are compelling statistics, and we believe they are evidence of a job market that is going to remain strong for the foreseeable future. skill shortages are global, and we are confident we can be a valuable resource to companies as they navigate this tight market. it's one of the reasons we have invested heavily in developing our proprietary matching technology and laying the foundation for a world-class client and candidate experience online.
but we believe you need a combination of technology and seasoned staffing professionals to be truly effective at finding and making the right match between client and job candidate. we are making digital investments, and we are making people investments to ensure we have the right mix of both. quarterly results for protiviti also reached an all-time high in the fourth quarter. we are very pleased with how this business is performing.
financial services continues to be protiviti's biggest industry sector. they are also putting greater focus on the technology sector. protiviti's cyber-security services remained strong during the quarter as did their wide range of internal audit and risk and compliance solutions, such as anti-money laundering services and work in the area of digital transformation. and we are optimistic about the successful go-to-market strategy with protiviti and our staffing operations.
we are providing a full spectrum of consulting, staff augmentation and managed services to our clients. now keith and i would be happy to answer your questions. [operator instructions]
