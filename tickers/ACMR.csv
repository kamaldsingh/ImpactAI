thank you. ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the q&a session.[operator instructions]. our first question comes from suji deselva from roth capital.
suji deselva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hello david, lisa. congratulations on all the progress here. so my first question is on the--hi, david. my first question is on the inventory.
you talked a bit about the dynamics there the finished goods came down but the overall inventory went up, and you're building for the second quarter. can you just elaborate on the dynamics there and what kind of pipeline backlog visibility you have given the non finished goods inventory went up so much in the second quarter expect to be an up sequential quarter based on the strong inventory rebuild.
lisa feng -- chief accounting officer and interim chief financial officer
second quarter, the reason that the inventory went up and then finish go strong that in quarter 1, we have a lot of substance realized in quarter 1. and for the quarter 2, we are participating in the high demand for revenue as well as the shipment. quarter 2, we forecasted about revenue about $25 million, and the shipment will be much higher.
suji deselva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
okay, so shipments did rebound nicely. that's helpful, lisa. thank you. and then david, you cover this in detail on the prepared remarks i did want to ask it to be clear.
given the macro environment, have any of the customer forecasts or capacity plans changed versus three months ago perhaps across memory or logic. or are you just not seeing any changes as everything moving along with the customers you have.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
actually so far with our existing customer with order delivery time, and almost no changing is this moment. as i mentioned even the last phone call and had one customer asking delia when moms might have seen their earlier phone call. and this year, i look in q2, q3, we are pretty much--be the for deliver their tool and this moment we don't see much changing away now from our existing customer. so as i mentioned before, our customer is about a year expansion plan and we're looking for.
it killed in their plan and probably some customer looking for their production yield and some customer just expanding their capacity to plan their scale.
suji deselva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
well, that's good news. and then lastly, the new product the tahoe product. i'm curious if the customers there are the existing and the prospects are the existing customer base or whether it's new ones and if it is. is it--are the same customers are taking sap's capsules today and if so, is there a notion of an attach rate.
david of tahoe tools to sap stores is at one to one or is i not how to think about how tahoe ramps.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
actually, in tahoe, our first customary integrity invasion to tahoe is our existing customer. so there we ship the tool and now the tool is in their customer site and for the initial testing. and obviously, we receive also other existing customer showed a high interest and the same thing and we also show there gather attention from other potential customer showed interest for the tahoe tool. the reason for the tahoe tool is that because of the tremendous.
so if we could ask a cv in this performance and that's their fundamental demand or their core their fundamental pressure our customer gaap. following your concern right. as we probably read a one of the new sand ad is probably all the chemistry you see in there. can any i call the process most of the chemistry can be neutralized.
however, only sulfuric acid, you cannot neutralize mostly have to go to that dump field right putting a deep on the ground. that's really a concern for our customer and it has a tremendous pressure to deal with sulfuric acid treatment. again, we are expecting tahoe will be tremendous reduction to reduce the severe sulfuric acid usage. that's we think will be not just only reduce the cost more important, reduce a lot of a pressure for you moment, protection.
suji deselva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
david, is there a notion of how many tahoe tools would solve for every sap stool or is that not the way i think about it.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
actually tahoe can that is all i expect you market size roughly of 20% and most there we should about the order or $3 billion. we asked a market price aside about almost like $600 million, and most applications as opposed to [inaudible] and also post [inaudible]. i saw it as a big market. and at this moment, we're paying actually very high expectation for their market to take this a as product.
operator
our next question comes from quinn bolton from [inaudible]
unknown speaker
i wanted to follow up on the ultra-c tahoe eval, i'm wondering if you give us some updates. i think you delivered that tool in january. do you expect it to recognize revenue in q3, q4 of this year. and then the second question, you talked about interest from at least three other customers for tahoe, will you be delivering additional eval tools here in the second quarter for tahoe.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
good question. actually, there's a customer we as first two are shipping in a general time line and a tool right now doing their iconic initial testing right now. so i'm expecting those data will come out probably in their q3 and timeline. and with that data be proving or gathering data come out.
and there obviously , will build to a more aggressive marketing and to the other new customer. so expecting probably either end of this year or maybe the next year, we can shipping additional tahoe tool to give a new customer, or we ship their tool to their repeating tool to the existing customer. so basically, the year 2019 revenue will not come in much of a $100 million quarter projection, but i would expect in part what can she be the next year. revenue in the sales.
unknown speaker
and then similar question for the new electro-plating tools. you'd mentioned shipment 2 of the advance packaging in one of the front end tool. are those eval tools or are those tools shipped for for revenue in the march quarter.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
okay. great. actually this the call that the [inaudible] packaging right ap tool is repeat order. so base on our revenue recognition, repeat order to the sale, to the existing customer will be recognized revenue upon shipment.
so we recognize revenue upon shipment which is issue year. then for our map which is i'll show you acp for the front end covering that can either connect the application. this tool is our first tool and to our existing customer. so this tool will go through evasion process.
the typical process, the validation for the first new tool. i should say probably six months to one year or sometimes even longer than one year as a new tool. so i will call the map the actual plating well not probably regular revenue until the year 2020.
unknown speaker
and then you talked about some of the current order strength you saw through the first quarter and noted a nice uptick in shipments in q2, wondering if you could just talk by in the market. is that demand really coming more from capacity expansions at your 3d nand and dram customers. are you seeing participation also from the foundry side of your business in that order strength.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
great. actually the order we see of the q1 and most of this tool organize shipment in q2 and q3 timeline and put this way including to all that we receive even the you wait until last month or this month. and we're pretty very busy on a q2 q3 time manufacture slots. and also this tool, their pretty balanced.
like a web for a full customer in dram, 3d nand and in a foundry. it's pretty much banners up are in a portfolio or the customer divided.
unknown speaker
and then the last question for me just the new electro-plating tools. when you look at the gross margin of those tools, how does that compare to the queen side of the business. is it in line with what the corporate average or can you give us some sense how to be thinking about the margins on the electro-plating tools. thank you.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
you look in a couple of leading tool. you have an application one for the month packages which is--i got a b and they're not a margin i should say is a anyway early production. it's within there are regular margin range and with also the violence the copper plating for a company that connectors mep and that's the put a front end application and actually in the high-end of our forecast the gross margin. so, it's a pretty waste backing you know to give us a good margin as to improving our deploy scale and the more customer acceptance.
so anyways both the technological innovative tool.
unknown speaker
great. thank you,david.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of mark miller from benchmark.
mark miller -- benchmark -- analyst
can you tell me where you stand on the current evaluations in terms of customers and any new customers and tools.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
well, obviously you'll see that we won't talk about the previous fall. i mean just answer tahoe has to be mentioned and as any evaluation. and also we have a couple of plating tool is especially advanced packaging tools we repeat order by the for this coming to connect a mapping tool is our evaluation. and also there are some other small packaging tool, well as it shipping out in the q1 timeline.
and some of this tool maybe evaluation too. i mean we're keeping as our recognizing new revenue as a procedure is as a new tool and to their existing customer or other tool or mature tool to the new customer. well i can see that as the invasion tool. so we're also expecting there's going to be evasion tool continue to be in there in q3, q4 timeline.
mark miller -- benchmark -- analyst
what about the new factory in terms of factory absorption of our overhead. does that help or hurt margins. and just one curious how that factory plays and in terms your margins.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
new factory, obviously, we had a much wider spacing and the more efficient area right now. also which full clean on final assembly. so i'll give a better quality and also give us more of a convenient, high efficiency and also wider spacing for our as somebody guy to work on their tool. and has come to their margin increasing, and i should say it really depends on how much we load there is the capacity, as we loading more of our tool and also more increase their manufacturing efficiency that would increase our margin and of course the margin.
mark mckechnie -- vice president of finance
mark mckechnie here. i might just add something on the margin front. we're not throughout the year we're still talking 40% to 45% on the gross margin. i think our product mix can have a bigger impact certainly in the near term.
and of course, if you look at longer term you know we'd hope for our margins to to drift up both from scale absorption and some better margins on some of the newer products.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes [inaudible].
unknown speaker
congratulations guys on a great start to the year. i have just two quick follow ups. david can you tell us many tools the ultra-c tahoe would be in a fab either by 50,000 or 100,000 wafer starts. however, the map is the easiest.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
let's take our example of that dram fab rate and it was on 100,000 wafer from fab. typically, we talk about the load of the tool anywhere between 20 to 30 too. that's their number estimate.
unknown speaker
perfect. and can you remind us what the typical asp for that product would be.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
obviously, even his father has a different chemistry as you say a different chemistry combination. and other than sulfuric acid add or c1, so dependent real configurations or pricing range. i think we're probably talking about their range over there about $5 million to $6 million range.
unknown speaker
perfect. and then lastly just a little bit more clarity on your comment about improved visibility. i know it's been asked a couple of different ways but any other further details you could give there whether it's increase visibility during the quarter from [inaudible] or any type of clarity that you can give about your improved visibility would be appreciated.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
obviously, there's lots in the earnings call. we have some appeal has to be receiving by some of the people is due on their kind over loi customer and verbal told us. but after the q1 at this moment, a lot of you hasn't materialized. we as real maturity oh and also we're more clear deliver time to most has mentioned to that before q2, q3.
so we are very busy, and obviously q1 is going to be the quarter and q2, q3 even busier. and this really a spot thought out there and there is some still some open spot in q4. but based on our our forecast and also our tool has been shipped last year which is some of them we recognized revenue this year. so where we have fully confident about a $100 million revenue in 2019.
unknown speaker
fabulous. thanks, no other questions.
operator
[operator instructions] no further questions at this time. i'll now hand the call back to david. please continue.

will begin to slide 3. 
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, gary. and welcome everyone for today's call. we are off to a greater start to 2019. it is the momentum to continue into the first quarter.
we delivered a solid revenue growth, excellent profitability, and we introduce key new electrical plating or ecp products. first-quarter results demonstrate the competitive strength of our technical expertise. product differentiation and the production scale. revenue would double from the same period last year, solid operating leverage grew gross margin of a 43.1% and operating margin of 14.6%. we ended the quarter with more than $27 million of cash.
total shipment which include tools deliver another year recognized as revenue where $14 million, up 40% year over year. in addition, portfolio of the financial results, we made a good operational progress in a quarter. orders were quite strong, and we completed all planned to delivers. at semicon china to a show in march, we launched two products with unique acm electroplating technology which i would talk more about a moment. now i will highlight three operations achievements.
from the first quarter, we go to slide 4. first, we deliver our first ultra-c tahoe evaluation tool to an important strategic customer testing is unplanned and we are on track for customer acceptance later in the year. because of the environment and the cost benefits, we are now seeing tremendous interest in ultra-c tahoe from three other major customers, as well as several new prospects. tahoe is an excellent example of our focus on differentiated patent protected product offerings by using one tenths of sulfuric acid typically used by competing single wafer cleaning tools.
tahoe meet the environmental requirements more than facts around the world. reducing the use of sulfuric acid also delivers tremendous cost savings. we estimate that tahoe can help customers saving around $10 million a year for typical hand use single wafer per month. feedback on tahoe is quite a positive. we believe the tahoe will eventually become a mainstream product that will solve the challenges faced by a customer or post empty cleaning and oppose the action clean. we move to advanced notice.
second, we introduce two electro- plating products at semicon china in march. this will show on slide 5. their first product is the ultra ecp ap, ap stands for advanced packaging. ap is the backhander assembly tool used for bumpy or plain copper, tin, nickel to wafers at the die level before packaging.
the ultra ecp ap deliver more uniform mantle layers and a match area by incorporating our proprietary technologies. this advanced technology solution delivers a better yield, greater efficiency, and a higher throughput due to the fabrication process. furthermore, ultra ecp ap, also support a wide range of packaging solutions including caterpillar, soda bump, redistribution layer, fan out application, [inaudible]. we also introduce our ultra ecp map.
map stands for multi anode partial plating. this new tool is used in front and wafer fabrication process and use our proprietary technology to deliver water cost electrochemical copper plating for copper interconnect applications. the ecp map offers improved gas feeding performance for plating ultra thin seed layer. this is a mission critical for advanced nodes at a 14 nano,12 nano [inaudible].
we're excited about this new ecb tool. they demonstrate our commitment to technology leadership by delivering innovative proprietary high-performance products in single wafer cleaning solutions. we believe in advanced palladium markets represent a great growth opportunity for us, and we are in great position to capitalize. market acceptance of the new plating tool is already promising. in q1, we received the repeater purchase order for two ultra ecp ap tools, from one of our major packaging customers.
and our first tool purchase order for ultra ecp map from our key foundry customer. we deliver the one of this tool in the first quarter by a week's back to the deliver, the other two tours in the coming months. beyond this new electro-plating solution, our engineering team remains productive and are working on additional new products as we show on slide 6, innovations through research is our strength. we are standing upon our investment in our need in order to further mounting our competitive need.
so stay tuned for more exciting new product announcements from us in the quarters ahead. third. our new shanghai factory is remaining as a plan as shown on slide 7. a common date for majority of a new production in q1.
for comparison in q4, the new factory handle 40% of our production. based on the ramp, we expect the new factory will be made to full support on demand in q2 and beyond. we intend to ship substantially all our production to the new factory over the course in 2019. all regional factory will be used for small tools, and advanced development activities.
going forward, we believe our expanded capacity and our ability to scale production will support our efforts to win new large customers. our new factory shows our commitment to scale capacity which will help us achieve our goal of becoming a major player in the industry. before i turn the call over to lisa, i want to say a few words about the broader industry. we are monitoring the spending trends in the industry just like everyone else. while semi-industry capital spending is a volatile, we are optimistic about another year of solid growth in 2019 based on orders from our customers.
we have orders and their firm forecast tied to a specific products and as several of our top customers. most of our customer are in early though a stage of multi-year investment to expand the capacity. they're ramping up based on the internal production plan, so less impact by cycle. for example, one pc is using our tool of how to improve yield in a 3d nand production line and it is being ramped.
another example is a body which is in their mid meters of planned multi-year capacity expansion. on [inaudible] we're actively fulfill order as we speak. furthermore, we believe we can dampen the effect of the cycle by delivering new products and adding new customer at all stage. today, we have plenty of room to grow over 3 billion addressable market. to conclude, we have excellent position dissipate in a build out of a next generation fab for years to come.
we have a technology leadership proximity to large customer and a production capacity. we have a build a solid foundation with a strategic semiconductor customer who are deploying our tools at a skier in some of their most advanced production line. and we expect to win new customer around the world as industrial progresses to more advanced nodes and a three dimensional architectures. let me now turn the call over to lisa, who will discuss financial results in more detail.
lisa feng -- chief accounting officer and interim chief financial officer
thank you, david. and a good day, everyone. our review of financial highlights and then turned back to david to discuss our outlook. all figures are the first quarter and all comparisons against the same period last year.
almost i state otherwise. as a reminder, the non-gaap financial results i'm discussing excluding stock-based compensation for reconsideration of the non-gaap financial results to the most directly comparable guide financial results. please see last night earnings release. you will find it posted in the investor relations section of our website.
the reconciliations are also including as exhibit to the current report on a form 8-k that we filed with the sec yesterday. please go to slide 8, where we will start with the revenues. revenue was $20.5 million, up 110%. growth was driven by solid demand for our single wafer cleaning equipment and our back end tool. and we had a customer acceptances at a first the tools that had shipped in prior periods.
total shipments were $14 million, compared to the $10 million in the year-ago quarter, and the $32 million last quarter. total shipments including tools shipped and the reorganized as a revenue in the quarter, plus shipments pending customer acceptance. we expect a significant increase in shipments in the second quarter based on solid demand for the repeated and the first two deliveries. gross margin was 43.1 which was with our normal expectation of a 40% to 45%.
this compares to 52.6% a year ago, and the 49.6% in the december quarter. gross margin was elevated in the prior-year period due to our high concentration of a certain sap two tools which commanded higher margins. we expect the gross margin to continue to vary on a quarterly basis due to product mix, and the manufacturing utilization. gaap operating expenses was $6.6 million, down 6% from the same period last year.
non-gaap operating expenses were$5.9 million, up from $4.9 million in the same period last year, and they're down from $7.1 million last quarter. growth in the operating expenses was driven primarily by r&d, as we increase investment in a new product development. gaap operating income was $2.3 million, compared to our operating loss of a $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2018. our gaap operating margin was111%, compared to -19.5% in the same quarter last yer, and the 13% last quarter.
non-gaap operating income was $3 million versus $0.3 million a year ago. the resulting of a non-gaap operating margin of a 14.6% compared to 2.8% in the same quarter last year, and the 15.5% last quarter. other expenses was $261,000 due to the foreign exchange impact of our working capital of the stronger r&d versus the dollar. gaap net income a treatable to acm research was $1.9 million, compared to the net loss of a $2.8 million last year, and the net income of $2.3 million last quarter.
non-gaap net income was $2.6 million, compared to a non-gaap net loss of $0.6 million last year. and the non-gaap net income of a $2.9 million last quarter. stock based compensation was approximately $0.7 million. gaap net income per diluted share was $0.10, compared to our $0.18 loss in the year-ago period. non-gaap net income per diluted share was $0.14, compared to $0.04 loss in the year-ago period.
now i will review the balance sheet. we ended the quarter 1 with $27.4 million cash was essentially flat quarter over quarter. we ended the quarter with a $12.8 million in the short-term borrowings, outperformed $9.4 million last quarter. now let me discuss the inventory. we ended the quarter with a $42.3 million of inventory as expected finish a good decrease to $13 million, compared to $6.5 million in the fourth quarter.
the decrease was due to customer acceptances exceeding the first two shipments during the quarter. cash flow from operation was a -3 million, the cash flow was due to primary to the increase inventory intended to fulfill strong quarter to demand. we also use cash to do this to deal with payables. we expect a positive cash flow from operation in quarter 2, and for the full year.
capital expenditures were $100,000. i will now turn the call back to david, to discuss our outlook.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, lisa. please go to the slide 9. we are pleased with our results. we are monitoring trends in the broader semiconductor market.
but are optimistic as we are receiving strong orders and production forecast from our customers. we are excited by our business prospects and remain committed to gaining share with new products, new customers, and a more production steps. we are maintaining our guidance for the full year for 2019. we'll continue to expect a revenue of highly million up 34% which reflects the strong demand from our existing customers. importantly, visibility for the full-year improved due to a solid orders and a customer forecast during q1.
to conclude, our solid results show that we are executing our strategy, we are participating in the growth of our major new [inaudible]. we are ramping production at our new factory, and we continue to deliver innovative and new products. we remain committed to achieving our vision of become a major player in a semiconductor equipment market. we look forward to continuing to deliver strong results in the balance of this year and beyond.
let's now open the call for any questions that you may have. operator, please go ahead.

thank you. ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the q&a session.[operator instructions]. our first question comes from suji deselva from roth capital.
suji deselva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hello david, lisa. congratulations on all the progress here. so my first question is on the--hi, david. my first question is on the inventory.
you talked a bit about the dynamics there the finished goods came down but the overall inventory went up, and you're building for the second quarter. can you just elaborate on the dynamics there and what kind of pipeline backlog visibility you have given the non finished goods inventory went up so much in the second quarter expect to be an up sequential quarter based on the strong inventory rebuild.
lisa feng -- chief accounting officer and interim chief financial officer
second quarter, the reason that the inventory went up and then finish go strong that in quarter 1, we have a lot of substance realized in quarter 1. and for the quarter 2, we are participating in the high demand for revenue as well as the shipment. quarter 2, we forecasted about revenue about $25 million, and the shipment will be much higher.
suji deselva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
okay, so shipments did rebound nicely. that's helpful, lisa. thank you. and then david, you cover this in detail on the prepared remarks i did want to ask it to be clear.
given the macro environment, have any of the customer forecasts or capacity plans changed versus three months ago perhaps across memory or logic. or are you just not seeing any changes as everything moving along with the customers you have.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
actually so far with our existing customer with order delivery time, and almost no changing is this moment. as i mentioned even the last phone call and had one customer asking delia when moms might have seen their earlier phone call. and this year, i look in q2, q3, we are pretty much--be the for deliver their tool and this moment we don't see much changing away now from our existing customer. so as i mentioned before, our customer is about a year expansion plan and we're looking for.
it killed in their plan and probably some customer looking for their production yield and some customer just expanding their capacity to plan their scale.
suji deselva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
well, that's good news. and then lastly, the new product the tahoe product. i'm curious if the customers there are the existing and the prospects are the existing customer base or whether it's new ones and if it is. is it--are the same customers are taking sap's capsules today and if so, is there a notion of an attach rate.
david of tahoe tools to sap stores is at one to one or is i not how to think about how tahoe ramps.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
actually, in tahoe, our first customary integrity invasion to tahoe is our existing customer. so there we ship the tool and now the tool is in their customer site and for the initial testing. and obviously, we receive also other existing customer showed a high interest and the same thing and we also show there gather attention from other potential customer showed interest for the tahoe tool. the reason for the tahoe tool is that because of the tremendous.
so if we could ask a cv in this performance and that's their fundamental demand or their core their fundamental pressure our customer gaap. following your concern right. as we probably read a one of the new sand ad is probably all the chemistry you see in there. can any i call the process most of the chemistry can be neutralized.
however, only sulfuric acid, you cannot neutralize mostly have to go to that dump field right putting a deep on the ground. that's really a concern for our customer and it has a tremendous pressure to deal with sulfuric acid treatment. again, we are expecting tahoe will be tremendous reduction to reduce the severe sulfuric acid usage. that's we think will be not just only reduce the cost more important, reduce a lot of a pressure for you moment, protection.
suji deselva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
david, is there a notion of how many tahoe tools would solve for every sap stool or is that not the way i think about it.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
actually tahoe can that is all i expect you market size roughly of 20% and most there we should about the order or $3 billion. we asked a market price aside about almost like $600 million, and most applications as opposed to [inaudible] and also post [inaudible]. i saw it as a big market. and at this moment, we're paying actually very high expectation for their market to take this a as product.
operator
our next question comes from quinn bolton from [inaudible]
unknown speaker
i wanted to follow up on the ultra-c tahoe eval, i'm wondering if you give us some updates. i think you delivered that tool in january. do you expect it to recognize revenue in q3, q4 of this year. and then the second question, you talked about interest from at least three other customers for tahoe, will you be delivering additional eval tools here in the second quarter for tahoe.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
good question. actually, there's a customer we as first two are shipping in a general time line and a tool right now doing their iconic initial testing right now. so i'm expecting those data will come out probably in their q3 and timeline. and with that data be proving or gathering data come out.
and there obviously , will build to a more aggressive marketing and to the other new customer. so expecting probably either end of this year or maybe the next year, we can shipping additional tahoe tool to give a new customer, or we ship their tool to their repeating tool to the existing customer. so basically, the year 2019 revenue will not come in much of a $100 million quarter projection, but i would expect in part what can she be the next year. revenue in the sales.
unknown speaker
and then similar question for the new electro-plating tools. you'd mentioned shipment 2 of the advance packaging in one of the front end tool. are those eval tools or are those tools shipped for for revenue in the march quarter.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
okay. great. actually this the call that the [inaudible] packaging right ap tool is repeat order. so base on our revenue recognition, repeat order to the sale, to the existing customer will be recognized revenue upon shipment.
so we recognize revenue upon shipment which is issue year. then for our map which is i'll show you acp for the front end covering that can either connect the application. this tool is our first tool and to our existing customer. so this tool will go through evasion process.
the typical process, the validation for the first new tool. i should say probably six months to one year or sometimes even longer than one year as a new tool. so i will call the map the actual plating well not probably regular revenue until the year 2020.
unknown speaker
and then you talked about some of the current order strength you saw through the first quarter and noted a nice uptick in shipments in q2, wondering if you could just talk by in the market. is that demand really coming more from capacity expansions at your 3d nand and dram customers. are you seeing participation also from the foundry side of your business in that order strength.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
great. actually the order we see of the q1 and most of this tool organize shipment in q2 and q3 timeline and put this way including to all that we receive even the you wait until last month or this month. and we're pretty very busy on a q2 q3 time manufacture slots. and also this tool, their pretty balanced.
like a web for a full customer in dram, 3d nand and in a foundry. it's pretty much banners up are in a portfolio or the customer divided.
unknown speaker
and then the last question for me just the new electro-plating tools. when you look at the gross margin of those tools, how does that compare to the queen side of the business. is it in line with what the corporate average or can you give us some sense how to be thinking about the margins on the electro-plating tools. thank you.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
you look in a couple of leading tool. you have an application one for the month packages which is--i got a b and they're not a margin i should say is a anyway early production. it's within there are regular margin range and with also the violence the copper plating for a company that connectors mep and that's the put a front end application and actually in the high-end of our forecast the gross margin. so, it's a pretty waste backing you know to give us a good margin as to improving our deploy scale and the more customer acceptance.
so anyways both the technological innovative tool.
unknown speaker
great. thank you,david.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of mark miller from benchmark.
mark miller -- benchmark -- analyst
can you tell me where you stand on the current evaluations in terms of customers and any new customers and tools.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
well, obviously you'll see that we won't talk about the previous fall. i mean just answer tahoe has to be mentioned and as any evaluation. and also we have a couple of plating tool is especially advanced packaging tools we repeat order by the for this coming to connect a mapping tool is our evaluation. and also there are some other small packaging tool, well as it shipping out in the q1 timeline.
and some of this tool maybe evaluation too. i mean we're keeping as our recognizing new revenue as a procedure is as a new tool and to their existing customer or other tool or mature tool to the new customer. well i can see that as the invasion tool. so we're also expecting there's going to be evasion tool continue to be in there in q3, q4 timeline.
mark miller -- benchmark -- analyst
what about the new factory in terms of factory absorption of our overhead. does that help or hurt margins. and just one curious how that factory plays and in terms your margins.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
new factory, obviously, we had a much wider spacing and the more efficient area right now. also which full clean on final assembly. so i'll give a better quality and also give us more of a convenient, high efficiency and also wider spacing for our as somebody guy to work on their tool. and has come to their margin increasing, and i should say it really depends on how much we load there is the capacity, as we loading more of our tool and also more increase their manufacturing efficiency that would increase our margin and of course the margin.
mark mckechnie -- vice president of finance
mark mckechnie here. i might just add something on the margin front. we're not throughout the year we're still talking 40% to 45% on the gross margin. i think our product mix can have a bigger impact certainly in the near term.
and of course, if you look at longer term you know we'd hope for our margins to to drift up both from scale absorption and some better margins on some of the newer products.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes [inaudible].
unknown speaker
congratulations guys on a great start to the year. i have just two quick follow ups. david can you tell us many tools the ultra-c tahoe would be in a fab either by 50,000 or 100,000 wafer starts. however, the map is the easiest.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
let's take our example of that dram fab rate and it was on 100,000 wafer from fab. typically, we talk about the load of the tool anywhere between 20 to 30 too. that's their number estimate.
unknown speaker
perfect. and can you remind us what the typical asp for that product would be.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
obviously, even his father has a different chemistry as you say a different chemistry combination. and other than sulfuric acid add or c1, so dependent real configurations or pricing range. i think we're probably talking about their range over there about $5 million to $6 million range.
unknown speaker
perfect. and then lastly just a little bit more clarity on your comment about improved visibility. i know it's been asked a couple of different ways but any other further details you could give there whether it's increase visibility during the quarter from [inaudible] or any type of clarity that you can give about your improved visibility would be appreciated.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
obviously, there's lots in the earnings call. we have some appeal has to be receiving by some of the people is due on their kind over loi customer and verbal told us. but after the q1 at this moment, a lot of you hasn't materialized. we as real maturity oh and also we're more clear deliver time to most has mentioned to that before q2, q3.
so we are very busy, and obviously q1 is going to be the quarter and q2, q3 even busier. and this really a spot thought out there and there is some still some open spot in q4. but based on our our forecast and also our tool has been shipped last year which is some of them we recognized revenue this year. so where we have fully confident about a $100 million revenue in 2019.
unknown speaker
fabulous. thanks, no other questions.
operator
[operator instructions] no further questions at this time. i'll now hand the call back to david. please continue.

good day, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. and welcome to the acm research first-quarter 2019 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]. i will now turn the call over to mr.
gary dvorchak, managing director of the blueshirt group asia. mr. dvorchak, please go ahead.
gary dvorchak -- investor relations, the blueshirt group asia
good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss financial performance for the first quarter 2019. we released results after the u.s. market closed yesterday.
the release is available on our website, as well as from newswire services. there's also a supplemental slide deck posted on the investor portion of our website, that we'll reference during our prepared remarks. on the call with me today are dr. david wang, president and chief executive officer; lisa feng, chief accounting officer, and interim cfo; and mark mckechnie, vice president of finance.
before we continue, please turn to slide 2. let me remind you that remarks made during this call may include, predictions, estimates or other information that might be considered forward looking. these forward-looking statements represent acm's current judgment for the future. however, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.

will begin to slide 3. 
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, gary. and welcome everyone for today's call. we are off to a greater start to 2019. it is the momentum to continue into the first quarter.
we delivered a solid revenue growth, excellent profitability, and we introduce key new electrical plating or ecp products. first-quarter results demonstrate the competitive strength of our technical expertise. product differentiation and the production scale. revenue would double from the same period last year, solid operating leverage grew gross margin of a 43.1% and operating margin of 14.6%. we ended the quarter with more than $27 million of cash.
total shipment which include tools deliver another year recognized as revenue where $14 million, up 40% year over year. in addition, portfolio of the financial results, we made a good operational progress in a quarter. orders were quite strong, and we completed all planned to delivers. at semicon china to a show in march, we launched two products with unique acm electroplating technology which i would talk more about a moment. now i will highlight three operations achievements.
from the first quarter, we go to slide 4. first, we deliver our first ultra-c tahoe evaluation tool to an important strategic customer testing is unplanned and we are on track for customer acceptance later in the year. because of the environment and the cost benefits, we are now seeing tremendous interest in ultra-c tahoe from three other major customers, as well as several new prospects. tahoe is an excellent example of our focus on differentiated patent protected product offerings by using one tenths of sulfuric acid typically used by competing single wafer cleaning tools.
tahoe meet the environmental requirements more than facts around the world. reducing the use of sulfuric acid also delivers tremendous cost savings. we estimate that tahoe can help customers saving around $10 million a year for typical hand use single wafer per month. feedback on tahoe is quite a positive. we believe the tahoe will eventually become a mainstream product that will solve the challenges faced by a customer or post empty cleaning and oppose the action clean. we move to advanced notice.
second, we introduce two electro- plating products at semicon china in march. this will show on slide 5. their first product is the ultra ecp ap, ap stands for advanced packaging. ap is the backhander assembly tool used for bumpy or plain copper, tin, nickel to wafers at the die level before packaging.
the ultra ecp ap deliver more uniform mantle layers and a match area by incorporating our proprietary technologies. this advanced technology solution delivers a better yield, greater efficiency, and a higher throughput due to the fabrication process. furthermore, ultra ecp ap, also support a wide range of packaging solutions including caterpillar, soda bump, redistribution layer, fan out application, [inaudible]. we also introduce our ultra ecp map.
map stands for multi anode partial plating. this new tool is used in front and wafer fabrication process and use our proprietary technology to deliver water cost electrochemical copper plating for copper interconnect applications. the ecp map offers improved gas feeding performance for plating ultra thin seed layer. this is a mission critical for advanced nodes at a 14 nano,12 nano [inaudible].
we're excited about this new ecb tool. they demonstrate our commitment to technology leadership by delivering innovative proprietary high-performance products in single wafer cleaning solutions. we believe in advanced palladium markets represent a great growth opportunity for us, and we are in great position to capitalize. market acceptance of the new plating tool is already promising. in q1, we received the repeater purchase order for two ultra ecp ap tools, from one of our major packaging customers.
and our first tool purchase order for ultra ecp map from our key foundry customer. we deliver the one of this tool in the first quarter by a week's back to the deliver, the other two tours in the coming months. beyond this new electro-plating solution, our engineering team remains productive and are working on additional new products as we show on slide 6, innovations through research is our strength. we are standing upon our investment in our need in order to further mounting our competitive need.
so stay tuned for more exciting new product announcements from us in the quarters ahead. third. our new shanghai factory is remaining as a plan as shown on slide 7. a common date for majority of a new production in q1.
for comparison in q4, the new factory handle 40% of our production. based on the ramp, we expect the new factory will be made to full support on demand in q2 and beyond. we intend to ship substantially all our production to the new factory over the course in 2019. all regional factory will be used for small tools, and advanced development activities.
going forward, we believe our expanded capacity and our ability to scale production will support our efforts to win new large customers. our new factory shows our commitment to scale capacity which will help us achieve our goal of becoming a major player in the industry. before i turn the call over to lisa, i want to say a few words about the broader industry. we are monitoring the spending trends in the industry just like everyone else. while semi-industry capital spending is a volatile, we are optimistic about another year of solid growth in 2019 based on orders from our customers.
we have orders and their firm forecast tied to a specific products and as several of our top customers. most of our customer are in early though a stage of multi-year investment to expand the capacity. they're ramping up based on the internal production plan, so less impact by cycle. for example, one pc is using our tool of how to improve yield in a 3d nand production line and it is being ramped.
another example is a body which is in their mid meters of planned multi-year capacity expansion. on [inaudible] we're actively fulfill order as we speak. furthermore, we believe we can dampen the effect of the cycle by delivering new products and adding new customer at all stage. today, we have plenty of room to grow over 3 billion addressable market. to conclude, we have excellent position dissipate in a build out of a next generation fab for years to come.
we have a technology leadership proximity to large customer and a production capacity. we have a build a solid foundation with a strategic semiconductor customer who are deploying our tools at a skier in some of their most advanced production line. and we expect to win new customer around the world as industrial progresses to more advanced nodes and a three dimensional architectures. let me now turn the call over to lisa, who will discuss financial results in more detail.
lisa feng -- chief accounting officer and interim chief financial officer
thank you, david. and a good day, everyone. our review of financial highlights and then turned back to david to discuss our outlook. all figures are the first quarter and all comparisons against the same period last year.
almost i state otherwise. as a reminder, the non-gaap financial results i'm discussing excluding stock-based compensation for reconsideration of the non-gaap financial results to the most directly comparable guide financial results. please see last night earnings release. you will find it posted in the investor relations section of our website.
the reconciliations are also including as exhibit to the current report on a form 8-k that we filed with the sec yesterday. please go to slide 8, where we will start with the revenues. revenue was $20.5 million, up 110%. growth was driven by solid demand for our single wafer cleaning equipment and our back end tool. and we had a customer acceptances at a first the tools that had shipped in prior periods.
total shipments were $14 million, compared to the $10 million in the year-ago quarter, and the $32 million last quarter. total shipments including tools shipped and the reorganized as a revenue in the quarter, plus shipments pending customer acceptance. we expect a significant increase in shipments in the second quarter based on solid demand for the repeated and the first two deliveries. gross margin was 43.1 which was with our normal expectation of a 40% to 45%.
this compares to 52.6% a year ago, and the 49.6% in the december quarter. gross margin was elevated in the prior-year period due to our high concentration of a certain sap two tools which commanded higher margins. we expect the gross margin to continue to vary on a quarterly basis due to product mix, and the manufacturing utilization. gaap operating expenses was $6.6 million, down 6% from the same period last year.
non-gaap operating expenses were$5.9 million, up from $4.9 million in the same period last year, and they're down from $7.1 million last quarter. growth in the operating expenses was driven primarily by r&d, as we increase investment in a new product development. gaap operating income was $2.3 million, compared to our operating loss of a $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2018. our gaap operating margin was111%, compared to -19.5% in the same quarter last yer, and the 13% last quarter.
non-gaap operating income was $3 million versus $0.3 million a year ago. the resulting of a non-gaap operating margin of a 14.6% compared to 2.8% in the same quarter last year, and the 15.5% last quarter. other expenses was $261,000 due to the foreign exchange impact of our working capital of the stronger r&d versus the dollar. gaap net income a treatable to acm research was $1.9 million, compared to the net loss of a $2.8 million last year, and the net income of $2.3 million last quarter.
non-gaap net income was $2.6 million, compared to a non-gaap net loss of $0.6 million last year. and the non-gaap net income of a $2.9 million last quarter. stock based compensation was approximately $0.7 million. gaap net income per diluted share was $0.10, compared to our $0.18 loss in the year-ago period. non-gaap net income per diluted share was $0.14, compared to $0.04 loss in the year-ago period.
now i will review the balance sheet. we ended the quarter 1 with $27.4 million cash was essentially flat quarter over quarter. we ended the quarter with a $12.8 million in the short-term borrowings, outperformed $9.4 million last quarter. now let me discuss the inventory. we ended the quarter with a $42.3 million of inventory as expected finish a good decrease to $13 million, compared to $6.5 million in the fourth quarter.
the decrease was due to customer acceptances exceeding the first two shipments during the quarter. cash flow from operation was a -3 million, the cash flow was due to primary to the increase inventory intended to fulfill strong quarter to demand. we also use cash to do this to deal with payables. we expect a positive cash flow from operation in quarter 2, and for the full year.
capital expenditures were $100,000. i will now turn the call back to david, to discuss our outlook.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, lisa. please go to the slide 9. we are pleased with our results. we are monitoring trends in the broader semiconductor market.
but are optimistic as we are receiving strong orders and production forecast from our customers. we are excited by our business prospects and remain committed to gaining share with new products, new customers, and a more production steps. we are maintaining our guidance for the full year for 2019. we'll continue to expect a revenue of highly million up 34% which reflects the strong demand from our existing customers. importantly, visibility for the full-year improved due to a solid orders and a customer forecast during q1.
to conclude, our solid results show that we are executing our strategy, we are participating in the growth of our major new [inaudible]. we are ramping production at our new factory, and we continue to deliver innovative and new products. we remain committed to achieving our vision of become a major player in a semiconductor equipment market. we look forward to continuing to deliver strong results in the balance of this year and beyond.
let's now open the call for any questions that you may have. operator, please go ahead.
",2019-Q1,ACMR

[operator instructions] we have the first question coming from the line of suji desilva from roth capital. please go ahead.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hello, david, lisa, mark. congratulations on the progress here. very, very strong.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
lisa feng -- chief accounting officer and interim chief financial officer
thank you.
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
thanks, suji.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
thirty three million of shipments to be recognized in the second half of '19. does that provide you very good visibility into the remaining '19 guidance or whether there would be a meaningful portion that would be out into the 2020 time frame?
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
yes. ok. suji, actually, look at our -- as i said, in the second half, we have a very good order receiving. also, we have a very high kind of a delivery schedule, too.
so obviously, we look at the second and third quarter and the fourth quarter. we think the third quarter will be heavier than the fourth quarter, right? and also, we see some order or forecasts where we either deliver end of q4 or probably come to the early q1 next year. so we're very kind of excited about this customer forecast and also our production capability.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok.
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
yes.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
and then on --
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
there's just one thing i would add.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
go ahead, mark.
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
oh, suji, just to add -- yes, sorry about that. but just to add is i think you were asking, too, if we thought some of the first tools we delivered here in the first half would be driving revenue for the second half. and usually, it takes two to four quarters for a first tool for recognition. so our second half, as david said, is -- a lot of it is shipment based.
and yes, the first tools we shipped in the first half of the year, we would think, would be more of next year-type recognition events.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. great. and then also on the shipments, are they spread evenly across foundry and memory customers? or is there a concentration on one side versus the other?
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
actually, looking at our customer, i mean, we do have our -- i call the the memory house and also have our foundry. and actually, our second half, you got mixing, right? mixing of the -- there's a nano company and also the foundry. pretty good mixing actually in the second half. as i said, our first customer, sk hynix, also a delivery in q1 and q2 time line, and we're not expect additional deliver for sk hynix in q3, q4.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
right. you said that. ok. great.
ok. and then a question on the tahoe products. are additional -- i know you have one customer trialing it now. are additional customers purposely -- or are you purposely waiting for that first customer's acceptance? in other words 2020? and are multiple customers kind of waiting on that event order? is that how this is going to work out? or the first customer acceptance is really the trigger for additional customers?
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
yes. that's the typical pattern. right? and looking at our history, it also showed that pattern. normally, first customer take in a tool, and other customers they'll be waiting for the result.
right? so also, they're first waiting for results; secondly, they're waiting for repeat order. so i think there's more. as i mentioned, we've got a very promising data from first customer, and we're continually improving further excellency and also improving more of our yield data in the coming quarters. so with that data, we are confident and -- we'll have a repeat order from first customer.
but then there may be -- it depends on other customer. if they're -- like our data, maybe they're now waiting for second order -- second repeat order to come out. they can make a decision, too. so we do have, as you say, a few customer lined up, and we're going to present our -- improve the results and -- to see what's their reaction.
mark, anything you want to add to this?
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. now, but --
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
that's good. that's -- i think you covered it, david, yes.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. great. and then just one thing i didn't clarify before. i just want to make sure.
is ultra-c tahoe complementary to saps and tebo? or is it a replacement for it? is it --
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
ok. so the -- so suji, basically, tahoe, partly -- i mean, tahoe is a part that's basically used as -- for sulfuric acid, process. right? most of their process as supposed to action and also their -- post their, i should say, their cmp. and there's some -- also some -- a little bit metal removing process.
but anyway, most metals process. at this moment, our tahoe -- our saps -- tebo didn't apply for those steps. and i should say, previously, they divide the market. however, there might be listed in structures and process that need or require adding tebo and saps the further you consider, i call, the performance.
so anyway, that's adding additional performances for that. but at this moment, our -- i should say most are -- we're sulfuric acid. and with this tahoe product, we'll meet the customer requirements.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. ok. and then last question. it's exciting to see your fifth customer here, dram customer.
can you talk about the number of steps relatively -- not to go numbers but just whether 3d nand or dram has more steps that are required at cleaning, which one's more intensive in terms of use of your tools or whether they're both pretty similar.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
well, in general, i see that is -- obviously, dram process are more complex than the 3d nand process. so therefore, their need a cleaning step is more in a dram process. right? so -- however, there are different challenging. right? for instance, if we look in the 3d nand, the -- they're multilayer, right, 128-layer, whatever in the future, 250-layer that deep hole or that sales structure, that deep-hole cleaning becomes challenging, too, right? and so i should say that generally speaking, obviously dram has more of a cleaner step than 3d.
however, for the specific or deep hole, that's a cleaning challenge, which is, i -- we believe, our saps technology exactly designed for those deep-hole layer and their particle removal. right? that's our strong point.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
all right. thanks, david. thanks, guys.
operator
we have our next question from the line of mark miller from the benchmark co. please go ahead.
mark miller -- the benchmark company -- analyst
congratulations on another good report. i just was wondering if you can give a little more color on the eval tools, how many you have out there and how do they break out in terms of tahoe and saps, etc.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
ok. well, so ok, the -- probably i can give you -- i cannot give all the number right at this moment. i can tell we have a tahoe system on an eval tool right now. and also, we have the copper 3d map, right, for the foundry application.
that's an eval tool. right? and the -- that's a major new product. and also, we do have some other eval tools, which is the existing product, and then -- which is a new customer. and they're -- because they take a first tool, they have to make the eval.
for instance, this new fifth customer dram company we're going to deliver their first tool, it's actually a mature tool. but it's also considered eval because of the first customer. so i can say there are at least three in hand right now. actually, we have more than other number in here, but i cannot give you each one or who each customer it is.
right? mark?
mark miller -- the benchmark company -- analyst
ok. r&d costs, are they going to be trending up for the rest of the year?
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
yes. i can hit that, mark. so yes, we expect our overall opex to trend up a little bit from the first half of the year, and it'll be weighted to -- some of the growth will be weighted more toward r&d. yes.
mark miller -- the benchmark company -- analyst
that's right. thank you.
operator
sir, we have the next question coming from the line of christian schwab, craig-hallum capital group. please go ahead.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
hey, guys. congratulations on another fabulous quarter. thank you for all those specific customer commentary that you gave. it's nicely refreshing.
as you look at sk hynix, do you have an opinion yet on whether their purchasing or spending with you will be up on a year-over-year basis in 2020 versus '19?
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
ok. well, it's really hard to say at the moment, right, looking at the dram pricing. and obviously, the dram market today has kind of people concerns. so especially, there's a trade conflict between japan and taiwan.
right? i mean japan and also korea, too. that all impact spending and also their future fab spending for hynix. i should say at this moment this year, well, pretty -- say that is our first half year, very busy with supplying tool to the hynix and the second half pretty empty. for next year at this moment, it's way too early to see that.
by our -- i mean, i worked with hynix for many, many years. it's hard for them to say next year, we'll have no spending. but we still think they are going to continue spending there. they'll spend over -- higher than this year or versus -- lower than this year.
it really depends on their plan. by the same report -- if you look in the same report, we have some indication. they're going to spend probably higher than this year, probably equal to the last year. right? but anyway, these are all the reporting projection.
i can see that probably we'll give you more update at the year end. or beginning next year, we'll give you more of our forecasts for our customer.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
great. as it relates to the tahoe and the initial evaluation results that you and the customer are very pleased with, in the last quarter you guys made commentary that you would expect material revenue with that customer for tahoe in 2020. i would assume, since the evaluation results, everyone's happy with -- that that would still be the case.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think you that said a very good point, right? and as i mentioned, we have a very promising result, and i can see that they are tahoe's human data, very close to their single-wafer hard sdm's single-wafer data. so that's what the real -- in the process what demonstrate tahoe have a similar capability, but we'll use only one-tenth of chemistry. right? so that's why the customer really like it.
as to our first tool, and we're packing typically, i should say, eight to 12 months. so assuming probably either end of this year or beginning next year, we'll finish the qualification of first customer. and then obviously, we're expecting repeat order from the same customer and additional order from other customer. right? and for the other customer, we're going to record a revenue of probably -- it depends on the order, right? normally, new customer take six months.
so some of those are new order from tahoe will help definitely to add on our revenue next year. and at this moment, probably too early to say. it depends on when orders start, when we deliver. right? so that's our projection.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. great. and then on the tebo, you guys talked about orders next year for your next-generation cleaning tool. can you remind us, any asp differences in the next-generation tool or gross margin differences versus the previous cleaning tools or asps and gross margins, the same just increased performance?
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
yes. ok. actually, as i mentioned, in early report in tebo, we're -- just like any technology -- i'll give as example, go back to saps. for the saps getting to the customer using for production, it will take more than two years.
right? so tebo will follow that trend. right? so i think the -- as i said, q2 last quarter, we're achieving together with a customer very good data, and -- which is through our hard working, closely collaboration with the customer and also modify hardware, modify parameter, modify processes, data -- i mean, process condition. so that will show our tebo is very effective in removing small particles and also removing the contamination without damaging the structure. right? with this good data, we'll continue working with the customer, and we'll continue to apply more and more steps.
and then eventually, they're going to buy more of our tool because of the more steps and more of expansion in their capacity. they need a tool. right? that's for our current customer. and with -- again, same thing i said with the tahoe, same kind of path.
as soon as one customer had a repeat order coming and overall data come out, and the other new customer like say, what's going on there. right? so we expect that that's moment, a checking point. we've got additional new customer coming. so anyway, i think that bottom line, at this moment, i should say all the pattern wafer, there's no -- any technology kind of apply or physical agitation to that tiny structure.
right? we're going to control their bubble temperature, control their -- our tebo technology, we're very promising or we're very confident this technology will play a big role, especially cleaning small particles, tiny particle into the trench, between the trench, above the trench or into the deeper layer. so it's really a critical technology when the people are moving to five-nano or three-nano, even down the road, right, no matter it's a finfet or nano wear. and so we're very promise. we're very optimistic about technology.
eventually, it become mainstream technology to remodel this kind of a critical application.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
fabulous. and then lastly, speaking about of optimism, i think you guys currently have, i think, roughly $350 million in annual revenue production capacity already. is that number still correct?
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
that's correct. as we announced before, we have two factories right now. first factory, about $100 million. our second factory, around $250 million.
so added together, it would be a $350 million revenue capability for a year. yes. that's correct.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. and then to the optimism part. given the fact that you're only a hundred million a year company today with another $250 million in capacity yet available, we're looking at adding future production and future space potentially in the near future. so with that in mind, what is your guide as multiyear outlook and objective for market share goals in the $3 billion cleaning market, as well as the $500 million advanced packaging market?
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
great point. right? and so if you look at our tam here, our cleaning market totaled $3 billion with our current product, which is, i call it, a critical process. our saps, tebo and also the tahoe, we think, about are -- total tam is about 50% of that. and also with additional where cleaning -- 3d market is getting, especially front- and then back-end together, that's a roughly $0.5 billion tam market.
so we have a real huge market. obviously, continue with innovation, new technology, we'll take more market -- increase the tam market, too. so it's a real good future for us. and where is that? that's why expecting -- we're trying to building manufacture capacity.
and further, we're going to also increase our sales capability both inside china, outside china. we put -- do believe our technology will be needed by everybody, every fab in the world. so that's why we're going to make our early preparation and for those time comes. and as to the, i should say, the sales revenue increase, it's hard to give you a future, but i can give you a past.
right? in the last five, six years, our annual compound increased about 60% of annual base. again, that trend, i should say, obviously, it depends on the future how we execute the business. and we want to maintain -- we want to get kind of a good increase to our revenue until we reach a certain, i call, saturation point. next three, four, five years, that'd be the growth, right, the growth period for us.
so we're very excited. we're going to prepare for that of course.

david wang -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, gary, and welcome everyone to today's call. i'm very pleased with our second-quarter results. business momentum was strong with record revenue, solid bottom-line growth and a healthy cash balance. our results demonstrate the growing strength of our technology, product offering and production scale as we continue on our mission to become a major supplier of capital equipment to the semiconductor industry.
revenue grew to $29 million, up 39% from last year. our strong top line, good growth margin and disciplined spending resulted in high-teens operating margin for the quarter. total shipments rebounded to $33 million, up more than 50%. we ended the quarter with $27.6 million of cash.
so far, 2019 played out better than expected. while the industry is moving through a fairly normal inventory cycle, our customers continued to invest in new capacity with many still in early stage of their production ramps. we are filling our production. we have a solid delivery in q2 from our second factory.
we plan to continue with a very busy second half. we have received promising initial results for tahoe from the evaluating tool at our lead development customer. we also began shipments of two new advanced ecp tools. we are proud to have announced our fifth significant customer, a large, china-based entrant to the dram industry.
and we're continuing to see encouraging order activity, recent order of our tools to be delivered in q4 and early next -- early 2020. we also have a solid indication for growth in 2020 and beyond. moving on slide 4, our success starts with our customers. they choose acm technology to help drive their own production capability.
we help them achieve their operational excellency needed to compete in global semiconductor markets. we consider the location of acm shanghai's world-class r&d team and production facility to be a key differentiator that put us in proximity to some of the largest fab projects in the world. last month, we announced our newest customer, an emerging, china-based dram maker. this new customer placed their purchase order for their first saps v system.
we plan to deliver it in the fourth quarter. acm was selected for its high performance, its technology road map and, most importantly, expected improvements to the production yields. we provide our customer with a proven fast-cleaning solution that will remove killer defect in more than 20 different type of cleaning steps. as with our other customer, we intend to help our newest customer achieve a successful production ramp.
as they ramp, we expect a flowing order for production-level tools. let me now discuss our significant customers. i will start with sk hynix, the no. 2 global dram supplier.
sk hynix was acm's first major customer, a strong testament to acm's proven technology and ability to improve production yields. we started with just a few production steps. now our tools are used in more than 20 steps as they progress to more advanced nodes. demand was solid from sk hynix in the first half.
we do not expect additional demand in the second half. next, let me discuss ymtc. they are a major new producer of 3d nand. we are working closely to support ymtc as they scale their 3d nand production in wuhan.
we believe we are ymtc's largest single-wafer wet cleaning supplier. acm tools are being deployed in a significant number of cleaning steps. we see strong demand from ymtc in the second half of 2019 and beyond. our third major customer is huali part of the huahong group, a leading advanced foundry in china.
huali is a middle of a multiyear capacity expansion. they are a great customer with a production near our current orders. the huahong group is adding capacity at its leading-edge node and is also building a new fab in wuxi. we are participating in both projects.
we also have a number of the first tool demo system at huali for some of our newer product offerings. huali has been a good contributor so far this year, and we expect to increase delivery in the second half. finally, let me discuss the smic, the largest foundry in china. they have several strategically located fabs in china and western europe.
smic has been a relatively small customers so far this year. however, we expect an incremental revenue opportunity next year as they're moving toward more advanced nodes, including 14, 10-nano and beyond. we are honored to support the five major it manufacturers. we believe these customers can support solid growth for years to come as they scale capacity, deploy our tools in additional production steps and deploy more acm products such as tahoe, tebo and our newly announced front and back-end packaging trading products.
we remain focused on winning additional major customer by: first, demonstrating our advantage at the current customers; two, scaling our production capacity; three, increase our skills, effort -- our sales effort to show the yield benefits delivered by acm's innovative and differentiated technologies. i will now provide an update on some of the new product activity on slide 5 and 6. we delivered our first tahoe demo tour to a strategic customer in january of this year and are pleased with the initial evaluation results. tahoe incorporates a unique and patented technology for acm to deliver a high cleaning performance while using one-tenth of the sulfuric acid typically used by conventional high-temperature, single-wafer cleaning tools.
because of the environment and the cost benefit, we continue to see tremendous interest in tahoe from our current customer base, as well as several new prospects. tahoe is excellent example of our focus on differentiated, patent-protected product offerings. we are encouraged by initial test results, and we remain in track for the customer acceptance in coming quarters. we expect that tahoe will eventually become a mainstream product that solve cost and the environmental challenges faced by customers for post-cmp cleaning and post-action cleaning when moving to advanced nodes.
tebo update, through close teamwork between acm and the customer, we have optimized multiple hardware and process parameter and obtained very promising results on tebo during the second quarter. this customer has reached particle removal efficiency, or pre, of 100% on the production pattern wafers. the customer is very happy with the results to see if -- for future capacity adds. we expect that this will result in orders next year.
next, on slide 6, we are encouraged by initial customer response to the two electroplating products that we introduced in march. the ultra ecp ap is a back-end assembly tool used for applying copper, tin and nickel to wafer at die level before packaging. the ap delivers a more uniform metal layer at a notch area by incorporating our proprietary technology. this uniformity is critical and deliver better yields and a greater plating efficiency.
it will be deployed not only in bump, but also in fan-out, 2.5d, 3d, in a pillar and other new 3d advanced packaging applications. the ultra ecp map is used in front-end wafer fabrication process. it uses our proprietary technology to deliver world-class electrochemical copper plating for copper interconnection application. the map offers the improved gap-filling performance for plating on an ultra-thin seed layer.
this enables continuously reducing metal pitch and therefore enhance the density of finfet and nano devices. we believe this is mission critical for advanced nodes at five-nano, three-nano and beyond. as i mentioned on our last call in q1, we received a repeat purchase order for two ecp ap tools from one of our major packaging customers. we also received our first two purchase order for ecp map from a key foundry customer.
their products are off to a good start as we successfully delivered one ap tool in q1 and one map tool in q2. we expect to deliver one more in the coming months. we believe that advanced 3d market represent a great growth opportunity. the tam for both ecp ap and ecp map is around usd 0.5 billion.
this is a new market, young cleaning tools, which is a $3 billion tam. we are in an excellent position to capitalize on the 3d opportunity. beyond these new products, our engineering team continue to work closely with our customer to advance our technology and broaden our product road map, which will further support their production goals. our internal road map now extending to several major new products over the next several years.
we remain committed to balancing our near-term profitability with investment to drive longer-term growth. we're looking forward to sharing some of these new products with you in the future once we have advanced some of these more promising product count set to first tool demo system for customer's evaluation. i will now discuss two recent strategic developments. please turn to slide 7.
first, let me update you on the shanghai star market listing. on july 22, the first 25 stocks began trading on the star market. recall that just prior, on june '17, we announced a plan to list the share of acm shanghai on new star market. we are now even more confident that this will prove a positive development for acm and its shareholders.
as a first step qualifying for the listing, we also announced a private investment of $27.3 million into acm shanghai subsidiary at a pre-money valuation of usd 675 million. our motivation for this plan is fairly simple. we believe that this what enable acm to, first, access local capital in our primary market, which is china; second, take advantage of a favorable valuation in the star market; and third, raising our profile with the regional customer and supply chain. since we call in june, we have submitted our business application to the ministry of their commerce in shanghai, and we expect the funding to be complete later in the third quarter.
big picture, acm research is committed to the global market opportunity. while industry growth is now centered in china, we expect 60% of the industrial capital spending to take place outside china market at least through 2025. for that reason, where we begun plans to further expand our lone china business. of course, we have the hynix now, and then we want to add one to three major customers in the coming years from either taiwan, u.s., europe, japan and korea.
we fully believe the best structure to achieve our goal is for acm research to remain not listed. we will maintain 80% or more ownership in acm shanghai after star market ipo. finally, i want to share an important, new development in our long-term production plan. as we look out several years, we begin -- we believe we may need to add even more manufacturing capacity beyond our two current facilities, which are shown on slide 8.
planning is at an early stage. we have located a potential site in shanghai at which we could add a third factory and r&d center. we're in negotiations with the developer and government authorities and could reach agreement before year end. should we move forward, the plan could require capital spending for the land this year or next.
to conclude, i'm positive on opportunity ahead of us and confident that we are in an excellent position to participate in the build-out of next-generation fabs for years to come. we have to build a strong foundation with the strategic semiconductor customers who are deploying our tools and scale in some of their most advanced production lines. and we expect to win new customers around the world as industry progress to more advanced nodes, three-dimensional architecture and 3d advanced packages. let me now turn the call over to lisa, who will discuss financial results in more detail.
lisa?
lisa feng -- chief accounting officer and interim chief financial officer
thank you, david, and good day, everyone. i will review financial highlights and then turn it back to david to discuss our outlook. all figures are for the second quarter and all comparison is against the same period last year, unless i state otherwise. as a reminder, our non-gaap financial results i'm discussing excluding stock-based compensation.
for a reconciliation of non-gaap financial results to the most directly comparable gaap financial results, please see last night earning release. you can find it posted in the investor relations section of our website. the reconciliations are also including as an exhibit to the current report on form 8-k that we filed with the sec yesterday. please go to slide 9, where we will start with the revenue.
revenue was $29 million, up 39%. growth was driven by solid demand for our single-wafer cleaning equipment and our back-end tools. we had customer acceptances of our first tools that have shipped in the prior periods. total shipments were $33 million, compared to $21 million in the year-ago quarter and the $14 million last quarter.
the significant sequential increase in shipments was driven by solid demand for repeat and the first two deliveries. gross margin was 45.3%, which was slight above our normal expectation of 40% to 45%. this compares to 41.8% a year ago and the 43.1% in the march quarter. we expect gross margin to continue to vary on a quarterly basis due to the product mix and the manufacturing utilization.
gaap operating expenses were $8.5 million, up 32.5% on the same period last year. non-gaap operating expenses were $7.9 million, up from $6.2 million in the same period last year and up from $5.9 million last quarter. growth in operating expenses was driven primarily by r&d and the general and administration expenses. r&d expenses were higher as we increased investment in new product development.
gaap operating income was $4.7 million, compared to $2.3 million in the second quarter of 2018. our gaap operating margin was 16.1%, compared to 11.2% in the same quarter last year and 11% last quarter. non-gaap operating income was $5.3 million versus $2.5 million a year ago. our non-gaap operating margin was 18.2%, compared to 12% in the same quarter last year and the 14.6% last quarter.
other income was $0.5 million due to the foreign exchange gains on our working capital due to a strong dollar versus renminbi in the quarter. gaap net income was $4.3 million, compared to $3.2 million last year and $1.9 million last quarter. non-gaap net income was $4.9 million, compared to $3.4 million last year and the $2.6 million last quarter. stock-based compensation was approximately $0.6 million.
gaap net income per diluted share was $0.23, compared to $0.18 in the year-ago period. non-gaap net income diluted share was $0.26, compared to $0.19 in the year-ago period. now i will review the balance sheet. we ended quarter 2 with $27.6 million in cash which is essentially flat quarter over quarter.
we ended the quarter with $15.1 million in short-term borrowings, up from $5.8 million last quarter. we ended the quarter with $45.5 million of inventories. finished goods was $13 million, essentially flat when compared to the first quarter. raw materials inventory grew in the quarter to support the strong shipments planned for the second half of the year.
cash flow from operations was negative $1.4 million. the cash outflow was due primarily to increased inventory and the receivables versus the first quarter. capital expenditures were $0.2 million. i will now turn the call back to david to discussing our outlook.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, lisa. please go to slide 10. we are very pleased with our results. we are monitoring trends in the broader semiconductor market.
i remain optimistic at the way we're receiving strong orders and demand forecasts from our customers. we are excited by our business prospects and remain committed to gaining share with new products, new customers and more production steps. for 2019, we're raising our revenue outlook to usd 105 million, representing more than 40% annual growth. this is an increase of $5 million from the guidance we provided on last quarter's call.
our outlook reflects strong demand from our existing customers. we have a good visibility for the remain of the year due to solid order and forecasts provided by our key customers. to conclude, our strong results show that we are exciting our strategy -- executing our strategy; we are participating in the growth of the major new ic fabs; we are ramping production at our new factory; and we continue to deliver innovative, new products. we remain committed to achieving our vision of become a major player in the semiconductor equipment market.
let's now open the call for any questions that you may have. operator, please go ahead.

[operator instructions] we have the first question coming from the line of suji desilva from roth capital. please go ahead.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hello, david, lisa, mark. congratulations on the progress here. very, very strong.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
lisa feng -- chief accounting officer and interim chief financial officer
thank you.
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
thanks, suji.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
thirty three million of shipments to be recognized in the second half of '19. does that provide you very good visibility into the remaining '19 guidance or whether there would be a meaningful portion that would be out into the 2020 time frame?
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
yes. ok. suji, actually, look at our -- as i said, in the second half, we have a very good order receiving. also, we have a very high kind of a delivery schedule, too.
so obviously, we look at the second and third quarter and the fourth quarter. we think the third quarter will be heavier than the fourth quarter, right? and also, we see some order or forecasts where we either deliver end of q4 or probably come to the early q1 next year. so we're very kind of excited about this customer forecast and also our production capability.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok.
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
yes.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
and then on --
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
there's just one thing i would add.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
go ahead, mark.
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
oh, suji, just to add -- yes, sorry about that. but just to add is i think you were asking, too, if we thought some of the first tools we delivered here in the first half would be driving revenue for the second half. and usually, it takes two to four quarters for a first tool for recognition. so our second half, as david said, is -- a lot of it is shipment based.
and yes, the first tools we shipped in the first half of the year, we would think, would be more of next year-type recognition events.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. great. and then also on the shipments, are they spread evenly across foundry and memory customers? or is there a concentration on one side versus the other?
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
actually, looking at our customer, i mean, we do have our -- i call the the memory house and also have our foundry. and actually, our second half, you got mixing, right? mixing of the -- there's a nano company and also the foundry. pretty good mixing actually in the second half. as i said, our first customer, sk hynix, also a delivery in q1 and q2 time line, and we're not expect additional deliver for sk hynix in q3, q4.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
right. you said that. ok. great.
ok. and then a question on the tahoe products. are additional -- i know you have one customer trialing it now. are additional customers purposely -- or are you purposely waiting for that first customer's acceptance? in other words 2020? and are multiple customers kind of waiting on that event order? is that how this is going to work out? or the first customer acceptance is really the trigger for additional customers?
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
yes. that's the typical pattern. right? and looking at our history, it also showed that pattern. normally, first customer take in a tool, and other customers they'll be waiting for the result.
right? so also, they're first waiting for results; secondly, they're waiting for repeat order. so i think there's more. as i mentioned, we've got a very promising data from first customer, and we're continually improving further excellency and also improving more of our yield data in the coming quarters. so with that data, we are confident and -- we'll have a repeat order from first customer.
but then there may be -- it depends on other customer. if they're -- like our data, maybe they're now waiting for second order -- second repeat order to come out. they can make a decision, too. so we do have, as you say, a few customer lined up, and we're going to present our -- improve the results and -- to see what's their reaction.
mark, anything you want to add to this?
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. now, but --
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
that's good. that's -- i think you covered it, david, yes.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. great. and then just one thing i didn't clarify before. i just want to make sure.
is ultra-c tahoe complementary to saps and tebo? or is it a replacement for it? is it --
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
ok. so the -- so suji, basically, tahoe, partly -- i mean, tahoe is a part that's basically used as -- for sulfuric acid, process. right? most of their process as supposed to action and also their -- post their, i should say, their cmp. and there's some -- also some -- a little bit metal removing process.
but anyway, most metals process. at this moment, our tahoe -- our saps -- tebo didn't apply for those steps. and i should say, previously, they divide the market. however, there might be listed in structures and process that need or require adding tebo and saps the further you consider, i call, the performance.
so anyway, that's adding additional performances for that. but at this moment, our -- i should say most are -- we're sulfuric acid. and with this tahoe product, we'll meet the customer requirements.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. ok. and then last question. it's exciting to see your fifth customer here, dram customer.
can you talk about the number of steps relatively -- not to go numbers but just whether 3d nand or dram has more steps that are required at cleaning, which one's more intensive in terms of use of your tools or whether they're both pretty similar.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
well, in general, i see that is -- obviously, dram process are more complex than the 3d nand process. so therefore, their need a cleaning step is more in a dram process. right? so -- however, there are different challenging. right? for instance, if we look in the 3d nand, the -- they're multilayer, right, 128-layer, whatever in the future, 250-layer that deep hole or that sales structure, that deep-hole cleaning becomes challenging, too, right? and so i should say that generally speaking, obviously dram has more of a cleaner step than 3d.
however, for the specific or deep hole, that's a cleaning challenge, which is, i -- we believe, our saps technology exactly designed for those deep-hole layer and their particle removal. right? that's our strong point.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
all right. thanks, david. thanks, guys.
operator
we have our next question from the line of mark miller from the benchmark co. please go ahead.
mark miller -- the benchmark company -- analyst
congratulations on another good report. i just was wondering if you can give a little more color on the eval tools, how many you have out there and how do they break out in terms of tahoe and saps, etc.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
ok. well, so ok, the -- probably i can give you -- i cannot give all the number right at this moment. i can tell we have a tahoe system on an eval tool right now. and also, we have the copper 3d map, right, for the foundry application.
that's an eval tool. right? and the -- that's a major new product. and also, we do have some other eval tools, which is the existing product, and then -- which is a new customer. and they're -- because they take a first tool, they have to make the eval.
for instance, this new fifth customer dram company we're going to deliver their first tool, it's actually a mature tool. but it's also considered eval because of the first customer. so i can say there are at least three in hand right now. actually, we have more than other number in here, but i cannot give you each one or who each customer it is.
right? mark?
mark miller -- the benchmark company -- analyst
ok. r&d costs, are they going to be trending up for the rest of the year?
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
yes. i can hit that, mark. so yes, we expect our overall opex to trend up a little bit from the first half of the year, and it'll be weighted to -- some of the growth will be weighted more toward r&d. yes.
mark miller -- the benchmark company -- analyst
that's right. thank you.
operator
sir, we have the next question coming from the line of christian schwab, craig-hallum capital group. please go ahead.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
hey, guys. congratulations on another fabulous quarter. thank you for all those specific customer commentary that you gave. it's nicely refreshing.
as you look at sk hynix, do you have an opinion yet on whether their purchasing or spending with you will be up on a year-over-year basis in 2020 versus '19?
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
ok. well, it's really hard to say at the moment, right, looking at the dram pricing. and obviously, the dram market today has kind of people concerns. so especially, there's a trade conflict between japan and taiwan.
right? i mean japan and also korea, too. that all impact spending and also their future fab spending for hynix. i should say at this moment this year, well, pretty -- say that is our first half year, very busy with supplying tool to the hynix and the second half pretty empty. for next year at this moment, it's way too early to see that.
by our -- i mean, i worked with hynix for many, many years. it's hard for them to say next year, we'll have no spending. but we still think they are going to continue spending there. they'll spend over -- higher than this year or versus -- lower than this year.
it really depends on their plan. by the same report -- if you look in the same report, we have some indication. they're going to spend probably higher than this year, probably equal to the last year. right? but anyway, these are all the reporting projection.
i can see that probably we'll give you more update at the year end. or beginning next year, we'll give you more of our forecasts for our customer.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
great. as it relates to the tahoe and the initial evaluation results that you and the customer are very pleased with, in the last quarter you guys made commentary that you would expect material revenue with that customer for tahoe in 2020. i would assume, since the evaluation results, everyone's happy with -- that that would still be the case.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think you that said a very good point, right? and as i mentioned, we have a very promising result, and i can see that they are tahoe's human data, very close to their single-wafer hard sdm's single-wafer data. so that's what the real -- in the process what demonstrate tahoe have a similar capability, but we'll use only one-tenth of chemistry. right? so that's why the customer really like it.
as to our first tool, and we're packing typically, i should say, eight to 12 months. so assuming probably either end of this year or beginning next year, we'll finish the qualification of first customer. and then obviously, we're expecting repeat order from the same customer and additional order from other customer. right? and for the other customer, we're going to record a revenue of probably -- it depends on the order, right? normally, new customer take six months.
so some of those are new order from tahoe will help definitely to add on our revenue next year. and at this moment, probably too early to say. it depends on when orders start, when we deliver. right? so that's our projection.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. great. and then on the tebo, you guys talked about orders next year for your next-generation cleaning tool. can you remind us, any asp differences in the next-generation tool or gross margin differences versus the previous cleaning tools or asps and gross margins, the same just increased performance?
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
yes. ok. actually, as i mentioned, in early report in tebo, we're -- just like any technology -- i'll give as example, go back to saps. for the saps getting to the customer using for production, it will take more than two years.
right? so tebo will follow that trend. right? so i think the -- as i said, q2 last quarter, we're achieving together with a customer very good data, and -- which is through our hard working, closely collaboration with the customer and also modify hardware, modify parameter, modify processes, data -- i mean, process condition. so that will show our tebo is very effective in removing small particles and also removing the contamination without damaging the structure. right? with this good data, we'll continue working with the customer, and we'll continue to apply more and more steps.
and then eventually, they're going to buy more of our tool because of the more steps and more of expansion in their capacity. they need a tool. right? that's for our current customer. and with -- again, same thing i said with the tahoe, same kind of path.
as soon as one customer had a repeat order coming and overall data come out, and the other new customer like say, what's going on there. right? so we expect that that's moment, a checking point. we've got additional new customer coming. so anyway, i think that bottom line, at this moment, i should say all the pattern wafer, there's no -- any technology kind of apply or physical agitation to that tiny structure.
right? we're going to control their bubble temperature, control their -- our tebo technology, we're very promising or we're very confident this technology will play a big role, especially cleaning small particles, tiny particle into the trench, between the trench, above the trench or into the deeper layer. so it's really a critical technology when the people are moving to five-nano or three-nano, even down the road, right, no matter it's a finfet or nano wear. and so we're very promise. we're very optimistic about technology.
eventually, it become mainstream technology to remodel this kind of a critical application.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
fabulous. and then lastly, speaking about of optimism, i think you guys currently have, i think, roughly $350 million in annual revenue production capacity already. is that number still correct?
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
that's correct. as we announced before, we have two factories right now. first factory, about $100 million. our second factory, around $250 million.
so added together, it would be a $350 million revenue capability for a year. yes. that's correct.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. and then to the optimism part. given the fact that you're only a hundred million a year company today with another $250 million in capacity yet available, we're looking at adding future production and future space potentially in the near future. so with that in mind, what is your guide as multiyear outlook and objective for market share goals in the $3 billion cleaning market, as well as the $500 million advanced packaging market?
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
great point. right? and so if you look at our tam here, our cleaning market totaled $3 billion with our current product, which is, i call it, a critical process. our saps, tebo and also the tahoe, we think, about are -- total tam is about 50% of that. and also with additional where cleaning -- 3d market is getting, especially front- and then back-end together, that's a roughly $0.5 billion tam market.
so we have a real huge market. obviously, continue with innovation, new technology, we'll take more market -- increase the tam market, too. so it's a real good future for us. and where is that? that's why expecting -- we're trying to building manufacture capacity.
and further, we're going to also increase our sales capability both inside china, outside china. we put -- do believe our technology will be needed by everybody, every fab in the world. so that's why we're going to make our early preparation and for those time comes. and as to the, i should say, the sales revenue increase, it's hard to give you a future, but i can give you a past.
right? in the last five, six years, our annual compound increased about 60% of annual base. again, that trend, i should say, obviously, it depends on the future how we execute the business. and we want to maintain -- we want to get kind of a good increase to our revenue until we reach a certain, i call, saturation point. next three, four, five years, that'd be the growth, right, the growth period for us.
so we're very excited. we're going to prepare for that of course.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst

david wang -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, gary, and welcome everyone to today's call. i'm very pleased with our second-quarter results. business momentum was strong with record revenue, solid bottom-line growth and a healthy cash balance. our results demonstrate the growing strength of our technology, product offering and production scale as we continue on our mission to become a major supplier of capital equipment to the semiconductor industry.
revenue grew to $29 million, up 39% from last year. our strong top line, good growth margin and disciplined spending resulted in high-teens operating margin for the quarter. total shipments rebounded to $33 million, up more than 50%. we ended the quarter with $27.6 million of cash.
so far, 2019 played out better than expected. while the industry is moving through a fairly normal inventory cycle, our customers continued to invest in new capacity with many still in early stage of their production ramps. we are filling our production. we have a solid delivery in q2 from our second factory.
we plan to continue with a very busy second half. we have received promising initial results for tahoe from the evaluating tool at our lead development customer. we also began shipments of two new advanced ecp tools. we are proud to have announced our fifth significant customer, a large, china-based entrant to the dram industry.
and we're continuing to see encouraging order activity, recent order of our tools to be delivered in q4 and early next -- early 2020. we also have a solid indication for growth in 2020 and beyond. moving on slide 4, our success starts with our customers. they choose acm technology to help drive their own production capability.
we help them achieve their operational excellency needed to compete in global semiconductor markets. we consider the location of acm shanghai's world-class r&d team and production facility to be a key differentiator that put us in proximity to some of the largest fab projects in the world. last month, we announced our newest customer, an emerging, china-based dram maker. this new customer placed their purchase order for their first saps v system.
we plan to deliver it in the fourth quarter. acm was selected for its high performance, its technology road map and, most importantly, expected improvements to the production yields. we provide our customer with a proven fast-cleaning solution that will remove killer defect in more than 20 different type of cleaning steps. as with our other customer, we intend to help our newest customer achieve a successful production ramp.
as they ramp, we expect a flowing order for production-level tools. let me now discuss our significant customers. i will start with sk hynix, the no. 2 global dram supplier.
sk hynix was acm's first major customer, a strong testament to acm's proven technology and ability to improve production yields. we started with just a few production steps. now our tools are used in more than 20 steps as they progress to more advanced nodes. demand was solid from sk hynix in the first half.
we do not expect additional demand in the second half. next, let me discuss ymtc. they are a major new producer of 3d nand. we are working closely to support ymtc as they scale their 3d nand production in wuhan.
we believe we are ymtc's largest single-wafer wet cleaning supplier. acm tools are being deployed in a significant number of cleaning steps. we see strong demand from ymtc in the second half of 2019 and beyond. our third major customer is huali part of the huahong group, a leading advanced foundry in china.
huali is a middle of a multiyear capacity expansion. they are a great customer with a production near our current orders. the huahong group is adding capacity at its leading-edge node and is also building a new fab in wuxi. we are participating in both projects.
we also have a number of the first tool demo system at huali for some of our newer product offerings. huali has been a good contributor so far this year, and we expect to increase delivery in the second half. finally, let me discuss the smic, the largest foundry in china. they have several strategically located fabs in china and western europe.
smic has been a relatively small customers so far this year. however, we expect an incremental revenue opportunity next year as they're moving toward more advanced nodes, including 14, 10-nano and beyond. we are honored to support the five major it manufacturers. we believe these customers can support solid growth for years to come as they scale capacity, deploy our tools in additional production steps and deploy more acm products such as tahoe, tebo and our newly announced front and back-end packaging trading products.
we remain focused on winning additional major customer by: first, demonstrating our advantage at the current customers; two, scaling our production capacity; three, increase our skills, effort -- our sales effort to show the yield benefits delivered by acm's innovative and differentiated technologies. i will now provide an update on some of the new product activity on slide 5 and 6. we delivered our first tahoe demo tour to a strategic customer in january of this year and are pleased with the initial evaluation results. tahoe incorporates a unique and patented technology for acm to deliver a high cleaning performance while using one-tenth of the sulfuric acid typically used by conventional high-temperature, single-wafer cleaning tools.
because of the environment and the cost benefit, we continue to see tremendous interest in tahoe from our current customer base, as well as several new prospects. tahoe is excellent example of our focus on differentiated, patent-protected product offerings. we are encouraged by initial test results, and we remain in track for the customer acceptance in coming quarters. we expect that tahoe will eventually become a mainstream product that solve cost and the environmental challenges faced by customers for post-cmp cleaning and post-action cleaning when moving to advanced nodes.
tebo update, through close teamwork between acm and the customer, we have optimized multiple hardware and process parameter and obtained very promising results on tebo during the second quarter. this customer has reached particle removal efficiency, or pre, of 100% on the production pattern wafers. the customer is very happy with the results to see if -- for future capacity adds. we expect that this will result in orders next year.
next, on slide 6, we are encouraged by initial customer response to the two electroplating products that we introduced in march. the ultra ecp ap is a back-end assembly tool used for applying copper, tin and nickel to wafer at die level before packaging. the ap delivers a more uniform metal layer at a notch area by incorporating our proprietary technology. this uniformity is critical and deliver better yields and a greater plating efficiency.
it will be deployed not only in bump, but also in fan-out, 2.5d, 3d, in a pillar and other new 3d advanced packaging applications. the ultra ecp map is used in front-end wafer fabrication process. it uses our proprietary technology to deliver world-class electrochemical copper plating for copper interconnection application. the map offers the improved gap-filling performance for plating on an ultra-thin seed layer.
this enables continuously reducing metal pitch and therefore enhance the density of finfet and nano devices. we believe this is mission critical for advanced nodes at five-nano, three-nano and beyond. as i mentioned on our last call in q1, we received a repeat purchase order for two ecp ap tools from one of our major packaging customers. we also received our first two purchase order for ecp map from a key foundry customer.
their products are off to a good start as we successfully delivered one ap tool in q1 and one map tool in q2. we expect to deliver one more in the coming months. we believe that advanced 3d market represent a great growth opportunity. the tam for both ecp ap and ecp map is around usd 0.5 billion.
this is a new market, young cleaning tools, which is a $3 billion tam. we are in an excellent position to capitalize on the 3d opportunity. beyond these new products, our engineering team continue to work closely with our customer to advance our technology and broaden our product road map, which will further support their production goals. our internal road map now extending to several major new products over the next several years.
we remain committed to balancing our near-term profitability with investment to drive longer-term growth. we're looking forward to sharing some of these new products with you in the future once we have advanced some of these more promising product count set to first tool demo system for customer's evaluation. i will now discuss two recent strategic developments. please turn to slide 7.
first, let me update you on the shanghai star market listing. on july 22, the first 25 stocks began trading on the star market. recall that just prior, on june '17, we announced a plan to list the share of acm shanghai on new star market. we are now even more confident that this will prove a positive development for acm and its shareholders.
as a first step qualifying for the listing, we also announced a private investment of $27.3 million into acm shanghai subsidiary at a pre-money valuation of usd 675 million. our motivation for this plan is fairly simple. we believe that this what enable acm to, first, access local capital in our primary market, which is china; second, take advantage of a favorable valuation in the star market; and third, raising our profile with the regional customer and supply chain. since we call in june, we have submitted our business application to the ministry of their commerce in shanghai, and we expect the funding to be complete later in the third quarter.
big picture, acm research is committed to the global market opportunity. while industry growth is now centered in china, we expect 60% of the industrial capital spending to take place outside china market at least through 2025. for that reason, where we begun plans to further expand our lone china business. of course, we have the hynix now, and then we want to add one to three major customers in the coming years from either taiwan, u.s., europe, japan and korea.
we fully believe the best structure to achieve our goal is for acm research to remain not listed. we will maintain 80% or more ownership in acm shanghai after star market ipo. finally, i want to share an important, new development in our long-term production plan. as we look out several years, we begin -- we believe we may need to add even more manufacturing capacity beyond our two current facilities, which are shown on slide 8.
planning is at an early stage. we have located a potential site in shanghai at which we could add a third factory and r&d center. we're in negotiations with the developer and government authorities and could reach agreement before year end. should we move forward, the plan could require capital spending for the land this year or next.
to conclude, i'm positive on opportunity ahead of us and confident that we are in an excellent position to participate in the build-out of next-generation fabs for years to come. we have to build a strong foundation with the strategic semiconductor customers who are deploying our tools and scale in some of their most advanced production lines. and we expect to win new customers around the world as industry progress to more advanced nodes, three-dimensional architecture and 3d advanced packages. let me now turn the call over to lisa, who will discuss financial results in more detail.
lisa?
lisa feng -- chief accounting officer and interim chief financial officer
thank you, david, and good day, everyone. i will review financial highlights and then turn it back to david to discuss our outlook. all figures are for the second quarter and all comparison is against the same period last year, unless i state otherwise. as a reminder, our non-gaap financial results i'm discussing excluding stock-based compensation.
for a reconciliation of non-gaap financial results to the most directly comparable gaap financial results, please see last night earning release. you can find it posted in the investor relations section of our website. the reconciliations are also including as an exhibit to the current report on form 8-k that we filed with the sec yesterday. please go to slide 9, where we will start with the revenue.
revenue was $29 million, up 39%. growth was driven by solid demand for our single-wafer cleaning equipment and our back-end tools. we had customer acceptances of our first tools that have shipped in the prior periods. total shipments were $33 million, compared to $21 million in the year-ago quarter and the $14 million last quarter.
the significant sequential increase in shipments was driven by solid demand for repeat and the first two deliveries. gross margin was 45.3%, which was slight above our normal expectation of 40% to 45%. this compares to 41.8% a year ago and the 43.1% in the march quarter. we expect gross margin to continue to vary on a quarterly basis due to the product mix and the manufacturing utilization.
gaap operating expenses were $8.5 million, up 32.5% on the same period last year. non-gaap operating expenses were $7.9 million, up from $6.2 million in the same period last year and up from $5.9 million last quarter. growth in operating expenses was driven primarily by r&d and the general and administration expenses. r&d expenses were higher as we increased investment in new product development.
gaap operating income was $4.7 million, compared to $2.3 million in the second quarter of 2018. our gaap operating margin was 16.1%, compared to 11.2% in the same quarter last year and 11% last quarter. non-gaap operating income was $5.3 million versus $2.5 million a year ago. our non-gaap operating margin was 18.2%, compared to 12% in the same quarter last year and the 14.6% last quarter.
other income was $0.5 million due to the foreign exchange gains on our working capital due to a strong dollar versus renminbi in the quarter. gaap net income was $4.3 million, compared to $3.2 million last year and $1.9 million last quarter. non-gaap net income was $4.9 million, compared to $3.4 million last year and the $2.6 million last quarter. stock-based compensation was approximately $0.6 million.
gaap net income per diluted share was $0.23, compared to $0.18 in the year-ago period. non-gaap net income diluted share was $0.26, compared to $0.19 in the year-ago period. now i will review the balance sheet. we ended quarter 2 with $27.6 million in cash which is essentially flat quarter over quarter.
we ended the quarter with $15.1 million in short-term borrowings, up from $5.8 million last quarter. we ended the quarter with $45.5 million of inventories. finished goods was $13 million, essentially flat when compared to the first quarter. raw materials inventory grew in the quarter to support the strong shipments planned for the second half of the year.
cash flow from operations was negative $1.4 million. the cash outflow was due primarily to increased inventory and the receivables versus the first quarter. capital expenditures were $0.2 million. i will now turn the call back to david to discussing our outlook.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, lisa. please go to slide 10. we are very pleased with our results. we are monitoring trends in the broader semiconductor market.
i remain optimistic at the way we're receiving strong orders and demand forecasts from our customers. we are excited by our business prospects and remain committed to gaining share with new products, new customers and more production steps. for 2019, we're raising our revenue outlook to usd 105 million, representing more than 40% annual growth. this is an increase of $5 million from the guidance we provided on last quarter's call.
our outlook reflects strong demand from our existing customers. we have a good visibility for the remain of the year due to solid order and forecasts provided by our key customers. to conclude, our strong results show that we are exciting our strategy -- executing our strategy; we are participating in the growth of the major new ic fabs; we are ramping production at our new factory; and we continue to deliver innovative, new products. we remain committed to achieving our vision of become a major player in the semiconductor equipment market.
let's now open the call for any questions that you may have. operator, please go ahead.

[operator instructions] we have the first question coming from the line of suji desilva from roth capital. please go ahead.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hello, david, lisa, mark. congratulations on the progress here. very, very strong.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
lisa feng -- chief accounting officer and interim chief financial officer
thank you.
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
thanks, suji.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
thirty three million of shipments to be recognized in the second half of '19. does that provide you very good visibility into the remaining '19 guidance or whether there would be a meaningful portion that would be out into the 2020 time frame?
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
yes. ok. suji, actually, look at our -- as i said, in the second half, we have a very good order receiving. also, we have a very high kind of a delivery schedule, too.
so obviously, we look at the second and third quarter and the fourth quarter. we think the third quarter will be heavier than the fourth quarter, right? and also, we see some order or forecasts where we either deliver end of q4 or probably come to the early q1 next year. so we're very kind of excited about this customer forecast and also our production capability.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok.
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
yes.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
and then on --
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
there's just one thing i would add.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
go ahead, mark.
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
oh, suji, just to add -- yes, sorry about that. but just to add is i think you were asking, too, if we thought some of the first tools we delivered here in the first half would be driving revenue for the second half. and usually, it takes two to four quarters for a first tool for recognition. so our second half, as david said, is -- a lot of it is shipment based.
and yes, the first tools we shipped in the first half of the year, we would think, would be more of next year-type recognition events.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. great. and then also on the shipments, are they spread evenly across foundry and memory customers? or is there a concentration on one side versus the other?
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
actually, looking at our customer, i mean, we do have our -- i call the the memory house and also have our foundry. and actually, our second half, you got mixing, right? mixing of the -- there's a nano company and also the foundry. pretty good mixing actually in the second half. as i said, our first customer, sk hynix, also a delivery in q1 and q2 time line, and we're not expect additional deliver for sk hynix in q3, q4.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
right. you said that. ok. great.
ok. and then a question on the tahoe products. are additional -- i know you have one customer trialing it now. are additional customers purposely -- or are you purposely waiting for that first customer's acceptance? in other words 2020? and are multiple customers kind of waiting on that event order? is that how this is going to work out? or the first customer acceptance is really the trigger for additional customers?
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
yes. that's the typical pattern. right? and looking at our history, it also showed that pattern. normally, first customer take in a tool, and other customers they'll be waiting for the result.
right? so also, they're first waiting for results; secondly, they're waiting for repeat order. so i think there's more. as i mentioned, we've got a very promising data from first customer, and we're continually improving further excellency and also improving more of our yield data in the coming quarters. so with that data, we are confident and -- we'll have a repeat order from first customer.
but then there may be -- it depends on other customer. if they're -- like our data, maybe they're now waiting for second order -- second repeat order to come out. they can make a decision, too. so we do have, as you say, a few customer lined up, and we're going to present our -- improve the results and -- to see what's their reaction.
mark, anything you want to add to this?
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. now, but --
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
that's good. that's -- i think you covered it, david, yes.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. great. and then just one thing i didn't clarify before. i just want to make sure.
is ultra-c tahoe complementary to saps and tebo? or is it a replacement for it? is it --
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
ok. so the -- so suji, basically, tahoe, partly -- i mean, tahoe is a part that's basically used as -- for sulfuric acid, process. right? most of their process as supposed to action and also their -- post their, i should say, their cmp. and there's some -- also some -- a little bit metal removing process.
but anyway, most metals process. at this moment, our tahoe -- our saps -- tebo didn't apply for those steps. and i should say, previously, they divide the market. however, there might be listed in structures and process that need or require adding tebo and saps the further you consider, i call, the performance.
so anyway, that's adding additional performances for that. but at this moment, our -- i should say most are -- we're sulfuric acid. and with this tahoe product, we'll meet the customer requirements.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. ok. and then last question. it's exciting to see your fifth customer here, dram customer.
can you talk about the number of steps relatively -- not to go numbers but just whether 3d nand or dram has more steps that are required at cleaning, which one's more intensive in terms of use of your tools or whether they're both pretty similar.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
well, in general, i see that is -- obviously, dram process are more complex than the 3d nand process. so therefore, their need a cleaning step is more in a dram process. right? so -- however, there are different challenging. right? for instance, if we look in the 3d nand, the -- they're multilayer, right, 128-layer, whatever in the future, 250-layer that deep hole or that sales structure, that deep-hole cleaning becomes challenging, too, right? and so i should say that generally speaking, obviously dram has more of a cleaner step than 3d.
however, for the specific or deep hole, that's a cleaning challenge, which is, i -- we believe, our saps technology exactly designed for those deep-hole layer and their particle removal. right? that's our strong point.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
all right. thanks, david. thanks, guys.
operator
we have our next question from the line of mark miller from the benchmark co. please go ahead.
mark miller -- the benchmark company -- analyst
congratulations on another good report. i just was wondering if you can give a little more color on the eval tools, how many you have out there and how do they break out in terms of tahoe and saps, etc.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
ok. well, so ok, the -- probably i can give you -- i cannot give all the number right at this moment. i can tell we have a tahoe system on an eval tool right now. and also, we have the copper 3d map, right, for the foundry application.
that's an eval tool. right? and the -- that's a major new product. and also, we do have some other eval tools, which is the existing product, and then -- which is a new customer. and they're -- because they take a first tool, they have to make the eval.
for instance, this new fifth customer dram company we're going to deliver their first tool, it's actually a mature tool. but it's also considered eval because of the first customer. so i can say there are at least three in hand right now. actually, we have more than other number in here, but i cannot give you each one or who each customer it is.
right? mark?
mark miller -- the benchmark company -- analyst
ok. r&d costs, are they going to be trending up for the rest of the year?
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
yes. i can hit that, mark. so yes, we expect our overall opex to trend up a little bit from the first half of the year, and it'll be weighted to -- some of the growth will be weighted more toward r&d. yes.
mark miller -- the benchmark company -- analyst
that's right. thank you.
operator
sir, we have the next question coming from the line of christian schwab, craig-hallum capital group. please go ahead.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
hey, guys. congratulations on another fabulous quarter. thank you for all those specific customer commentary that you gave. it's nicely refreshing.
as you look at sk hynix, do you have an opinion yet on whether their purchasing or spending with you will be up on a year-over-year basis in 2020 versus '19?
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
ok. well, it's really hard to say at the moment, right, looking at the dram pricing. and obviously, the dram market today has kind of people concerns. so especially, there's a trade conflict between japan and taiwan.
right? i mean japan and also korea, too. that all impact spending and also their future fab spending for hynix. i should say at this moment this year, well, pretty -- say that is our first half year, very busy with supplying tool to the hynix and the second half pretty empty. for next year at this moment, it's way too early to see that.
by our -- i mean, i worked with hynix for many, many years. it's hard for them to say next year, we'll have no spending. but we still think they are going to continue spending there. they'll spend over -- higher than this year or versus -- lower than this year.
it really depends on their plan. by the same report -- if you look in the same report, we have some indication. they're going to spend probably higher than this year, probably equal to the last year. right? but anyway, these are all the reporting projection.
i can see that probably we'll give you more update at the year end. or beginning next year, we'll give you more of our forecasts for our customer.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
great. as it relates to the tahoe and the initial evaluation results that you and the customer are very pleased with, in the last quarter you guys made commentary that you would expect material revenue with that customer for tahoe in 2020. i would assume, since the evaluation results, everyone's happy with -- that that would still be the case.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think you that said a very good point, right? and as i mentioned, we have a very promising result, and i can see that they are tahoe's human data, very close to their single-wafer hard sdm's single-wafer data. so that's what the real -- in the process what demonstrate tahoe have a similar capability, but we'll use only one-tenth of chemistry. right? so that's why the customer really like it.
as to our first tool, and we're packing typically, i should say, eight to 12 months. so assuming probably either end of this year or beginning next year, we'll finish the qualification of first customer. and then obviously, we're expecting repeat order from the same customer and additional order from other customer. right? and for the other customer, we're going to record a revenue of probably -- it depends on the order, right? normally, new customer take six months.
so some of those are new order from tahoe will help definitely to add on our revenue next year. and at this moment, probably too early to say. it depends on when orders start, when we deliver. right? so that's our projection.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. great. and then on the tebo, you guys talked about orders next year for your next-generation cleaning tool. can you remind us, any asp differences in the next-generation tool or gross margin differences versus the previous cleaning tools or asps and gross margins, the same just increased performance?
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
yes. ok. actually, as i mentioned, in early report in tebo, we're -- just like any technology -- i'll give as example, go back to saps. for the saps getting to the customer using for production, it will take more than two years.
right? so tebo will follow that trend. right? so i think the -- as i said, q2 last quarter, we're achieving together with a customer very good data, and -- which is through our hard working, closely collaboration with the customer and also modify hardware, modify parameter, modify processes, data -- i mean, process condition. so that will show our tebo is very effective in removing small particles and also removing the contamination without damaging the structure. right? with this good data, we'll continue working with the customer, and we'll continue to apply more and more steps.
and then eventually, they're going to buy more of our tool because of the more steps and more of expansion in their capacity. they need a tool. right? that's for our current customer. and with -- again, same thing i said with the tahoe, same kind of path.
as soon as one customer had a repeat order coming and overall data come out, and the other new customer like say, what's going on there. right? so we expect that that's moment, a checking point. we've got additional new customer coming. so anyway, i think that bottom line, at this moment, i should say all the pattern wafer, there's no -- any technology kind of apply or physical agitation to that tiny structure.
right? we're going to control their bubble temperature, control their -- our tebo technology, we're very promising or we're very confident this technology will play a big role, especially cleaning small particles, tiny particle into the trench, between the trench, above the trench or into the deeper layer. so it's really a critical technology when the people are moving to five-nano or three-nano, even down the road, right, no matter it's a finfet or nano wear. and so we're very promise. we're very optimistic about technology.
eventually, it become mainstream technology to remodel this kind of a critical application.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
fabulous. and then lastly, speaking about of optimism, i think you guys currently have, i think, roughly $350 million in annual revenue production capacity already. is that number still correct?
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
that's correct. as we announced before, we have two factories right now. first factory, about $100 million. our second factory, around $250 million.
so added together, it would be a $350 million revenue capability for a year. yes. that's correct.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. and then to the optimism part. given the fact that you're only a hundred million a year company today with another $250 million in capacity yet available, we're looking at adding future production and future space potentially in the near future. so with that in mind, what is your guide as multiyear outlook and objective for market share goals in the $3 billion cleaning market, as well as the $500 million advanced packaging market?
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
great point. right? and so if you look at our tam here, our cleaning market totaled $3 billion with our current product, which is, i call it, a critical process. our saps, tebo and also the tahoe, we think, about are -- total tam is about 50% of that. and also with additional where cleaning -- 3d market is getting, especially front- and then back-end together, that's a roughly $0.5 billion tam market.
so we have a real huge market. obviously, continue with innovation, new technology, we'll take more market -- increase the tam market, too. so it's a real good future for us. and where is that? that's why expecting -- we're trying to building manufacture capacity.
and further, we're going to also increase our sales capability both inside china, outside china. we put -- do believe our technology will be needed by everybody, every fab in the world. so that's why we're going to make our early preparation and for those time comes. and as to the, i should say, the sales revenue increase, it's hard to give you a future, but i can give you a past.
right? in the last five, six years, our annual compound increased about 60% of annual base. again, that trend, i should say, obviously, it depends on the future how we execute the business. and we want to maintain -- we want to get kind of a good increase to our revenue until we reach a certain, i call, saturation point. next three, four, five years, that'd be the growth, right, the growth period for us.
so we're very excited. we're going to prepare for that of course.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst

david wang -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, gary, and welcome everyone to today's call. i'm very pleased with our second-quarter results. business momentum was strong with record revenue, solid bottom-line growth and a healthy cash balance. our results demonstrate the growing strength of our technology, product offering and production scale as we continue on our mission to become a major supplier of capital equipment to the semiconductor industry.
revenue grew to $29 million, up 39% from last year. our strong top line, good growth margin and disciplined spending resulted in high-teens operating margin for the quarter. total shipments rebounded to $33 million, up more than 50%. we ended the quarter with $27.6 million of cash.
so far, 2019 played out better than expected. while the industry is moving through a fairly normal inventory cycle, our customers continued to invest in new capacity with many still in early stage of their production ramps. we are filling our production. we have a solid delivery in q2 from our second factory.
we plan to continue with a very busy second half. we have received promising initial results for tahoe from the evaluating tool at our lead development customer. we also began shipments of two new advanced ecp tools. we are proud to have announced our fifth significant customer, a large, china-based entrant to the dram industry.
and we're continuing to see encouraging order activity, recent order of our tools to be delivered in q4 and early next -- early 2020. we also have a solid indication for growth in 2020 and beyond. moving on slide 4, our success starts with our customers. they choose acm technology to help drive their own production capability.
we help them achieve their operational excellency needed to compete in global semiconductor markets. we consider the location of acm shanghai's world-class r&d team and production facility to be a key differentiator that put us in proximity to some of the largest fab projects in the world. last month, we announced our newest customer, an emerging, china-based dram maker. this new customer placed their purchase order for their first saps v system.
we plan to deliver it in the fourth quarter. acm was selected for its high performance, its technology road map and, most importantly, expected improvements to the production yields. we provide our customer with a proven fast-cleaning solution that will remove killer defect in more than 20 different type of cleaning steps. as with our other customer, we intend to help our newest customer achieve a successful production ramp.
as they ramp, we expect a flowing order for production-level tools. let me now discuss our significant customers. i will start with sk hynix, the no. 2 global dram supplier.
sk hynix was acm's first major customer, a strong testament to acm's proven technology and ability to improve production yields. we started with just a few production steps. now our tools are used in more than 20 steps as they progress to more advanced nodes. demand was solid from sk hynix in the first half.
we do not expect additional demand in the second half. next, let me discuss ymtc. they are a major new producer of 3d nand. we are working closely to support ymtc as they scale their 3d nand production in wuhan.
we believe we are ymtc's largest single-wafer wet cleaning supplier. acm tools are being deployed in a significant number of cleaning steps. we see strong demand from ymtc in the second half of 2019 and beyond. our third major customer is huali part of the huahong group, a leading advanced foundry in china.
huali is a middle of a multiyear capacity expansion. they are a great customer with a production near our current orders. the huahong group is adding capacity at its leading-edge node and is also building a new fab in wuxi. we are participating in both projects.
we also have a number of the first tool demo system at huali for some of our newer product offerings. huali has been a good contributor so far this year, and we expect to increase delivery in the second half. finally, let me discuss the smic, the largest foundry in china. they have several strategically located fabs in china and western europe.
smic has been a relatively small customers so far this year. however, we expect an incremental revenue opportunity next year as they're moving toward more advanced nodes, including 14, 10-nano and beyond. we are honored to support the five major it manufacturers. we believe these customers can support solid growth for years to come as they scale capacity, deploy our tools in additional production steps and deploy more acm products such as tahoe, tebo and our newly announced front and back-end packaging trading products.
we remain focused on winning additional major customer by: first, demonstrating our advantage at the current customers; two, scaling our production capacity; three, increase our skills, effort -- our sales effort to show the yield benefits delivered by acm's innovative and differentiated technologies. i will now provide an update on some of the new product activity on slide 5 and 6. we delivered our first tahoe demo tour to a strategic customer in january of this year and are pleased with the initial evaluation results. tahoe incorporates a unique and patented technology for acm to deliver a high cleaning performance while using one-tenth of the sulfuric acid typically used by conventional high-temperature, single-wafer cleaning tools.
because of the environment and the cost benefit, we continue to see tremendous interest in tahoe from our current customer base, as well as several new prospects. tahoe is excellent example of our focus on differentiated, patent-protected product offerings. we are encouraged by initial test results, and we remain in track for the customer acceptance in coming quarters. we expect that tahoe will eventually become a mainstream product that solve cost and the environmental challenges faced by customers for post-cmp cleaning and post-action cleaning when moving to advanced nodes.
tebo update, through close teamwork between acm and the customer, we have optimized multiple hardware and process parameter and obtained very promising results on tebo during the second quarter. this customer has reached particle removal efficiency, or pre, of 100% on the production pattern wafers. the customer is very happy with the results to see if -- for future capacity adds. we expect that this will result in orders next year.
next, on slide 6, we are encouraged by initial customer response to the two electroplating products that we introduced in march. the ultra ecp ap is a back-end assembly tool used for applying copper, tin and nickel to wafer at die level before packaging. the ap delivers a more uniform metal layer at a notch area by incorporating our proprietary technology. this uniformity is critical and deliver better yields and a greater plating efficiency.
it will be deployed not only in bump, but also in fan-out, 2.5d, 3d, in a pillar and other new 3d advanced packaging applications. the ultra ecp map is used in front-end wafer fabrication process. it uses our proprietary technology to deliver world-class electrochemical copper plating for copper interconnection application. the map offers the improved gap-filling performance for plating on an ultra-thin seed layer.
this enables continuously reducing metal pitch and therefore enhance the density of finfet and nano devices. we believe this is mission critical for advanced nodes at five-nano, three-nano and beyond. as i mentioned on our last call in q1, we received a repeat purchase order for two ecp ap tools from one of our major packaging customers. we also received our first two purchase order for ecp map from a key foundry customer.
their products are off to a good start as we successfully delivered one ap tool in q1 and one map tool in q2. we expect to deliver one more in the coming months. we believe that advanced 3d market represent a great growth opportunity. the tam for both ecp ap and ecp map is around usd 0.5 billion.
this is a new market, young cleaning tools, which is a $3 billion tam. we are in an excellent position to capitalize on the 3d opportunity. beyond these new products, our engineering team continue to work closely with our customer to advance our technology and broaden our product road map, which will further support their production goals. our internal road map now extending to several major new products over the next several years.
we remain committed to balancing our near-term profitability with investment to drive longer-term growth. we're looking forward to sharing some of these new products with you in the future once we have advanced some of these more promising product count set to first tool demo system for customer's evaluation. i will now discuss two recent strategic developments. please turn to slide 7.
first, let me update you on the shanghai star market listing. on july 22, the first 25 stocks began trading on the star market. recall that just prior, on june '17, we announced a plan to list the share of acm shanghai on new star market. we are now even more confident that this will prove a positive development for acm and its shareholders.
as a first step qualifying for the listing, we also announced a private investment of $27.3 million into acm shanghai subsidiary at a pre-money valuation of usd 675 million. our motivation for this plan is fairly simple. we believe that this what enable acm to, first, access local capital in our primary market, which is china; second, take advantage of a favorable valuation in the star market; and third, raising our profile with the regional customer and supply chain. since we call in june, we have submitted our business application to the ministry of their commerce in shanghai, and we expect the funding to be complete later in the third quarter.
big picture, acm research is committed to the global market opportunity. while industry growth is now centered in china, we expect 60% of the industrial capital spending to take place outside china market at least through 2025. for that reason, where we begun plans to further expand our lone china business. of course, we have the hynix now, and then we want to add one to three major customers in the coming years from either taiwan, u.s., europe, japan and korea.
we fully believe the best structure to achieve our goal is for acm research to remain not listed. we will maintain 80% or more ownership in acm shanghai after star market ipo. finally, i want to share an important, new development in our long-term production plan. as we look out several years, we begin -- we believe we may need to add even more manufacturing capacity beyond our two current facilities, which are shown on slide 8.
planning is at an early stage. we have located a potential site in shanghai at which we could add a third factory and r&d center. we're in negotiations with the developer and government authorities and could reach agreement before year end. should we move forward, the plan could require capital spending for the land this year or next.
to conclude, i'm positive on opportunity ahead of us and confident that we are in an excellent position to participate in the build-out of next-generation fabs for years to come. we have to build a strong foundation with the strategic semiconductor customers who are deploying our tools and scale in some of their most advanced production lines. and we expect to win new customers around the world as industry progress to more advanced nodes, three-dimensional architecture and 3d advanced packages. let me now turn the call over to lisa, who will discuss financial results in more detail.
lisa?
lisa feng -- chief accounting officer and interim chief financial officer
thank you, david, and good day, everyone. i will review financial highlights and then turn it back to david to discuss our outlook. all figures are for the second quarter and all comparison is against the same period last year, unless i state otherwise. as a reminder, our non-gaap financial results i'm discussing excluding stock-based compensation.
for a reconciliation of non-gaap financial results to the most directly comparable gaap financial results, please see last night earning release. you can find it posted in the investor relations section of our website. the reconciliations are also including as an exhibit to the current report on form 8-k that we filed with the sec yesterday. please go to slide 9, where we will start with the revenue.
revenue was $29 million, up 39%. growth was driven by solid demand for our single-wafer cleaning equipment and our back-end tools. we had customer acceptances of our first tools that have shipped in the prior periods. total shipments were $33 million, compared to $21 million in the year-ago quarter and the $14 million last quarter.
the significant sequential increase in shipments was driven by solid demand for repeat and the first two deliveries. gross margin was 45.3%, which was slight above our normal expectation of 40% to 45%. this compares to 41.8% a year ago and the 43.1% in the march quarter. we expect gross margin to continue to vary on a quarterly basis due to the product mix and the manufacturing utilization.
gaap operating expenses were $8.5 million, up 32.5% on the same period last year. non-gaap operating expenses were $7.9 million, up from $6.2 million in the same period last year and up from $5.9 million last quarter. growth in operating expenses was driven primarily by r&d and the general and administration expenses. r&d expenses were higher as we increased investment in new product development.
gaap operating income was $4.7 million, compared to $2.3 million in the second quarter of 2018. our gaap operating margin was 16.1%, compared to 11.2% in the same quarter last year and 11% last quarter. non-gaap operating income was $5.3 million versus $2.5 million a year ago. our non-gaap operating margin was 18.2%, compared to 12% in the same quarter last year and the 14.6% last quarter.
other income was $0.5 million due to the foreign exchange gains on our working capital due to a strong dollar versus renminbi in the quarter. gaap net income was $4.3 million, compared to $3.2 million last year and $1.9 million last quarter. non-gaap net income was $4.9 million, compared to $3.4 million last year and the $2.6 million last quarter. stock-based compensation was approximately $0.6 million.
gaap net income per diluted share was $0.23, compared to $0.18 in the year-ago period. non-gaap net income diluted share was $0.26, compared to $0.19 in the year-ago period. now i will review the balance sheet. we ended quarter 2 with $27.6 million in cash which is essentially flat quarter over quarter.
we ended the quarter with $15.1 million in short-term borrowings, up from $5.8 million last quarter. we ended the quarter with $45.5 million of inventories. finished goods was $13 million, essentially flat when compared to the first quarter. raw materials inventory grew in the quarter to support the strong shipments planned for the second half of the year.
cash flow from operations was negative $1.4 million. the cash outflow was due primarily to increased inventory and the receivables versus the first quarter. capital expenditures were $0.2 million. i will now turn the call back to david to discussing our outlook.
david wang -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, lisa. please go to slide 10. we are very pleased with our results. we are monitoring trends in the broader semiconductor market.
i remain optimistic at the way we're receiving strong orders and demand forecasts from our customers. we are excited by our business prospects and remain committed to gaining share with new products, new customers and more production steps. for 2019, we're raising our revenue outlook to usd 105 million, representing more than 40% annual growth. this is an increase of $5 million from the guidance we provided on last quarter's call.
our outlook reflects strong demand from our existing customers. we have a good visibility for the remain of the year due to solid order and forecasts provided by our key customers. to conclude, our strong results show that we are exciting our strategy -- executing our strategy; we are participating in the growth of the major new ic fabs; we are ramping production at our new factory; and we continue to deliver innovative, new products. we remain committed to achieving our vision of become a major player in the semiconductor equipment market.
let's now open the call for any questions that you may have. operator, please go ahead.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from quinn bolton of needham and company. please go ahead.
quinn bolton -- needham and company -- analyst
hi david, lisa and mark. congratulations on the really strong results out here in the third quarter. i guess david, my first question for you. i understand the upside in q3 was partly due to some accelerations or pull-ins from q4 into q3.
but i'm just kind of curious, as you look into the fourth quarter and you maintain your annual revenue target of 105 million, it implies revenues in the december quarter down to about 22 million. i think you pulled in tools to the third quarter. i guess i would have thought that that might have freed up some manufacturing slots that you could fill in with other customers. and so that fourth quarter drop seems pretty extreme.
can you talk about the ability to try and fill in those manufacturing slots that might deliver some upside to that $105 million target or the 22 million implied by our annual guidance? and then i've got a couple of follow-on questions.
david wang -- chairman, president, chief executive officer, and founder
great. thank you for the question. q3, actually we're shipping almost 43 million, right, total shipment. it's a very record high.
we're really excited for the power of the manufacturing capability and definitely, that is good record for us to be able to build such quantity. in q4, and the shipments that you mentioned were predicted 105 million of revenue. so we're definitely considering put a slot, a variable building there further even q1 deliver. it's a very good time for us to make more of quality control and also, we'll start building tool put some slot into the preparation building as we're receiving order and delivery to q1.
any other adding remark, mark and lisa?
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
i think that's a good answer. i wouldn't add anything else. quinn, you said you had some follow-on questions?
quinn bolton -- needham and company -- analyst
i guess looking into the tahoe and tebo evals that are going on, it sounds like you're making progress on both fronts. can you give us some sense today how many tahoe and tebo tools do you have in the field that represent opportunity for rev rec? and then it sounds like for both tools, you think you're in a position to start taking production orders in 2020. how much could tahoe and tebo contribute to next year's -- i know you haven't given a formal revenue guide, but how meaningful could that rev rec and follow-on production orders be for tahoe and tebo next year?
david wang -- chairman, president, chief executive officer, and founder
ok, great. quinn, actually tahoe, we have tool delivered in january this year. so the customer start to evaluation the tool. at this stage, they're still in the middle stage.
however, they do have initial data come out and some of the other more device yield data coming soon. so we see that customers like the result and they like our technology, and also especially like we're saving more than 80% of sulfuric acid, right. so with that satisfaction with the customer, we definitely anticipate the same customer will buy repeat order next year. and then, with that validate for the tahoe tool and we'll consider multiple actually order come from other additional new customer.
so now, we're approaching customer in china, customer in taiwan, customer in the u.s. and also customer in korea. the reason for that is because we believe tahoe tool is a significant environmental impact concern by made this single-wafer sulfuric acid, right. you can look at the people getting to the single-wafer sulfuric acid cleaner, the huge amount of the sulfuric acid has been consumption.
more importantly is for -- with treatment, those acids very difficult and for some country, you can put in landfill. but some other country cannot do that. you have [inaudible] with treatment and consumption of a lot of energy, a lot of cost. and so with that in mind, i think that will be the real revolution tool and for the custom adapter to really solving their big headache for the acid consumption or acid with treatment.
so regarding the tebo tool and as mentioned in our new series tool, we do meet progress and for tebo, and something i cannot disclose so far right now, because it was still in the patent application process. we shall see that tebo made tremendous progress. and as tebo going well with first customer and also anticipate the repeat order from this existing customer. and with this one custom evaluated tebo tool, i can see definitely more customer interest there, right, so that we see both tahoe and tebo will enter new shipments and also definitely revenue for next year.
so we're expecting those kind of activity will add -- boost our revenue for next year. mark, anything?
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
yes, i might add a few to that, quinn. i appreciate that. so on the -- you asked a little bit about the demo tools that are out there with customers. and so we broke out the finished goods inventory at a little over 18 million.
and that's carried at cost. if you took a reasonable gross margin on that, it would work out to about 36 million of revenue. and it's a range of tools. as david said, some are additional tools to our existing customer base.
some are actually into new customers. but if you look out to 2020, saps will be the big driver. of course, it's the main business now. but we see good incremental business from tahoe, tebo, and the ecp products.
so we'll give you the full guidance on the next quarter's call.
david wang -- chairman, president, chief executive officer, and founder
quinn, i want to add one thing here. we do have one ecp for front end plating tool will ship june this year. right, those tools will be qualified probably middle of next year or early next year and then we're expecting also revenue contribution or repeat order from existing customer and also probably for other new customer for the new shipment.
quinn bolton -- needham and company -- analyst
right.
david wang -- chairman, president, chief executive officer, and founder
thanks, quinn. maybe next question, operator.
operator
our next question is from patrick ho of stifel. please go ahead.
patrick ho -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thank you very much and congrats on a very nice quarter. maybe as a follow-up question to quinn's regarding the market environment. you saw some strong shipments and revenues from the existing customer base this quarter. qualitatively as we look at 2020, how are you looking at contributions from both tebo and tahoe, as well as the ecp tool as contributors to another growth year? is it just going to be a small incremental amount or do you see it as a big contributor to the growth in 2020?
david wang -- chairman, president, chief executive officer, and founder
patrick, good question. obviously, as i said, we have tebo. tahoe has been qualified by a customer. this is the first customer and as i mentioned, we're going to expect a repeat order from the existing customer with the qualified tool.
those tools i'm pretty sure will be regular revenue for next year. and but for any new tool, which his from new customer, i mean for the tahoe, tebo, ecp, that will be eventually we're past deliver and recognize the revenue upon acceptance. so this new customer next year, whether it's mpo, most likely will be coming as a shipment. now, we recognize revenue as we expect that pass.
so come to the point is definitely, as i said, two product ecp will add the revenue. however, we've added more new customer. so maybe the most -- bigger revenue come to the year 2021. but we still say next year [inaudible] shipment, contribute like a shipment.
mark, anything you want to add?
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
the only thing i'd add is, i mean, we talked a little bit about some of the industry analysts that are predicting kind of capacity adds at some of our bigger customers. and so we're busy. we think we're going to be pretty busy on our production schedules next year with our second factory. and david also pointed out that, in his prepared remarks, that we're looking at some land for longer-term production adds for longer-term capacity.
so we feel pretty good about growth from our -- mainly from our current products alone. but we see a pretty good contribution from tahoe, tebo next year.
patrick ho -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
and maybe either for lisa or mark in terms of my follow-up question, which is related to those new products. obviously, new products and acceptance from initial customers tend to have lower margins. you guys did a great job this quarter due to product mix. what are some of the efforts you can take to kind of soften some of those initial cost pressures that you typically see with new products or new customer acceptance?
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
you want to start?
david wang -- chairman, president, chief executive officer, and founder
i can start that. obviously, for the first tool, right, especially new tool, and there are certain -- we give the same here for the people to adapt a new product, new application. and we call it the first tool discount, right. as time -- as the tool qualification is going on and we'll give the regular pricing to reflect the value of the tool we give the customer.
so again, yes, we have certain pricing bidding. however, as the customer qualifies the tool and they like the tool, and also put more function and more mature, i call the additional mature design. and those tools get more revenue, more pricing on the market.
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
i'd just add, patrick, we're confident in our -- we talked about 40 to 45% kind of our gross margin model. if i look at the cost and the revenue associated with the demo tools that we have out there, i'm pretty comfortable with the gross margin of what's out there in the field.and we think as we ramp up these new products next year, the contribution will be well within our gross margin model. and longer-term, the new products should carry a better margin.
patrick ho -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thank you. maybe you're right guys. thanks, david.

the next question is from sujeeva desilva of roth capital. please go ahead.
sujeeva desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
so a couple things. on tebo, it seems like it's coming into the revenue line. can you remind us which nodes or applications tebo is more suited for versus saps, if there's a differentiation there?
david wang -- chairman, president, chief executive officer, and founder
ok. so basically, saps, we try to clean a flat wafer. most flat wafer is a major application. and tebo is more cleaner for the pads and wafer or with a trench structure or mirror inside.
so as i said, the customer with us, right now, they're qualified actually 28 nano large product. and but i should say that the technology we have for tebo definitely can be expandable to the smaller geometry. so as we go into the different customer and we see this technology, we'll get into some more geometry and further application.
sujeeva desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
and david, are there tebo applications for memory as well? are there certain memory technologies where tebo comes in?
david wang -- chairman, president, chief executive officer, and founder
there's a lot of also pattern structure in the memory site. they have a lot of structure in the gated site. and also, probably also in the capacity side too. so we do see that potential for using the tebo application.
sujeeva desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
and then on the manufacturing side, how many lines are you now running at fab 2 and what's the utilization? how close are you to needing that new land and facility built demand wise?
david wang -- chairman, president, chief executive officer, and founder
our manufacturing second factory, it's pretty busy right now. this moment, i should say -- and our line spot, you can holding 10 to 11 machine simultaneously. so that's the capacity we're doing right now. this moment, we're definitely manufacture a bunch of different toolsets and also, we have our new product and we manufacture there.
and also some other product, which we're developing right now. we'll manufacture there too. so it's very busy right now.
sujeeva desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
and then my last question is you mentioned a fifth customer, dram customer. can you update us on the status there, perhaps timing of shipments to that customer or if you're already started shipping machines there -- tools there for acceptance?
david wang -- chairman, president, chief executive officer, and founder
the fifth customer we're adding now, right. we did ship a machine in q3 timeline. the machine is in assembly or in the final -- i mean in the qualification right now. so, this is a faster machine and with our record data for yield improve, and also providing much better cleaning performance.
and we're expecting this tool will do a lot of enhancement for the new customers here at the site and also particular cleaning removal performance and enhancement.
sujeeva desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok thanks. congratulations on the strong quarter everybody.
david wang -- chairman, president, chief executive officer, and founder
thank you.

our next question is from the line of christian schwab of craig-hallum capital. please go ahead.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group lp -- analyst
great, thanks for taking my question. great quarter and another great year. i was just -- had one follow-up question kind of along the lines of what patrick was asking. as you guys sit here today, i know we're not giving guidance for 2020.
but can you give us your expectations, whether it's new customers and new tools or continued strong spending, in particular in china on current products, that gives you confidence in growth in 2020 today?
david wang -- chairman, president, chief executive officer, and founder
let me put it this way. we see our existing customer in china, they're still keeping their building plan. and you probably know that ymtc continue expansion. they are probably 50k next year.
and there also, we see the fifth dram customer, they're also expansion. and then you look at huali, they have a continual -- they're building up their two fabs, one in wuxi, one in shanghai. and as i see the smic, they're also starting building a fab right now. so we see the activity both happen in the fab in shanghai and also in beijing.
then as part of the high-end site, as we see their market recover, we hear something going on, not firm yet. but we do believe there's something going on next year for sure. so we are very -- for existing customer, we see a very positive sign 70,000 this year. and then also with our new add-in product, like we mentioned with tahoe and tebo, and also our ecp, both in front end, also back end at advanced packaging side application.
so we do have new product that we're adding to our revenue stream. so we're expecting another growth year next year with not just our existing product, with also new product. so we're very happy and very excited about next year. and we'll be very glad to announce the final number in the next earnings call.
and that's probably in the march timeline.
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
christian, just like to add and put kind of a different high level on there. we felt pretty good, obviously, about 40% growth in a challenging year for the industry. we had pretty strong -- you guys all know the dram player in the first half of the year who was really strong for us. and we didn't have much if anything in the second half here.
and so we've got -- a number of our big customers are still in their early middle stages. we don't really need a big recovery in the dram spending to drive good growth, if you look at our new products and where our early middle stage customers are.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group lp -- analyst
thank you for that clarity. no other questions. thanks.

your next question is from mark miller of benchmark. please go ahead.
mark miller -- benchmark -- analyst
hey, mark. let me add my congratulations on the quarter. you didn't provide a cash flow statement, at least in the information i received. i was just curious with the strong results you were cash flow from operations breakeven.
just was wondering what was going on with that.
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
thanks, mark. and we can give you a little detail. you'll see more coming out in the 10-q but look, i think as we talked about on the call, we had some acceleration into q3. and so we delivered a lot of product in the quarter.
and so we came our right about cash flow neutral from operations. looking out into q4, a lot of the products we delivered in q3, we expected collections and cash flow positive in q4.
mark miller -- benchmark -- analyst
just was wondering, based on your existing backlog and we talked a little about margins prior in this call. does that represent -- are those tools and backlog consistent with the margins that you've been recently reporting? you did say we're going to see higher margins on new products. i'm just wondering about the margin profile and the backlog.
mark mckechnie -- vice president, finance
you're asking about the tools -- the finished goods inventory. now, we're comfortable with the margin profile of those. we have pos that have specific prices tied to those. so we know what the price is for those.
and we're comfortable with the margin profile of those.
mark miller -- benchmark -- analyst
yeah. thank you.

david wang -- chairman, president, chief executive officer, and founder
thanks gary and welcome everyone to today's call. our third-quarter results mark another quarter of great financial results, new product development, and strategic progress. we delivered record revenue, record shipments, strong bottom line growth and we're strengthening our balance sheet. this result validated our technology, our spending product portfolio, and our ability to scale production.
we remain focused on our mission to become a major proprietor of technical equipment to the semiconductor industry. revenue growth of 33 million, up 44%. our customers push us to deliver high volume tools in the third quarter as they scale their own production capacity, with some key delivers accelerated from the fourth quarters. shipments were 43 million, up 33% year over year.
this includes first tool for new product to existing customer and also saps-v product to our newest and the fifth major customer, an emerging china-based dram producer. we expect this first tool to translate into revenue upon acceptance in future quarters, and more importantly, drive growth as they're moving into production. we ended the quarter with 47 million of cash, up from 27 million last quarter. we took the opportunity to build our balance sheet to better align with our corporate mission.
we are pleased with our u.s. capital reach, which has put us in a strong position to support our growth plans. this cash balance does not include the stock market, private equity investments, which we have chosen to segregate and hold in reserves. let's move to recent customer activity and technology developments.
please turn to slide 4. first, ymtc. we are working close to support ymtc's 3d nand production ramp in wuhan. industrial analysts predict that ymtc will ramp its monthly wafer production from 6,000 to 20,000 in 2019 and to 50,000 or more in 2020.
we believe we are ymtc's largest single-wafer wet cleaning supplier. acm tools are being deployed in a significant number of cleaning steps and we anticipate strong demand from ymtc in the quarters ahead. second is huali, also known as hlmc. it is a part of the huahong group, a leading advanced foundry in china.
huali is in early to middle stage of a multiyear capacity expansion. they are one of our key strategic customers with a production near our shanghai headquarters. huali is adding capacity at a leading-edge node and is completing the build out of a new fab in wuxi. we are participating in both projects, as they scale capacity and deploy our tools in their production.
we also have a number of first tool demo systems at huali for our newer product offerings. next, we added our fifth front end customer and a large china base entrance to dram industry. in july, this new customer placed the first order for saps-v first tool. we delivered the tool in q3.
this led us for compelling value proposition, yearly improvements, and a solid technology roadmap. this dram customer is in the early stage of their multiyear production plan and we feel well positioned to participate as they scale in 2020 and beyond. let's turn to slide 5. we see great growth opportunity with our new product.
let me start with an update on our ultra-c tahoe. technical trials are progressing well. our leading customer for tahoe has moved its first tool into the production environment. initial reports confirm that tahoe delivers the same cleaning performance of competitor's high temperature sulfuric acid single-wafer cleaner, but with much less consumption of sulfuric acid.
we anticipate customer acceptance and revenue recognition from tahoe in the coming quarters. we remain confident that tahoe tool will become a mainstream product that will solve current and future environmental challenges faced by customers. for tebo, we continue with our development work. this quarter, we made great technical progress to meet customer requirements for the combined removal of bigger small particles for 3d-patterned structure without damaging.
as a result, our tebo tool has been qualified for field production cleaner step with higher particle remove efficiency without damaging. we expect a good order for tebo in 2020. let's now turn to slide 6. we delivered two ecp ap tools during the third quarter to one of our major packaging customers.
their ultra ecp ap is a back-end assembly tool used for applying copper, tin, nickel to wafers at die level for packaging. the aps delivered more uniform metal layer in a large by incorporating our proprietary technology. this uniformly is critical and it has delivered better yield and greater cleaning efficiency. it will be deployed not only in pumping, but also in fan-out, 2.5d, 3d, in the portal and other 3d advanced packaging applications.
all of our products, saps, tahoe, tebo, and ecp share the same philosophy. acm focuses around bringing new technology to solve the problems of major semiconductor manufacturers. this product and our financial results demonstrate acm's capability to address production challenges in more advanced nodes and complex architectures. now, let's turn to several strategic developments.
to start, we're pleased with the reception of our [inaudible] equity offering. we intend using the capital primarily to fund our business outside of china and for strategic m&a. industry analysts predict china will represent over a quarter of industrial spending in 2020, making china the top spending country ahead of south korea, taiwan, japan, and north america. we have increased our effort to address the non-china market with the addition of a senior sales manager in north america, southeast asia.
we also plan to ramp our marketing efforts out of china beginning this quarter. we are also making steady progress with our shanghai stock market listing. we are encouraged by performance of the first batch of 34 ipos on the stock market. even with volatility, the valuation remains quite favorable and we are still targeting a listing of acm shanghai shares in the second half of next year.
finally, an update on our longer-term production plans. as we said on our last call, we are moving forward with plans for long-term production capacity. we are in later stage negotiation with the shanghai government authorities for agreement to purchase land for new factory and r&d centers. to conclude, i remain positive on the opportunities ahead of us and our ability to participate in a build-out of next-generation fabs for years to come.
we expect to win new customers around the world as industrial progress to more advanced nodes, free dimensional architecture, and 3d advanced packages. i would like to thank our customers, partners, and the shareholders for their continued support and confidence in acm research. i especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication. i will now turn the call over to lisa, who will discuss financial results in more detail.
lisa feng -- chief accounting officer
thank you, david and good day everyone. i'll review financial highlights and then turn back to david to discuss our outlook. all figures are for the third quarter and all comparisons are against the same period last year unless i state otherwise. as a reminder, the non-gaap financial results include stock-based compensation.
for a reconciliation of non-gaap financial results to the most direct comparable gaap financial results, please see the last slide of the earnings release, which you can find posted in the investor relations section of our website. the reconciliations are also included in our exhibit to the current report on form 8-k that we filed with the sec. please go to slide 8, where we will start with the revenue. revenue was 33.4 million, up 44%.
growth was driven by solid demand for our single-wafer cleaning equipment and our new ecp copper plating tools for advanced packaging. total shipments were 43 million compared to 32 million in the year ago quarter and 33 million last quarter. the significant increase in shipments was driven by demand for repeat and the first two deliveries. gaap gross margin was 48.6%.
this compares to 44.4% a year ago and 45.3% in the june quarter. non-gaap gross margin was 49.1% compared to 44.5% a year ago. gross margin was above our normal expectation of 40 to 45% due to our favorable product mix during the quarter. we expect gross margin to continue to vary on a quarterly basis due to product mix and the manufacturing utilization.
gaap operating expenses were 9.2 million, up 34% from the same period last year. non-gaap operating expenses were 7.8 million, up from 6.5 million in the same period last year and a largely flat quarter over quarter. year-over-year growth in operating expense was driven primarily by r&d and the sales and marketing expenses. gaap operating income was 7 million compared to 3.4 million in the third quarter of 2018.
operating margin was 21% compared to 14.7% in the same quarter last year and 16.1% last quarter. non-gaap operating income was 8.6 million versus 3.8 million a year ago. our non-gaap operating margin was 25.7% compared to 16.5% in the same quarter last year and 18.2% last quarter. other income was 1.9 million, mainly due to the foreign exchange gains on our working capital from a strong dollar versus renminbi in the quarter.
this gain was higher than normal due to our 4% decline of chinese renminbi versus the dollar during the quarter. we had a net tax benefit of $0.3 million in the third quarter versus our tax expense of $0.5 million last year. the net benefit was due in part to a one-time reduction of tax valuation allowance. also, below the operating line, we have a net income attributable to the redeemable non-controlling interest of $0.3 million in the quarter.
this line item was added to our account for the pe investment in our acm shanghai subsidiary, which represents 4.2% of the outstanding shares of acm shanghai. gaap net income attributable to acm research was 8.8 million compared to 3.9 million last year and 4.3 million last quarter. non-gaap net income was 10.3 million compared to 4.3 million last year and 4.9 million last quarter. stock-based compensation was approximately 1.6 million, elevated during the quarter preliminarily due to the employee stock purchase related to china ipo.
gaap net income attributable to acm research per diluted share was $0.45 compared to $0.21 in the year ago period. non-gaap net income per diluted share was $0.53 compared to $0.23 in the year ago period. the tax allowance reduction and the positive impact to operating from currency fluctuation resulted in a $0.14 improvement to our gaap and non-gaap net income per diluted shares. now, i will review the balance sheet.
we ended quarter three with 47.3 million in cash and the equivalent, up from 27.6 million last quarter. we completed our u.s. equity raise in august, which added approximately 23 million in net primary proceeds to the acm. this was partially offset by our 4.2 million investment in a venture capital fund.
the cash figure does not include 27 million in proceed from the private equity raise related to the stock market, which we have voluntarily segregated as restricted cash. we ended the quarter with 15.7 million in short-term borrowings, up slightly from 15.1 million last quarter. we ended the quarter with 43.5 million of inventory. finished goods were 18.6 million, up from 13 million last quarter.
cash flow from operations was breakeven for the quarter. capital expenditures were $0.5 million. i now turn the call back to david to discuss our outlook.
david wang -- chairman, president, chief executive officer, and founder
thank you, lisa. please go to slide 9. for 2019, we continue to expect our revenue to be approximately $105 million. this represents more than 40% annual growth.
we are proud of this growth, given a challenging year for the industry. as we look to 2020, we plan for growth. we plan to provide formal guidance for the full-year 2020 on our next earnings call. to conclude, we are executing our strategy.
we are participating in the growth of major new ic fabs. we are ramping production and we continue to develop and deliver innovative new products. we are confident in our opportunity in china, expansion outside of china. we remain committed to achieve our mission to become a major player in the semiconductor equipment market.
let's now open the call for any questions that you may have. operator, please go ahead
",2019-Q3,ACMR
1.0,0.9995499999999999,,,":
operator
certainly. [operator instructions] our first questions comes from the line of donnie teng from nomura securities. please go ahead.
donnie teng -- nomura instinet -- analyst
thank you, management, for taking my question. congratulations on a very strong 2019 result. and my first question is regarding to our shipment and the sales outlook this year. so, i calculated the accumulated shipment sales since third-quarter 2017, and i found that we probably still have left $30 million of the backlog.
so i'm wondering whether if our sales momentum this year if largely intact is mainly driven by the backlog or we are also seeing a very strong shipment growth this year? this is my first question. thank you.
david wang -- chief executive officer
ok. hi, thank you. so then i will go first. maybe i will give a remark and then more. actually, like you've pointed out, yes, there's a deferred revenue last year and for this year, and we estimated also $30 million were record revenue this year, obviously.
so by our projections, obviously, we'll see more shipment this year, much more than last year. i also kind of see in my mind even more will be same as deferred revenue through the 2021. so to answer your question, yes we see more shipments better more than last year. hey, mark anything to add there if you have?
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
yes, the only thing i would add -- thanks, david, and thanks, donnie, for the question. so yes, if you look at the revenue opportunity of the finished goods inventory, so finished goods inventory ended the year at $19.3 million. we reported that, and so that's carried at cost. so you could kind of do a quick conversion to the revenue value of that.
it's about $36 million or so. and, yes, as david said, we expect to grow shipments and we see that, obviously, that adds some visibility to our revenue as we get accepted to take revenue on those products.
donnie teng -- nomura instinet -- analyst
ok. great. and my second question is regarding to our growth outlook. could you tell us what kind of a customer or applications are still going strong this year despite of coronavirus? i think as you mentioned is ymtc is still on track. so i think ymtc is growing very strong and for huahong they have wuxi fab and it's ramping up, as they mentioned in the earnings call.
but i'm curious about smic, is because smic spent most of their capex on 14 nanometer capacity, like out of the $3 billion capex they spent $2 billion there. so i'm wondering if smic is also very important growth driver for us and whether our gross from smic is mainly from their 14 nanometer or just purely from their 8-inch in tianjin or other fabs? thank you.
david wang -- chief executive officer
ok. thank you for questions. actually, like you mentioned we have continued demand from ymtc and also we see the demand from the family from [inaudible], their 22 nano fab and also their wuxi huahong fabs. and we also see from initial property investing on some type of transaction from sk hynix, right, second half this year too.
as a matter to the smic, yes, they get a lot of r&d research for the nano and this year renminbi. and with revenue participate in that renminbi, also beyond that also we have their demand from the beijing 12-inch fab too. so i expect in this year revenue from smic should be increased more than last year.
donnie teng -- nomura instinet -- analyst
got it. so basically for smic it is like both from like 14 nanometer in shanghai, as well as a 12-inch fab in beijing.
david wang -- chief executive officer
yes, that's as i see that. yes.
donnie teng -- nomura instinet -- analyst
got it. and my last question is regarding to a dram customer. so as you know, i think coronavirus is causing some uncertainties on end demand for sure. under the most bearish case, do you think that our sales from dram customer can be still maintained stable compared with 2019 in terms of absolute u.s.
dollar amount or --
david wang -- chief executive officer
this moment, i cannot say very clear. as i mentioned, we do see some technology upgrade, and this is another real expansion for the capacity. it's more like they transition from certain technology to certain advanced nodes. they need more of our tool, right.
so we see that orders were coming in, as i said, the second half. and as a matter of their real capacity expansion, this moment, i should say, we're cautiously watching and carefully waiting, and we're still waiting for customer sign right now.
operator
thank you for the questions. [operator instructions] the next questions comes from the line of suji desilva from roth capital. please go ahead.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hi, david. hi, mark. and good to know your staff is safe and back to work there.
david wang -- chief executive officer
thank you, suji.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
yes, first question on the gross margin, can you talk about the factors that drove that above target, what the pricing elements are there and whether those will persist or revert to normal in the next few quarters?
david wang -- chief executive officer
ok. so, suji, as i said, yes, last quarter, our gross margin is actually beyond our range, which is 40% to 45%. it's really a matter of combination of the tool and combination of the technology as well. i still feel since we're growing our self in the future, we still believe, even this year, or maybe for next one year, we still consider 40% to 45% is our normal range, right? obviously, some year can be higher, some year can be lower, but i still think about the ranges, we are -- this is what we're thinking right now.
obviously, beyond a couple year later, as we have more advanced tools accepted, and when we're moving that gross margin to the next level. so that's our assessment right now. mark, anything you want to add on that?
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
no, i think you covered it well. it's every quarter, just our product mix and customer mix. you can have some variants. it doesn't take a lot of tools to shift the gross margin one way or the other.
but yes, we are very confident in our long-term model.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. it's helpful color there. and then on the 20 -- we're in the 20 guidance for revenue, can you talk about the mix of that? that would be a non-saps as you diversify your revenue stream from the core saps revenue?
david wang -- chief executive officer
yes. actually, so suji i can see that as we have more product on the line right, you can see that we are have a toggle as being introduced in the market today -- i mean, this year, last year, and we see there are probably multiple customer interested and to this powerful product because of the large quantity of their [inaudible] and which is real protected environment. and also we see the positive repeat order coming for the existing customer for tahoe. beyond that, i can see that they also have their plating tool and we are probably seeing more of a customer buying tool for their both back-end and also front-end.
so that all add together probably you are seeing about their new product, which is beyond the fabs. this year, we'll add additional $15 million to $20 million more sale. and so that's i see their growth potential, which is our new product gaining additional customer and give us new revenue-driven stream.
operator
thank you for the questions. next questions comes from the line of christian schwab from craig-hallum. please go ahead.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group llc -- analyst
hi, great. congratulations on extremely solid execution in this challenging time. two quick questions, how many tools -- first one is how many tools is the opportunity for the tahoe after acceptance there?
david wang -- chief executive officer
ok. great question. i think we see a few -- i mean, at least three more customer interested in the tahoe. and that's new customer, right.
possibly, we'll have customer give us conditional deal or first two deals. and then we do have repeating orders come from the existing customers, which is our first time tahoe customers, right? so we're expecting probably about four and two. and if we're working -- i mean, lucky, we may add another one so that we see the four or five tool this year for the tahoe deliver. but obviously, not all of this will recognize revenue by end of this year, right.
so that really depends on how we deliver tools and how we can be qualifying for the new customer and that will account for the revenue this year.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group llc -- analyst
ok. great. and then my second question, i think the big fund, the national ic industry investment fund is about to kick off its big second phase of capital investment. it -- to the local chip guys in china. is that supportive of your solid outlook for this year or could there actually be upside to your estimates as that begins to flow in the marketplace?
david wang -- chief executive officer
yes. actually, as mentioned, i feel [inaudible] is really boosting for their -- actually, their fiber building and fiber expansion plan. as we mentioned a couple times, china customer and they're really under multi-year expansion plan, either you called it ymtc or huali huahong group and all the smic and other -- also other new dram customers too. so they have a multiyear expansion plan, and obviously this is the new founding injection into their -- our customer side and what -- that may be improving our visibility and give us more of an opportunity.
beyond that, it's also [inaudible], i should say, power device fab is also gaining the support in some -- those funds. so we see that expansion of new fab will give us a new opportunity too.
operator
thank you. next question comes from the patrick ho with stifel. please go ahead.
patrick ho -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thank you very much, and congratulations, and glad to hear everyone well. maybe first off in terms of the supply chain. you mentioned on the prepared remarks that it's fine and everything is going well. can you discuss any potential disruptions that you did have over the last few months, and whether that's part of the reason why you're pushing out some of the system deliveries into the second and third quarters.
and what gives you confidence that it's now resolved where you don't have to use, i guess, second or third source suppliers?
david wang -- chief executive officer
ok. great. actually, just for the supply chain ebitda line first, at this moment, i should say probably our major supply and probably 70% come from outside china. in that pouring, i call the import from china in which probably most of them from japan and some are also from korea.
and we do have about less than probably 10% from u.s. and 10% from europe. that's our supply chain distribution. in the last two months, three months, we didn't see any supply chain delay, right? until that time obviously china got to suffer.
we do have seen some of our machine shop and gather people not on time return to the job. but at this moment, all our supply in china for machine shop have been on the line already. so as i see that is our major tool pushing from the q1 to q2 is obviously you see that is -- in the wuhan, our customer ymtc, they do have manpower or they subcontract. they cannot go through the wuhan restrictions, so that's why some tool we suppose ship to the ymtc in the q1 was pushed to the q2.
that's the major reason, right? so, obviously, we will watch carefully for our supply chain now since the coronavirus has kind of spread out and -- however, we're lucky to see japan and korea that is stable and hopefully in a few months, we are going to see u.s. and europe get stable. so we are, so far, cautious watching. we feel probably ok for a real long -- i call it, for imported components at this moment.
patrick ho -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and maybe a question for you, mark, in terms of capex for this year, especially as you get the third facility signed on and begin the process there, can give a little bit of color on how much you think potentially you're going to invest in capex for 2020?
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
yes. hey, patrick, thanks for the question. so the capex for 2020 is just normal run rate operations, $2 million to $5 million is what we're looking at, adding a second floor to production at our second factory and some other upgrades. so that's kind of our normal run rate.
we did talk about the land for our new production in r&d site out there in lingang. so if we reach agreement on that, we could see putting some money down for that, and we might even spend some on the construction side there this year. so, depends on exactly when it starts, but that land could be on the order of $10 million and maybe $5 million to $10 million of spending on construction, depending on when it starts.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of charlie chen from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
charlie chen -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, david, mark. nice to meet you online. so, my question -- so first of all, congratulations for your great results and great execution during this kind of environment. my question is really about your overseas customers' opportunity.
can you please give us some color whether you will be able to enter the sub-7 nanometer logic foundry opportunity? so, i guess, it is ready to your chance for 3 nanometer? and also for the current 7 nanometer and 5 nanometer baseline, do you think customer could change the baseline for you to use your higher performance products? thank you.
david wang -- chief executive officer
ok. charlie, thank you. by the way, thank you, i have not seen china. one day, i should really do.
anyway, so thank you for the question. and actually, you mentioned about the top tier customer. acm has been real working very hard, and as this moment, heavily engaged with a two of top three, a guy in the industry. so, let me give you the first -- our preparation, right? we believe as acm want to be the vendor for the top tier guy, you have to get a certain size, which is at this moment we are also moving about one employee and $100 million revenue this year even more higher.
so also we are having strong balance sheet ready for this, i call it, penetration process. so we have about currently $100 million cash and we'll also get more from the china ipo in hopefully end of this year. so as i see that is, we're in the right spot and the size to be able to supporting big guys demand, big guys, i call it, requirement. so as the map come to the next line of technology.
with our technology tebo and saps and tahoe, we definitely -- we have confidence those technologies will be needed for the top tier guy to enhance their yield and reduce the kind of spending, especially sulfuric acid and also most importantly for their -- as a smaller geometry coming is 7, 5, 3 nano and yield improvement is critical for their economical ramping up. so we have very strong confidence. and as a matter, i should say that is we're working very hard and we're -- this is a matter of time and hopefully, we'll can bring one of these two customers this year and happy even more, right, to have two together. but we're hoping to bring one over this year and possibly bring another one next year.
so that's our strategy put on. and third, we also hire high power, actually, sales force and both in taiwan also in north america. there's one additional announcement what we assume very high power to help our sales in the u.s. and north american market.
so with that all said, acm will be very positive and we're being -- working hard and to penetrate those top tier customers. mark, anything you want to add on that?
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
david, no. i think you summarized it pretty well. i mean, we're -- really everything we do here at acm is to become a major player, broaden our product line, developing the balance sheet, our capacity plans, and we're putting some serious resources in place to realize our goals.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] next question comes from the line of mark miller from benchmark. please go ahead.
mark miller -- benchmark -- analyst
thank you for the questions. you mentioned in your situation with respect to the coronavirus, but i'm just wondering, what's the situation with some of your major customers? are they back to normal?
david wang -- chief executive officer
ok. thanks, miller. as i said is -- i mentioned they're -- our customer ymtc in the wuhan, they're -- actually they never stopped manufacturing even in the luna new year timeline. obviously, they're in the, i call it, full production today.
as a matter of -- if they want to install a new tool and they are waiting for 3d to real -- so the people can move in, right? hopefully, those kind of things can happen again too. with that confirmation, then probably we can install, we can have our people move into wuhan to install this tool. and i see that even the worst case, i still have a service guy, about 20 service guys in wuhan and that is still possible. you saw the tool and may be a little bit slow pace, but that's the worst case situation.
in other cities, like beijing and our customer smic in shanghai, huali, wuxi, and sk hynix, and also huahong -- wuxi, they are so far pretty open right now, and they're -- we can have our engineers sent there. we can have our -- visiting to those customer, but that's all becoming normal right now.
mark miller -- benchmark -- analyst
just was wondering, the smartphone production supposed to be down around 12% year over year this quarter may also be softer in the second quarter. are any of your customers adjusting their production schedules you know about?
david wang -- chief executive officer
this moment, i should say, our major customer, we have not seen any slowdown yet. and they're -- there are some trends there to deliver time based on their [inaudible] on our plan or on our production schedule, right? as a matter of -- our dram customer, as i mentioned, they're still moving to the new advanced mode. they're still buying further buyer tool to expand in the new generation technology. so for the capacity wise, we're still in a cautious watching right now and we're -- we have not gotten a clear sign yet.
mark miller -- benchmark -- analyst
i'm sorry if i missed this. what was stock based compensation in the fourth quarter?
david wang -- chief executive officer
hey, mark. [inaudible] answer that?
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
yes. i can look it up. it's on the table in our earnings release.
mark miller -- benchmark -- analyst
in the presentation slides?
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
yes, it's in the table in the earnings call, but yes, stock based compensation here looks like it's $650,000 for the quarter and $3.6 million for the year. we actually had a big jump. the reason that it was high in, i believe, the third quarter was some of the options we granted to our china ipo employees regarding the china ipo. there was a bump for that.
mark miller -- benchmark -- analyst
dave, you indicated tax and effective foreign exchange increase were positive by debt benefit of $4.7 million for the year. what were they for the quarter in terms of how do they add on this quarter?
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
yes, for the quarter, it was about a nickel. so you had -- if you adjusted relative to 14% tax rate, you have about $1.7 million on the tax. we had a partial valuation release in q3, and we did the full release for the year. so it's about $1.7 million delta in q4.
and then we actually had a foreign exchange loss from operations of about $600,000. so, that was a headwind to our earnings, but net-net we reported $0.23 non-gaap earnings in q4, and there was -- apples-to-apples, it would be a nickel lower. so it would have been like a $0.17 number if you took out those one-time items.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] next question comes from charlie chen from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
charlie chen -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks for taking my follow-up question. so david, i know it's a little bit sensitive, but also related to your potential china ipo. given the circumstance of china, u.s. pension and your big exposure to china customer like ymtc, smic, do you consider potential restriction on your technology export to your china customers from the u.s.
government? and how is the company going to address these potential risks? thank you.
david wang -- chief executive officer
ok. well, good question charlie. and basically the technology we're selling in most markets right now is, i think, wafer technology, right? wafer cleaning. those technologies actually were developed in the last 10 to 15 years in shanghai.
so, based on our talking with our lawyer in the u.s., that is not in the restriction category of the export technology category right now. however, we do see some kind of either 25% the immunity rule, right components, if you import and use u.s. components. that 25%, as i heard, probably, down to 10%.
with that challenge yes, we do have seen some challenges there. if that happens, we will have to real ship in the product or we have to find a alternative choice of supply chain to replace those components, right? that is so far our strategy try to protect our investors' interest and also make the company continue to grow in this kind of a dynamic environment.
charlie chen -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. thanks. and my next question, if i may, is about your value and pricing versus your key competitors. sorry, i didn't know about this.
but do you need to process some discounts versus japan or u.s. vendors when you approach your customers?
david wang -- chief executive officer
you mean our pricing from -- i make sure of the question. you mean our purchase pricing components or our selling price to the customer?
charlie chen -- morgan stanley -- analyst
your selling pricing to the customer, and if you can give us a rough market share in china?
david wang -- chief executive officer
ok. well, i mean, pricing is always kind of challenge, right? and obviously, we constantly get pressure from customer and lower the pricing. however, i think our strategy of trying to sell product is by our product quality and value added the specials have really improved, and also for other excellent, you know, better service for our customer, say local customer in korea, and in china, potentially in taiwan. so we offer better quality and value-added products.
again, obviously, we're looking for reasonable pricing and for the customer. so that's our strategy right now. to answer your question, yes, we're trying to really sell the value added and moreover consider cost of their ownership not just by selling price. so that's our strategy.
charlie chen -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. and your market share in china? mark, yes, please.
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
yes. hey, david, if you don't mind i would just add. yes, i would just add to that is, look, like we're a small company with -- but growing bigger with some big aspirations. so, david and the team, every one of our products have some innovations backed by patents and we have to do a little better on the performance side.
so, we cut our teeth with sk hynix proving that the yields at the steps, the tahoe product similar performance, but we're going to reduce the amount of sulfuric acid use. so we always have something innovative to drive the customers to use our products and we feel that we offer a bit more and we can get a good price for that.
charlie chen -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
david wang -- chief executive officer
yes, maybe, charlie, i want to add one more word here. i do believe the company was sustaining r&d arm and sustaining our operation or give a certain profitability of the company. we are not real pushing pricing down to get market share. we rather maintain certain pricing.
we leave out some market share to other competitors coming. we feel that more win-win situation, and that's our strategy.
operator
thank you. we have a last question from the line of quinn bolton from the line of needham & company. please go ahead.
quinn bolton -- needham and company -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for squeezing me in here. first question, mark, just a clarification on the timing of the restricted cash. did you say that you have access to that restricted cash or it becomes unrestricted upon the filing of the star market transaction or on the listing, a successful listing of that transaction?
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
yes. hi, charlie. yes, so i'm glad you asked that. so yes, quinn, we do -- we did say that on the call that when we submit the application, we're going to unrestrict the cash as opposed to when we achieve the listing, yes.
quinn bolton -- needham and company -- analyst
great and then second question from me, just can you guys give us any sense of the number of tools or the dollar revenue that may have shifted from q1 to q2 as a result of the coronavirus effects?
david wang -- chief executive officer
ok. quinn, it's a good question but as we set the rule general earnings call, we do put the -- not normally give guidance for the coming q or next q, right? the reason for that is because one tool and if it is delivered in q1 versus q2 will cause fluctuation of sometimes 10% to 15%. that gives us real projection on the earnings for the next quarter is very difficult. that's why we say this moment and maybe for wire, we're not going to give the clear projection for the coming quarter.
however, if we see our revenue, say maybe quarterly come to $50 million, $60 million, or $70 million per quarter, then maybe that time we can give more clear. in that case, one tool gets delay or gets up not much impact to our final projection accuracy. so, i really hope you understand that and we're in another situation. however, as you can see that is maybe q1 is our lowest quarter in the whole year, and we can see strong q2, q3 demand, and we don't know q4 or q2 is so far the highest, i think, right now, but we don't know q4 right? maybe q4 will be higher than q3 or maybe you know q4 can be higher than q3, it depends on the management agreement.
so that's our assessment for this year's revenue.
operator

gary dvorchak -- managing director of the blueshirt group
good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss fourth-quarter and fiscal 2019 results. we released results after the u.s. market closed yesterday.
the release is available on our website as well as from our newswire services. there's also a supplemental slide deck posted to the investor portion of our website that we will reference during our prepared remarks. on the call with me today are our ceo, dr. david wang; our cfo, mark mckechnie; and lisa feng, the cfo of our operating subsidiary, acm shanghai.

you should refer to our press release for our non-gaap results and reconciliations between gaap and non-gaap amounts. with that, let me now turn the call over to dr. david wang, who will begin with slide 3. david? 
david wang -- chief executive officer
thanks, gary, and welcome everyone to today's call. 2019 marked another year of growth and achievement for acm research. we made meaningful progress in our mission to become a major supplier of capital equipment for the semiconductor industry. we delivered great operational results and ended the year in a solid financial position.
let me review some of our accomplishments in 2019 as shown on slide 3. first, our financial performance was excellent. we grew our topline by more than 44% to $107.5 million and delivered non-gaap earnings of $1.17 per share. we generated $9.4 million in operational cash flow and ended the year with $58 million of cash with an additional $60 million in reserve cash from proceeds of the private equity funding into acm shanghai.
second, we showed our production expertise. throughout the year, our manufacturing team ran our second factory. with two facilities running, we were able to ship 115 million of equipment production of more than 100 million is an important achievement. it demonstrates our ability to scale operations, which is one of several critical factors for winning new business.
third, we expanded our customer base to five major ic manufacturers, a key advantage is that we are near some of the newest and the most advanced fab in the world. in september, we delivered our first tool to a new local china dram player. that brought our total to five major front-end customers. in addition to this new dram customer, we are now supplying to sk hynix, the no.
2 dram player in the world, ymtc the emerging 3d nand player, huali and huahong wuxi, a growing local foundry and smic are strategically important china foundries. fourth, we expanded our market opportunity by introducing new products and making r&d progress on other products in our roadmap. let me review our progress during the year. first, in q1 we introduced few new tools for advanced metal plating as shown on slide 5.
the ultra ecp ap or advanced wafer level packaging is a back-end assembly tool that delivers better plating performance with a more uniformed metal layer as much area. the ultra ecp map or multi anode partial plating is a front-end fab tool that delivers world-class plating for copper interconnect applications. this is becoming more critical as the world migrate to 40 nano and below. our ecp tools have estimated tam of 500 million.
this adds to 3 billion tam for our core market in single-wafer cleaning tools. our ecp tools are off to a great start. we delivered four of them in 2019. the four delivers including both revenue and the first tool evaluation.
next, tahoe. let's turn to slide 4. our first tahoe customer achieved very encouraging results in the production environment late last year. they confirmed that our tahoe delivers equivalent performance to competitors, but with just a friction of the sulfuric acid use.
this tool is on track for acceptance in the first half of 2020 and we believe repeat order will soon follow that. we are in advanced discussions with the rest of our customers and are optimistic this will lead to several first tool orders later in the year. we see the environment advantage of tahoe is a great calling card. we will begin discussions with new potential customers in taiwan, north america, and europe.
next, tebo. we have made great technical progress with tebo during 2019. in q4, we -- our lead tebo customer confirmed that we met their requirements for damage-free removal of both big and small particles of 3d patterned structure. as a result, our tebo tool was qualified for several production cleaning steps with higher particle removal efficiencies for fine particles without damages.
we expect to see repeat order from this leading customer this year. yesterday we announced another new product, the ultra sfp ap shown on slide 6. the main is stress free polishing for advanced packaging. this tool combines acm proprietary sfp electro-polishing and cmp technology into one platform.
we believe this is the first of its kind in the world. the ultra sfp ap incorporates a building electrolyte recycle and reuse system. it reduces amount of [inaudible] by 80% versus conventional cmp. we delivered our first tool during the fourth quarter of 2019 to a leading chinese wafer-level packaging customer.
we expect to recommend revenue this year upon customer acceptance. in general, we are focused on broadening our product line. we are committed to gaining share in $3 billion plus tam for the single-wafer wet cleaning tools. we estimate that our saps, tahoe, and tebo tools cover more than 50% of this market.
we believe our share of cleaning market would grow as our customer achieve scale production and as acm gain additional customers. we are also adding new products in adjacent markets through expanding our opportunities to address even more of the international total wafer fab incremental spend. we are -- we estimate the combination of a new ecp and sfp products add another $700 million to our tam. moving on, i will now discuss some of the more strategic efforts we are making to build the foundation to achieve acm longer term objectives.
first, we raised capital in the u.s. the follow on equity offering added $25 million to our balance sheet. we are deploying the proceeds to invest in the customer development in new regions, including in north america, europe and the southeast asia. we also began a significant marketing push in those regions to support our growing direct sales efforts.
second, we entered into our framework agreement to acquire land rights in the lingang region of shanghai, 30 miles from acm headquarters. by middle year we expect to complete a definitive agreement for the land. we expect to begin construction of a new r&d center and a factory later this year and start initial production at that facility by the end of 2022. finally, we are gearing up for our shanghai stock market listing.
we are pursuing the listing for two reasons. first, we want to raise our profile with regional customers and our supply chain. second, we want to raise local capital in our primary market of china at attractive valuation. to meet the requirement for the listing, we added several independent strategic local investors.
we sold 8.3% of the outstanding share of acm shanghai to those investors at $675 million pre-money valuation. this reached $60 million. we are on the track to submit our application for the listing in the middle 2020 and to price the transaction by end of the year. before i turn over to mark, i would like to update you on how the coronavirus situation has impact our operations and outlook.
i'm proud and thankful to report that more than 90% of our staff are back to the work at both our shanghai's fab facility, which are shown on slide 7. we took early action in february before employee return from lunar new year to make sure no one took unreasonable risk to rush back to work. we also took steps to ensure safe workplace upon return. at this point, shanghai appears to be stabilizing with the number of new reported covid-19 cases falling.
our production lines are now back to normal starting and our supply chain does not appear to be a issue. we are working to increase our manufacturer capacity to propel for heavy loading in q2 and q3. we have been in a constant contact with our customers, in particular ymtc. as many of you know, ymtc is the first factory, and its center of operations are in wuhan, and they are fully committed to scaling production.
ymtc and all of our customers, in fact, continue to run their fabs uninterrupted through the lunar new year and after. we have a local service team member in wuhan to provide close support to ymtc. they have been on-site supporting ymtc during the challenging times. we are monitoring the situation on a day-by-day basis.
we have shipped a number of the ymtc tool delivered from the first quarter into the second quarter, but otherwise, i'm now pleased to say our operations with ymtc appear to be recovering as the city begin to relax its locked down. meanwhile, other customers in less affected city have been managing -- have already returned to work. we expect the business to return to normal operations during q2, with the constraints become less of the factor on our business. as we are looking ahead, we remain optimistic.
let me share our current outlook as shown on slide 8. q1 revenue and shipments have been impacted by the virus. although, part of our business shift from q1, our internal forecast are strong for q2 and q3. and include significant demand for demo tools.
we have a good visibility in q3 due to firm orders and customer forecast as well as number of tools awaiting acceptance. accordingly, our full year 2020 outlook is unchanged. we expect revenue to be in the range of $130 million to $150 million, as also we announced on january 13th. this represents 30% annual growth at the mid-point.
our outlook is based on a couple of important assumptions. first, the virus situation continue to steadily improve in china and stabilizes in the rest of the world. second, low end of the revenue range, assuming muted dram recovery and ebitda revenue contribution from new customers. to conclude my faction, i would like to thank our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in acm research.
i especially want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication during challenging time. our entire team is focused on what we can control, we're investing in r&d to enhance our current products and develop new products. we are building our global sales and marketing infrastructure in order to penetrate new customers in new regions. we are scaling scale of production capacity to fulfill the wave of new demand we are seeing coming.
as we grow, we are committed to assort more balance between the current profit and the investment growth. we believe that growing fast with the profitability, we deliver the maximum value to our shareholders. and so, i will now turn the call over to mark, who will discuss the financial results in more detail.
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
thank you, david, and good day, everyone. q4 was another strong quarter ending 2019 on a high note with good profitability. for the full year, we grew our business significantly with increased market share, good customer exposure and expanded production at our second factory. we added several new key products, including our ecp tools for advanced metal plating.
we closed the year with $58 million of cash on our balance sheet, up from $27 million a year ago. and now to put some detail around our full 2019 results. unless i note otherwise, i will refer to non-gaap financial measures. a reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to comparable gaap measures is included in our earnings release.
first, highlights of our results for the full year shown on slide 9. revenue was $107.5 million, up 44%. we break out our 10% customers on an annual basis and will provide occasional color on quarterly costs. as you can see on slide 11, for 2019, we had 3 10% revenue customers, which i will now describe.
first, huali and huahong wuxi accounted for 26.5% of revenue versus 24.2% in 2018. they grew by 58%, a good contributor of growth as we expanded penetration from huali shanghai fabs to additional factories of huahong and the wuxi. ymtc was our largest customer at 27.5% of revenue versus 39.6% in 2018. our revenue from ymtc was unchanged year-over-year as expected, ymtc ramped its wafer production from 5,000 per month to 20,000 per month during the year.
even though the wafer starts increased significantly, the number of tools was about the same due to subscale utilization of some of our tools at the initial 5,000 wafer per month level. sk hynix accounted for 19.8% of revenue versus 23.8% in 2018. revenue from sk hynix was up 20% year-over-year. sk hynix was a big contributor in the first half and fell off in the second half due to challenging dram market conditions.
smic and jcap were larger revenue contributors in 2019 as compared to 2018, but less than 10% customers for both years. total shipments were $115 million versus $95 million in 2018. gross margin for the year was 47.3%, compared to 46.2%. this was above our normal expectations of 40% to 45% due to a favorable product mix.
we expect gross margin to also continue to vary on a quarterly basis due to product mix and manufacturing utilization. operating income was $21.3 million, compared to $9.8 million. operating margin is 19.9% versus 13.2% a year ago. net income attributable to acm research was $21.5 million for the year versus $9.9 million.
2019 net income included a benefit of 2 items, which acm considers onetime in nature. this includes a tax valuation allowance release or benefit of $4 million for the year and a realized gain or benefit of $1 million from the effective foreign currency fluctuations on our operating results. net income per diluted share was $1.17, compared to $0.55 in 2018. this includes the net benefit as discussed above of 25% -- $0.25 per share for the tax and currency items.
for the fourth quarter, shown on slide 10, revenue was $24.6 million, up 18% from the fourth quarter of 2018. total shipments were $25 million versus $35 million in the fourth quarter of '18 and $43 million in the third quarter of year 2019. keep in mind, third quarter 2019 shipments had been neutrally strong due to the acceleration of a number of shipments from the fourth quarter. gross margin was 50.7% versus 49.6% in the prior year period.
operating income was $4.5 million, up 39% from $3.2 million in the year-ago period. operating margin was 18.3% versus 15.5% in the prior year period. net income attributable to acm research was $4.6 million versus $2.9 million in 2018. this includes the benefit of $2.3 million from a tax valuation release and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our operations.
net income per diluted share was $0.23, compared to $0.16 in 2018. this includes an aggregate benefit of $0.05 for the tax and currency items for the quarter. now i'll review the balance sheet. the cash balance was $58.3 million at the end of 2019.
cash was up $11 million from the end of last quarter, and up $31.1 million from the end of last year. the increase for the year was driven by positive free cash flow and our capital raise in august of 2019. we held $59.6 million in restricted cash at year end. this is from the proceeds to acm shanghai for its 2 private equity funding rounds.
restricted cash will be unrestricted when we submit our china ipo application. short-term borrowings at year-end were $13.8 million, down from $15.7 million at the end of q3 and up from $9.4 million at the end of 2018. total inventory was $44.8 million at year-end. finished goods inventory grew to $19.3 million at year-end, up from $18.6 million at the end of the third quarter and $16.5 million at the end of 2018.
we view the increased finished goods inventory as a positive indicator as it reflects the deployment of additional first tool systems to potential customers. cash flow from operations was $14.2 million for the fourth quarter and $9.4 million for the year. capital expenditures were $0.2 million for the quarter and $1.1 million for the full year 2019. to conclude, we are executing on our strategy.
we are participating in the growth of major new ic fabs. we are ramping production, and we continue to develop and deliver innovative new products. we are positive on our opportunities in china and the expansion outside of china. we're committed to achieve our mission to become a major player in the semiconductor equipment market.
now let's open the call for any questions that you may have. operator, please go ahead.
",2019-Q4,ACMR
0.99865,0.99975,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of quinn bolton from needham & company. please ask your question.
quinn bolton -- needham and company -- analyst
hey, guys. congratulations on the results and great to hear that everybody's well and operations are back to 100%. david, i wanted to start with kind of the introduction of the new tools. it sounds like you significantly expanded the product line over the next -- over the last quarter or so in the semi-critical clean in the furnace.
can you give us some sense on just timing of revenue acceptance for those new platforms? it sounds like some of the semi-critical clean may have already been accepted as revenue. and i think, you mentioned furnace first eval tool accepted by the end of the year. but just hoping you could share a little bit more color on the new platforms.
david wang -- chief executive officer
ok. thank you, quinn. as we say that this call is a heavy quarter, announced quite a bit of product. and i mean, i'll give you our strategy get the ultra furnace.
and acm has been working on the wet process tool for a long time. and however, with our goal to become a major player and that's one major step we get into the dry process step. so this tool, as i mentioned, has been delivered to customers. we're expecting to be qualifying and record revenue probably by end of this year.
with further other semi-critical cleaning tool. as i mentioned, some of them, especially backside cleaning tool have been recognized as revenue and some of them still in the qualification. and then with the scrubber tool, we just shipped their first tool in the q1 of this year. so we hope this will be recognized by the end of this year.
and with the auto bench tool, there is someone has been recognized with still some of them is still in the qualification process. so again, all this new tool this year, we hope will contribute some revenue, obviously, and some will be probably beyond in this year. we also expect to continue to receive the repeat order from the customers regarding their semi-critical cleaning product. and for the furnace, and probably we think about either end of this year or next year, with the same repeat order or other new order from customers.
quinn bolton -- needham and company -- analyst
great. thanks, david. that kind of leads my second question, perhaps for you or for mark. if i look at the first-quarter revenue of $24 million, you had shipments of only $12 million.
so it looks like you must have had multiple new customer tools or new platforms accepted for revenue. you mentioned the first revenue acceptance for tahoe. so congratulations on that. were the -- is the difference that the first acceptance on the wet bench and the backside cleaning tool, is that kind of the delta between shipments and what was recognized as revenue in the first quarter?
david wang -- chief executive officer
yeah. i can talk something and maybe mark add something to that. actually, yes, q1, we have quite more acceptance from the tool we're shipping last year. so that's become our first tool record revenue.
and then during even the shipping the $12 million new tool, some of them will be record revenue upon shipment, some of them still go to the customer side. so that's probably the number you can feel about this together. mark, you want to mention anything about there?
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
yeah, you bet. no. so quinn, i think you're thinking about it the right way because we did talk about revenue. we got acceptance for tahoe and some of the new semi-critical tools.
so yeah, as david said, we focused our q1 efforts really on acceptances and new products and firming up the year outlook. so really good acceptance. tahoe was something we're proud of and we do expect the shipments to rebound pretty substantially in q2 and beyond.
quinn bolton -- needham and company -- analyst
and then last for me, mark, on the tahoe repeat orders. can you give us some sense? i know that's a pretty high asp platform. were these multiple units, any sense of how large that repeat order was on tahoe? thanks.
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
we're not saying much more than just a good repeat order from our lead customer and we do expect some orders and demand for demo tools for tahoe from current customer base. yeah.
quinn bolton -- needham and company -- analyst
ok. thanks, guys,
david wang -- chief executive officer
yeah, i mean, to add on that, is surely, is we do have our two, i call the delivery and from the repeated customer this year. and then, we'll probably have additional we're targeting two additional new tool tahoe for the new customer, right? that so far we see right now. hopefully, we can report more on the next quarter's earnings call, give you more of an update on the tahoe progress.
quinn bolton -- needham and company -- analyst
thank you.
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
great. thanks, quinn. maybe operator, we'll go to the next question.
operator
sure. your next question comes from the line of patrick ho from stifel. please ask your question.
patrick ho -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thank you very much and congrats on the nice quarter, and most like us here, everyone as well. maybe for you dave or mark. as it relates to covid-19, your gross margins held up very well given the dynamics in the quarter, especially with some, i guess, evaluation tools has been recognized in revenue. can you just give specifically any, i guess, incurred costs on the gross margin line, whether it was manufacturing innovation, whether it's supply chain, procurement of parts or even logistics.
how that may have impacted gross margins and whether that continues into the june quarter?
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
david, do you want to start and i can finish or -- yeah.
david wang -- chief executive officer
yeah. sure, that's good. ok. thanks, patrick.
i think as we mentioned before, our gross margin in the range of 40% to 45% and that's still in the range we're talking right now. and also, we think the 40%, 45% for next near term for a few years our goal, right, to reach another margin there. the reason for that is we balance our penetration product to market and also versus profitability. so i should say, after our major leading tool, the x factor by the key customers or more customers, and then, our margin can increase beyond 45% stability.
at this moment, you can see that as they get into the semi-critical cleaning tool and there are some of the semi-critical cleaning tool, margin is lower, but some are still good margin. so as i said, that as we more get revenue and go to penetrate the customer, we'll be in the range of 40%, 45% is our current goal. and mark, anything you want to add on that?
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
yeah. no, i sure would. so patrick, related to the covid related expenses. in our prepared remarks, we pointed out that we had some additional expenses in our g&a line.
we didn't call anything specific on our cost of goods sold. so, we there wasn't a major impact on cost of goods sold from the covid spending. and as david said, we're very confident in the 40% to 45% gross margin range. thanks.
patrick ho -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. and maybe as my follow-up question in terms of the ramp through the rest of the year. obviously, there's likely to be some pent-up demand that's coming out of your customer base. you talked about expanding your manufacturing capacity to meet that.
i guess, how much incremental cost are related to that? and also, are you -- will you be able to get that expanded capacity in place as fast as possible given probably the demand that's helping?
david wang -- chief executive officer
ok. ok. patrick, very good question. actually, as we reported the last earnings call, we see the q2 is better than the q1, also very strong in q3.
actually, q3 has recognized revenue shipment and also many new first tool. so, that it give us a challenging and quickly get the people trained and also get the first facility to the production for this high volume. so the next thing is, obviously, the supply chain. we are very carefully monitor supply chain.
at this moment, we have not seen any, i call it, big delay or major concern for supply chain right now. however, we do and very carefully watching the chain changing, especially the covid, how the impact or later delivery, right, or the components or the subunit system in probably q3 timeline. so again, we'll be very dedicated working and our procurement guy. we'll work with our partners, supply chain, and make sure those supply and delivery on time and not impact our shipments in q3 and q4.
hey, mark, anything want to add on that?
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, the only thing i'd add is given the -- since the last call, we got through our first quarter and things played out a lot like we had planned. and so, we feel a bit better about the year following than we did when we reported last quarter. we worked to firm of the years.
we got some key acceptances. we are doing a lot of work with our supply chain. and so, we feel confident that we'll be able to deliver product. i think, if there's any major disruption by the industry, that's something we'd have to manage around and deal with, but we're confident with our outlook at this point.
thanks. maybe we'll go -- operator, next question.
operator
sure. your next question comes from the line of suji desilva from capital. please ask your question.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
hi david, mark, lisa. good to hear the team is doing well and safe, and congratulations on the results here. so the new products you've announced, can you talk about the -- if i missed -- i thought i missed this, the asp range for those products relative to the saps and tebo products you already have in the market?
david wang -- chief executive officer
ok. well, i mean, again, a different product, different, i call it, the configuration. and looking at the scrubber is much lower than our typical chemical cleaning tool, right? they're only running water base. so as i should say, the every price under $1 million for the scrubbers.
and then, the auto bench is anywhere average pricing, $2 million, $2.5 million. that's a range and some is higher as more complicated chemical combination. as a matter of the backside cleaning tool, it's running ok. anywhere between $3 million, $3.5 million in terms of each chamber tool.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. thank you. that's very helpful. and --
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
hey, suji, sorry to cut in. so that's for the vm, the new semi-critical tools. but david, if you look at the portfolio of the furnace, the sfp, the ecp products, maybe, david, you could say a little bit about the prices on those, too. yeah.
david wang -- chief executive officer
ok. so again, our other product, at this moment, we're still in the market, ecp, you do have a front end, back end, right? and again, some tools still in the qualification in a range. front end, we still talk about $4 million and the back end is really hard to tell because they have different chamber different combinations. and lower from $2 million and higher to probably $4 million and depend on the configuration of the plating chamber.
as a matter of sfp tool, so far, we only sold to the back-end application and that's about roughly about $3 million range average sale price.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
great. ok. thanks. thanks, david and mark.
and then also, just looking at the shipments, i think you talked about it a little bit, or just the linearity of the last few years, the first quarter seems to be lower than the third and march quarter seems to be low and the september quarter seems to be at peak. can you just explain if that dynamic still applies for this year, or whether because of covid, there's a different sort of linearity to the shipments this year?
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
yeah. david, do you want me to answer that? i can give a good answer there.
david wang -- chief executive officer
yeah. actually, in the fourth quarter, obviously, in china, there's a lunar new year, right? associate that. that's typically the workforce, go home and come back again, even, i call normal year, right? that you can see, typically, q1 it's kind of light. and also, customer locally in china or some in korea, same thing.
the both ask to deliver end of last year, and then, they can go lunar new year preparation. so that's may be the nature of the business here with the culture related. then i can say, normally, the last year, same thing, q2 is higher than q1. and then, q3, q4 really depend on market, all the customer requirements.
so, like, you're right. typically, q1 is a light quarter.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. very helpful. and have your lead times -- and last question, have your lead times to the tool deliveries to customers stretched out at all with the covid disruptions?
david wang -- chief executive officer
so far, we're still ok, right? and if a repeat order, then, we still talk about four months and some new tool, we may be, i should say, four to five months. that's a typical, our delivery time. and as i said, we so far have not seen any supply components of seasonal delay, but we are very carefully watching that delivery time in this, especially, in the two quarters beyond.
suji desilva -- roth capital partners -- analyst
ok. great. thanks david, mark, and congratulations on the new products you launched.
david wang -- chief executive officer
thank you, suji.
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
thanks, suji. yup. next question, operator.
operator
sure. your next question comes from the line of christian schwab from craig-hallum. please ask your question.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
thank you. congratulations on a great start to the year and the new products. david, could you tell us on the tahoe repeat order? was the customer excited about that? was the customer more excited about the better performance of the tool or the environmental positive impacts?
david wang -- chief executive officer
ok. actually, christian, they're both, right? and first, obviously, outperformance is number one, right? they are more of a concerned. but i mean, they're more of an expecting performance. so we reach the equivalent performance, as their single-wafer spm process in line.
and so, they are very high above data and also in line data and some are in the process, i call, the yield data. and furthermore, is the real chemistry consumption reduction, right? and as we said about before, so far, we confirm more than 80% reduction in the sulfuric acid usage. and that's real, they love it, right? because of not just cost and per tool whole year, just fuel saving, no inconvenient environment pressure, their relief from the local government. so both of the reasons you can see that is, they want us to deliver two tools this year and for this first customer.
so they are very happy about this data and also performance.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
and in the data that they have, sometimes new customers like this would be willing to let you use that to show to new customers outside of them. is that the case with this customer or not?
david wang -- chief executive officer
well, i mean, customer give me two repeat order, deliver, right? that's not the easy, anybody spend bigger billion and million dollar, multi-million dollar to show new customer, right? so i mean, again, they're very happy with the performance, first. second, i also mentioned, another thing is we do did even 90-nanoparticle data for their production line and probably not immediately required right now. however, they want ensure, the technological extend into future, 40 nano or even beyond a manufacturing process. they did also intensive future particle portfolio looking.
so our 90-nanoparticle data looks great. they are very happy with the data. and they're comfortable with this tool expandability to the future advanced manufacture nodes.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
perfect. and then, my last question has to do with the recent department of commerce regulations. is there any chance that any of that will impact you guys?
david wang -- chief executive officer
well, ok. it's a good question. so far, we have not seen any impact for us. we sell to our customers, either in domestic or in china or outside china, in korea, so far right now.
obviously, we're going to follow regulations, right? both inside china, also we'll follow u.s. export law requirement. but the one thing i can tell that is, we're in a very good position. and as you will see that we're a u.s.
company and has operated in china, so we both have a flexible structure. we also add our korean manufacturer and enter in future possible to be manufactured to in korea, too. so that gives us a lot of flexibility to maneuver with our capability to deal with any dynamic or any future, i call this, trade intension. so very good structure and good position compared with other local guys, and also other, i call it, a big guy in terms of this trade situation.
hey, mark, anything to add on that?
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok.
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, and i think you answered that well. i mean, we expect the trade war tension to be with us for a while. we expect it to be volatile, but we'll do our best to plan around it.
but as david said, it's dynamic. we'll follow all the regulations. we don't see anything immediate to impact our outlook.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
perfect. no other questions. thanks, guys.
david wang -- chief executive officer
thank you.
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
thanks, christian.
operator
your next question comes from the line of donnie teng from nomura. please ask your question.
donnie teng -- nomura instinet -- analyst
hi, good evening. thank you everyone for taking my question and congratulations on good results in first quarter. my first question is a housekeeping question. so, if we look at your shipment sales and actual sales.
it's like the first-quarter actual sales was better than our previous expectation, but apparently, the gap between shipment and actual sales is quite big. can we say that the second-quarter actual sales may be relatively flat or it's not going that much compared with first quarter? and what kind of shipment growth magnitude we should expect into second quarter? it looks like the shipment growth could be pretty strong in the second quarter.
david wang -- chief executive officer
ok. donnie, good question. normally, at this moment, we do not give guidance for the quarter, next quarter, right? because as i mentioned, the scale and also the quantity would deliver this moment, one, two or even missed a shipment and end of the quarter can be big impact the ratio of our projection accuracy. so normally, we do not give precisely, i'll call the projections.
however, i can come to see that q2 is better than -- much better than q1 in terms of revenue and also shipment. and also, we're looking even stronger, much stronger q3 on the line. and so, as i mentioned to a previous analysts, we'll try to prepare for our capacity really to be able to ship in q3, a bigger order, not just only the, i call the repeat orders. also, we have a bunch of tool, if the first tool -- first order or first tool, when you do the shipment in the q2, q1, q3 timeline.
donnie teng -- nomura instinet -- analyst
sure. just a quick follow-up on the numbers. so you mentioned about the new products, right? can we have a rough idea what kind of gross margin would be compared with our current corporate average level for the new product?
david wang -- chief executive officer
i think our new product and, i call it, the new product average of new product gross margins is still within the range of 40%, 45%. and obviously, depending on customer configuration and also customer requirement, that started varying of their gross margins, right?
donnie teng -- nomura instinet -- analyst
ok. thank you. my second question is regarding to the customers' order. it could be a little bit long question.
so i break it down your customers into three categories. one is china customer, second one is the korea customer, and the last one is the maybe potential global leading customers. so for china customers, are you seeing any early pull in for their orders due to the potential restriction from the u.s. commerce? and also for your korea customer, are you seeing any early sign of maybe the dram capacity expansion in the near future? and for the global potential leading customers, could you give us an update on your progress there? thank you.
david wang -- chief executive officer
ok. good, a long question. ok. let's go one by one.
and so as of mark, you can add on more. ok, for the domestic customer, i do see the demand strong, right? and as i mentioned, domestic customer in china is more of a -- they have a long-term strategic investment plan going on. and also, most of them in half of the expansion for their manufacture fab. so this covid-19, whatever, didn't impact they're -- i should say, didn't impact.
they still follow their plan as they -- even the year before their study and their investment keeps going. and so, i think the most impact by the either market demand or market situation. the second one you mentioned about is our customer in korea. and again, the market, you know that the dram is still new to recover.
and we do see that they have demand for technology migration because our tool as go to the small geometry advanced nodes, they have added more process steps. so, we see that the demand for better applications. we have not seen any capacity expansion yet, right? so again, we're carefully watching. and hopefully, something will be changing in the q3, q4 timeline that is restarting their -- if situation is going well, they're going to restart expansion in their production line.
a last one, for the taiwan customer, again, yeah. and global, i see that is taiwan is the next major, i call the penetration. and also, we try to also penetrate the u.s. customer, probably they have a fab in china, too.
so we are working very closely with the top-tier customers. and again, it's hard to real tell what time breakthrough. but we're expecting maybe we can breakthrough one any of this top-tier customer in the year -- in this year. and if we're lucky, maybe you can break two, right? so again, that's our strategy to pull our technology into the top-tier customer.
we have a strong confidence. they need our technology. and also, we have company has been into the, we call it, critical stage, right? where we have a very good balance sheet and also have a relatively about 340 people 350 people right now in the reach of their -- they call their critical sites. so we can support them with large volume with multi-system repeat order.
so we're going to propel. again, we try to working also hard and get into the top-tier customer. it's a really matter of time.
donnie teng -- nomura instinet -- analyst
ok. thanks for your help. i can --
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
great. yup. thanks, donnie. next question operator, please.
operator
your next question from the line of jeff su from morgan stanley. please ask your question.
charlie chan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, david, hey, mark. it's charlie chan from morgan stanley.
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
hey, charlie.
charlie chan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
so first of all, yeah, great to hear everything goes well. and first question is really about the opportunity of your new product. in your slide, page 7, you said saps and the tebo is around 50% of your kind of total addressable market. so with those new products, what would be your total addressable market now? is it still a $3 billion or more than that?
david wang -- chief executive officer
yes. ok. actually, we have our new products right now, and maybe, i go give the certain point here. obviously, there's semi-critical cleaning product, three products together, we estimate at about probably $800 million total value market for us and then beyond that is we have our ecp.
ecp, we have a front end, back end, and they all add together, roughly about $5 million for their ecp. and our sfp, actually, at this moment, we're most focused on right now is the front end, i think, in the back end right now. however, they do have a potential to get in front end, right? so if we can add all together, our estimation, almost about $500 million for copper polishing. and the furnace, right, is actually huge, right? it's almost by their market data, almost $1.5 billion.
obviously, they have different kinds and neo, oxidation, lpcvd, and ald. as our plan, at this moment, regarding lpcvd, however, as going on, we definitely will get into their -- another three new process. eventually, we'll get into ald process too. so you put it all together, that's almost about $3.5 billion.
and then, add with our cleaning original -- our leading-edge technology cleaning is about $1.5 billion. so that's about $5 billion market we're targeting right now. again, with our plan to get to market and with more funding, we believe that we can support our growth and to become the multi-product company and cover both wet precess and dry process.
charlie chan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok, david. thanks. and i think for your current liquidity is quite differentiated, i would say, given the megasonic technology. but for those new business furnace and also the ultra c.
do you have kind of specific technology differentiation and who are the main competitors in this area?
david wang -- chief executive officer
ok. obviously, great. at this moment, you can see that semi-critical cleaning ultra furnace, there's quite a big player there, right? and maybe, i don't need to mention four names here. look in the furnace, major ones are dell and kokusai and hitachi.
so the reason, as i said, is that we get into the ultra furnace. we do believe there's innovation continually needed when the people go to advanced nodes. so that's the real major reason we're getting this business. at this moment, and we're working on carefully, and also, we are working on the innovation side there, which will deliver something different to the market.
and with the semi-critical market and that probably, i should say, it's more like a customer, one that get in the market. and the reason for that, they want one-stop shopping, and also, they want to gather -- they like our tool quality. so -- and it's kind of how do we fill customer demand? that's really getting through there. so as the future going on, we believe we're still focused on our innovation product and especially penetrate the first-tier customer.
however, with other non-critical or semi-critical products, we still try to meet other customer or second-tier customer requirement for those products. and mark, anything you want to add on?
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
no. nothing to add. go ahead, charlie, with your next question. thanks, david.
charlie chan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you. yeah. so --
david wang -- chief executive officer
go ahead, please. hello?
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
yeah. operator, maybe you can try getting charlie back on. it looks like he dropped and came back. i -- actually, let's go to the next question and bring charlie back later.
yeah.
charlie chan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok.
operator
he's back. he's back. i'm sorry.
david wang -- chief executive officer
oh, ok.
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
oh, he is? oh, ok. go ahead, charlie.
david wang -- chief executive officer
hey, charlie. please, sorry.
charlie chan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah. new customers in taiwan or u.s., my question is whether you are aiming for the kind of the legacy production line? or are you guys aiming for the new geometry, new generation?
david wang -- chief executive officer
yeah. actually, i think for the top-tier customer and definitely, their interest in acm's differential technology, right? and so, it's not a legacy tool. it's more of our saps, tebo, and tahoe. and this moment, they are most interest for our major products.
and maybe, as time going on, maybe sfp, stress free polishing can be another targeted product. so, we are going to penetrate the top-tier customer with our, i call it, differentiated proprietary technology. that's our strategy.
charlie chan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. got it. thank you.
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
yup. next question here, please.
david wang -- chief executive officer
thank you, charlie.
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
you got it. yup. thanks, charlie.
operator
sure. your next question comes from the line of mark miller from mister -- please ask your question.
mark miller -- analyst
let me just extend my appreciation that seem to be doing well and there were no serious problems with the covid virus for your staff. and just wanted to -- could you kind of more quantify, you said some shipments were delayed into 2q. is there a figure you can apply to that?
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
yeah, david, do you want me to answer that? he's asking a little bit for --
david wang -- chief executive officer
yeah. go ahead.
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
yeah. so mark, yeah, i just -- there's a number of tools, a couple of tools, a couple several tools from -- got delayed from q1 to q2. that's -- we're not going to give a lot of detail, but it was a number of tools. yeah.
mark miller -- analyst
ok. they'll be revenued in the second quarter then, those tools?
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
yeah. we'd expect that in the majority in the second quarter. yeah.
mark miller -- analyst
i think you also have last quarter's --
david wang -- chief executive officer
yeah. some of them will be revenue.
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
ok.
david wang -- chief executive officer
-- and some of them probably the first tool, right? also delayed from q1 to q2.
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
yeah.
david wang -- chief executive officer
because of reason of this wuhan situation.
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
yeah.
mark miller -- analyst
you also had some slippage into the third quarter, i think in ymtc, has there been any more slippage in ymtc?
david wang -- chief executive officer
most our tool -- actually, what we try to deliver in q2 time line, and again, maybe the end of q2 or beginning of, i call it q3. but most like the mid of the year, that's our delivery for the ymtc.
mark miller -- analyst
because of our --
david wang -- chief executive officer
again, we're working with them, other new products. and some other new product would be delivered maybe in the q3 and q4 timeline.
mark miller -- analyst
ok. because of the new -- the virus, there was a spike in purchase of certain type things like laptop, pcs, which really produced a strong quarter. we've been looking at dram and also nand pricing for some time and that has steadily been rising for both types of chips since late october. but over the last several weeks, we've seen kind of a flattening of the increase.
in fact, dram prices have come down, i'm just wondering what you're seeing at your customers in terms of capacity utilization. has that continued to stay up? or has there been some slackening off of capacity utilization?
david wang -- chief executive officer
ok. well, a good question, right? and again, there's a -- we have both customers, one in the dram, another one, most in the 3d nand business. look at their 3d nand in china, obviously, they're in the capacity increase and they're trying to increase their capacity go to 50,000 per month level. and also, the reason now they're 128-layer of the 3d nand process with even better driving speed and also better of the intensity compared to other guys, 128-layer because they put the drive circuit and also the cell circuit in two different wafers, right? so i think in that sense, is they're in the regular shape, expanding their strategy, and deliver their milestone goal.
and so far, i saw they're doing very well. every time they commit to something, they meet it, right? so we have very good confidence. and that's why also they have become our major customer, our revenue stream for their -- for this year, will continue next year. regarding the dram customer, as i mentioned, they do have some demand.
and as i said, the most is technology migration, right? because there's a [inaudible] whatever they are doing, that migration do need our product, right? so there's demand for that tool. but we have not seen any capacity expansion at this moment. and i think in changing time going on, we just at a moment, watch carefully.
charlie chan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
thank you, sir. yeah. thanks, mark. have a good day and we'll move on to our next question.
i think we time for one more question. yeah.
operator
sure. your next question comes from the line of krish sankar from cowen and company. please cut -- ask your question.
krish sankar -- cowen and company -- analyst
yeah. hi. thanks for taking my question and squeezing me in. hey, mark.
hey, david. how are you guys doing?
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
hey, krish. good. thanks.
david wang -- chief executive officer
hi.
krish sankar -- cowen and company -- analyst
so i had a couple of questions, and maybe, i'll just target it to david. on the ultra furnace project, is this mainly competing against like dell or kokusai? and is this a customer tool? or is this more a function of you for trying to diversify the business from wet to dry? and then, i have a follow-up.
david wang -- chief executive officer
ok. well, again, right? this is a real, i call, the high concentrated customer base. i mean, the vendor base, right? this is a major player as a pop tool, a real japanese player, and which they are doing very well. i'll put it this way.
however, we do believe there's opportunity going on because of the rising market in china. and our customers are more like close supporting and they want to also r&d engineer, very localized to their the fab. so they can give their demand or their special requirement. and therefore, we can build a tool and also do the r&d even need their future requirements.
so that requirement come out. and again, that's a huge market first. and also, we see the market potential there. we are doing a lot of wet process tool.
however, that wet process tool will be followed by the dry process, right? so when we get in the dry process, also help our wet process tool to be take a lot of innovation. so with that in mind, is that way we get into the dry process and we're very, i should say, excited and get into the dry process. and we're prepared for continuing innovation, which is we're building it in our dna. we try to also innovate the product as the customer migrate more geometry, there's also a bunch of new requirements come out.
so that's our intention.
krish sankar -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. got it, david. and then just along with that, clearly, on the batch furnace side, it's mostly the memory customers who use it. it looks like the advance logic and foundry the customers already move to single wafer.
is there a risk that the memory companies also move a single wafer? or do you think they're going to stay a batch for a long time?
david wang -- chief executive officer
good question. actually, a lot of people thought a single-wafer process, right? is it new or is it a lpcvd, and there's always a benefit single part wafer, right? the more better uniformity and better, i call, quality. however, there's still some good advantage for their batch process because of the throughput, right? so even consider ald, there's a lot of slow process ald, right? that's really the painful for the single-wafer process. so there is certain processes step, which can be on done in the batch process, too.
so again, i continue, as i said, it was -- we believe, there's still big potential market in the batch process there. and that's why we gotten this product.
krish sankar -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. got it. and then david, if i could just squeeze in one last question from my end. you spoke about working with advance logic and foundry customers who are in outside china and outside korea.
what metric or what specification are they looking for? like is there a certain magic bullet you need that convince them to buy you -- buy tools from you? or is it just a process there to go through?
david wang -- chief executive officer
ok. great. actually, let's look at our wet process equipment, right? we do have a fab as a megasonic cleaning. especially for the flat wafer, and especially for cleaning monoparticle, especially particles as 90-nano.
we did have strong data, strong correlation and from customers, we are the best in terms of removing small parties in flat wafers, compared with typical water gas gel spray technology. with also our tebo megasonic technology, we do too, we can do the patent wafer cleaning without damaging, without this air bubble burst or we call the cavitation a nonstable cavitation and generally the microjet to destroy the patent wafer. so our tebo technology real fundamentally solve the other bubble burst, i call it, a problem or difficult. so, we can do the stable cavitation without their burst.
that way we put megasonic in the new of the application. we can do patent cleaning with either finfab or future any 3d structure. and that is today knowing your solution that can do their physical cleaning by a small geometry patent wafer. so that's the second technology, right? with tahoe, we also mentioned about the sulfuric savings, a big 80% more savings.
so with the three key technology, we have a strong confidence. our customers, especially even existing customers also future potential top-tier customer, they need the technology. why? they have to improve their product yield, right? also have reduced the environment concerns, and obviously, sometimes the costs related there. so that's our strong point and penetrate our product into the top-tier customers.
also, we do have a plating and also have a polishing tool. and that's also underlying and we believe they also can offer special innovation and also special performance, which were needed for the customer in advanced nodes.
krish sankar -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. thanks. thanks a lot david and mark.
david wang -- chief executive officer
thank you.
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
yup. thanks, krish. operator, i think that's it for the call. maybe you can close it up here.
operator

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. welcome to acm research first-quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. i would like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, mr.
gary dvorchak. thank you. please go ahead.
gary dvorchak -- managing director of the blueshirt group
good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss acm research first-quarter 2020 results. we released results after the u.s. market closed last night.
the release is available on our website, as well as, through newswire services. there is also a supplemental slide deck posted in the investor portion of the website that we will reference during our prepared remarks. on the call with me today are ceo, dr. david wang; our cfo, mark mckechnie; and lisa feng, the cfo of our operating subsidiary, acm shanghai.
before we continue, please turn to slide 2. let me remind you that remarks made during this call may include predictions, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. these forward-looking statements represent acm's current judgment for the future. however, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
those risks are described under the risk factors and elsewhere in acm's filings with the securities and exchange commission. please do not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect acm's opinions only as of the date of this call. acm is not obliged to update you on any revisions to these forward-looking statements. certain of the financial results that we will provide on this call will be on a non-gaap basis, which excludes stock-based compensation.
you should refer to our press release for our gaap results and reconciliations between gaap and non-gaap amounts. with that, let me now turn the call over to david wang, who will begin with slide 3. david? 
david wang -- chief executive officer
thanks, gary, and welcome, everyone, to today's call. i hope that each of you and your families are staying safe and healthy in light of the covid situation. our heart go out to those who have been personally impacted by the pandemic. i also want to thank all the healthcare workers around the world who are fighting the virus on the frontline and saving lives.
to support the effort in february, we donated 30,000 marks and 300 full cover hazarded suits to wuhan. more recent, we donate 10,000 masks to new york and california. despite the virus impact, we had a busy and productive first quarter. our first priority was the safety of our employees.
after that, we focus on making progress in growth for the year. we achieved customer acceptances. for demo tools, introduced new products and delivered solid financial results. we are moving forward with key strategic actions that support our mission to become a major supplier of capital equipment to the semiconductor industry.
now some highlights for the quarter on slide 3. we are pleased with our financial results. we delivered $24.3 million in sales, up 19% year on year. shipments were $12 million.
we delivered double-digit revenue growth, even though some shipments delayed from q1 into q2. spending was up as expected. we invested and focus r&d to support new product introduction. we increased sales and marketing to penetrate new customers, and we had higher g&a to prepare for our star market ipo.
we ended the quarter with a solid balance sheet with $52 million of cash and another $59 million in restricted cash from last year's private equity withdrawal. please turn to slide 4. during the quarter, we achieved a major milestone with our tahoe product. on last quarter's call, we reported positive results for tahoe in a production environment as a lead customer.
i'm now excited to report that tahoe achieved first two acceptance at that customer. resulting revenue recognition in q1. this represents a great achievement for acm and for the industry. tahoe is a unique platform compared to other single-wafer spm cleaning tool.
tahoe offers the same or even better performance while using only a fraction of the sulfuric acid. sulfuric acid is environmental problem for the entire industry. our tool is one of our 10 solution that delivers good performance, benefits the environment, and reduces operational costs with significantly less chemical use. even more exciting today, we report that we received repeat order from tahoe from this lead customer.
we plan to deliver tool for revenue in the coming quarters. the environmental advantages of tahoe put us in a great position to engage with new potential customers in taiwan, north america, and europe. we expect more momentum from tahoe including orders for additional demo tools as the year progresses. our customers are happy with our current products and are pushing us to provide more tools for cleaning and for other manufacturer steppers.
in response to the demand, i have a few exciting new products to share with you today. please turn to slide 5. yesterday, we introduced a latest addition to acm cleaning product line, three new semi-critical wet cleaning tools for front and backside wafer process. the new tools are first, the ultra c b for the back side cleaning; next, ultra c wb for automated wet bench; and the third, ultra c s for scrubber.
these new tools, expanding our opportunity to even more clean steps at our major customers and we estimate to add approximately $800 million to acm's total available market opportunity. while these are semi-critical cleaning steps, this tool are features the same high-quality that our customers expected from us. we are off to a great start with these tools. we have already delivered a number of these tools as demo tool to current customers with some already recognized for revenue and some still in qualification.
next, turn to slide 6. for another major announcement, the ultra furnace. this broad platform is our entry into dry processing application. this opens another large market for acm beyond wet processing.
in our view, innovation in a vertical furnace technology still required for industry with progress to more advanced manufactured nodes. that is why acm into the market. we have been hard at work for furnace for more than two years. in a joint development project of our world-class technology teams in china and korea.
the two teams developed a new hardware platform that combine our premium proven software and the proprietary control system. the ultra furnace delivers reliable control of pressure, gas blow rate and the temperature. the ultra furnace is optimized to deliver high-performance batch processing of up to 100 12-inch wafers that initially supports low-pressure chemical vapor separation process or called lpcvd. with additional development work, the furnace tool can be expanded to address oxidation, annealing process and the for atomic layer deposition process.
we delivered our first ultra furnace demo tool to a key customer in the first quarter and expect the qualification by the end of this year. please turn to slide 7. this represents acm's view of the market opportunity addressed by full product line. you are all familiar with our core single-wafer wet cleaning product, saps, tebo and tahoe.
we estimate this product represents a $1.5 billion market opportunity for acm. we estimate our four recent announced products. the ecp, the sfp stress free polishing and semi-critical cleaning and vertical furnace products, extending our reach by another approximately $3.5 billion take us to up to $5 billion in total market opportunity. acm commits to gaining market share through innovation and new products.
we have a multiyear product roadmap, and we are committed to further developing our technology across current and new product line to address technical challenges faced by our customers at more advanced nodes in the future. turn to slide 8. we are confident in the opportunity to expanding beyond our current base of five major customers. we believe every major semiconductor manufacturers can benefit from our technologies.
we began to broaden our sales team last year with the addition of new sales managers in the u.s. and singapore. in early april, we announced the appointment of jim straus as vice president of sales for north america. jim brings to acm near 30 years of sales and business development experience in semiconductor capital equipment.
he has a track record of success sell into top five global ic manufacturers. we're excited to have jim on board. he will lead our effort to expanding adoption of our core technology at a major ic manufacturers in north america. now an update on two major strategic efforts for 2020.
please turn to slide 9. first, our land agreement. in december, we announced an agreement to acquire land right in the lingang region of shanghai, 30 mile from acm headquarters shanghai. this will be the future site of our fully owned r&d and production facility.
negotiations are in the final stage. we expect to reach agreement very soon. if an agreement is reached, we would expect to start the construction late this year with goal to begin initial production in later 2022. second, we are making steady progress on the shanghai star market listing.
we are on track to submit acm shanghai's ipo application in middle 2020. we are hopeful for a timely review by the shanghai stock exchange, sse, and registration by the china security regulatory commission, csrc. if all goes wells, we will be pricing the transaction by end of the year. we are confident that the ipo will raise acm profile in asia and improve acm spending with the local customer and the supply chain.
the star market ipo would also inject sizable capital into our china and global operation, and what we believe will be favorable valuation. this will help take acm to the next level, enable us to accelerate our long-term business plan at a critical stage in our development. before i turn it over to mark, i would like to update you the covid-19 situation and discuss our 2020 outlook. i'm happy to report that all of our staff are back to work at both of the shanghai facility, as shown on slide 10 and at our korean r&d center.
the shanghai regime has stabilized further since our last call with no new local covid-19 cases. all our production lines have returned to 100% staffing. we are working closely with our supply chain to ensure timely delivers. most important, we are working hard to expand our capacity to handle additional loading for the rest of the year.
since outbreak, we have been in constant contact with our customers, in particular, ymtc is the first factory and its center of operations are in wuhan. they are fully committed to scaling production. we happily report that wuhan has officially opened and we are on track for delivery to ymtc in the second quarter and beyond. our other customers in less affect city have also returned to work in an ordinary fashion.
operations appear to have returned to normal. please now turn to slide 11. as we look ahead, we remain optimistic. let me share our current outlook, which is unchanged from last quarter.
q1 revenue and shipments expected were impacted by the covid-19 pandemic where part of our business shift from q1 q2. our internal forecast for repeat orders and first tool remain largely unchanged for the full year. our visibility is supported by firm orders, customer forecast, and tool awaiting acceptance. accordingly, we reaffirmed our full-year 2020 outlook.
we expect revenue to be in the range of $130 million to $150 million. this will represent 30% annual growth at the mid-point. our outlook is based on a couple of key assumptions. first, covid-19 situation further improves in china and stabilizes in the rest of the world.
second, the low end of revenue range, assuming muted dram recovery, and limited revenue contribution from new customers. to conclude, i would like to thank our customers, partners, and shareholders for their continued support and confidence in acm research. i also want to thank our employees for their hard work and their dedication in this challenging time. we are executing on our strategy.
we are investing in r&d to enhance current products and to develop new products. we are building our global sales and marketing resource to penetrate new customers in new regions, and we are scaling production capacity to support our long-term growth plan. i will now turn the call over to mark, who will discuss financial results in more detail.
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
thank you, david, and good day to everyone. we're off to a solid start here in 2020. unless i note otherwise, i will refer to non-gaap financial measures. a reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to comparable gaap measures is included in the earnings release.
turning to slide 12. for the first quarter, revenue was $24.3 million, up 19%. q1 revenue and shipments were impacted by the covid-19 related shutdowns. revenue growth was driven by an increase in front-end equipment, partly offset by a decrease in back end assembly and packaging equipment.
total shipments were $12 million versus $14 million in the year-ago quarter and $25 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. total shipments included deliveries for revenue in the quarter and deliveries of systems awaiting customer acceptance for potential revenue in future quarters. we expect shipments to rebound in q2 and q3. gross margin was 42.2% versus 43.2% in the prior-year period.
gross margin was within our long-term target of 40% to 45%. gross margin varies on a quarterly basis due to a variety of factors such as sales volume and product mix. operating expenses were $8.4 million, up 43%. the increase in operating expenses was related to higher r&d on new products, sales related activities, preparation for the china star market ipo, and covid-19 related spending to ensure the safety of our operations.
operating income was $1.9 million versus $3 million in the year-ago period. operating margin was 7.8% versus 14.6%. net interest income was $0.2 million versus a net expense of $0.1 million in the year ago period due primarily to increased interest income earned on larger cash and restricted cash balances. net income attributable to acm research was $2.4 million versus $2.6 million last year.
this included a net benefit of $0.6 million in q1 of 2020 versus the net expense of $0.1 million in q1 of 2019. that factors a normalized tax rate of 12% and removes the realized operational income or loss from foreign exchange fluctuations in each period. net income per diluted share was $0.11, compared to $0.14 in the same period last year. this includes a net benefit of $0.03 for the tax and foreign exchange items for the quarter versus $0.01 expense in the same quarter last year.
now, i'll review the balance sheet items for the end of q1. cash and equivalents were $52.3 million, down from $58.3 million in q4. the decline was primarily due to a reduction of short-term borrowings, offset by positive cash flow from operations, and other items. restricted cash was $58.7 million, down slightly from q4 due to exchange rate fluctuations.
restricted cash reflects the proceeds from acm shanghai's private equity rounds and it will be released when we submit our china star market ipo application, which is expected by the middle of the year. short-term borrowings were $3.9 million, down from $13.8 million at the end of q4. total inventory was $45 million, finished goods inventory decreased to $11.6 million from $19.3 million at the end of the last quarter, and $13 million in the year-ago quarter. the quarter on quarter decline reflects the net effect first tool of shipments and customer acceptances in the period.
cash flow from operations was $3.8 million for the first quarter and capital expenditures were $0.1 million. to conclude, we are participating in the growth of major new ic fabs, we're ramp production, and we continue to develop and deliver innovative products. we're optimistic about our opportunities in china and expansion outside of china in spite of the disruptions caused by the covid-19 pandemic, and we remain committed to achieving our mission to become a major player in the semiconductor equipment market. so, let's now open the call for questions that you may have.
operator, please go ahead.
",2020-Q1,ACMR
1.0,0.9937,,,":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions]. we'll pause for a moment to compile the q&a list. we have our first question comes from the line of patrick ho with stifel financial corp. your line is open. please go ahead.
patrick ho -- stifel financial corp.
thank you very much. yeah, directly [phonetic], nice outlook maybe to david or mark, the semi equipment industry has gone through a lot of supply chains and strength over the past quarter given result let your outlook, it looks like then very well. can you just qualitatively, give a little bit of color and then whether you're seeing any supply constraints your supply chain is probably a lot different than some of my american companies, but i was just wondering how you saw supply chain constraints during the quarter or if any going forward.
david wang -- chief executive officer
okay. thank you. actually because the market is moving the component supply together tight hesitated bank. so we do see some long leading item get for the longer, so only way we're many that, is that where based on our projections fell in the half even beyond. and then we're looking there early ordinary early purchase it right and there is a long leading item. so we do see some components get a longer which impact on us. however, we get a pretty much could and we'll continue to see that there, hopefully this is get input and this moment, we feel comfortable about our revenue this year. and actually also. we also comment about also our shipment this year too.
patrick ho -- stifel financial corp.
right, that's helpful. maybe in the smart collected from mark gross margin between the 40% to 45% range. lot of moving pieces. every quarter as we look at the high segment. we have the first time to customers. how do you balance that versus your overall i guess normal operators because if you get a quarter of the multiple system, is that could weigh in gross margin, the out of that, what are some of the steps you're taking to try and ensure that in the gross margin. still, you say your stated given the number of first tool the evaluating out in the field.
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
great. so, patrick, i'll take that and maybe david, if you wanted to add to it, but, patrick.
david wang -- chief executive officer
sure
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
...it's an art and a science, certainly i mean right now. demand is quite strong and so we're focused on our production.we do what we can of course to balance our revenue items versus our shipment our first tool shipment items and to the balance to gross margins. but many times, really it's we --our customers have strong demand. and we do what we can to support our customers. so we are --it's very important for us to focus on innovation at the high end, but then we're also moving to deliver some round out the product market to create a moat between us and our competition. and so we do feel very comfortable that we can balance all the items to deliver at gross margins in the range in the 40% to 45% range.
david, do you want to add anything to that?
david wang -- chief executive officer
yeah, actually you mentioned quite a bit. good. i want to add something really at this moment. i think,we together balance the product portfolio, right, and you will see that there, say a year ago. most our is single wafer community and there was a normally higher margin and the margin still keeping changing as we introduce the semi critical product and also moreover advanced packaging tool and their slightly lower-margin product come out. right. so we combined together does kind of margin. you see that dilution a. however, as we continue to mature, our products. you mean in the semi-critical tool and also control our cost manufacturing i gear production plus we're additional innovation product ecp continue mature cell and also at the bulk of the come out and so you that and is continue i. so we believe this moment we tried to also secure position and also especially keeping competitor get into our flagship product, as it the most organic semi-critical, all other relatively low profit product. however, as i said, we've got confidence with our also future innovation keep going even add a new cleaning function more of a new feature even to our community major products that were see that margin eventually get back. i mean it was still confident. at 40%, 45% and as i said, continued innovation and new property that will help our margin keep going in the range.
patrick ho -- stifel financial corp.
great, thanks very much.
operator
our next question...,
david wang -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
...comes from the line of quinn bolton from needham and company. your line is open. please go ahead.
quinn bolton -- needham and company
on the ecp sort of outlook and hoping you might be able to spend just a little bit more time talking about the ramp that you expect for ecp, maybe if you could give us a sense how many tools you have? ecp tools you have waiting customer acceptance and any thoughts whether ecp might be able to get to 10% of revenue next year, is it ramps and customers accept tools?
david wang -- chief executive officer
okay. we're looking at ecp product, we've got actually a major i should say 3 major categories. let me clear that one is a damaging process we call ecp map. and the second line recorded ecp pfc, number three is actually advanced packaging tool which will deliver for the packaging fan-out and a pillar or advanced packaging requirement, number four, we come is actually another copper plating for the compound semiconductor, it's a relatively small size 6 inch in mostly, eventually 8-inch. so with, not all product were fully expanding.
this year we see a quite a bit of a shipment and to the new customer. we're looking for actually probably tiny plus total tool we're deliver total again this year and some of them a record revenue, but most of them, i mean as you say, is how the enough, but there, some of them will be tactical, but again, obviously next year what become a repeat order and then that will be real other, bigger ramp booster or revenue. i call the product and to our portfolio of next year.
quinn bolton -- needham and company
so it sounds like, if you've got 20 million plus of tools delivered this year repeat a lot person is...
david wang -- chief executive officer
no, it not a 20 million, 20 tool number. not a 20 million tools.
quinn bolton -- needham and company
wow. okay.
david wang -- chief executive officer
yes.
quinn bolton -- needham and company
got it.
david wang -- chief executive officer
you. have a wrong number right? quinn?
quinn bolton -- needham and company
got it. thank you. that's why i get the 10% of revenue pretty quickly. got it. thank you david.
mark just. yeah. thoughts on opex. i know you guys are increasing the r&d to invest in all the new products. but as we look at the quarterly progression of opex, can you give us any sense as to what kind of increases you might expect into q3 and thoughts whether opex would increase further in q4, whether it would fall followed normal seasonality and maybe tick down a little bit in the 4th quarter. thank you.
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
yeah, i mean we don't, we don't give a lot of detail on our opex, we tend to guide on the, on the top line, but for the year. we think the opex would be 28%, 29% of sales, a good mix of r&d that we've talked about sales and marketing and then followed by g&a. so, yeah, you don't expect any, any kind of significant changes in the back half of the year, but so you should get a little leverage in the back half of the year. on the, on the overall revenue growth.
quinn bolton -- needham and company
got it. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of krish sankar from cowen. your line is open. please go ahead.
krish sankar -- cowen and company
yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. i had two of them, first one, david, on the bevel etch chemistry. what are the main competitors because it seems like most of them new drive and this trying to figure out who the comecer on the that and then i have a follow-up.`
david wang -- chief executive officer
great. i actually, --like you said. --and so, --i mean, i should say, a large part, of [indecipherable] right. a lot of bevel etch, buying etchy pockets, which is, i should say, it's pretty good performance. however you have there, a particle remaining and just switch right and they for that a portion how to really get to in a cleaning, again, i mean the wet process etchy tool you adjust buses they can the much better profile and also give you clear at your result almost nobody could on top. so that's really helping reduce the film --the particle contamination and adds to the edge die for our case, actually also innovative method. as i mentioned, we have a very precisely alignment to control the center or to pass the center wafer. and so, therefore we can reach much better centering performance therefore region much better control for the bevel accuracy, leading to the better yield right that's our product.
krish sankar -- cowen and company
got it! very helpful. and then just a follow-up on electroplating, thanks for the color on the different drivers for electroplating, i'm just kind of curious, david, you mentioned the plating market could triple to $1.5 billion in the next few years. i understand the different drivers like couple yield down the seen in compound semi but it almost seems like for the last few decades. this market of under $0.5 billion are pretty high the asp is a pretty low some kind of curious what gets you to a tripling in market to $1.5 billion, is it just these 4 drivers, you spoke about, or is there anything else going on the asc increases or throughput reduction happening. thank you.
david wang -- chief executive officer
yeah. okay, great. i think the need to drive the post is still, i should probably psv and also the 3d packaging right. obviously balancing process. yeah. it has been like very stable obviously more volume, more wafer if you people talk about that will continue to. great. i know you increase. and then more of their driving we see here is that, like all their 3d packaging now there talk of our pillar if you claw can pick could you 2 got mega dealer. i would just kind of a higher pillar, you need a more of a positive time into plating such a figure pillar right so also they're talking about 3.5 g and 3d. so there is a much more 3d application come out and for the packaging. obviously, not only for advanced, i call application even people today consider even 28-nano or 40-nano there, try to combine with the advanced packaging technology there is further enhance our performance. so with that in mind, we think just grow. i and the people who this year property is when we reach is 700 million as a total tenancy and the packaging altogether. so we're very the see that a growing opportunity again because our pretty driving by their how the mortgage law right, people focused on their on a lot of the bank packaging approach.
krish sankar -- cowen and company
very helpful, thanks a lot, david. thank you very much.

our next question comes from the line of charlie chan from morgan stanley, your line is open. please go ahead.
charlie chan -- morgan stanley
thanks for taking my question and great results. david, good evening and mark, good morning. my first question is about the lean time between your shipment to the revenue. so maybe mark, can you please remind us what is the lean time?
david wang -- chief executive officer
in this moment i should they are average the pie along those 6 months already.
charlie chan -- morgan stanley
okay
david wang -- chief executive officer
...and average some bigger product so there something maybe longer as about the 2 months longer than our previous 4 months time. so that's the, now i hopefully as time going on we going to shorten in other product cycle and at the moment, i should say supply that in leading leading item and take much longer time to get in the hand of the major reasons.
charlie chan -- morgan stanley
okay, thanks. yeah. so because you took about your annual annualized production. right. so if i look at second quarter you're is up over $80 million us and the full year. production is exactly as range of $50 million us i'm thinking that when you try to just meant your annualized production hundred million us dollars. my question is that when well, companies revenue scale will hit 500 million us?
david wang -- chief executive officer
well, that's tough question. again, i mean, assuming the number we normally to now there are real i quarter final release in almost end of the year. right. so i can tell this year. our shipment is much higher than last year and i actually number. i'd just say it might be waiting for q4 or early release but then, so i mentioned a $5.0 million revenue shipment as the capital. so, if it's a shipment no probably easier to reach, right hopefully within next year. but the revenue wise, it was still based on that, what do you say, a lot of a new product and new customer our rare recognition big time. right. so again i to see that a lot of going on by the revenue wise, we'll give you a property by early next year then we see more visibility. what is our sales all the next year.
operator
we have our next question comes from the line of donnie teng from nomura securities. your line is open. please go ahead.
donnie teng -- nomura instinet
thank you, david. and mark, for taking my question. my question is related to customers. on your prepared remarks, you mentioned about that you recently received new orders from for several tools for the second half of the year. so i'm just wondering is if there any approval granted by smic's us suppliers, so that they can start to procure more equipment from our research as well or is there any other reason behind and for another customer like one tc right so i think one tc is running out of it is a phase 1 capacity expansion maybe by the end of this year or maybe by sometime next year. so just wondering if you could kindly give us some update on maybe when will one tc start the potential phase 2 capacity expansion? so this is my first question.
david wang -- chief executive officer
okay. well, again, right, regarding thing is a lot of different the inflammation following in a market, right. and we do see some anyway our and same player in the industry. it is that they got the license and with for the entire tool, of a big tool. and also, we heard is some even some component supplier. they also get the license to right, i'll come up maybe a full year one time license. so again, we see that there i call about the pension that release, but again i don't know. all of this, the total product and as i know, going to buy, how much percentage again how much not again so that information. i really cannot comment that's i heard so far. but however we do have indication and they're trying to expansion their demand their customer. it really demand capacity. right. so next year it do have expanding plan on the nickel into next year. so, our same property as and timing reach this year and also maybe q3, we can see more clear a picture on that. regarding one qc, as we know there faced factory almost a 4-occupied. right. and by that by capacity and private end of this year. the first phase land plant is going. it then if we look at the building, i can only say what asia right as i'd be careful what is very coverage also if look at outside ability. we, the next line that in deposits. so by their ability to any now we're probably going to say about end of this year. they can finish their construction and then again as a major supplier with uptick finished construction this year they expanding their second fab any i heard that they will make us successful 128 of their manufacturing. right. so with that their technology be developed. it's very natural thinking they continue expanding, they are 128 layer in our mass production. and obviously this is a recent game. we're also expecting that go into even 198 or even more of layer r&d for the coming year. so one qc is a very good customer for us, and we have available to and also we are expanding our product portfolio, right, not just only product and we're spending also other a couple trading and also other photos product eventually getting the. you see also all the new advanced requirement. i especially for the 1-25 and bob. but we very good i call the plenty to improving our product we have today to make sure we can meet their requirement. right. 2 years, 3 years from now, probably not client of for the new layer even more. so we're working very close and to give us joined develop our new products to meet their future requirements.
donnie teng -- nomura instinet
thirdly, i have a follow-up on smic so when you that you received new orders from smic is that for like there shanghai fab but most vention i fab or is for like beijing more mature nodes like above 28 nanometers.
david wang -- chief executive officer
yeah. we got actually from beijing mature notes and also, i'd say that expansion plan. as i mentioned the can part also there beijing with most of that happened, maybe a shenzhen, right. that's why i heard so far.
donnie teng -- nomura instinet
okay. and my second question is probably for maybe longer term business expansion. so i think based on your sales scale, right. if we consider you have maybe like 80% of sales roughly from wafer cleaning tools then i guess you probably will translate into at least more than 10% of the market share in china already in terms of wafer cleaning tool. so i think probably you are the biggest --already the biggest one, then continue expanding market share in china. domestically, but i think that kind of market share has been pretty high. right. so, inevitably, you need to spend to more new product for portfolio as you just mentioned like ecp advanced packaging etc. but on the other hand, previously that you are also trying to penetrating into overseas, leading semiconductor customers. so i'm just wondering, which targets are the priority right now and could you kindly give us some update on your expansion in the overseas market. thank you.
david wang -- chief executive officer
great, thanks. okay. i should say both important right both the market in china is important and also outside china important and actually our long-term goal. let me give you the long-term goal. we are trying to make our revenue 50% come from china market and 50% from outside china market and that's why we are actively agile higher building our strong team in the us to approaching leading customer us also enhance our team in taiwan too right and reason. also we have further enhance our sales team in europe, we believe our core our proprietary technology like saps and tebo for pdd cleaning with our energy and also a powerful product in our, with our i call so vegas process and there also. and we, i should say that we also add additional new function, new requirement, and for the further strengthening our community product right among those 2. that was all innovation in hand, we are trying to first the demonstrate probably china and korea market and we believe our product eventually or think in apache. there are major companies in the world. we only key customer they neither technology, right. as i've said, again our proprietary technology and there is a real unique approach we're providing and with all the benefit we think are essential product we're getting into the market outside china and we're very confident and we see that a big movement and also duty as ordered in the us. so it. david, you want to participate better in a growth market in the us and also obviously you can see very growing market in taiwan. and also, you know, and the potential from new york right if you can talk about the too. so as acm today are really again equal important even revenue major compound in china right now. however, we do see our future growth. and also we're coming from outside china.
donnie teng -- nomura instinet
i have a follow-up for that, so, previously impression is like you put more focus on expanding overseas customers but in past few quarters is like, it looks like our new products or our new equipment expansion to be faster than expected, so we put more emphasize there, i'm just wondering if this kind of situation crack way to say or does the mean that we --our schedule with the offers these customers continuing to be postponed?
david wang -- chief executive officer
well, again as say we are working closely right again as now there i sir. the final mature, not a final maturity yet, but again i don't think i think when we can progress. right. and when the timing and the reaching was announced that at this moment is that we are very, very working closely with the customer.
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
great. we should probably move on to the next question please.

charlie chen -- credit suisse
okay. thank you, lisa dalian, so david, you give some color on smic and one piece. and can you talk a little bit about the xmt please. because, i'm just curious as it has been doing pretty well with all the other major guys in china, but it seems that the business is a little bit lower with the xmt thank you.
david wang -- chief executive officer
yeah, actually we do see that business pick up. right. and probably the to location lines of aging the right and again we're working close with them. i will see that there some some i call order we already and from beijing, the new factory to. i know they have a bigger 40k expansion right and other that will keep going and the partial release that order we're say property of most of our happen next year, but there continue improving technology and implement capacity. so, let's see. and we have been working very close with them to our cleaning product and also a brady [phonetic] and also further to try to walk with them together expanding in our spot right get into their their production 9-2 for their evaluation. so, for the customer and we hopefully eventually they become a copper customer for us and the inorganic coming year soon right so that's our effort to the put here to win the customer as the xmt.

hi david. hi, mark. congrats on the progress here. on the global customer. you said you're going to ship in calendar year '21 and since you have 6 months leaves. i guess you the visibility there starting to understand this is a production volume or pilot volume is it saps, tebo or back-end advanced drilling those kind of that kind of color would help. thanks.
david wang -- chief executive officer
well, and i really couldn't really any product right obviously control, even though it's not a lot talk about of which thereby anyway. we're now going to see that how the cleaning tool and that you will be the evaluation tool and hopefully what we end, repeat order, appeal and that digital process first along the evaluation, we would like in the product, they gather all the production verification bank we're hopefully going to be in. all right. so anything while repeat what that we've had mix right, that's going to be, then we are expecting. again, it's a good opportunity. that's why we're the very good effort and make our team really cells and also some easy and all other related logistics supported by for those haven't

chi tsai -- jefferies.
hi, david; hi, mark, thank you for taking our question. could you give us some color on your asia as you said it's going to take another one to two months. so can you share what were kind of profit with the csrc what's going to take where that yield to go through?
david wang -- chief executive officer
okay, good. so chi, actually, as i mentioned in june actually the shanghai stock exchange. based on these application right to the csrc. so we are going through question-answer as you so far the question given to us were all answered already. all right. and then now i been probably in their internal procedure process and to get a final and also just two days ago, we also submitted the q2 financial review. right. and to this day has csrc also. so let's say it maybe they come into some question coming back to our q2 data and anyway, we're prepared for that. again acm probably, is the first us company has headquarter to us. they also have no ipo with their subsidiary in shanghai and for star market ipo. right. i'm pretty sure, this is a real unique and first case. so it's vulnerable, and they take it more time, consider and take them over a cautious effort. i especially have this this i quarter social report to come out. right. all i think put together. anyway, we have confidence as i said that we're a good housing company and could technology and with our strategy and i think we should be overcome and this i call there. thank you can ipo in star market believe definitely both benefit our real run our expansion plan in china and that's there we're believing would be there knowing win-win right and for the customer in china and our financial investor in the us and also acm global growth. so it's a good thing to try to to to work and make it happen.
chi tsai -- jefferies.
yeah. thank you very much. my second question is regarding your r&d expense. i think you have a very big job on your first half r&d expense. i think that's very positive given you are extending your product there. can you give us some color on the long term r&d expense. although well it says the same like meetings going into next 2, 3 years?
david wang -- chief executive officer
yeah, good question. actually, let me put this way as a major couple of earning call on previous time. we want to balance and profitability and also a growth opportunity. right? so, probably last 2 year, you can save about 100% r&d, and this quarter we get into the 14%.. so, probably seeking to the good range and for us to stay aligned. we've had and this gross margin 40%, 45%. this is all operating coming together you have together a 10% plus and that's kind of profit or read there. so we've got a bad is in the hand and that's why we give you 50% is our property, a number of, we try to be keeping our next two,-three year, but let me add another difference we are for other big guy we spend on the money, very efficient.
look in the last two-three year with developing operating and with you other furnace, we spend also semi critical in process also by and this year we're pushing additional new cleaning function other even drive like already come out and is are cleaning product. we are spending very efficient month was up every pinion dollar and to maximize their our r&d effort. so i think 50% is a good number and we can --we've got a spending. we have a confidence in our getting into our new product come out on a timeline. and also i think are key for our success, or r&d is we are always get inhalation product always the high court division. we don't want to get need to. but number one tier. we also have a very good team and working in the shanghai and working with a korean market, korean onsite. so that's really give us a strong r&d effort and then really see there are part of the market and that's really, i mean historically in terms of that so continue innovation, we are very confident, we'll continue pushing r&d at the next level with the new innovation,product.
chi tsai -- jefferies.
thank you. that's very helpful. i'll come back on the good result thank you.

christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group llc
okay, great quarter guys. i'll try to sneak in 2 quick questions. this some quick recent news about a leading customers default would that is potentially going to have any impact on your was question one. question 2 is what happens if ymtc gets put on the entity list, is there any way to ship to them?
david wang -- chief executive officer
mark, you want to answer that? or
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
yeah, i can i can start and then have you finish, but yeah, the first one on the bond defaults. david has talked about that and prior calls we're pretty confident that the operations of that customer, are solid. and then our general thought is that the financing will be available hopefully from is so long as the operation continues to execute that they can them seek funding from other areas and it's more of about ownership issue rather than a funding operation issue.
in terms of the entity list it's --they are an important cost, ymtc's an important customer, david talked about we expect growth but likely a lower percentage we're monitoring closely, and hopefully they don't get put on the entity list, we feel pretty confident given our manufacturing operation in shanghai and a lot of our technology came from there that we might have some more flexibility to shift to --should they can put on the list, but of course it is dependent upon their ability for the other suppliers to get licenses. so we'll monitor closely and will update if necessary.

gary dvorchak -- managing director of the blueshirt group
thank you and good morning everyone. good evening in china. thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss second quarter 2021 results. we released results after the u.s market closed yesterday.
the release is available on our website as well as from newswire services. there's also a supplemental slide deck posted to the investor portion of our website that we will reference during our prepared remarks. on the call with me today are our ceo, dr. david wang; our cfo, mark mckechnie; and lisa feng, the cfo of our operating subsidiary acm shanghai.

with that, let me now turn the call over to dr. david wang, who will will begin with slide 3, david?
david wang -- chief executive officer
thank you, gary. good day and welcome to today's call. we had another productive quarter with a solid financial results. we delivered right of the revenue and shipment with a good profitability. second quarter results reflect acm's growing customer base, technology leadership, expanding product line, and increased production scale.
revenue growth to $54 million up 38% year-over-year. shipments were $82 million up from $45 million in the second quarter of 2020. we delivered a good balance of growth and profitability with the 40.5%, gross margin to 10.4% operating margin. we are committed to drive profitable growth as we increase our investment in r&d to drive innovation, further strengthening our existing product portfolio, and grow our addressable market with new product. on the bottom line, we reported $0.19 net income per diluted share compared to $0.29 back in the same period last year. we ended the quarter with $7 million of cash. in addition, we hold smi safe star market share worth $31 million as of quarter end.
i will now discuss the recent operational highlights on slide 3: first, our q2 revenue growth was broad base driving by current and new products with current and new customers. our wet cleaning and other front-end product tools represent 85% of the total sell in q2 we had a good growth from our flagship saps product with incremental contribution from our semi-critical tools, advanced packaging, other service and growth significantly country to 15% of our sale versus about 3% last year.
the strong growth of this group was driven by advanced packaging tools, including weather developer and coater [phonetic] and a big increase in our service and spare part tools [phonetic]. this first generation semi critical and advanced packaging tool accelerated our revenue growth and further strengthening our position as a leader supplier in the china semi-conductor industry.
the higher mixing of this product, however, partially dilute our gross margin during this introduction stage. we incur this new market segments to capture the strong demand for our china-based customer and to deepen the mold that differentiate our flagship product from competitors. in cleaning, our newer semi-critical tool, it's the acm flagship saps, tebo and tahoe product recovered more than 80% of the [indecipherable] opportunity in advanced packaging our newer ecp ap product line extending our current portfolio with a highly smic product put it altogether. we remain committed to our 40%, 45% corporate gross margin target.
as a part of our normal product management, we expected improvement in gross margin for our semi-critical and advanced have you grow this will come from these highly featured content as we early model and then arranged for customer evaluation and cost reduction in later generation models. we also expand our cost benefit from volume production, new wire [phonetic], gross margins while our flagship cleaning products remain consistent with the past appeared, which we expect continue.
acm strategy to enter a market with advanced smic products such as our flagship cleaning product, our ecp tools, advanced furnace tools and other new innovative product. this product allow us to win major customer and provide to us the profits, to find a future product development. it also allows us to enter middle range or lower end product that may come with a lower margin in early stage, but allow us to capture a much larger market opportunity as we scale the business.
we remain committed to our gross margin target which we believe, we can achieve by balancing continuous innovation and high-end with that gets planned, product management, cost engineering, and production scale.
less than two slide, we find to discuss acm growing customer base. we have a 5 major front-end customer in foundry, 3d nand and dram. in 2021, we expect huahong group and ymtc to remain our top two customers, we expect good growth from them. this year, however, each may represent a lower percentage, our total revenue as we expect to see significant growth from other customers. we also expect the contribution by smic, sk hynix and 6mp [phonetic]. importantly we [indecipherable] sake. new orders for several tools for smic for the second half of the year.
during the past 12 to 18 months. our team has done a great job, a broader broadening acm tool compound as including a full range of cleaning product and study tools. we are getting indication of higher demand. so as say it was on segment, but it is still early as i must say demand is subject to further licensing progress by then with other us become supplier.
we recently added a number of new china base me come semiconductor customers who manufacture pole analog, cmos image sensor, compound semi-conductor, and other devices. this customer, including 4 or 5 tier 2 player and then hand the floor of new tier 3 and other customers, although is a rally small that's grew over new tier 2 and tier 3 customer, as a whole could contribute 10% or more in 2021 as newer customer investing in new capacity to supporting growth of ig, iot, and euv technology.
acm, a good penetration with a range of tool including saps, semi critical, ecp, and the furnace products. our 3rd customer growth is advanced packaging and other processing companies and also processing customers. top customer have including jcap, tohoe, mappers, and the wafer works. in q1, we discussed and order from xu advanced packing house and we now expect to add more customer as we move in through the year. collectively, we expect a significant growth from the group driving by increased industrial focus on advanced packaging penetration of new customers and a new product cycle for ecp ap costs.
looking ahead, we believe that our current customer base represent a significant opportunity for acm. most of this customer still in early or middle stage of the multiyear capacity expansions. we remain committed to further broadening our customer base as we believe every major semiconductor manufacturer can benefit from our technology.
please turn to slide 6: we delivered total shipment of $82 million in the second quarter, a new record in the company's history. shipment in q2 was $28.0 million higher than revenue the difference largely we present shipment of first tool awaiting customer acceptance. we view this as a positive indicator. as we think we flat demand for new product and from new customers.
this level of shipments is a testament to acm production team in our chuansha factory. we are scaling capacity to meet strong customer demand in a generally supply chain environment. our unit cost high performance battery and the strength of our manufacturing team are helping us manage near term supply chain constraint that give us confidence in our ability to navigate the environment entering the second half of this year.
we plan to begin production in a second building of our chuansha factory in the 3rd quarter of this year. we have increased our capacity plans and now target a run rate beginning in q4 of this year that represent more than 500 million of annualized production capacity up from 315 million at the beginning of this year. we expect to further increase production capacity in 2022. our long-term plan is a build their production and r&d center in the lingang region of shanghai. there are 1 million square of our floor space will enable us to increase our annual production capacity to $1.5 billion us. we completed additional architecture and design work in the second quarter with initial production now part in the beginning of 2023.
please turn to slide 7, we continue to invest in new product to broaden our offering. today, i'm pleased to announce bevel etch, extension to our weather product line. this uses a wet etch method to remove dielectric, metal, and organic material films, as well as contaminants on the wafer edge. acm edged approach minimize impact of edge condemnation or later positive steps and thus improving manufacture yield the product leverage acm wet processing expertise to deliver performance benefit compared to joint approaches in the consumer less technical and support the broader range of a device type and process including 3d map, dram, and advanced logic process we expect to ship our first tool for high volume manufacturing for china based larger manufacture this quarter.
additionally with acm proprietary technology, this new panel product can achieve more accurate and efficient wafer centering on it. this enables our precisebevel etch and our enhanced product yields and a wafer throughput. in addition, we are currently developing advanced technology to deepen our leading market position in cleaning, which we will add more products to our portfolio in 2022.
we remain bullish on our ecp product line in front-end smaller geometry require advanced plating solution. meanwhile, back-end advanced packaging are becoming more important as industrial looks for packaging innovation to drive a higher performance as the industry moves beyond moore's law.
our ecp product line indicate ecp map, a front-end tool for tempering copper interconnection. the ecp psv for uniformed metal layer and also for front-end and you see the ap for the packaging. we believe the total global market for ecp triple from $5.0 million last year to up to $1.5 billion in the coming years. although we did not revenue in the second quarter, we delivered to first 2-3 customer. we expect to deliver a high volume of ecp tools in the second quarter, second half of this year.
with the good revenue contribution from the the shipments in q3 and q4. we also continue to see strong interest for our ultra ecp and furnace joining profit tool portfolio. we deliver several first two including over the built-party lpcvd. in the first half and expect to deliver additional units as we progress through the year. we remain on track, high temperature observation and viewing at our ability to our furnace product line in the 3rd quarter of 2021.
3d or maps, the next major development in our furnace roadmap is a patch atomic layer deposition or air deposits. we view this as a most of challenging and promising product for advanced manufacturing nodes. we expect our furnace pilot cycle to become more meaningful in 2022 timeframe. we are making significant r&d investments in 2 major new product categories to achieve our goal over seventy, our total adjustable market from $5.0 billion today to more than $10.0 billion.
we continue to bring top engineer opinion to support this programs and are confident our team will deliver products and move forward with customer evaluations on first product line, in the first half of next year and the second product line, in the second half of 2022. i'm happy to report we made a good progress with the potential us and taiwan based customers since our last call. despite the covid related travel restriction, our team is heavily engaged in business development.
we are confident that we can secure orders from at least one new major first tier global semiconductor manufacturers in 2021. before i provide our updated 2021 outlook. let's discuss the status of the star market ipo of acm shanghai. we continue to make a good progress on june 10, 2021, the shanghai stock exchange commission from acm shanghais application for registration the star market ipo for china security regulatory commission, csrc. moving up, they have a closer toward our goal. we're hopeful that the csrc approves and complete our registration soon. when we see this csrc approved. we estimate that the issue process will take another one to 2 months. keeping in mind that the timing is subject to numerous factors. i will say acm control. we are confident that our eventual star market this being combined with our obviously can provide a strong foundation to accelerate our mission to become a major global player in the semiconductor equipment industry.
now let's move to our 2020 outlook on slide 8: our guidance reflect optimism about our growth opportunity for 2021. based on our strong results through the second quarter and include visibility for demand and our supply chain through the year-end. we have read outlook for the full year. we now expect the revenue to be between $225 million and $240 million from the prior range of $205 million to $230 million.
the revised revenue range represent 48% annual growth and ebitda point. our updated outlook for 2021 is based on several key assumptions:
first, the global covid-19 situation continues to improve.
second, the stability us-china trade policy.
third, a range of spending scenario.for the production range of key customers.
fourth, various in the trajectory of the dram recovery.
and finally, a range of the timing of customer acceptance of first tool.
our results and outlook stands with a successful execution strategy. our strong growth is supporting additional r&d spending. our new products, we are building our global sales and marketing resource to penetrate the new customer, a new region and we are production capacity to support our long-term growth plan. our mission to become a major supplier for the global semiconductor industry remains on track.
to conclude, i would like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication. i also want to thank our customers, partners, and shareholders for their continued support and the confidence in acm research. i will now turn the call over to mark to discuss the financial results in more detail. mark, please.
mark mckechnie -- chief financial officer
thank you, david, and good day everyone. we delivered solid financial results in the second quarter unless i note, otherwise i will refer to non-gaap financial measures, which excludes stock-based compensation and unrealized gain in trading securities. reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to the comparable gaap measures is included in our earnings release.
now on the second quarter shown on slide 9: revenue was $33.9 million, up 37.9%. revenue for single wafer cleaning tools, which includes saps, tebo, and tahoe and our semi-critical cleaning was $45.5 million, up 36.4%, $33 million. we had net revenue for ecp furnace or other technologies during the second quarter, as david noted, however we delivered 3 first tools in the quarter and we expect more revenue contribution in the back half of the year.
revenue for advanced packaging excluding ecp, services and spares with $8.4 million, up from $1.2 million in 2020. total shipments were $82 million versus $45 million in the second quarter of 2020 and $74 million in the first quarter of 2021. this include deliveries through revenue in the quarter and deliveries of systems awaiting customer acceptance for potential revenue in future quarters. this represents another quarter of record shipments, a great accomplishment by our production team in an industry wide supply constraints.
gross margin was 40.5% versus 49.7%. this was at the lower end of our normal expectation range of 40% to 45%. the decrease in gross margin, as david mentioned was due in large part to product mix, we expect gross margin to continue to vary on a quarterly basis due to a variety of factors including product mix and manufacturing utilization.
operating expenses were $16.1 million versus $11.2 million. the increase in operating expenses reflected higher r&d on new products, our expanded us sales team and legal costs related to our us civil suit and the china star market ipo. r&d expenses grew by 52% to $7.7 million or 14.2% of sales versus $5.5 million or 12.9% of sales last year. the increased r&d intensity reflects acm's commitment to new products and innovation.
we expect to continue to increase our r&d spending in 2022. operating income was $5.7 million, down from $8.2 million. operating margin is 10.5% versus 21%. unrealized gain on trading securities related to the change in the market value of our soic investment was $3.8 million in the second quarter of 2021 note that we exclude this non-cash item from our non-gaap results. tax expense was $15,000 versus $1.9 million in the year ago period. net income attributable to acm research was $4.1 million versus $6.2 million in the year ago period. net income per diluted share was $0.19 compared to $0.29 in q2 of 2020.
tax items and the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on operating results provided a net headwind of $0.3 million or a penny per share in the second quarter of 2021 versus a net headwind of $0.9 million or $0.04 per share in the second quarter of 2020.
we'll now review selected balance sheet items. our cash balance was $70.2 million at the end of the second quarter versus $78.8 million at the end of the first quarter. in addition to the cash balance, we also had trading securities of $31.3 million related to our smic investment. this includes a significant unrealized gain from our original purchase price.
total inventory was $136.9 million at the quarter end up by $33.6 million from the prior quarter. the quarter-on-quarter increase was driven by 2 items first finished goods inventory grew by $68 million to $64 million. this represents first tools that have been delivered to customers for evaluation and are carried on our balance sheet at cost pending potential customer acceptance.
the second item is work in process and raw materials, which in total grew by $16.8 million from the prior quarter. this was due to purchases to support shipment growth expected for the remainder of the year.
short-term borrowings at quarter-end were $22.8 million, down from $23.5 million at the end of the first quarter. long-term borrowings were $18.7 million, up $1.3 million from the first quarter. cash flow used by operations was approximately $10.0 million for the second quarter but it was slightly positive for the first half of the year. in 2021, our base case plan for capital spending is about $15 million. this includes $2.8 million already spent, through the first half of the year, our 2021 investments will be primarily focused on capacity increases at our transfer factories investments to support our r&d programs, and planning and some initial spending on lingang. and some, we continue to execute on our strategy, we are providing, --we are participating in the growth of major new ic fabs. we are ramping production and we're developing and delivering new products to a growing list of customers. we are positive on our opportunities in china and expansion outside of china. we remain committed to achieving our mission to become a major player in the semiconductor equipment market.
let's now open the call for any questions that you may have. operator, please go ahead.

thank you so much. ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. as a reminder, if you wish to ask a question please press 1 on your telephone keypad. we will pause for just a moment to compile the q&a roster. your first question from the line of patrick ho from stifel. your line is open.
patrick ho -- stifel -- analyst
hi, thank you very much and congratulation on nice quarter and outlook. actually, mark, maybe to start off first with you the supply chain. based on your results, your outlook and the margin profile, it looks like you guys managed it very well. can you discuss what problems you may have seen and how you mitigated the situation given the results and outlook.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
yeah. hey, patrick, maybe i will let david start on that and then i can add, but yes, dave.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
we saw that there, patrick, the [indecipherable] actually you know the orders the constraints and the semiconductor equipment their spending is double compare to last year. so we see our component also [indecipherable] constrained and i should say some components we buy from us and buy from japan and we also on europe, right, there is a leading time get a longer and longer, i can give you some example some normal products, we have 2 months, now they are getting in four months, even some special products getting in six months. yeah, so for that reason delay where we had over forecast to ourselves and then based on sales forecast, we are buying those long leading item ahead of time and so that's the approach we are taking so far.
obviously now when they are rolling base and forecasts next 12 months and what is the possible delay, what our vendors supply [indecipherable] and actually now we require our vendor give us next 12 months and [indecipherable] can provide to us right, so that the approach we are taking, and hopefully we can have this supply security or we call supply on time to be improved and you can see that the third quarter, we are doing a lot of good work and however as compared with the regular last year, our leading [indecipherable] it will take more time anyway. so that's the status right now and we know our chief supplier start includes hire more people and also increase the manufacturing floor and we're hoping those situation going to improve for the next year. hi, mark anything you want to add on that.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
yeah. no. thanks, david. i mean, the only thing i would add patrick is, it's not new to deal with the supply chain. i mean we've been dealing with the situation you know related to covid and the global supply chain and then of course the big recovery where the industry is building back semi-capacity pretty aggressive but at our size as a company, i think we're demonstrated some scale, it's really important that our customers are confident that we can deliver and so we're sending that message, but i think our manufacturing and supply chain team did a good job in quarter three and we anticipate that as well in quarter four.
patrick ho -- stifel -- analyst
great, thank you. that was really helpful as my follow-up question, maybe for david in terms of the advanced packaging market, are you showing some really nice growth there. the marketplace itself is growing, can you give a little more color on the type of applications you seen today and how it may progress to say next generation techniques like heterogeneous integration, what are you seeing today and what are some of the opportunity, say over the next couple of years.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
okay. patrick, actually i should say we have relayed on very good product portfolio, right, and therefore that advanced packaging tool with where the positive cleaning and coater developer, stripper and also in the most important copper plating tool. right. so we see the people in this growing area is obviously pillar and also we see the people in the [indecipherable] out and also there also people talking about is micro pillar, more than 300 micron of copper play there. so it's really high demand for our copper plating tool and also our copper plating add certain benefit compared to our competitors including i call their edge control and high plating rate with special design of the plating number. so we see there very strong i call driving for our revenue growth or the [indecipherable] growth this year and next year. so i should say we're also see there a customer outside mainland china interest in our plating tool and we're expecting with those tool hopefully next year, we're getting in the taiwan market and that's our planning. so that maybe there in general way of their i call their advanced packaging tool and plus we also increased new customer in china, jcap and tongfu is our traditional top 2 customer. also we are seeing a few other emerging or i call the new start company getting into this application tool. so we have very good a positive or i call the forecast right for the advanced packaging tool growth.
patrick ho -- stifel -- analyst
great, thank you very much and congrats again.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer

thank you so much. your next question from charlie chan from morgan stanley, your line is open.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
hi charlie.
charlie chan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey david and mark, and hey [indecipherable]. first of all, congratulations for your great result in china ipo and finally also congrats. my first question is about, it seems like we're in the component shortage, you can do more shipments, right. so i'm not sure this year is still delivering very strong growth. right, the next year, do you think we can even stronger growth rate for 2022, any preliminary outlook.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
okay. yeah, actually, you look at our shipment right in quarter two, almost double. right, i mean 80% and our quarter three shipment also 60% in quarter two. so our total shipment you know compared to last year has been increased a lot right, by the end of this quarter i am giving you more detail how much percentage increase, it is much, much more than previous year. so, we think next year continue we look at strong in our forecast pipeline. so in other words, we have the real increase more of the components and buying from our supplier. so you know the words we are real working closely with our key supplier and as i said, we give them a rolling 12 months their forecast plan and they can tell us what is deliver and what is the capacity they can build costs. so we're working on that and i really hopefully next year get a better, but again we're still very carefully watching the market and also working close to our supply chain, it is ongoing process, [indecipherable] carefully also manage this supply chain.
charlie chan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, thanks and i'm not sure if you talk about these, but previously, you mentioned you have 2 new product lines to launch, right. can you update the status right now.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
you're talking about new product or the existing product.
charlie chan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah, the new product line.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
about the 2 new products. yeah.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
i see, ok, well probably there let's put this way 2 years ago right was starting, announcing 2 new product and unfortunately as you cannot tell you what the product and may however, we believe these 2 products represent the bigger market and so it was a market globally and also, we see the 2 new products and also have our i call [indecipherable] also need that innovation for technology improvement, so now we are working closely with r&d and their team. i think probably one product will come out at first half next year, and also we do have a customer talk together it gathers through as a better side application [indecipherable] and also our second product, we're targeting second half next year. so with our team and looking very dedicate, we're hoping those 2 tool would deliver in the timeline.
charlie chan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, seems on the track and my last question is to mark, again lots of works on china ipo. i am not sure that the pricing, what's the kind of [indecipherable], and what will [indecipherable] into your us listing, [indecipherable].
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
yeah, hey, charlie. so i think we put a lot of the details out on where it was price in the number of shares. right, we have the proceeds $3.685 billion remnant [indecipherable] $575 million us, so we in terms of the valuation, i think you can kind of look at our numbers and work that out and of course, i don't know how that's going to necessarily filter back into our us market cap. but after after the offering, we mentioned that the us, we would own 82.5% of the subsidiary.
charlie chan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. okay, thanks. yeah, i thought that it's a big catalyst give us any kind of an overhand, so hope that your market kept can continue to expand. yeah. that's all from me. thank you.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
thanks, charlie.
operator
thank you so much. next question from quinn bolton from needham and co. your line is open.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
thanks, david and mark, i will offer my congratulations on the star market ipo as well as the international customer retention. i wanted to start with the international customer retention. it sounds like the 3 customers you're working with or that you recently announced are all taking tools for delivery to their china manufacturing facilities and wondering if you could give us your thoughts that as you first penetrate their china manufacturing facilities, what's the opportunity to begin to place deliver tools to international.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
hey, we lost your voice. hi, mark, can you hear quinn.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
david, i heard quinn ok, i can repeat the question. can you hear us. david.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
hi mark.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
yeah.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
are you there?
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
yes, we are.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
hi, mark, i can hear you, or am i coming through.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
yeah, you're coming through. okay quinn. i don't hear david, maybe.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
hi mark, can you hear me.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
david, we can hear you ok. i guess you cannot hear us. yeah. quinn, i can take that question while we wait for david to come back, but i think your question was about the new customer announcements. i think we mentioned that two of those were for delivers to the china fab and other one was in asia [indecipherable] one and so can you maybe just clarify your question.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
yeah, i guess maybe i misunderstood i thought all three were smart tool deliveries taking place in china, and was asking what's the progression, you know that the company's opportunity to first deliver tools to china facilities, but then to expand to other manufacturing facilities at those customers around the world.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
got it. yes, it's a great question for david, but i think you know, we've got a global sales force and so these are the three that we announced here recently, but we still feel pretty positive about our opportunity for customer deployments in outside of mainland china. i think, as david noted, our longer-term goal is to have half of our business outside of mainland china. so we've got activities that we think can can result in that in the coming year. soon.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. just to clarify, did you said it one of the customers was taking delivery outside of china somewhere else in asia well.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
these 3, we talked about a saps evaluation order from a global semi manufacturer with the china development fab, we talked about the two stripper orders right where two global idms china packaging facility and then the ecp evaluation order, we just mentioned it was from asia, a regional semiconductor manufacturer, but we didn't say where that tool was going.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
got it, got it. the second question david talked about the growth in the advanced packaging business. i'm wondering if we might be able to get you to sort of give us your sense how much of the business in 2022 might come from that broader advanced packaging application.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
so, quinn, i guess we gave the mix right for quarter three and year-to-date, it was about 74% on the front-end products and 26% on the. sorry, guys we are having some technical issues. i think the team in shanghai just trying to get back into the call, but yeah, i think for now, quinn, kind of a similar mix. i mean it's hard to say for next year where the growth will come from, will give more details on our quarter four call, but we don't anticipate a significant shift between those two groups got it.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you, mark.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
thanks quinn.

thank you so much. next question from suji desilva from roth capital, your line is open.
suji desilva -- roth capital -- managing director, senior research analyst
hi, mark. i don't know if david back on. but, congrats on the progress here. i wanted to that the tivo product has been out there for a while since the ipo, today you started talking about more in this call is that ramp opportunity now potentially going to inflect what are the kind of the puts and takes of the pace at which tebo can grow versus saps.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
got it. yeah, great and suji, we are trying to get got.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
i got back in now. can you give me a okay.
suji desilva -- roth capital -- managing director, senior research analyst
okay. david, can you hear me.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
that's great. hey, david.
suji desilva -- roth capital -- managing director, senior research analyst
david, it's suji, can you hear me.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
very well. please.
suji desilva -- roth capital -- managing director, senior research analyst
okay, great. i have got david. so, i will repeat the question. so i said this call you guys talked about the tivo product more that you had the ipo, i'm curious, is there an inflection ahead for the tivo product with the opportunity there. what are the factors the puts and takes of that growth versus saps which has done very well for the last few years.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
okay. well, actually the tivo, we made a progress right and also, we realized a tivo, we have to combine with a certain dry technology. so a year ago was rather develop with advance drying technology and [indecipherable] two type, one is hard ipa, a multi [indecipherable] method. next one is the, actually a [indecipherable] the two new joining technology, i think we're one will come out probably quarter one next year and the other one will come out should probably quarter two next year. with this joining technology and together with [indecipherable] we're further give a tivo much wider [indecipherable] why, because all they're like 70 nano dram their capacity structure, you have the dry by co2 because the [indecipherable] fact right. also certain [indecipherable] structure also there [indecipherable] ratio either hot ip driving origin. so with this, adding additional joint technology on tivo product and we will see that there tool get a longer [indecipherable]also their logic manufacturing.
suji desilva -- roth capital -- managing director, senior research analyst
okay, all right, thanks david and quinn just ask the question, i want to maybe rephrase and ask it make sure we get your answer.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
sure.
suji desilva -- roth capital -- managing director, senior research analyst
the new customers seem to be shipping primarily into china and the region, with one maybe in asia, and we're excited about the global customers you talk about 50% of business coming from outside of china longer term, can you talk about what it would take for these customers to start putting your tools in outside of china and why maybe the dominant initial push is in the china facility just understand that dynamic.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
yeah. actually, obviously the tool we ship into the china facility or china fab right there fab, is good starting point. this way, our process data, process capability validate by their fab in china. right [indecipherable] potential a quarter getting their fab also, i mean in china, right and so that's we're looking for. so i think it's really good assigned and also a good starting point and those data come out there i think in china may need a driving force and [indecipherable].
suji desilva -- roth capital -- managing director, senior research analyst
okay, that's very helpful color. david, thank you. congrats again.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
thank you.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
thanks suji.
operator
thank you so much. once again in order to ask a question, please press 1 in telephone keypad. next question from mark miller from benchmark. your line is open.
mark miller -- benchmark company -- analyst
thank you for the question and congratulations on the quarter. we're seeing margins jump around a lot and i believe that's through the mix and i'm just, you said the mix looks like it's going to be 75 and 25 front and back-end. i'm just wondering for the next quarter or is it a similar mix to the third quarter.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
yeah, david, do you want to answer that. should i can take that too.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
i think you can [indecipherable] right. this is normally gross margin is a flat rate, we [indecipherable] 40% to 45% and there is a higher margin tool and [indecipherable] that for a moment to give a high margin and certain i got a copper plating and also give margin for front-end and then there is also no margin tool right and as i older bench as certain i call there ([indecipherable] the process tool advanced packaging side too. so it's good, i mean this is a good combination and also depend on combination, there a margin we may be change in right [indecipherable] i couldn't give you precise number, but i think we'll be in a range 40% to 45%.
mark miller -- benchmark company -- analyst
okay. for the next quarter, does it look like a similar mix to the third quarter.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
yeah.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
i said you know, i cannot give you precise numbers. [indecipherable] combination by customer and this year, [indecipherable] 40% to 45% maybe [indecipherable]
mark miller -- benchmark company -- analyst
you're breaking up at least on my side. just wondering if you've been primarily more dram, nand as supposed to come on stronger next year, do you see opportunities, more opportunities for yourself in nand.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
[indecipherable].
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
hey hey, david. you're breaking up a lot. maybe i'll take the question, mark since david's breaking up. yeah. so, mark, just to be clear, if you look at our customers in china, they are very reflected. our nand business as you know ymtc is our big nand customer right, so they were in the 30% range last year and so i think kind of your premise, we have a pretty good mix in nand and then of course sk hynix, cxmt or dram customer. so we continue to expect to get good content in both in 3d nand and with our dram customers.
mark miller -- benchmark company -- analyst
thank you.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
yeah, you got it.

thank you so much. next question from emma tian from [indecipherable]. your line is open.
emma -- analyst
hey guys, congrats first of all on the really straight quarter three. this is emma from [indecipherable] my questions are probably more for david as well, but mark you're welcome to share your thoughts [indecipherable] david back on line, probably not yet.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
yeah, yeah. can you hear me ok.
emma -- analyst
oh that is great, hey, i can hear you (foreign speech). thanks. so my first question is we related to quinn's question as well. i just wanted to ask a bit more details about your future plans, probably in the long-term about expanding the global markets, since we know that the three factories of acmr are all based in mainland china. they actually quite they are all near shanghai, if i remember correctly, is there a particular reason for that. like, do you have any plans to build any other factories say in beijing or even outside of mainland china or outside of asia area.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
okay. let me give you little [indecipherable] star market and it's ultimately our [indecipherable] market ipo most strong financial foundation and [indecipherable].
emma -- analyst
sorry, david, you're still breaking up quite a lot or is it just me, i am not sure.

okay. i said there, we already have our manufacture in their korea. all right. so from now when we probably are [indecipherable] major customer in china and actually beijing and also wuhan and potentially [indecipherable] right. those r&d is more than they were helping closing support customer, but more than that is also we consider other region and also country and as a our business moving out of china is a goal, taiwan and go to us and even though in europe and we do have a plan view the r&d support center and we believe the r&d closings for the customer will give you faster choice or faster supporting capability. meanwhile also we consider if we found good [indecipherable] tenant people for the company, we can [indecipherable] company in the local region that's a further enhance our r&d power in local.
so our goal is really getting into their diversifying and global r&d in our road-map and also as i mentioned in our [indecipherable] we said that we are going to have eventually 50% still right from outside mainland china and you 50% from the inside and that's our long-term strategy right and also with our our division technology, i think what would be much strong driving force, our tool to be sold in global like we mentioned tivo or tahoe and also wet development, new technology also on the role as our innovation product come out be validate in the local market in china and then we can start that push those verify the product into their global market and meanwhile we see also some fab in china altogether [indecipherable] a process going on. so, we have also our tool can be evaluate in most advanced technology nodes, in our sense we got a better of their technology being verify here, they will help us getting into the market outside china.
emma -- analyst
thank you, david. that's all from, do you mind sharing a bit of a timeline for the factories outside of china or is it just it's more of a long-term plan and it depends on how the r&d activities and other opportunities go.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
yeah, actually it really depends on how we penetrate
operator
the customer and also how we see their opportunity in other m&a or potential i call there group come out and [indecipherable] dynamic and as i said we're building korean [indecipherable] centre few years ago and we're definitely have that in our plan and also according to our success, our penetration with their local customer, i will say china than will speed up those [indecipherable] up, right all found some good people and good product. while we may be just group of people there, too, that also can further enhance our sales and supporting capability for that a local region great.
emma -- analyst
that's awesome. all the best for that.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
mark, anything you want to add on that.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
yeah, nothing to add. i think we are kind of at the end of our call here. so i think we need to wrap up. operator, if you can please wrap up the call thanks.

david h. wang -- ceo and president
thanks, gary. good day and welcome to this call. we had an excellent third quarter with strong financial results. we deliver record revenue and shipments with a solid profitability. third quarter results demonstrate the strength of our expanding customer base, our differentiated multi-product solution, strong product cycle for both front-end and back-end, and our growing production scale. revenue growth to 67 million of 41% year-over-year. shipments were 99 million, upper 68% from $59 million in the same period last year. we maintain a good balance of growth and profitability with a 44.5% gross margin and 19.5% operating margin. we are focused on profitable growth as we invest in r&d to drive innovation, broaden our product portfolio and introduce new products.
on the bottom line, we report to this extent of net income value [indecipherable] this year compared to 42% in the same quarter last year. we ended the quarter with 65 million of cash, in addition, we add 30 million in the quarter and holding of smic stock market shares. i will now discuss recent operational highlights on slide three. first, our quarter three revenue growth was the broader base, driving both current and the new products, all wet cleaning and other front-end process tool growth 29% and represent a 70% of the total sales in quarter three. the growth or trailing by our flagship [indecipherable] good contribution from tivo canadian tool and all semi-critical cleaning tools.
advanced packaging other process tools services and spare parts grew by 8% to 26% of a sale. the strong growth of this group was driven by ap tools, including ecp ap wet etcher, stripper and scrubbers together with the increase in our service and spare parts business. second, we received good orders from 3 new major customers. several weeks ago, we announced evaluation orders from 2 potential new customer, the first order is the 4 saps canadian tool from a major global semiconductor manufacturer and is scheduled to be in-store in the china-based development fab in the first quarter of next year. the second order is for ultra ecp map copper plating tool from major asia based semiconductor manufacturer also for deliver early next year. yesterday, we announced order from leading global integrated device manufacturer or idm orders of 2 ultra-c pr wet stripping system to be used in thier china-based advanced packaging facility. we already deliver their first order in october and plan a second half delivery in delivery in quarter one of 2022. acm offers a full product line of wlp wet process tools ranging from colder [indecipherable] wet etcher, cleaning and pr strippers, to advanced copper plating tools. our wlp wet process tool have gained wider acceptance with a number of china-based manufacturers, this order acm first wlp tool win the major global player. acm progress is the three new major player is a testament to our technology leadership. regional support teams and the production scale, we are confident that successful qualification of this tool can result in larger business opportunities. we continue to build our sales tidy pipeline with a top tier player. i want to thank our sales and technical support teams for their outstanding execution. china is among the largest and the fastest growing market.
for semiconductors over the year, acm has become a significant supplier of semiconductor equipment in china with our major [indecipherable] from, and the customer. we believe acm differentiate technology and a multi-product offering provide us opportunity to capture significant market share on a global basis. longer term, we are targeting half of our sales from countries and regions outside of mainland china. third, all ecp product ramps is gathering momentum. we deliver the multiple ecp tool in the first half 2021, even more in quarter three. as noted in last quarter's call, we expect that ecp momentum to continue with the delivery of 20 ecp tools for the full year 2021.
we expect the ecp product line to drive meaningful growth in 2022. we see good opportunity for ecp in both front-end and back-end or packaging applications. from a smaller geometry require advanced plating solutions, our ecp portfolio includes the ecp map for [indecipherable] copper interconnection and ecp [indecipherable]. meanwhile, back-end and advanced packaging has become more important as industrial moves via moist law. manufacturers are looking for packaging innovation to drive higher performance, acm ecp ap for advanced packaging address is a back-end opportunity. we estimate that the total global market for ecp front-end and back-end application will triple from 500 million last year to up to 1.5 billion in the coming years.
fourth, we are seeing strong interest for our outdoor event furnace dry process tool portfolio. so far in 2021, we delivered several [indecipherable] frost tools and evaluation tools, including top and the non-top [indecipherable]. we expect to deliver additional units by year-end. more recently in october, shipped furnace product with higher temperature oxidation and a [indecipherable] capability. building on this strong effusion, the next major development in our furnace road-map, is a batch atomic layer deposition or ald process. we view this as a most challenging and promising product for advanced manufacturing nodes for both memory and analogy. we expect furnace product cycle to ramp in 2022.
based on 2022 market data, we estimate our current products sale of 5 billion total global market opportunity. we are committed to our goal to double our addressable market to 10 billion in the next several years. on that note, we are making steady progress with our r&d investment in 2 additional major new product categories. this is our long-term commitment to major adjustment market, in which our customer are pushing us to invest in product road-map, their support, their advanced nodes. we have accelerated our hiring to supporting this program. we are confident that we can deliver the first tool in each category in the second half of 2022 respectively. we have a deep r&d program, intended to address the next 2 product generations by entering this category as it is a leading edge nodes. we are in a strong strategic position to leverage our local relationships with some of their most advanced semiconductor fabs in the world where we can test [indecipherable] and develop our most advanced technology. this will help driving in most of our product line to the leading edge and competing on a global basis.
next, i would like to recap acm customer base on slide five. all this group includes our five major from end customer that represent the foundry 3d-nand and dram manufacturers. for 2021, we expect a good growth from huahong group and ymtc, which we expect to remain as our top 2 customers. however each may represent a lower percentage of total revenue as we anticipate meaningful growth from other customers. for 2021, we also expect a good contribution from our other three major front-end customer [indecipherable] likely to be over 10% contributors. this including as smic which contributed to our third quarter results as earlier anticipated, sk hynix and cxmt.
our second group including a number of new china-based semiconductor customers who manufacture power analog cmos, image sensor compound semiconductors and other devices. this customer including 4 of 5 tier 2 player and handful of new tier 3 and others, which each is relatively small, this grew up a new customer combined with the contribute 10% or more to our 2021 revenue. as the newer customer are investing in new capacity to support the growth of 5g, iot, ev and ai and other emerging technologies. acm has good presence at customers supplying a broader range of tool including saps semi critical cleaning ecp and furnace products. our third group is advanced packaging and the wafer manufacturing customer, top customer here have including jcap, tongfu, nepes and wafer works. we have had a good order momentum in this group this year, including orders from 2 new advanced packaging house in quarter one and yesterday announcement from the china-based packaging facility, a major global ibm.
we expect additional orders from more potential customer in this group by year-end. collectively, we expect tremendous growth from this group. this should be driving buyer increased industrial focus on advanced packaging and wafer manufacturing. penetration of new customer and a strong product cycle for acm ecp ap floors. looking ahead we believe opportunity for acm, most of the customers are still in early or middle stage of our multi-year capacity expansion. we are committed to further broaden our customer base as we believe every major semiconductor manufacturer can benefit from our technologies. move on, i would now like to discuss quarter three shipments and provider update on our manufacturing facility.
please turn to slide six, we delivered record and total shipments of a 99 million in the third quarter shipments. shipments were 32 million higher in revenue, the difference being first tools and the evaluation tools, net of a customer acceptance for previous deliver first tools. this is a positive indicator as it reflects demand for new product and from new customer. to achieve this level of shipments, we must thank the production team [indecipherable] our facility, we're ramping production capacity to meet the strong customer demand in a constraint supply chain environment.
started production in the second building of our chuansha factory in quarter three as planned. we are on track with our capacity road-map, which targets a full rate of $500 million of annualized production capacity by the end of this year, up from $350 million at the beginning of this year. we expect to further increase production capacity to $625 million by the end of 2022. we are committed to our long-term strategic plan to build the production and r&d center in the lingang region of shanghai. the 1 million square feet of floor space will enable us to increase our annual production capacity to 1.5 billion. the facility will also be used to support advance r&d with a state-of-art [indecipherable].
we recently began initial construction [indecipherable] ground work toward our plan for initial production in the beginning of 2023. before i provide our 2021 outlook, i want to provide an update acm shanghai has star market ipo. yesterday, the shanghai stock exchange announced the pricing of the star market ipo for share of acm operating subsidiary acm shanghai. in ipo, acm shanghai proposed to issue 43.4 million shares, which is a 10% of the total share outstanding following the ipo at there announced pricing of 85 rmb per share. this would represent gross proceeds of 3.685 billion rmb or approximately 575 million us dollars at the current exchange rate. if all goes according to plan, we tended to be [indecipherable] acm shanghai stock to begin trading on november 18, 2021. please keep in mind that the term tiny and successful completion are subject to factors beyond acm shanghai control. we are confident that the star market listing of acm shanghai shares combined with [indecipherable] acm class a [indecipherable] can provide a strong foundation to a supporting our mission to become a major player in the global semiconductor equipment industry.
now let's move to our 2021 outlook on slide eight. our guidance reflects optimism about our growth opportunity for 2021, we have tightened our revenue guidance to the range too highly of 30 million to 240 million. we presenting 50 percent of annual growth at an needle point. our outlook for 2021 is based on several key assumptions. first stability regarding the global covid 19 pandemic. second, the stability in us-china trade situation. third, a range of a spending scenario for their production ramps of key customers, fourth management of acm supply chain and finally, a range of a timing of customer acceptance of our first tools. our results and outlook demonstrate successful execution of our strategic.
we have strong strategy, our strong growth is a supporting additional r&d spending on new products, we are building our global sales and marketing resource to penetrate the new customer in the region and we are carrying production capacity to support our long-term growth plan. we believe we can on track to achieve our mission to become a major equipment supplier to global semiconductor industry. to conclude, i would like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication. i also want to thank our customers, partners and shareholders for their support and the confidence in acm research. i will now turn the call over to mark to discuss financial results in more detail. mark, please.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
thank you, david, and good day everyone. we delivered strong financial results in the third quarter, unless i note, otherwise i will refer to non-gaap financial measures, which exclude stock-based compensation and unrealized gains and trading securities. reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to comparable gaap measures is included in our earnings release. now the third quarter shown on slide nine, revenue was $67.0 million, up 46%. revenue for single wafer cleaning tools, which include saps, tebo, tahoe and semi-critical cleaning was $49.5 million, up 29% from $38.3 million.
revenue for ecp furnace and other technologies, was 8.2 million, up 69.1% from $4.9 million. revenue for advanced packaging excluding ecp services and spares was $9.4 million, up 109.5% from 4.5 million in 2020. total shipments for $99 million versus $59 million in the third quarter of 2020 and 82 million in the second quarter of 2021. this includes deliveries for revenue in the quarter, deliveries of systems awaiting customer acceptance for potential revenue in future quarters and deliveries of evaluation tools. this represents another quarter of record shipments, great accomplishment by our production team given industry wide supply constraints. gross margin is 44.5% versus 42.8%. this was at the upper end of our normal expected range of 40% to 45% due to its favorable product mix. we expect gross margin to continue to vary on a quarterly basis due to a variety of factors including product mix and manufacturing utilization.
operating expenses were $16.7 million versus $10.1 million. the increase in operating expenses reflected higher r&d and new products, our expanded us sales team and other costs. r&d expenses grew by 82.2% to $7.6 million or 11.3% of sales versus 4.2 million or 8.7% of sales last year. the increased r&d intensity reflects acm's commitment to new products and innovation. we expect to increase r&d spending in 2022.
operating income was $13.1 million, up from $10.3 million. operating margin was 19.5% versus 21.6%. unrealized loss on trading securities related to the change in market value for our smic investment was $1 million in the third quarter of 2021 versus an unrealized gain of $9 million in the year ago quarter. note that we exclude this non-cash item from our non-gaap results. we had a tax benefit of $0.3 million versus a tax benefit of $1.7 million in the year ago. net income attributable to acm research was $12.4 million versus $9.0 million in the year ago. net income per diluted share was $0.56 compared to $0.42 in quarter three of 2020. tax items and the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on operating results provided a net benefit of $1.7 million or $0.08 per share in the third quarter of 2021 versus a net benefit of $0.3 million or $0.02 per share in the third quarter of 2020.
i will now review selected balance sheet items. our cash balance was $65 million at the end of the third quarter versus $70.2 million at the end of the second quarter. in addition to the cash balance, we also had trading securities $30.2 million related to our smic investment, this includes a significant unrealized gain from our original purchase price. total inventory was $176.6 million at quarter end, up from $136.9 million at the end of last quarter. the 39.7 million quarter-to-quarter increase was driven by 2 items, first finished goods inventory grew by $17.9 million to 81.9 million, this represents the balance of first tools that have been delivered to customers and evaluation and are carried on our balance sheet at cost, pending a potential transfer of ownership. the second item is work in process and raw materials, which in total grew by 21.8 million from the prior quarter. this was due to purchases to support future shipment growth.
at quarter end, short-term borrowings including the current portion of long-term debt was $17.5 million down from $24 million at the end of the second quarter. now current long-term borrowings were $23.1 million versus $18.7 million to close in the second quarter. cash flow used by operations was approximately $4 million for the third quarter. in 2021, capital expanding as planned at approximately $10 million. this includes $5.5 million already spent through the first 9 months of the year. our 2021 investments will be primarily focused on capacity increase at our chuansha factories investments to support our r&d programs and initial spending on laying down. in some, we are successfully executing on our strategy. we are participating in the growth of major new ic fabs, we are ramping production and we are developing and delivering new products to a growing list of customers. we are positive about our opportunities in china and expansion outside of china. we remain committed to achieving our mission to become a major player in the semiconductor equipment market.
now, let's open the call for any questions that you may have. operator, please go ahead.

operator
thank you so much. ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. as a reminder, if you wish to ask a question please press 1 on your telephone keypad. we will pause for just a moment to compile the q&a roster. your first question from the line of patrick ho from stifel. your line is open.
patrick ho -- stifel -- analyst
hi, thank you very much and congratulation on nice quarter and outlook. actually, mark, maybe to start off first with you the supply chain. based on your results, your outlook and the margin profile, it looks like you guys managed it very well. can you discuss what problems you may have seen and how you mitigated the situation given the results and outlook.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
yeah. hey, patrick, maybe i will let david start on that and then i can add, but yes, dave.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
we saw that there, patrick, the [indecipherable] actually you know the orders the constraints and the semiconductor equipment their spending is double compare to last year. so we see our component also [indecipherable] constrained and i should say some components we buy from us and buy from japan and we also on europe, right, there is a leading time get a longer and longer, i can give you some example some normal products, we have 2 months, now they are getting in four months, even some special products getting in six months. yeah, so for that reason delay where we had over forecast to ourselves and then based on sales forecast, we are buying those long leading item ahead of time and so that's the approach we are taking so far.
obviously now when they are rolling base and forecasts next 12 months and what is the possible delay, what our vendors supply [indecipherable] and actually now we require our vendor give us next 12 months and [indecipherable] can provide to us right, so that the approach we are taking, and hopefully we can have this supply security or we call supply on time to be improved and you can see that the third quarter, we are doing a lot of good work and however as compared with the regular last year, our leading [indecipherable] it will take more time anyway. so that's the status right now and we know our chief supplier start includes hire more people and also increase the manufacturing floor and we're hoping those situation going to improve for the next year. hi, mark anything you want to add on that.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
yeah. no. thanks, david. i mean, the only thing i would add patrick is, it's not new to deal with the supply chain. i mean we've been dealing with the situation you know related to covid and the global supply chain and then of course the big recovery where the industry is building back semi-capacity pretty aggressive but at our size as a company, i think we're demonstrated some scale, it's really important that our customers are confident that we can deliver and so we're sending that message, but i think our manufacturing and supply chain team did a good job in quarter three and we anticipate that as well in quarter four.
patrick ho -- stifel -- analyst
great, thank you. that was really helpful as my follow-up question, maybe for david in terms of the advanced packaging market, are you showing some really nice growth there. the marketplace itself is growing, can you give a little more color on the type of applications you seen today and how it may progress to say next generation techniques like heterogeneous integration, what are you seeing today and what are some of the opportunity, say over the next couple of years.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
okay. patrick, actually i should say we have relayed on very good product portfolio, right, and therefore that advanced packaging tool with where the positive cleaning and coater developer, stripper and also in the most important copper plating tool. right. so we see the people in this growing area is obviously pillar and also we see the people in the [indecipherable] out and also there also people talking about is micro pillar, more than 300 micron of copper play there. so it's really high demand for our copper plating tool and also our copper plating add certain benefit compared to our competitors including i call their edge control and high plating rate with special design of the plating number. so we see there very strong i call driving for our revenue growth or the [indecipherable] growth this year and next year. so i should say we're also see there a customer outside mainland china interest in our plating tool and we're expecting with those tool hopefully next year, we're getting in the taiwan market and that's our planning. so that maybe there in general way of their i call their advanced packaging tool and plus we also increased new customer in china, jcap and tongfu is our traditional top 2 customer. also we are seeing a few other emerging or i call the new start company getting into this application tool. so we have very good a positive or i call the forecast right for the advanced packaging tool growth.
patrick ho -- stifel -- analyst
great, thank you very much and congrats again.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
thanks, patrick.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
thank you.
operator
thank you so much. your next question from charlie chan from morgan stanley, your line is open.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
hi charlie.
charlie chan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey david and mark, and hey [indecipherable]. first of all, congratulations for your great result in china ipo and finally also congrats. my first question is about, it seems like we're in the component shortage, you can do more shipments, right. so i'm not sure this year is still delivering very strong growth. right, the next year, do you think we can even stronger growth rate for 2022, any preliminary outlook.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
okay. yeah, actually, you look at our shipment right in quarter two, almost double. right, i mean 80% and our quarter three shipment also 60% in quarter two. so our total shipment you know compared to last year has been increased a lot right, by the end of this quarter i am giving you more detail how much percentage increase, it is much, much more than previous year. so, we think next year continue we look at strong in our forecast pipeline. so in other words, we have the real increase more of the components and buying from our supplier. so you know the words we are real working closely with our key supplier and as i said, we give them a rolling 12 months their forecast plan and they can tell us what is deliver and what is the capacity they can build costs. so we're working on that and i really hopefully next year get a better, but again we're still very carefully watching the market and also working close to our supply chain, it is ongoing process, [indecipherable] carefully also manage this supply chain.
charlie chan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, thanks and i'm not sure if you talk about these, but previously, you mentioned you have 2 new product lines to launch, right. can you update the status right now.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
you're talking about new product or the existing product.
charlie chan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah, the new product line.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
about the 2 new products. yeah.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
i see, ok, well probably there let's put this way 2 years ago right was starting, announcing 2 new product and unfortunately as you cannot tell you what the product and may however, we believe these 2 products represent the bigger market and so it was a market globally and also, we see the 2 new products and also have our i call [indecipherable] also need that innovation for technology improvement, so now we are working closely with r&d and their team. i think probably one product will come out at first half next year, and also we do have a customer talk together it gathers through as a better side application [indecipherable] and also our second product, we're targeting second half next year. so with our team and looking very dedicate, we're hoping those 2 tool would deliver in the timeline.
charlie chan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, seems on the track and my last question is to mark, again lots of works on china ipo. i am not sure that the pricing, what's the kind of [indecipherable], and what will [indecipherable] into your us listing, [indecipherable].
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
yeah, hey, charlie. so i think we put a lot of the details out on where it was price in the number of shares. right, we have the proceeds $3.685 billion remnant [indecipherable] $575 million us, so we in terms of the valuation, i think you can kind of look at our numbers and work that out and of course, i don't know how that's going to necessarily filter back into our us market cap. but after after the offering, we mentioned that the us, we would own 82.5% of the subsidiary.
charlie chan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. okay, thanks. yeah, i thought that it's a big catalyst give us any kind of an overhand, so hope that your market kept can continue to expand. yeah. that's all from me. thank you.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
thanks, charlie.
operator
thank you so much. next question from quinn bolton from needham and co. your line is open.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
thanks, david and mark, i will offer my congratulations on the star market ipo as well as the international customer retention. i wanted to start with the international customer retention. it sounds like the 3 customers you're working with or that you recently announced are all taking tools for delivery to their china manufacturing facilities and wondering if you could give us your thoughts that as you first penetrate their china manufacturing facilities, what's the opportunity to begin to place deliver tools to international.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
hey, we lost your voice. hi, mark, can you hear quinn.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
david, i heard quinn ok, i can repeat the question. can you hear us. david.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
hi mark.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
yeah.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
are you there?
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
yes, we are.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
hi, mark, i can hear you, or am i coming through.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
yeah, you're coming through. okay quinn. i don't hear david, maybe.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
hi mark, can you hear me.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
david, we can hear you ok. i guess you cannot hear us. yeah. quinn, i can take that question while we wait for david to come back, but i think your question was about the new customer announcements. i think we mentioned that two of those were for delivers to the china fab and other one was in asia [indecipherable] one and so can you maybe just clarify your question.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
yeah, i guess maybe i misunderstood i thought all three were smart tool deliveries taking place in china, and was asking what's the progression, you know that the company's opportunity to first deliver tools to china facilities, but then to expand to other manufacturing facilities at those customers around the world.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
got it. yes, it's a great question for david, but i think you know, we've got a global sales force and so these are the three that we announced here recently, but we still feel pretty positive about our opportunity for customer deployments in outside of mainland china. i think, as david noted, our longer-term goal is to have half of our business outside of mainland china. so we've got activities that we think can can result in that in the coming year. soon.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. just to clarify, did you said it one of the customers was taking delivery outside of china somewhere else in asia well.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
these 3, we talked about a saps evaluation order from a global semi manufacturer with the china development fab, we talked about the two stripper orders right where two global idms china packaging facility and then the ecp evaluation order, we just mentioned it was from asia, a regional semiconductor manufacturer, but we didn't say where that tool was going.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
got it, got it. the second question david talked about the growth in the advanced packaging business. i'm wondering if we might be able to get you to sort of give us your sense how much of the business in 2022 might come from that broader advanced packaging application.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
so, quinn, i guess we gave the mix right for quarter three and year-to-date, it was about 74% on the front-end products and 26% on the. sorry, guys we are having some technical issues. i think the team in shanghai just trying to get back into the call, but yeah, i think for now, quinn, kind of a similar mix. i mean it's hard to say for next year where the growth will come from, will give more details on our quarter four call, but we don't anticipate a significant shift between those two groups got it.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you, mark.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
thanks quinn.
operator
thank you so much. next question from suji desilva from roth capital, your line is open.
suji desilva -- roth capital -- managing director, senior research analyst
hi, mark. i don't know if david back on. but, congrats on the progress here. i wanted to that the tivo product has been out there for a while since the ipo, today you started talking about more in this call is that ramp opportunity now potentially going to inflect what are the kind of the puts and takes of the pace at which tebo can grow versus saps.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
got it. yeah, great and suji, we are trying to get got.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
i got back in now. can you give me a okay.
suji desilva -- roth capital -- managing director, senior research analyst
okay. david, can you hear me.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
that's great. hey, david.
suji desilva -- roth capital -- managing director, senior research analyst
david, it's suji, can you hear me.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
very well. please.
suji desilva -- roth capital -- managing director, senior research analyst
okay, great. i have got david. so, i will repeat the question. so i said this call you guys talked about the tivo product more that you had the ipo, i'm curious, is there an inflection ahead for the tivo product with the opportunity there. what are the factors the puts and takes of that growth versus saps which has done very well for the last few years.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
okay. well, actually the tivo, we made a progress right and also, we realized a tivo, we have to combine with a certain dry technology. so a year ago was rather develop with advance drying technology and [indecipherable] two type, one is hard ipa, a multi [indecipherable] method. next one is the, actually a [indecipherable] the two new joining technology, i think we're one will come out probably quarter one next year and the other one will come out should probably quarter two next year. with this joining technology and together with [indecipherable] we're further give a tivo much wider [indecipherable] why, because all they're like 70 nano dram their capacity structure, you have the dry by co2 because the [indecipherable] fact right. also certain [indecipherable] structure also there [indecipherable] ratio either hot ip driving origin. so with this, adding additional joint technology on tivo product and we will see that there tool get a longer [indecipherable]also their logic manufacturing.
suji desilva -- roth capital -- managing director, senior research analyst
okay, all right, thanks david and quinn just ask the question, i want to maybe rephrase and ask it make sure we get your answer.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
sure.
suji desilva -- roth capital -- managing director, senior research analyst
the new customers seem to be shipping primarily into china and the region, with one maybe in asia, and we're excited about the global customers you talk about 50% of business coming from outside of china longer term, can you talk about what it would take for these customers to start putting your tools in outside of china and why maybe the dominant initial push is in the china facility just understand that dynamic.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
yeah. actually, obviously the tool we ship into the china facility or china fab right there fab, is good starting point. this way, our process data, process capability validate by their fab in china. right [indecipherable] potential a quarter getting their fab also, i mean in china, right and so that's we're looking for. so i think it's really good assigned and also a good starting point and those data come out there i think in china may need a driving force and [indecipherable].
suji desilva -- roth capital -- managing director, senior research analyst
okay, that's very helpful color. david, thank you. congrats again.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
thank you.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
thanks suji.
operator
thank you so much. once again in order to ask a question, please press 1 in telephone keypad. next question from mark miller from benchmark. your line is open.
mark miller -- benchmark company -- analyst
thank you for the question and congratulations on the quarter. we're seeing margins jump around a lot and i believe that's through the mix and i'm just, you said the mix looks like it's going to be 75 and 25 front and back-end. i'm just wondering for the next quarter or is it a similar mix to the third quarter.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
yeah, david, do you want to answer that. should i can take that too.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
i think you can [indecipherable] right. this is normally gross margin is a flat rate, we [indecipherable] 40% to 45% and there is a higher margin tool and [indecipherable] that for a moment to give a high margin and certain i got a copper plating and also give margin for front-end and then there is also no margin tool right and as i older bench as certain i call there ([indecipherable] the process tool advanced packaging side too. so it's good, i mean this is a good combination and also depend on combination, there a margin we may be change in right [indecipherable] i couldn't give you precise number, but i think we'll be in a range 40% to 45%.
mark miller -- benchmark company -- analyst
okay. for the next quarter, does it look like a similar mix to the third quarter.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
yeah.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
i said you know, i cannot give you precise numbers. [indecipherable] combination by customer and this year, [indecipherable] 40% to 45% maybe [indecipherable]
mark miller -- benchmark company -- analyst
you're breaking up at least on my side. just wondering if you've been primarily more dram, nand as supposed to come on stronger next year, do you see opportunities, more opportunities for yourself in nand.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
[indecipherable].
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
hey hey, david. you're breaking up a lot. maybe i'll take the question, mark since david's breaking up. yeah. so, mark, just to be clear, if you look at our customers in china, they are very reflected. our nand business as you know ymtc is our big nand customer right, so they were in the 30% range last year and so i think kind of your premise, we have a pretty good mix in nand and then of course sk hynix, cxmt or dram customer. so we continue to expect to get good content in both in 3d nand and with our dram customers.
mark miller -- benchmark company -- analyst
thank you.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
yeah, you got it.
operator
thank you so much. next question from emma tian from [indecipherable]. your line is open.
emma -- analyst
hey guys, congrats first of all on the really straight quarter three. this is emma from [indecipherable] my questions are probably more for david as well, but mark you're welcome to share your thoughts [indecipherable] david back on line, probably not yet.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
yeah, yeah. can you hear me ok.
emma -- analyst
oh that is great, hey, i can hear you (foreign speech). thanks. so my first question is we related to quinn's question as well. i just wanted to ask a bit more details about your future plans, probably in the long-term about expanding the global markets, since we know that the three factories of acmr are all based in mainland china. they actually quite they are all near shanghai, if i remember correctly, is there a particular reason for that. like, do you have any plans to build any other factories say in beijing or even outside of mainland china or outside of asia area.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
okay. let me give you little [indecipherable] star market and it's ultimately our [indecipherable] market ipo most strong financial foundation and [indecipherable].
emma -- analyst
sorry, david, you're still breaking up quite a lot or is it just me, i am not sure.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
can hear now better.
emma -- analyst
yeah, this is much better.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
okay. i said there, we already have our manufacture in their korea. all right. so from now when we probably are [indecipherable] major customer in china and actually beijing and also wuhan and potentially [indecipherable] right. those r&d is more than they were helping closing support customer, but more than that is also we consider other region and also country and as a our business moving out of china is a goal, taiwan and go to us and even though in europe and we do have a plan view the r&d support center and we believe the r&d closings for the customer will give you faster choice or faster supporting capability. meanwhile also we consider if we found good [indecipherable] tenant people for the company, we can [indecipherable] company in the local region that's a further enhance our r&d power in local.
so our goal is really getting into their diversifying and global r&d in our road-map and also as i mentioned in our [indecipherable] we said that we are going to have eventually 50% still right from outside mainland china and you 50% from the inside and that's our long-term strategy right and also with our our division technology, i think what would be much strong driving force, our tool to be sold in global like we mentioned tivo or tahoe and also wet development, new technology also on the role as our innovation product come out be validate in the local market in china and then we can start that push those verify the product into their global market and meanwhile we see also some fab in china altogether [indecipherable] a process going on. so, we have also our tool can be evaluate in most advanced technology nodes, in our sense we got a better of their technology being verify here, they will help us getting into the market outside china.
emma -- analyst
thank you, david. that's all from, do you mind sharing a bit of a timeline for the factories outside of china or is it just it's more of a long-term plan and it depends on how the r&d activities and other opportunities go.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
yeah, actually it really depends on how we penetrate
operator
the customer and also how we see their opportunity in other m&a or potential i call there group come out and [indecipherable] dynamic and as i said we're building korean [indecipherable] centre few years ago and we're definitely have that in our plan and also according to our success, our penetration with their local customer, i will say china than will speed up those [indecipherable] up, right all found some good people and good product. while we may be just group of people there, too, that also can further enhance our sales and supporting capability for that a local region great.
emma -- analyst
that's awesome. all the best for that.
david h. wang -- ceo and president
mark, anything you want to add on that.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
yeah, nothing to add. i think we are kind of at the end of our call here. so i think we need to wrap up. operator, if you can please wrap up the call thanks.

david h. wang -- ceo and president
thanks, gary. good day and welcome to this call. we had an excellent third quarter with strong financial results. we deliver record revenue and shipments with a solid profitability. third quarter results demonstrate the strength of our expanding customer base, our differentiated multi-product solution, strong product cycle for both front-end and back-end, and our growing production scale. revenue growth to 67 million of 41% year-over-year. shipments were 99 million, upper 68% from $59 million in the same period last year. we maintain a good balance of growth and profitability with a 44.5% gross margin and 19.5% operating margin. we are focused on profitable growth as we invest in r&d to drive innovation, broaden our product portfolio and introduce new products.
on the bottom line, we report to this extent of net income value [indecipherable] this year compared to 42% in the same quarter last year. we ended the quarter with 65 million of cash, in addition, we add 30 million in the quarter and holding of smic stock market shares. i will now discuss recent operational highlights on slide three. first, our quarter three revenue growth was the broader base, driving both current and the new products, all wet cleaning and other front-end process tool growth 29% and represent a 70% of the total sales in quarter three. the growth or trailing by our flagship [indecipherable] good contribution from tivo canadian tool and all semi-critical cleaning tools.
advanced packaging other process tools services and spare parts grew by 8% to 26% of a sale. the strong growth of this group was driven by ap tools, including ecp ap wet etcher, stripper and scrubbers together with the increase in our service and spare parts business. second, we received good orders from 3 new major customers. several weeks ago, we announced evaluation orders from 2 potential new customer, the first order is the 4 saps canadian tool from a major global semiconductor manufacturer and is scheduled to be in-store in the china-based development fab in the first quarter of next year. the second order is for ultra ecp map copper plating tool from major asia based semiconductor manufacturer also for deliver early next year. yesterday, we announced order from leading global integrated device manufacturer or idm orders of 2 ultra-c pr wet stripping system to be used in thier china-based advanced packaging facility. we already deliver their first order in october and plan a second half delivery in delivery in quarter one of 2022. acm offers a full product line of wlp wet process tools ranging from colder [indecipherable] wet etcher, cleaning and pr strippers, to advanced copper plating tools. our wlp wet process tool have gained wider acceptance with a number of china-based manufacturers, this order acm first wlp tool win the major global player. acm progress is the three new major player is a testament to our technology leadership. regional support teams and the production scale, we are confident that successful qualification of this tool can result in larger business opportunities. we continue to build our sales tidy pipeline with a top tier player. i want to thank our sales and technical support teams for their outstanding execution. china is among the largest and the fastest growing market.
for semiconductors over the year, acm has become a significant supplier of semiconductor equipment in china with our major [indecipherable] from, and the customer. we believe acm differentiate technology and a multi-product offering provide us opportunity to capture significant market share on a global basis. longer term, we are targeting half of our sales from countries and regions outside of mainland china. third, all ecp product ramps is gathering momentum. we deliver the multiple ecp tool in the first half 2021, even more in quarter three. as noted in last quarter's call, we expect that ecp momentum to continue with the delivery of 20 ecp tools for the full year 2021.
we expect the ecp product line to drive meaningful growth in 2022. we see good opportunity for ecp in both front-end and back-end or packaging applications. from a smaller geometry require advanced plating solutions, our ecp portfolio includes the ecp map for [indecipherable] copper interconnection and ecp [indecipherable]. meanwhile, back-end and advanced packaging has become more important as industrial moves via moist law. manufacturers are looking for packaging innovation to drive higher performance, acm ecp ap for advanced packaging address is a back-end opportunity. we estimate that the total global market for ecp front-end and back-end application will triple from 500 million last year to up to 1.5 billion in the coming years.
fourth, we are seeing strong interest for our outdoor event furnace dry process tool portfolio. so far in 2021, we delivered several [indecipherable] frost tools and evaluation tools, including top and the non-top [indecipherable]. we expect to deliver additional units by year-end. more recently in october, shipped furnace product with higher temperature oxidation and a [indecipherable] capability. building on this strong effusion, the next major development in our furnace road-map, is a batch atomic layer deposition or ald process. we view this as a most challenging and promising product for advanced manufacturing nodes for both memory and analogy. we expect furnace product cycle to ramp in 2022.
based on 2022 market data, we estimate our current products sale of 5 billion total global market opportunity. we are committed to our goal to double our addressable market to 10 billion in the next several years. on that note, we are making steady progress with our r&d investment in 2 additional major new product categories. this is our long-term commitment to major adjustment market, in which our customer are pushing us to invest in product road-map, their support, their advanced nodes. we have accelerated our hiring to supporting this program. we are confident that we can deliver the first tool in each category in the second half of 2022 respectively. we have a deep r&d program, intended to address the next 2 product generations by entering this category as it is a leading edge nodes. we are in a strong strategic position to leverage our local relationships with some of their most advanced semiconductor fabs in the world where we can test [indecipherable] and develop our most advanced technology. this will help driving in most of our product line to the leading edge and competing on a global basis.
next, i would like to recap acm customer base on slide five. all this group includes our five major from end customer that represent the foundry 3d-nand and dram manufacturers. for 2021, we expect a good growth from huahong group and ymtc, which we expect to remain as our top 2 customers. however each may represent a lower percentage of total revenue as we anticipate meaningful growth from other customers. for 2021, we also expect a good contribution from our other three major front-end customer [indecipherable] likely to be over 10% contributors. this including as smic which contributed to our third quarter results as earlier anticipated, sk hynix and cxmt.
our second group including a number of new china-based semiconductor customers who manufacture power analog cmos, image sensor compound semiconductors and other devices. this customer including 4 of 5 tier 2 player and handful of new tier 3 and others, which each is relatively small, this grew up a new customer combined with the contribute 10% or more to our 2021 revenue. as the newer customer are investing in new capacity to support the growth of 5g, iot, ev and ai and other emerging technologies. acm has good presence at customers supplying a broader range of tool including saps semi critical cleaning ecp and furnace products. our third group is advanced packaging and the wafer manufacturing customer, top customer here have including jcap, tongfu, nepes and wafer works. we have had a good order momentum in this group this year, including orders from 2 new advanced packaging house in quarter one and yesterday announcement from the china-based packaging facility, a major global ibm.
we expect additional orders from more potential customer in this group by year-end. collectively, we expect tremendous growth from this group. this should be driving buyer increased industrial focus on advanced packaging and wafer manufacturing. penetration of new customer and a strong product cycle for acm ecp ap floors. looking ahead we believe opportunity for acm, most of the customers are still in early or middle stage of our multi-year capacity expansion. we are committed to further broaden our customer base as we believe every major semiconductor manufacturer can benefit from our technologies. move on, i would now like to discuss quarter three shipments and provider update on our manufacturing facility.
please turn to slide six, we delivered record and total shipments of a 99 million in the third quarter shipments. shipments were 32 million higher in revenue, the difference being first tools and the evaluation tools, net of a customer acceptance for previous deliver first tools. this is a positive indicator as it reflects demand for new product and from new customer. to achieve this level of shipments, we must thank the production team [indecipherable] our facility, we're ramping production capacity to meet the strong customer demand in a constraint supply chain environment.
started production in the second building of our chuansha factory in quarter three as planned. we are on track with our capacity road-map, which targets a full rate of $500 million of annualized production capacity by the end of this year, up from $350 million at the beginning of this year. we expect to further increase production capacity to $625 million by the end of 2022. we are committed to our long-term strategic plan to build the production and r&d center in the lingang region of shanghai. the 1 million square feet of floor space will enable us to increase our annual production capacity to 1.5 billion. the facility will also be used to support advance r&d with a state-of-art [indecipherable].
we recently began initial construction [indecipherable] ground work toward our plan for initial production in the beginning of 2023. before i provide our 2021 outlook, i want to provide an update acm shanghai has star market ipo. yesterday, the shanghai stock exchange announced the pricing of the star market ipo for share of acm operating subsidiary acm shanghai. in ipo, acm shanghai proposed to issue 43.4 million shares, which is a 10% of the total share outstanding following the ipo at there announced pricing of 85 rmb per share. this would represent gross proceeds of 3.685 billion rmb or approximately 575 million us dollars at the current exchange rate. if all goes according to plan, we tended to be [indecipherable] acm shanghai stock to begin trading on november 18, 2021. please keep in mind that the term tiny and successful completion are subject to factors beyond acm shanghai control. we are confident that the star market listing of acm shanghai shares combined with [indecipherable] acm class a [indecipherable] can provide a strong foundation to a supporting our mission to become a major player in the global semiconductor equipment industry.
now let's move to our 2021 outlook on slide eight. our guidance reflects optimism about our growth opportunity for 2021, we have tightened our revenue guidance to the range too highly of 30 million to 240 million. we presenting 50 percent of annual growth at an needle point. our outlook for 2021 is based on several key assumptions. first stability regarding the global covid 19 pandemic. second, the stability in us-china trade situation. third, a range of a spending scenario for their production ramps of key customers, fourth management of acm supply chain and finally, a range of a timing of customer acceptance of our first tools. our results and outlook demonstrate successful execution of our strategic.
we have strong strategy, our strong growth is a supporting additional r&d spending on new products, we are building our global sales and marketing resource to penetrate the new customer in the region and we are carrying production capacity to support our long-term growth plan. we believe we can on track to achieve our mission to become a major equipment supplier to global semiconductor industry. to conclude, i would like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication. i also want to thank our customers, partners and shareholders for their support and the confidence in acm research. i will now turn the call over to mark to discuss financial results in more detail. mark, please.
mark mckechnie -- cfo and treasurer
thank you, david, and good day everyone. we delivered strong financial results in the third quarter, unless i note, otherwise i will refer to non-gaap financial measures, which exclude stock-based compensation and unrealized gains and trading securities. reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to comparable gaap measures is included in our earnings release. now the third quarter shown on slide nine, revenue was $67.0 million, up 46%. revenue for single wafer cleaning tools, which include saps, tebo, tahoe and semi-critical cleaning was $49.5 million, up 29% from $38.3 million.
revenue for ecp furnace and other technologies, was 8.2 million, up 69.1% from $4.9 million. revenue for advanced packaging excluding ecp services and spares was $9.4 million, up 109.5% from 4.5 million in 2020. total shipments for $99 million versus $59 million in the third quarter of 2020 and 82 million in the second quarter of 2021. this includes deliveries for revenue in the quarter, deliveries of systems awaiting customer acceptance for potential revenue in future quarters and deliveries of evaluation tools. this represents another quarter of record shipments, great accomplishment by our production team given industry wide supply constraints. gross margin is 44.5% versus 42.8%. this was at the upper end of our normal expected range of 40% to 45% due to its favorable product mix. we expect gross margin to continue to vary on a quarterly basis due to a variety of factors including product mix and manufacturing utilization.
operating expenses were $16.7 million versus $10.1 million. the increase in operating expenses reflected higher r&d and new products, our expanded us sales team and other costs. r&d expenses grew by 82.2% to $7.6 million or 11.3% of sales versus 4.2 million or 8.7% of sales last year. the increased r&d intensity reflects acm's commitment to new products and innovation. we expect to increase r&d spending in 2022.
operating income was $13.1 million, up from $10.3 million. operating margin was 19.5% versus 21.6%. unrealized loss on trading securities related to the change in market value for our smic investment was $1 million in the third quarter of 2021 versus an unrealized gain of $9 million in the year ago quarter. note that we exclude this non-cash item from our non-gaap results. we had a tax benefit of $0.3 million versus a tax benefit of $1.7 million in the year ago. net income attributable to acm research was $12.4 million versus $9.0 million in the year ago. net income per diluted share was $0.56 compared to $0.42 in quarter three of 2020. tax items and the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on operating results provided a net benefit of $1.7 million or $0.08 per share in the third quarter of 2021 versus a net benefit of $0.3 million or $0.02 per share in the third quarter of 2020.
i will now review selected balance sheet items. our cash balance was $65 million at the end of the third quarter versus $70.2 million at the end of the second quarter. in addition to the cash balance, we also had trading securities $30.2 million related to our smic investment, this includes a significant unrealized gain from our original purchase price. total inventory was $176.6 million at quarter end, up from $136.9 million at the end of last quarter. the 39.7 million quarter-to-quarter increase was driven by 2 items, first finished goods inventory grew by $17.9 million to 81.9 million, this represents the balance of first tools that have been delivered to customers and evaluation and are carried on our balance sheet at cost, pending a potential transfer of ownership. the second item is work in process and raw materials, which in total grew by 21.8 million from the prior quarter. this was due to purchases to support future shipment growth.
at quarter end, short-term borrowings including the current portion of long-term debt was $17.5 million down from $24 million at the end of the second quarter. now current long-term borrowings were $23.1 million versus $18.7 million to close in the second quarter. cash flow used by operations was approximately $4 million for the third quarter. in 2021, capital expanding as planned at approximately $10 million. this includes $5.5 million already spent through the first 9 months of the year. our 2021 investments will be primarily focused on capacity increase at our chuansha factories investments to support our r&d programs and initial spending on laying down. in some, we are successfully executing on our strategy. we are participating in the growth of major new ic fabs, we are ramping production and we are developing and delivering new products to a growing list of customers. we are positive about our opportunities in china and expansion outside of china. we remain committed to achieving our mission to become a major player in the semiconductor equipment market.
now, let's open the call for any questions that you may have. operator, please go ahead.
