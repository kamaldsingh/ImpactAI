i would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today, jeff lawrence, chief financial officer. please go ahead, sir.
jeffrey d. lawrence -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, sonia, and hello, everyone. this is jeff lawrence, chief financial officer of domino's pizza. thank you for joining the call today about the results of our first quarter of 2020. given the unique circumstances created by the covid-19 crisis throughout the world, in addition to discussing our first quarter results, we are also going to share with you some preliminary estimated results of the first few weeks of the second quarter.
as you know, this call is primarily for our investor audience, so i kindly ask that all members of the media and others be in a listen-only mode throughout the call. if forward-looking statements are made today, i refer you to the safe harbor statement, you can find in this morning's release and the 10 q.
we will start with comments from chief executive officer, rich allison, followed by an update from me. then we'll go back to rich for closing remarks before taking analyst questions. we ask that our analysts limit themselves to one question during this call.
with that, i'd like to turn the call over to rich.
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
thanks, jeff. and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. given the extraordinary circumstances, we are going to take a different approach to the call this morning. i'm going to speak first to share some perspective on the business and how we're responding to the covid-19 crisis both here in the us and around the world. i'll then talk about some of the investments that we're making in our team members and in the communities that we serve. i'll then hand it over to jeff who will walk you through the details around our q1 performance, and jeff will also share some preliminary estimated results from the first few weeks of our second quarter.
i'll then come back to discuss some of the things that we're focused on as we look forward to the remainder of 2020. and then following that, as we always do, we'll be happy to take some of your questions. so with that as a roadmap for our call this morning, let's get started. and i'll begin with some perspectives on the business and how we're responding to this covid-19 crisis.
on the 30th of march, we released a preliminary first quarter business update. we pride ourselves on being transparent with our stakeholders and we hope that information was helpful to you. so i won't spend much time on q1 in my comments this morning as i've already shared some of my perspective on the quarter in that release.
the reality is that the world is changing very rapidly, and we are much more focused on the present and on how we're going to continue to navigate this crisis going forward. the restaurant industry is facing an existential crisis, and no one knows how many restaurants will survive or what form the industry will take as this crisis eventually abates. we also don't know how consumer behaviors and purchasing patterns may evolve during and then after this covid-19 crisis.
we were fortunate to enter the year and this crisis in what we believe to be a very strong financial position, both at the brand and at the franchisee levels. our us franchisees averaged an estimated $143,000 in ebitda per store and over $1 million in average ebitda at the enterprise level in 2019. both of those figures are increases over the 2018 levels. now we know that profit levels vary significantly across the country based on wage levels and a number of other factors, but we're pleased that our franchisees remained healthy and strong throughout 2019.
looking forward here into 2020, we know our business, along with our franchisees and stores, will face new costs as we respond to covid-19 with new service methods and a number of investments in items such as masks, gloves and thermometers both for corporate and franchisee team members. we are well-positioned as a brand with a delivery and carryout business model, and this has allowed us to continue serving our customers and employing our team members in the sizable majority of our markets and our stores around the world.
as we manage through this challenge across the globe, i'm very proud as our ceo to say that we are leading with our values. our first two values at domino's are: number one, do the right thing; and second, put our people first. and for us, that means prioritizing the health and well-being of store team members, franchisees and the communities that we serve.
during this extraordinary time, we take our responsibility for continuing to provide convenient, reliable, delivery and carryout experiences to the communities where those services have been deemed essential. we take it very seriously. fewer than 20 stores in our us business are currently facing temporary closures. all others remain open and are serving customers.
now with that said, our us business model has adapted to this new environment, and our standard operating procedures have changed considerably over the last two months. i say to folks here inside domino's, we're a 60-year-old brand that has rewritten most of our standard operating procedures in the last six weeks. we've moved to a 100% contactless delivery model across the country. we have made our contactless drive-up carryout technology available to all us stores. we have temporarily banned customers from sitting and eating in our stores. we're asking our customers to practice social distancing when they visit us to pick-up their carryout orders. we have implemented social distancing protocols in our store and supply chain for our team members there. and in addition to thermometers, we are supplying them with masks and gloves to protect our teams and our customers.
at domino's, food safety and cleanliness have always been top priorities, but recently we've devoted additional resources toward our efforts and our procedures there. i'm incredibly proud of our us franchisees. they continue to embrace change at an unprecedented rate. but i'm also not surprised to see that they have elevated their commitment to safely serving their team members and their communities. it is at times like these when our us franchisees truly shine brightest.
all of our us supply chain centers also remain open and are fully operational. through the remarkable efforts of our supply chain team, we successfully opened our newest supply chain center in columbia, south carolina on march 29th. we're working very closely with our suppliers to maintain a safe and stable flow of product into our stores. i'm so proud of our supply chain team. they've done just a tremendous job of continuing our core operations, while also responding to this crisis in new ways. they put significant effort into sourcing masks, gloves, thermometers, contactless delivery supplies and cleaning supplies at a time when these items are under just incredible demand pressures.
in an effort to provide ongoing transparency to you in the midst of this crisis, this morning, we released our preliminary estimated us sales results for the first four weeks of the second quarter. sales have improved relative to the last two periods of the first quarter, as detailed in our march 30th business update. and jeff is going to share more details around this later this morning in our call.
we continue to observe and analyze the rapidly changing trends in consumer purchasing behavior. across delivery and carryout service methods, day parts, days of the week, the us will continue to be impacted by many factors such as shelter-in-place orders, business and school closings and event cancellations, which vary in magnitude across the cities and towns in the us that we serve.
across our international business, the unique circumstances in a number of markets have necessitated the temporary closing of stores. and in some cases, entire markets have temporarily closed for varying periods of time. we continue to stay in contact with the master franchisees operating these affected markets and stores. some have already reopened, and we look forward to them reopening the remainder of their stores as soon as possible. at our peak, we had almost 2,400 international stores closed and, as of april 21st, that number was approximately 1,750.
this morning, we also released our preliminary estimated international sales results for the first three weeks of the second quarter. the sales impact stemming from covid-19 varies quite dramatically across our international markets. some markets where we have significant service method and operating our restrictions, we've seen major declines in same-store sales. in other markets, we've seen strong recovery and steady gains in same-store sales over the recent weeks. china was our first market to be significantly impacted by covid-19 and we are pleased to see our sales there recover and accelerate in the last few weeks of the first quarter and to remain strong early in q2.
i'm very proud of our international master franchisees and their resiliency as they manage through this crisis in their markets around the world. i'm also grateful for the best practice sharing and rapid adoption of new ideas across the globe. and much of what we're doing today right here in the us has been informed and inspired by our international markets that found themselves on the forefront on the front end of this crisis.
i'm going to turn our attention now to some of the investments that we're making in our teams and in our communities. throughout this uncertain time, we are committed to supporting our teams and the communities we serve. in our corporate stores and supply chain centers, we are investing heavily in our teams during this crisis. we have committed to pay additional bonuses to our corporate store and supply chain hourly team members over a 10-week period from mid-march through at least the last pay period in may. we're also providing enhanced sick pay benefits to our hourly corporate store and supply chain team members through at least the remainder of the year. at domino's, we don't want anyone to have to choose between their health and their paycheck.
now most of you probably are not familiar with the domino's pizza partners foundation. it's a registered 501c3 that was established to help domino's team members in need during a time of crisis. its mission is summed up in the phrase, team members helping team members. and its primary source of funding is through payroll deduction from corporate and franchisee employees. i'm very proud to say that our company is making a significant donation to the partners foundation to help team members at this particular time of need across the globe. we're grateful as a brand that we're in a position to be able to make these investments, and we are very proud of our independent franchise business owners, many of whom are making similar investments in their team members.
our supply chain centers, corporate stores and franchisees are also hiring and have been looking to add more than 10,000 employees across the us. with so many americans newly unemployed, we feel privileged to be in a position to offer employment and a career opportunity within the domino's pizza system. we're also committed to supporting the communities around the us where we live and work. we recently launched our feed the need program. this is in partnership with our franchisees to provide 10 million slices of pizza across the us. we're making a significant investment as a brand by supplying the food for this program, while our franchisees and corporate stores are being generous and providing the labor.
we've empowered our franchisees and stores across the country to identify the need specific in their communities. in some places, it's school children who are no longer receiving free or reduced lunch, in others its hospital workers and first responders, in some places, it's essential workers in grocery and retail and many other areas. this isn't new because domino's has always given back in times of crisis. this isn't an exception.
while these are some highlights from the us, i would be remiss this morning if i didn't also thank our international master franchisees, many of whom are doing similar things in their markets. from the uk to india to australia and really all over the world, the domino's system is stepping up to support our communities. as a system, we are happy to make these investments in both our teams and our communities, and we'll continue to search for ways to invest and to feed the need during this crisis. these investments are expected to be material during the second quarter. jeff will comment on the financial impact of these investments in just a moment, and we will provide more detail to you during our next earnings cycle in july.
so, with that, i'm going to hand it over to jeff, who will walk you through the highlights of the first quarter and some preliminary estimated results from the first two weeks of -- few weeks, excuse me, of q2. and then after that, i'll come back and share a few more thoughts with you before we move to q&a. so, jeff, over to you.
jeffrey d. lawrence -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, rich, and good morning again everyone. i'll cover off the first quarter financial results as well to provide a brief preliminary financial update for the business for the first few weeks of the second quarter.
starting with the first quarter results, we continue to lead the broader restaurant industry with 36 straight quarters of positive us comparable sales and 105 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. we also continue to increase our global store count as we opened 178 gross new stores and 69 net new stores in q1. this net store growth number includes the closure of the 71 stores comprising our south africa market during the quarter that was unrelated to the covid-19 pandemic.
our diluted eps in q1 was $3.07, an increase of 39.5% over the prior year quarter, primarily resulting from a significantly lower effective tax rate and strong operational results. with that, let's take a closer look at the financial results for q1.
global retail sales grew 4.4% as compared to the prior year quarter, pressured by a stronger dollar. when excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 5.9%. this global retail sales growth was driven by both an increase in the average number of stores opened during the quarter and higher same-store sales. same-store sales for the us grew 1.6%, lapping a prior year increase of 3.9%. and same-store sales for our international business grew 1.5%, rolling over a prior year increase of 1.8%. breaking down the us comp, our franchise business was up 1.5%, while our company-owned stores were up 3.9%.
the us comp this quarter was driven by ticket growth. we continued to see robust growth in our carryout business, while our delivery comp for q1 was slightly negative, consistent with previously discussed market dynamics. our international comp for the quarter was driven entirely by order growth. we estimate that the international comp for the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately 1 point to 1.5 points by the covid-19 pandemic.
on the unit count front, we opened 30 net us stores in the first quarter, consisting of 35 store openings and just five closures. our international division added 39 net new stores during q1, comprised of 143 store openings and 104 closures, including the closure of the 71 stores comprising our south africa market.
turning to revenues. total revenues for the first quarter were up 4.4% from the prior year, driven primarily by higher global retail sales, which drove higher supply chain and global franchise revenues. these increases were partially offset by lower company-owned store revenues resulting from the new york store sale in q2 of 2019. international royalty revenues were pressured by $1.4 million during the quarter by foreign currency exchange rates.
moving now to operating margin. as a percentage of revenues, consolidated operating margin for the quarter increased to 39% from 38.6% in the prior year quarter and was positively impacted by the new york store sale and higher revenues from our global franchise business. supply chain and company-owned store operating margin percentages were relatively similar year-over-year.
g&a expenses decreased approximately $1 million as compared to the prior year quarter. we continue to see the benefit of improved discipline and focus in this important area, while continuing to invest in strategic initiatives throughout our business. our reported effective tax rate was negative 3.7% for the quarter, down 18.8 percentage points from the prior year quarter. the reported effective tax rate in the quarter included a 26-percentage-point positive impact from tax benefits on equity-based compensation. we do expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to these tax benefits. when you add it all up, our first quarter net income was up $29 million or 31.2% over the prior year quarter.
our first quarter diluted eps was $3.07 versus $2.20 in the prior year, which was a 39.5% increase. here is how that $0.87 increase breaks down for the quarter. our lower effective tax rate, resulting primarily from higher tax benefits on equity-based compensation, positively impacted us by $0.58. lower diluted share count, resulting primarily from share repurchases over the past 12 months, benefited us by $0.14. higher net interest expense, resulting primarily from higher average debt balances, negatively impacted us by $0.08. and most importantly, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.23.
now turning to cash. during the first quarter, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of more than $95 million. after deducting for capex, we generated free cash flow of almost $78 million, which was pressured by normal balance sheet movement. during the first quarter, we repurchased and retired approximately 271,000 shares for $80 million or about $294 per share on average. it's important to note that these repurchases were made during the first week of the first quarter. all in all, a good quarter for the business in q1.
as we now move away from our q1 financial discussions, i'd like to remind folks that we did issue a business update on march 30th, which contained preliminary estimates of selected q1 information, including comps, store growth and global retail sales information. we also informed the market that due to the uncertainty surrounding the global economy and our business operations considering covid-19, we withdrew our 2020 guidance measures related to g&a, capex, store food basket pricing and the impact of foreign currency and royalty revenues. we also announced that as a precautionary measure, we borrowed the remaining funds available to us under our outstanding variable funding notes to further strengthen our already strong financial position.
i'd like to now switch gears and give a financial update on the business for the first few weeks of the second quarter for which we have available results. this information contains preliminary unaudited estimates and is being provided to assist our stakeholders with a high-level understanding of how the business is performing during these extraordinary times.
in the us business, comps were up 7.1% during the first four weeks of q2. us retail sales were up 10.7% over the same time period. sales trended up significantly over this four-week period. as it relate to us customer behavior during this crisis, this is what we are generally seeing thus far. delivery and carryout mix are holding relatively steady on average. weekday sales have been significantly up, while weekends have generally been more pressured. lunch and dinner dayparts are up, while late night had been more pressured, and we are seeing larger order sizes throughout the week. again, these are initial observations regarding consumer behavior, and we may experience volatility in our sales going forward as a result of this dynamic environment.
in our international business, comps were down 3.2% during the first three weeks of q2. important to note here that we are only reporting three weeks of international sales information due to the normal reporting lag in that business. to be very clear, the international same-store sales comp for the last two weeks of q1 and the first three weeks of q2 was negatively impacted by covid-19.
the negative impact primarily occurred from stores that had sales in a week but were limited due to a service restriction, carryout and/or delivery and, in some markets, even dine-in restrictions, a part of the weak temporary closure and/or a change in-store hours. if a store was closed the entire week and had zero sales for that week, however, it is not included in same-store sales definition or results.
moving on to retail sales for international, retail sales, excluding fx, were down 13.2% over the same time period, reflecting the many stores internationally that have been temporarily closed or have some other operating restriction impacting sales.
turning now to our franchise partners. we have not provided widespread economic relief to our franchisees globally. while we acknowledge that this could change depending on the time period that this crisis persists and its overall impact on our results, we attribute our current situation to the underlying strength of our business model and the overall economics that our franchise partners have earned alongside of us over the past many years. the strength and resiliency of the domino's brand has never been more evident.
as rich discussed earlier, we are making significant investments in our team members and our communities during this time of crisis, including frontline bonuses, enhanced sick pay policies, community giving and partnership with our franchisees and investments in supplies such as face coverings and gloves. we anticipate pressure on our q2 earnings related to these investments of approximately $15 million. based on trends we've seen to-date, we also anticipate pressure on our q2 earnings of an additional approximately $5 million related to lost revenues from our international franchise stores due to those temporary store closures. these are current estimates and they're preliminary and could very likely change.
we would also be remiss if we didn't comment on what we're seeing in the fx markets. if fx rates hold for the remainder of the year, we believe it could be a substantial headwind to 2020 cash flows and earnings of approximately $10 million. this current estimate is preliminary and could very likely change as foreign currency rates continue to fluctuate.
shifting now to cash and liquidity matters. we currently have more than $325 million in available cash, and we note that our ongoing operations have provided positive net cash flow to the business during this crisis so far. out of an abundance of caution, we have not repaid amounts on our variable funding notes and that cash is included in the available cash balance i just mentioned.
we continue to invest in our strategic initiatives, and we paid our shareholders our previously declared dividend on march 30th. additionally, earlier this week, our board of directors declared a $0.78 per share dividend to be paid on june 30th. separately, we have not repurchased any shares under our authorized share repurchase program since the first week of january. as a reminder, we currently have $327 million remaining under our board authorization for future repurchases.
in closing, we remain in good shape financially, and we will continue to closely monitor all aspects of our business as we operate in these uncertain times. we will continue to focus on doing the right thing for our team members and our communities today, while ensuring that we not only survive but are best positioned to thrive coming out of this crisis tomorrow.
thank you again for joining the call today, and i'll turn it back over to rich.
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
thank you, jeff. i would now like to turn everyone's attention to our focus looking forward. across the globe, domino's will remain steadfastly focused on the health and safety of our franchisees, team members and our customers. that is always priority one. we'll also remain focused on execution, service and value as we continue to navigate through these headwinds created by covid-19.
2020 will continue to bring more uncertainty to the restaurant industry than any of us have ever experienced. and we do not have clear visibility into the duration and magnitude of the impact of this pandemic on our industry or our business, and continue to assess each on an ongoing basis. we do expect that the sales impact will continue to vary greatly across the cities and communities in the us and in our 90 markets around the world.
given general economic conditions along with uncertain timing of the infection curve, the shelter-in-place orders, business interruptions, school and university closings and so many other factors make forecasting sales more difficult than ever. we do expect to see a significant impact on our store openings this year as construction and municipal permitting have slowed down dramatically during the crisis. we should have better visibility around unit growth in the months ahead.
so given all of this, as noted in this morning's release, we are withdrawing our two to three-year outlook for global retail sales growth, us same-store sales growth, international same-store sales growth and global net unit growth. i want to be clear, do not mistake that as a lack of optimism about the domino's brand and our business looking forward. i remain very optimistic about the long-term growth and success of our brand. there is just too much uncertainty in the current operating and economic environment for us to provide an outlook at this time.
in this uncertain environment, you can rest assured that we are carefully managing our balance sheet, cash flow and all areas of the business to ensure that we are doing what we believe will help us best manage through the near-term and as always position ourselves for long-term success. we are committed as a brand and as a system to managing through covid-19 and to emerging even stronger in the future.
i have extraordinary confidence in our franchisees and in our teams around the world. there is simply no group of people that i would rather stand beside than the approximately 350,000 individuals that wear the domino's logo. i am proud and i am grateful to serve them each and every day.
and now, jeff and i will be happy to take some of your questions.
",":
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from brian bittner of oppenheimer & company. your line is now open.
brian bittner -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for the question, guys. i know that there's a lot of moving pieces when we look at short windows on your comps, but your trends to start 2q have clearly seen this measurable improvement versus 1q. and i appreciate the color that you gave, jeff, in your prepared remarks on what you're seeing from a daypart perspective, etc. but can you unpack this recent improvement, just a little more for us. what do you think has clearly changed recently that's driving the positive impact on your business? i know the underlying restaurant industry has gotten a little better in the last several weeks, but i just wouldn't expect that to be a huge factor for you guys. so any additional color, like maybe stimulus impacts or anything else that you can provide on recent trends would be helpful.
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
hey, brian, it's rich. thanks for the question. yeah, i think there are several things that we're seeing in recent weeks. and again, it is a very dynamic situation that we're all living in. but certainly, i think, some of the improvement results from the fact that there was a lot of pantry loading that consumers did as the pandemic really first started to come to the us. and i think as we've seen in some of our asian markets in particular, that we're more on the front end of this. as time goes forward, people start to get a bit tired of cooking and eating the same thing. some of the pantry loading that they've done, it starts to bleed down a bit over time.
i also think, we and i suspect the rest of the industry, probably are seeing some near-term impacts here from some of the stimulus dollars that have gone out. so there are some factors that i would characterize as being more outside of our control. but then i think that there -- i think there are some things that are inside of our control. and if you've taken a look at what we've done as a brand over the course of the last three or four weeks, we have pivoted very quickly to implement contactless delivery and carryout procedures across our system to protect our team members and also to give our customers confidence in the experience that they will have with us.
we've pivoted our advertising quite significantly to focus on those important queues, which are very important to customers right now to have a safe and pleasurable food experience for their families. so, brian, i think a combination of some factors outside of our control, but i think also some things that we're doing here at domino's as well.
brian bittner -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
thank you, rich.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from matt difrisco of guggenheim. your line is now open.
matt difrisco -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
thank you. jeff, can you speak a little bit about those charges, i guess, or the $15 million and the $5 million. i just want to understand how you're coming about with those. the math would suggest about 1,700 stores or so is closer to 15%, but you're lower than 10% on that sales hit. so, is it correct to assume that you're expecting these to continue to open and not be closed for the full quarter in that estimation? and then also the $15 million, i guess, can you just sort of bracket that -- i want to better understand that in the new normal that these costs wouldn't necessarily be an ongoing quarterly charge that is mostly front-line stuff and the bonuses, not necessarily new investments that are required in what maybe investors might perceive as a new normal?
jeffrey d. lawrence -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, matt. i hope you're well and appreciate the question. the first thing, i would just caution everyone on is, we don't know what the new normal is going to be. the information that we've shared with you today is, it's preliminary, it's estimated. and it's the best that we can give you right now, but we wanted to give you our best shot at what we're seeing kind of live.
so, i'll break it down in kind of the three big buckets that i talked about during my prepared remarks. the biggest bucket that we expect, again, we don't know yet, we're only four weeks into a 12-week quarter here, so a lot still to happen in an uncertain environment, is the $15 million related to doing the right thing for the safety and well-being of our team members, our customers and our communities. this is the 10 million slices of pizza, this is masks and gloves, this is bonus pay for our front-line team members in our stores and in our supply chain centers, and it's just stuff that we're proud to be able to do, and it's going to have a pretty significant impact. and we're ok with that. it's the right thing to do.
i then, kind of get in to the next bucket, which is the international business has been clearly impacted more on the whole than our singular market of the us business, right? it's an average. there are 90 markets there. there are lots of different things going on. but as we look at the first four weeks in the quarter, quarter two and known that we have, again, eight weeks to go, our best guess is that we're going to take a haircut of about $5 million in royalties. it could be higher, it could be lower, it's preliminary, but it's super dynamic, and that's what we're seeing today.
the last thing, we could argue it's covid-related or maybe indirectly covid-related, but it's just the impact of fx. and that one, i gave you, at least a preliminary view for the whole year. $10 million kind of year-over-year of a bad guy there. again, preliminary estimated, don't know if that's going to be the number. but when you add all three of those up, it's -- as we look today, it's a $30 million headwind. some of it was in our control, and we're proud to do. some of it kind of happening to us. so, that's the best we can give you right now. we'll continue to assess whether we give any additional business updates between now and july. we're not promising anything today. but for sure, you'll hear more detail from us in july. and by then, i'll tell you, and rich will tell you exactly what happened for the four, 12 weeks of q2
matt difrisco -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
excellent. thank you so much. glad you're all well.
jeffrey d. lawrence -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you. thanks for the question.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from chris o'cull of stifel. your line is now open.
chris o'cull -- stifel -- analyst
yeah. thanks. good morning, guys. rich, does the company still plan to launch a new product in 2020? and if so, has the timing changed at all?
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
hey, chris. thanks for the question. yes, we are still planning to launch a new product in 2020 and still anticipating to do that in the summertime. obviously, managing through a different operating environment today as we work to make that happen, but we are still targeting summer for that launch.
chris o'cull -- stifel -- analyst
great. thanks.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from sara senatore, bernstein. your line is now open.
sara senatore -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
hi. thank you. i wanted to follow-up on the business patterns you were seeing in the stronger weekday versus weekend. i guess, my interpretation is that, you're benefiting on the weekdays from people being at home more, but maybe weekends, perhaps lower incomes or something about of headwind to spend. so i was just hoping you could help me contextualize this, whether if you're seeing anything across different income, cohorts or maybe talk about in the past, the resilience of your category to when incomes slow. it's a little tricky because i know you're in the midst of a turnaround back in '09. but i'm just trying to understand to parse out what role is sort of lower income playing versus more of the sort of stay-at-home shelter-in-place? thanks.
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
hey, sara; it's rich. thanks for the question. yeah, we are still assessing this literally day-by-day as these patterns continue to evolve quite rapidly. jeff highlighted some of them, higher sales growth during the weak than on the weekends. and i think a lot of that is driven by the fact that there are more families at home during the week eating together. and then on -- by daypart, our late night business is down significantly, while lunch and dinner are much better.
there just aren't evening gatherings of people or sporting events to watch and things like that. so certainly those are having some impact. we haven't seen any discernible patterns across income categories, as you asked, but interestingly enough, order sizes are up significantly. and i think that's because more people are at home eating together. but also, we're finding, at domino's, and i think some of our peers in the restaurant industry are finding, people are ordering extra food to have leftovers around also, which is a really interesting dynamic in the market today. but it's really early, sara. and one of the things about this covid-19 phenomenon is, at least for a period of time, it's -- i think it's upending a lot of the patterns that we have historically seen in our business and broadly across the restaurant industry. so, we are watching it every day, every minute of every day and responding and adapting as we go.
sara senatore -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from alex slagle of jefferies. your line is now open.
alex slagle -- jefferies -- analyst
hey. thanks for the question. i want to get your perspective on the operations and the restaurants and discuss any potential issues with delays in delivery times or longer carryout turnaround times and inventory management, stuff like that, that as demand has likely been a bit less predictable and more volatile?
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
sure. i'm really proud, alex, of our corporate stores and our franchisees, who i think have just done a tremendous job with their operations and responding to this crisis. as i mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks, we've taken 60 years worth of standard operating procedures, and we've had to rewrite a good many of them in just the last six weeks around contactless delivery and carryout, no sitting down and dining in our stores.
our drive-up carryout feature, which we've now been rolling out aggressively across the country and our franchisees and corporate stores have responded and done a terrific job. even despite the more recent increases in sales, they've done a very good job of continuing to provide high levels of safe and responsive service out there to our customers.

thank you. and our next question comes from nick setyan of wedbush securities. your line is now open.
nick setyan -- wedbush securities -- analyst
thank you. you guys talked about obviously the near-term impact on unit openings. but could you maybe comment on the pipeline? and medium to longer term, what some of the chaos across the industry means for the domestic unit growth rates, where you're starting to hear much more favorable terms, better site selection? and could that potentially mean a higher unit growth rate, especially domestically in the medium to longer term for you guys?
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
yeah. nick, so on unit growth here in the us, near-term, it really is all about just a slowdown in construction and permitting in terms of the near-term slowdown in the openings. no fundamental changes as we look out over the medium to long-term in terms of the appetite of franchisees to open stores in the us. stores over the medium and long-term are going to open based on strong unit level economics as they always have.
certainly we are taking a look, as we look out through the remainder of the year and into next and trying to assess what incremental opportunities might be available because of some of the changing dynamics in the real estate market and whether or not that means some sites are -- may become available that weren't before or also some opportunities potentially around how we think about lease extensions and rent opportunities going forward. it has been a pretty tight real estate market for a while now, and we don't know exactly how much that's going to open up. but our guess is that it probably does open up a bit as we look out in the medium to long-term.

thank you. and our next question comes from peter saleh of btig. your line is now open.
peter saleh -- btig -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. i just want to ask about the pizza, i guess, landscape right now as you guys see it. i know 50% or so of the category is still run by many of the independents. while you guys are the leaders you've been taking share, i'm sure seeing it anecdotally, at least that you guys are seeing any closures in some of the markets or some pressure on the independent and do you feel like you're taking share or do you feel like the pizza category, in general, is fairly healthy at this point and that the sales lift that you're seeing is kind of being reflected across the entire category?
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
yeah, pete, it is still really early to tell, because we don't know -- when we take a look across the restaurant landscape, there are a lot of restaurants out there that are not open right now. and we don't know how many of those honestly are temporary and how many of those will turn into permanent closures. i tell you, i did a lot of independent restaurants out there. so i think the last thing any of us in the industry want to see is a lot of independent restaurant closures.
we do here at domino's, we do believe that we're a pretty resilient brand in a time like this. i think the positioning that we have as delivery and carryout player has certainly helped us in the early part of this crisis. and i think will continue to help us because i don't think consumers are going to snap right back to the old patterns and behaviors. i think the capability that we're building in contactless delivery and contactless carryout, i think are going to continue to be important for many months to come when we think about how this ultimately evolves. so, as we think about the capabilities that we're putting in place today, it's not just to be competitive in the next couple of months. it really is to set ourselves up in what may end up being the new normal in our industry.

thank you. and our next question comes from lauren silberman of credit suisse. your line is now open.
lauren silberman -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thanks for the questions. to your point that you just made, do you expect contactless delivery will be something that will be available permanently? and then, contactless delivery changed the economics of the delivery transaction or productivity and turnaround times at all? thank you.
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
so, lauren, right now, contactless delivery is the only type of delivery that we do in the us. we've actually made it mandatory across the country. and i do think that even at a point, if we pull back on that and no longer mandate it, we are still going to offer it to the customer because i think for some extended period of time, there is going to be some portion of the customer base that is going to want that contactless experience in delivery and/or in the carryout side of the business.
as it relates to the economics around contactless, we have -- we've just rolled out an innovation we call the pizza pedestal, which is a pretty simple cardboard pedestal so that our delivery experts don't put your pizza directly on the ground or on some other surface that we don't know if it's been cleaned or not. so, there are some minor costs associated with things like that.
in addition to the actual physical operation of contactless, i'm also incredibly proud of our technology and innovation teams who have rapidly moved to bring that contactless experience to the customers' handheld device or however they choose to order from us. and that includes some rapid innovation also to make tipping of our delivery experts easier and more prominent in the ordering experience because the last thing that we want to see come out of this is any of our delivery experts to see a decline in income as customers move away from cash transactions and more toward digital either credit or debit card transactions.

thank you. and our next question comes from gregory francfort of bank of america. your line is now open.
gregory francfort -- bank of america -- analyst
hey, rich. thanks for the question. just, first of all, clarification, did you say china is running positively in recent weeks? i wasn't clear with, i guess, that description. and then, in the us, what -- are you seeing any differences regionally or urban versus suburban that are standing out in terms of how customers are using the brand or sales trends? thanks.
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
sure, greg. so, on china, we did see a pattern early on in the pandemic where china sales were pressured, but we have seen positive sales in china and improvements in the latter part of the first quarter and in -- here into the early weeks of the second quarter. i got to tell you, i am incredibly proud of our team in china. much of what we are doing across our 17,000 store footprint was based on innovations around contactless delivery that our team in china brought forward. so, really, really proud of not only their business performance but also how they've contributed to our system.
and then, in terms of regional differences, the answer is, yes, we've seen all kinds of differences. and it really is based on how this pandemic has moved across the country with the pace of that movement and the severity of its impact in different places. if you turn the news on, we all see that there are certain places that have been significant hotspots for covid-19. we've seen some places peak and start to level out, while others ramp up. and most certainly, those have impacted some of the trends in our business performance in those geographies.
and it's still, as we sit here on the 23rd of april, it's still an evolving situation in many of the communities that we serve. there is also some very significant differences, as i'm sure you all are aware, just in terms of how states and local municipalities have responded to the crisis and what restrictions they have put in place in terms of what business can be conducted and what consumers -- customers can do in terms of travel and other things in those states.

thank you. and our next question comes from david tarantino of baird. your line is now open.
david tarantino -- robert w. baird -- analyst
hi. good morning. i hope everyone is doing well. my question, rich, is on the international business, really kind of two parts to it. first is related to how they're managing through or the ones that are seeing large or widespread closures, how they're managing through this from a financial perspective, and do you see any signs of strength or stress in the system-related to that?
and then, secondly, and relatedly is just the outlook for unit growth internationally, with all the stress that appears to be occurring in the system, do you think we will see a moderation for time being as they work through those?
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
yeah, david, on the first part of your question. i think going into this, we're really fortunate to be in a place where we've got a significant amount of our international business that is managed by publicly traded master franchisees who came into this crisis with very strong financial positions. so, relative to perhaps some other brands, strong ability to weather a crisis like this.
now that said, most certainly, when -- in a country when you have to close all of your stores or close some substantial number or even some places, as jeff described, our stores are open but with very limited trading hours or very limited service methods. those do result in significant declines in retail sales for a period of time. our master franchisees are doing all the things that you would expect them to do. they're prioritizing, first and foremost, the safety of their team members and their customers, but they're also taking the appropriate steps to manage cash appropriately and to manage -- make sure that they're being mindful of the liquidity in their operations. they're also working really hard to get those stores reopened.
and we've already seen a couple of large international markets, spain and france would be two, where we were completely closed for a period of time but have begun to reopen stores in each of those countries. we're staying very actively in touch with those international master franchisees and talking with them daily about their financial position. and we'll continue to do so as we work together through the course of this crisis.
the second part of your question around unit growth, most certainly in the near-term, we will see an impact on unit growth. much as i described in the us, where there are construction delays and there are permitting delays, the same holds true in many of the international markets. and then certainly, in some of those markets that have been under more pressure where we've had a significant number of store closures or the entire market shuttered, certainly that results in a near-term slowdown in store growth there.
but over the long-term, i come back to what i always talk about with you is that the unit economics will ultimately drive the store growth over time. and as we come out of this covid-19 crisis, which i believe we will do with a very healthy brand around the world, my expectation is that we still have a significant opportunity to grow our brand footprint across the globe. as you know, we've got a lot of share growth opportunity outside the us, and we've got well capitalized and well-managed master franchisees who are going to be eager to get back after that as this subsides.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from james rutherford of stephens & company. your line is open.
james rutherford -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
yeah. thanks for taking the question. just one for me. i'm curious, jeff, if you can share how much of the us sales mix prior to covid-19 was related to large group orders for parties, events, meetings and the like? and i ask that because i assume those occasions have gone down dramatically, which makes the improvement in your other kinds of orders more impressive to drive that 7% comp here in the first four weeks of the second quarter?
jeffrey d. lawrence -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, james. thanks for the question. we're trying to be as transparent as we can and have given you guys a peek into the consumer behavior at least during the first four weeks of q2 here. but the insights aren't any more fancy than kind of we laid it out already. you can imagine that people that used to get around television to watch your favorite sporting event, those orders aren't there.
if you are ordering and you're sheltered in home with your family, those orders are larger because you might be looking for some leftovers for the next couple of days. if you had an occasion that you'd buy pizza for the folks that you work with in an office building, those occasions are gone. so it really is no more complicated than that. although i will still tell you, it is early in this crisis. we just don't know how that consumer behavior will ebb and flow as we continue through this and get out of this. but what i can tell you, as rich just alluded to, is we believe that the global pizza industry is super resilient. people are going to want eat pizza, before, during and after this crisis, and there's no one better positioned with our franchise partners around the world to hopefully fill that demand than we do.
so, we'll be there for all the occasions. we'll continue to morph our standard operating procedures, as rich talked about, to make sure that we give the consumers what they want now and in the future. again, being vertically integrated in tech, having real innovative business partners around the world, give us a huge advantage versus a lot of the other competitors in the industry. so, we feel like if anybody can get it done, we can get it done, and we're going to continue to put our customers first, our team members safe in all that we do.

and our next question comes from john glass of morgan stanley. your line is now open.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks very much. how many of the customer visits you're seeing recently are coming from new customers or lapsed users? and what are you doing to maybe capitalize on that opportunity to get new customers? are you incenting them to sign up in the loyalty program in a different way and maybe any metrics around that loyalty growth during this period of time would be helpful? thanks.
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
sure, john. we absolutely are seeing an uptick in new customers. and i'll talk about it on a couple of dimensions. i am sure that we are seeing some folks trying us for the first time or trying us again, just given the availability of restaurants and food types out there, we're getting a shot with some customers that maybe weren't doing business with us before.
also what we're seeing is, we are getting new digital customers as well. the digital percentage of our business has ticked up pretty significantly in the last several weeks. i think i reported to you, for the fourth quarter, we touched 70% digital. in recent weeks, we're running 75%, and we've had at least one week where we were over 80% digital. so that's also another benefit we're seeing as the customers are coming to that digital channel as we go into this contactless space that we're in.
and we are absolutely actively working to -- for that -- we got the first order from that customer to get the second digital order and for those customers that are ordering digitally, actively working to migrate them to our piece of the pie rewards and loyalty platform as well. so it's still early, john, but certainly we're seeing some opportunities with customers that we didn't have in the previous couple of months leading up to covid-19.

thank you. and our next question comes from chris carril of rbc capital markets. your line is now open.
chris carril -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the question. i wanted to ask about aggregators and specifically any updated thoughts on how the current environment will shift the competitive dynamics and delivery. so with the rising demand for off-premise here, is there any more opportunity for domino's to highlight its value positioning, especially in a more pressured macro environment?
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
sure, chris. well, one thing i can tell you is, in the current environment we're operating in, i am so glad that we are not on these aggregator platforms as domino's. when i think about what matters to our customers, the trust in knowing how that food, where it was prepared and who delivered it to them, it certainly comforts me to know that it is our uniformed and trained domino's delivery experts that are bringing the food to the door in a time like this.
i'm also very glad that we're -- that we've made the decision over time to continue to own that customer relationship on the front end, particularly now that we're talking about 70 -- run rate of 75% plus digital, we think even more than ever that it is critical for us to continue to own that digital relationship with the customer as well. that said, certainly in the current environment with virtually all restaurants close to dine-in, there are lots and lots of customers that are trying delivery for the first time and many of them through the aggregators.
so, this is going to be a very dynamic environment as we look over the months ahead. and ultimately, to all learn, what ultimately sticks, in terms of these changes in customer behavior, because my guess is, customers don't immediately go back to what they were doing before. in that environment, we're staying focused on the things that we know are so important to the business for the long-term on value, staying very focused on value, staying committed to our delivery and our carryout value offers. we're also remaining very focused on service.
one of the things that is happening right now across the domino's us business is the very aggressive hiring of additional delivery experts. the labor market has been incredibly tight for a couple of years. as that has loosened up, in recent weeks, we've -- just since announcing our effort to hire 10,000 team members in the us, our corporate store business has hired 2,500 people in that limited period of time. and that is really a key element of how we continue to provide great service to our customers during this time.
and then, staying out on the forefront of safety, through all of these contactless methods, through the enhanced cleaning of our stores, we've changed from operational audits to safety awareness visits during this time. so we believe all of those actions will continue to position us well as we move forward through this crisis and into the time period beyond.

thank you. and our next question comes from katherine fogertey of goldman sachs. your line is now open.
katherine fogertey -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thank you. thanks for the question. i was wondering if you could comment, you mentioned a little bit about the 10,000 delivery expert hiring. if you could give a number of how many the whole system has hired, and if you've seen any change in turnover either positive or negative at the stores, given the current environment. and on that point, wanted to get your thoughts on how you view your benefit package and the fact that you employ your drivers as competitive advantage vis-a-vis the aggregators? thank you.
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
sure, katie. so, on the 10,000 folks that we're trying to hire across the system, we don't have perfect visibility into our franchisee hiring, because that really is their job as their team members to hire and to train. but what i can tell you from the conversations that we have is that the applicant volume has increased significantly. since we began that effort and unfortunately we just saw another 4.5 million filed for unemployment this morning. unfortunately, there are a lot of people out there that are out of work right now. and i am certain that that is contributing to the increased applicant flow. that's coming in, into our stores.
as i think about what our value proposition is, relative to someone working in the gig economy. i think now, in an environment where so many people are losing their jobs, having a set schedule and having a job, getting a w2 from domino's or from one of domino's franchisees i think is probably valued, probably more than it has been in quite a long-time.
we've tried to make a very strong commitment to our corporate store, team members that's drivers and everybody in the store with enhanced bonuses over a 10-week period as folks work through this crisis we've been have enhanced our sick pay benefits during that time as well. so we are also looking for opportunities here in the near-term, but then also over the long-term, to continue to make that a very attractive employment opportunity.
and then finally, we talked about it so many times, well over 90% of our us franchisees started off as delivery drivers or folks working inside the stores. and that's a career opportunity that is out there that just isn't available in the gig economy.
katherine fogertey -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you. and just my question around turnover, are you seeing turnover go up, be flat or go down in the stores. maybe if you can just comment on the company's stores here.
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
yeah. katie, we haven't seen any major shifts in turnover. it's still a really short period of time that we've been in this crisis. so we'll probably know more in the months ahead, as things continued on unfold there.

alton stump -- longbow research -- analyst
thank you. most of the questions have been asked. but just sort of just a follow-up on last couple of answers, rich. is there an opportunity on labor cost front for savings here, given the fact that they're obviously to your point, an awful lot of people especially international industry that are looking for work currently, an opportunity potentially for you guys and or your franchisees to bring the average cost down a little bit on the labor front?
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
hey alton, it's rich. we're going to ask you to -- your line was breaking up a little bit, if you could just slow down just a little bit and repeat that question, we just want to make sure -- i think jeff and i heard about 60% of it.
alton stump -- longbow research -- analyst
okay. sorry about that. i was just asking, if there is an opportunity on your labor cost front to save money given the fact that there obviously are a lot of people to your point, especially in the restaurant industry that are looking for work currently?
jeffrey d. lawrence -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, alton. thanks for repeating that. i want to be very, very clear. we want to be very clear that this crisis is not a time to lower the rates that we pay our valuable team members. and we don't think that way our franchisees don't think that way. if anything we want to employ more people and, as rich mentioned, we're paying them bonuses, we're paying them more, so i'm a finance guy. i always think about efficiencies and things like that, but right now, quite frankly, it's not about that.
for us it's about continuing to run as an essential service, taking very seriously, hiring more people, paying them more actually right now, giving people more jobs. that's really what we're focused on. we're proud of the small role that we're playing in keeping people employed and fat, and we're leaving for another day to get efficient on any kind of labor rate stuff.

john powers -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. hopefully you can hear me ok. just, just a couple quick ones for me. ad budgets are down across the restaurant space as a whole, but also all the advertising dollars seem to be pivoting toward this off premise or delivery channel. so, can you talk about how you're managing through communicating to consumers that you're valued there, that -- and frankly breaking through to consumers in this time when everybody seems to be focused on this one channel?
and then, just pivoting to the unit -- us unit growth, i'm curious if you could talk about you mentioned the health of the franchise community is very strong coming into this crisis. and we're taking a pause right now, but is there any reason to believe that you can't ramp growth faster on the back end, particularly if rents are going to be lower and/or you see some independent store closures at the end of this whole crisis? thank you.
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
hey. thanks, john. on your first question around the advertising spend out there in the market, we look at a couple of things around that as we think about it. one is, we view it absolutely as a time to continue to lean in hard on getting our voice out there. so we're not pulling back one bit on advertising during this. and frankly, one of the things as you look broadly across, not just restaurants, but across all of the folks out there that spend a lot of money on advertising, there has been a heavy demand out there for a lot of the same customers that we want to reach. and therefore, grp delivery has been a little spotty out there in the marketplace over the course of the last couple of years. and we expect that we may see some benefit in that and just getting the full delivery of the grps that we want to buy anyway.
and then, as it relates to share of voice within the category, most certainly, all of the spend out there as a wallet some of its come down overall, it really is focused on the on the delivery channel. we've just got to continue to invest against it. we've got to continue to talk about value, to talk about service, to talk about safely serving our customers. and i am really proud of our advertising team. i mean, they have pivoted so quickly. and if you look back over the last six weeks or so, they've produced about an ad a week, and normally we go through a much more prolonged cycle to produce advertising, so we're trying to stay very nimble and we just got a terrific team that is -- that's making that happen for us.
and then, your second part of your question was around us unit growth. we're certainly assessing what the back-end of the crisis opportunity might be. ultimately as i talked about all the time the unit growth is going to be driven by the cash-on-cash returns at the unit level and how our franchisees view the economics. i can tell you that for our corporate store business, i would love to accelerate and go even faster. and if there are opportunities to do that, we are most certainly going to.

thank you. and our next question comes from john ivankoe of jpmorgan. your line is now open.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi. great. can you hear me?
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
we can, john.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan -- analyst
all right. excellent. thank you for that. okay. first, a clarification and then a follow-up on the theme we've been talking about. first, you've mentioned the increased transaction size in number of different times. i mean can you comment on same store transactions and delivery same store transactions and carry out. i mean it does sound like we got some outside ticket gauge just wants to see what was happening in terms of transaction count.
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
yeah, john. so, again, very early, very dynamic. but as we look at period for the increase that we reported, the 7.1 for the entire us system, that's more ticket, certainly than it was orders. but the important thing to remember here in this new environment is that the ticket part of the overall comp includes way more food now in the same order, so when you think about an order used to be an order, well now an order is kind of more than an order because people are looking to put some stuff in their ziploc bag. so, again, it's early, we're giving you as much as we can trying to be as transparent as we can. but it's -- larger orders is what we're seeing so far. we're happy to get that to you in a safe contactless way.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan -- analyst
yeah, definitely, and it would make sense to amortize some delivery fees as well. so that would make sense from many different perspectives. and then secondly, we have, i guess, an economic situation that many of us would have never anticipated where a number of people will make more money on unemployment for four months, being at home than they would actually working in a lot of different cases. so i wanted to ask this from two perspectives. one, if you are seeing kind of a pickup from a consumer perspective and maybe that's the type of consumer that would be benefiting economically from a weekly basis of basically not working versus working.
and then secondly, if there is a way to comment on it appropriately, has that influenced or do you think it might influence on the margin your ability to attract employees that what you might offer them might not be equivalent to their state plus federal unemployment benefits.
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
hey, john. it's rich. on the first part of the question, really too early and would be hard to tell. i suspect that the stimulus that was just released out there is probably having more impact than the unemployment benefits thus far that you just described in terms of money going into consumers pockets, which they could choose to spend with us or with others.
and then, the second part of your question around, does it make it harder to hire folks. we tried to lean into that a bit. as we mentioned a couple of times earlier for 10 weeks in our corporate stores and in our supply chain business, we've got bonuses for our hourly team members and also for our store managers as well. we've done that first and foremost to say thank you to them for continuing to serve our customers in what is a relatively crazy time. but also we recognize that we've got to continue to earn their loyalty, to work for us, as there are other alternatives potentially out there as you described.
so, haven't seen any pullback there. and as i mentioned earlier, we've actually seen a very significant increase in applicant flow, because even with those near-term unemployment benefits, i think a lot of folks are looking beyond that, and into august and september the months beyond the expiration of those benefits. i think want to make sure that they've got a job when they get to that point in time.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan -- analyst
it definitely makes sense. and rich, maybe as a couple quarters go maybe the second quarter of '19, we talked about delivery service times and just overall delivery metrics. i think you touched on it a number of different times again this call, but on an apples-to-apples basis, where are we in terms of delivery metrics at this point in time, down time the household order accuracy, just let's say things are not necessarily health and safety related, but just the kind of the old fashioned core of the way you guys used to measure yourself?
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
sure. sure. so, john, as i've mentioned before, we didn't get a lot better from '17 to '19 on delivery times, but started to see some improvement there, particularly i'm really proud of our corporate store business where we've seen a good bit of improvement with a lot of focus around delivery times. and look, we've got some franchisees out there that are averaging every week under 20 minutes delivery time. so there are a lot of really strong proof points out there across our system.
the data, like the data in every other aspect of our business can be pretty choppy here with -- in this covid-19 time, and a lot of that gets driven by the fact that we see these shifts across days and across dayparts. and we and a lot of our franchisees are still working really hard to figure out those new patterns and make sure we've got delivery driver schedules, balanced appropriately against them.
so, what i can tell you is the system is very focused on service. we were making some improvements there, and we are bringing safety to the forefront, does not mean that we're not also focused on their service times, because we do know that's going to be a critical way that we'll continue to grow our business and compete against the aggregators.

jeffrey bernstein -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you very much. rich talked about in your prepared remarks the independence and the existential crisis the industry is facing, and obviously the impact of the future. so, it seems like you would have good insights into more of the independent side of things in each of your franchisees in many ways as more of a mom and pop. but you're consequently solidly positive. i'm just wondering how you think about the independent's survival with costs down significantly, whether it's within pizza or just thinking more broadly as a restaurant ceo, the ability for them to keep their doors open for an extended period and kind of survival, whether that would help the industry supply demand and balance that people have been talking about for years, any thoughts on kind of the broader industry and the independent's ability to survive would be great?
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
yeah, jeff, i'll stay fairly brief on that. restaurant business is a tough business. and there are a lot of restaurants out there that were struggling even before this crisis got here, as labor rates have increased significantly across the country. and so, i think there's a lot of pain in the industry right now as folks -- a number of independents came into it, not particularly strong going in, but now being faced with this existential crisis.
so, certainly, as someone who has been in the restaurant industry for a long time and someone who loves to eat out, i sure hope independents survive. because i think all of us want to be able to go to an independent restaurant, want to be able to go to a domino's pizza, we want to be able to go to an independent restaurant as well.

with that, i'd like to turn the call over to our chief financial officer, stu levy.
stu levy -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, chris. and good morning everyone. we're excited to discuss our fourth quarter and annual results with you today. overall, we had a very strong q4 and full year 2020, despite the ongoing global challenges presented by covid-19.
before we jump into the numbers, i would first like to remind everyone once again that our fourth quarter included an extra week this year, which also included new year's eve and new year's day, both of which are typically major sales days. we have an extra week in our fiscal year every five or six years depending on how the calendar falls. typically, our fiscal year consists of three 12-week quarters and a 16-week fourth quarter. but in 2020, our fourth quarter consisted of 17 weeks. in the earnings release we filed this morning, the impact of this additional week has been adjusted out of our 2020 results as an item affecting comparability. the next time this will happen is in 2026.
turning to our results. overall, our team members and franchisees around the world generated strong operating results, leading to a diluted eps of $3.85 for q4 and $12.39 for the full year. our diluted eps, as adjusted for the extra week in our fiscal year, was $3.46 for q4 and $12.01 for the full year.
here's some additional detail on the components of our earnings. in q4, global retail sales grew 21.7% as compared to q4 2019. as a reminder, global retail sales growth includes both comp growth and unit growth, which i'll break down for you in a moment. our global retail sales in q4 were benefited by the extra week and also by a weaker dollar. when excluding the extra weak and the positive impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 12%.
for the full year, our global retail sales grew 12.5%. when excluding the extra weak and the negative impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 10.4%. breaking down our global retail sales growth, our us retail sales grew 22.8% during q4 and 17.6% for the full year. when excluding the extra week, us retail sales grew 14.3% in q4 and 15% for the full year.
our international retail sales grew 20.7% during q4 and 7.5% for the full year. when excluding the extra week and the impact of foreign currency, international retail sales grew 9.9% for q4 and 5.9% for the full year. during q4, we continued to see positive momentum in our international business, including a reduction in temporary store closures and other operating restrictions, which contributed to sequentially stronger same-store sales performance and an increase in net units, which i'll discuss in more detail momentarily.
turning to comps. during q4, we continued to lead the broader restaurant industry with 39 straight quarters of positive us comparable sales and 108 consecutive quarters or 27 years of positive international comps, both truly remarkable achievements.
same-store sales in the us grew 11.2% in the quarter, lapping a prior year increase of 3.4%. and same-store sales for our international business grew 7.3%, rolling over a prior year increase of 1.7%. as a reminder, our same-store sales growth is not affected by the extra week.
breaking down the us comp, our franchise business increased 11.4% in the quarter, while our company-owned stores were up 8.1%. the us comp this quarter was driven by a healthy mix of both ticket and order growth. within that mix, our ticket growth was driven by an increase in items per order and a higher delivery mix, which often comes with an associated transparent delivery fee. the 7.3% international comp was driven by ticket growth. similar to in our us business, that ticket growth was driven by both a higher item count and a higher delivery mix.
shifting to unit count. we and our franchisees added 116 net stores in the us during the fourth quarter, consisting of 118 store openings and two closures. for the full year, we and our franchisees opened 229 net us stores. our international business added 272 net stores during q4, comprised of 328 store openings and 56 closures. for the full year, we added 395 net international stores.
in total, we and our franchisees opened 624 stores globally in 2020. we're very pleased with our ability to continue to grow units during the pandemic and particularly encouraged by our strong growth in q4. however, we do still face some challenges opening stores in certain markets, including delays in construction and permitting, which we will continue to monitor moving forward.
regarding revenues and operating margins. total revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion and we're up $206 million or 17.9% from the prior year quarter. total revenues for the year were $4.1 billion and we're up $499 million or 13.8% from prior year. the extra week increased revenues by an estimated $88 million. the remaining increase was driven by higher global retail sales, which in turn drove higher revenues across all areas of our business. changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted our international royalty revenues by $0.4 million in q4 as compared to q4 2019 and negatively impacted our royalty revenues by $3.9 million for the full year as compared to 2019.
our consolidated operating margin as a percent of revenues increased to 39.5% from 38.9% in q4 2019, due primarily to higher revenues from our us franchise business, partially offset by investments made related to the covid-19 pandemic.
company-owned store margin as a percent of revenue decreased to 21.9% from 24.4% in q4 2019 and was negatively impacted by higher covid-related labor costs. as we announced in december of 2020, we paid a special bonus to our front-line workers to thank them for their contributions throughout the pandemic. supply chain operating margin as a percent of revenue increased to 11.6% from 11.1% in q4 2019, driven by operating efficiencies and reduced fuel expenses.
g&a expenses increased approximately $19 million in q4 2020 as compared to q4 2019. for the full year, our g&a was $407 million, an increase of approximately $24 million as compared to prior year. we estimate that $6 million of these expenses were incurred as a result of the extra week this year. the remaining increase primarily related to higher variable performance-based compensation expense and professional fees and was partially offset by lower travel expenses.
net interest expense increased approximately $8 million in the quarter as compared to q4 2019. we estimate that $3 million of this increase was driven by the extra week this year. the remaining increase was driven by a higher weighted average debt balance resulting from our 2019 recapitalization transaction and was partially offset by a lower weighted average borrowing rate. our weighted average borrowing rate decreased to 3.9% from 4% in q4 2019, due to the lower interest rates on the debt outstanding in q4 2020 as compared to q4 2019.
our reported effective tax rate was 19.9% for the quarter as compared to 17.8% in q4 2019. the reported effective tax rate in q4 2020 included a 1.8 percentage point positive impact from tax benefits on equity-based compensation as compared to a 3.9 percentage point positive impact in q4 2019. we expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to these equity-based compensation tax benefits.
when you combine all of these elements, our fourth quarter net income was up $22.6 million or 17.5% over q4 2019. for the full year, our net income was up $90.6 million or 22.6% over 2019. we estimate that the 53rd week positively impacted net income by $15 million in the fourth quarter and for the full year due to the additional week of sales and the associated operating leverage, which is included as an item affecting comparability in our earnings release.
our diluted eps in q4 was $3.85 versus $3.12 in the prior year, an increase of 23.4%. our diluted eps as adjusted in q4 was $3.46 versus diluted eps as adjusted of $3.13 in q4 2019, an increase of 10.5%. breaking down that $0.33 increase a bit. most notably, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.34. our lower diluted share count, driven by share repurchases during 2020, benefited us by $0.16. i'll provide more detail on share repurchases in a moment.
higher net interest expense resulting primarily from the higher average debt balances i mentioned earlier negatively impacted us by $0.10. and finally, our higher effective tax rate, resulting primarily from lower tax benefits on equity-based compensation as i mentioned previously, negatively impacted us by $0.07. for the full year, our diluted eps was $12.39 versus $9.56 in the prior year, an increase of 29.6%. our diluted eps as adjusted for the full year was $12.01 versus diluted eps as adjusted of $9.57 in 2019, an increase of 25.5%.
shifting to cash. our economic model remains strong and it continued to generate significant free cash flow throughout the quarter. during full year 2020, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $593 million. after deducting for capex, we generated free cash flow of approximately $504 million. regarding our capital expenditures, we spent approximately $89 million on capex in 2020, primarily on our supply chain centers and technology initiatives.
during q4, we also repurchased and retired approximately 568,000 shares for $225 million or $3.96 per share on average, bringing our 2020 total repurchases to 305 million. subsequently, we've also repurchased an incremental 66,000 shares for $25 million year-to-date in q1 2021. related to our repurchases, we're also pleased to announce that as you saw in this morning's earnings release, our board of directors has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which has replaced the remaining authorization under our existing program.
additionally, during q4, we returned $61 million to our shareholders in the form of two $0.78 quarterly dividend payments, bringing our 2020 total dividend payments to $122 million. as we move into 2021, we're excited to announce that our board of directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.94 per share to be paid on march 30th, an increase of 21% over the previous quarter's dividend. when you add the share repurchases and quarterly dividends, the cumulative impact is that we return more than $425 million to shareholders in 2020.
before wrapping up the financial update, i'd like to walk you through the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our q4 results, as we have done in previous quarters. during q4, the estimated total impact from safety and cleaning equipment, enhanced sick pay and other compensation for our team members and support for our franchisees and our communities, was $7 million.
as we look ahead, we would like to remind you of the 2021 outlook items that we communicated in mid-january, as well as provide you with a longer range outlook. we currently project that the store food basket within our us system will be up 2.5% to 3.5% as compared to 2020 levels. and we do expect some volatility around that range quarter-to-quarter. we estimate that foreign currency could have a $4 million to $8 million positive impact on royalty revenues in 2021 as compared to 2020.
we anticipate our gross capex investments to be approximately $100 million as we continue to invest in strategically growing our business, including in technology, innovation, new stores and supply chain capacity. we expect our g&a expense to be in the range of $415 million to $425 million. keep in mind that g&a expense can vary up or down depending on, among other things, our performance versus our plan as that affects variable performance-based compensation expense as well as other areas such as corporate store advertising.
in addition, in this morning's earnings release, we also announced our two to three-year outlook of 6% to 10% global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact and 6% to 8% global net unit growth. we anticipate providing additional outlook measures if and when we have the appropriate visibility into the broader environment such that it would be meaningful for the investment community.
in closing, our business continued its strong performance during the fourth quarter and for the year and we remain in very good shape financially. obviously, we will continue to closely monitor all aspects of our business operations, given these uncertain times.
and finally, as i intend to do in each of these calls, i want to take a minute to thank our incredible team members and franchisees around the world. they're the reason our brand is able to generate these results.
thank you again for joining the call today. and i'll now turn it over to ritch.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
thanks, stu. and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning. 2020 was a milestone year for us at domino's as our 60th year in business and it certainly was a year like no other. we and our franchisees enter the year with great optimism and solid plans to continue to grow the domino's brand around the world. as covid-19 swept across the globe, we were forced to adapt quickly to a new and more challenging operating environment.
as we continue to deal with the pandemic, we were also confronted with profound issues around social justice that could not be ignored. throughout the year, my team and i lead with our values and we stayed focused on our core stakeholders. those are our customers, our team members, our franchisees, our communities and our shareholders. and despite the many challenges, our franchisees and team members rose to the occasion and delivered exceptional results during 2020.
i am so grateful for the hundreds of thousands of committed people around the world who wear the domino's logo every day. the year like no other really brought out the strength and determination that makes the domino's culture so unique.
now i'd like to do a few things on the call this morning. i'll share some reflections on our performance during the quarter, but i'll focus most of my commentary on 2020 in total across both our us and our international businesses. and i'll discuss some of the things we are focused on as we look forward into 2021 and beyond. and then following that, as always, we'll take some q&a. so with that as our roadmap for the morning, let's get started with our us business.
over the past 60 years, we've worked very hard to earn the trust of our customers, built on our commitment to high quality products, service and image, along with our industry-leading value. in 2020, that foundation of trust was as critical as ever. this trust allowed us to connect with our customers in unique ways and to communicate and to execute a safe quality delivery experience for them and their families. we never took their trust lightly. and through innovations such as contactless delivery and domino's carside delivery, we remained focused on ensuring that our customers felt as confident and safe as ever when they order from domino's.
we gave our customers more options, expanding our menu with three new product launches in the back half of 2020. our new wings and sauces have been enthusiastically embraced by our customers and our new cheeseburger and chicken taco pizzas are now among our best-selling specialty pizzas.
now, innovation wasn't just limited to our delivery options or menu. in 2020, we also delivered a number of operations and technology innovation to our stores. those included our gps driver tracking, our enhanced make-line and cut-table technology and tools and our ai-enabled forecasting to better match demand with capacity in our stores. these innovations are all designed to increase speed, accuracy and efficiency, allowing us to continue to better serve our customers.
we, along with our franchisees, also remain dedicated and disciplined on the value we're known for when our customers really needed it the most. our core $5.99 and $7.99 platforms have been a reliable, important part of the domino's brand experience for many years.
while we certainly brought new customers into the brand over the last year, the story of 2020 was more about the frequency and loyalty of our existing customer base. our customers ordered more often. and when they did, they also ordered more items. and we saw that specifically among our loyalty program members. we now have over 27 million active members in our piece of the pie rewards loyalty program. notably, we achieved continued year-over-year growth in our loyalty program without running any of our more aggressive week-long promotions during the last three quarters of 2020.
now despite the challenges associated with construction and permitting during the pandemic, store growth was once again a significant driver for us of growth in the us. we and our franchisees, both new and existing, continued to invest in our businesses, resulting in 229 net new stores for the year. if you look back over the last five years, we've opened nearly 1,200 new stores in the us and we have closed fewer than 80 over the last five years.
we continue to invest in our supply chain business to support the growth of our franchisees opening two new us centers in 2020 on time and on budget. and that's despite the challenges presented by the covid-19 pandemic. we opened in columbia, south carolina in march, we opened in katy, texas in december. and in september, we also added a thin crust production line to our existing supply chain center in edison, new jersey.
we also invested in the safety and well-being of our front-line corporate store and supply chain team members throughout 2020. we invested in equipment and processes designed to ensure their safety and an enhanced sick pay and benefits and enhanced hourly wages, recognizing the unique challenges of working during the pandemic, including the nearly $10 million in bonuses that we paid to our corporate store and supply chain team members in the month of december.
and we invested in our communities throughout 2020 partnering with our franchisees to donate 10 million slices to first responders, front-line workers and families in need, responding to natural disasters by getting food to people in need, launching a national hiring campaign to provide 30,000 jobs to workers who may have been displaced from theirs, committing $3 million to support black communities in the us, including $1 million to establish the domino's black franchise opportunity fund and partnering with our franchisees to raise $100 million over the next 10 years for st. jude children's research hospital. we and our franchisees raised $13 million for st. jude in 2020 alone.
now looking ahead to 2020 in our us business, we will continue as a work in progress brand, striving to get a little better each and every day. and i'll highlight a few focus areas. and not surprisingly, most of these areas will not be new news to you.
first, we will continue to fortress our markets driving faster and more consistent service, lower delivery costs, better economics for drivers and incremental carry-out traffic. fortressing will continue to drive overall store growth into 2021, including in our company-owned markets. we will continue to deliver new product innovation in 2021. we will continue to produce world-class advertising and we're excited to begin our relationship with work in progress as our new advertising agency.
we will continue to invest in technology to enable great customer experiences, to drive speed, accuracy and efficiency inside our stores, to improve our corporate store team members' ability to support our business. value is always a key focus for us and that won't change in 2021. more than ever, with many americans out of work in these uncertain economic times, value matters. and we're committed to maintaining our unquestioned position of value leadership within the qsr pizza segment.
we're ramping up our focus on service in 2021, getting pizzas out the door to our customers hotter, fresher and more reliably than ever before through innovation within our stores. we're doubling down with technology, with training and with communications.
we will continue to invest in our front-line team members across our corporate stores and supply chain centers, increasing hourly wages in many markets and enhancing our team member benefits. we will also be taking a comprehensive look at our environmental impact. within the next one to three years, we will set science-based time-bound commitments
in accordance with a science-based targets initiative process to reduce the company's total contribution to climate change.
and as always, we will remain obsessed, absolutely obsessed with franchisee profitability. stu shared our initial 2020 store-level ebitda estimate with you in january, and we will share the final number with you when that figure is ready. but we do expect it to be higher than the estimate that stu shared with you last month.
while we believe this level of profitability and associated cash-on-cash returns exceeds any player in our category, we recognize that some of our franchisees and our corporate stores are under intense cost pressure. despite higher overall levels of unemployment across the country, many local labor markets remain tight and wages continue to rise across the country. fixed costs such as rent and insurance also bring added pressure. but my team and i recognize these challenges and we remain intensely focused on helping to drive efficiency and profitability at the store and enterprise level for our franchisees, just as we are for our corporate markets.
as i look back on the fourth quarter and on the full year, i'm very happy with our us performance. we achieved our 39th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth and we surpassed $8 billion in us retail sales for the very first time. i am confident that we are well positioned to continue playing the long game in our us business.
now i'm going to move on to international. during the fourth quarter, our pandemic recovery continued as we reopened stores and delivered the strongest quarterly comp we've reported in four years. we marked our 108th straight positive quarter, that's 27 full years, an incredible run that seemed in doubt when covid struck early in the year. and i'm particularly pleased that our master franchisees continued to invest in the business opening 272 net stores in the quarter and 395 net for the full year. now when you consider that we had about 2,400 stores temporarily closed back in q2, this is truly a remarkable achievement.
and it highlights the terrific unit level economics that our master franchisees have built in many markets around the globe. there is no question that we had more closures in 2020, in fact we had over 300, than you would normally see from domino's in a typical year. this was driven by strategic choices in several markets to close some previously underperforming units, including a number of units with formats that admittedly would have struggled in a new operating environment, rather than reopening them after the pandemic.
so when i look forward, i'm very optimistic about our master franchisees' ability to ramp up our unit growth across the international business. and i want to thank our international partners for their engagement throughout the year.
we dramatically increased our communication across the system. and master franchisees from all over the world really leaned in sharing best practices throughout the year to help their peers and to help our us team manage through the pandemic. this truly demonstrated the power of the global domino's system. and we could not have responded so effectively to covid without this level of partnership.
now, i'd love to share a few 2020 market highlights. we opened for the first time in croatia, welcoming the team there to the domino's family. we opened 95 net stores in china and grew retail sales by over 30%, accelerating growth in this very important market. we were also very pleased to invest in dash brands, our master franchise partner, with a $40 million investment in 2020 and a subsequent $40 million investment, which we completed in q1 of this year. we are excited to partner more deeply with their terrific management team and investors. and i am more optimistic than ever about the potential for domino's in china.
japan was an incredible success story in 2020, passing the 700-store milestone with 100 net stores and over 40% in retail sales growth. germany is another market that saw outstanding retail sales growth of over 25% with 100 -- excuse me -- where we are fast approaching 350 stores, with much potential for future growth.
i'd also like to thank our teams that worked incredibly hard to reopen stores throughout the year following the covid-driven closures. india, france, spain, mexico, new zealand and panama are a few of the markets, along with many others around the world, that have pushed hard to bounce back from significant temporary closures and to position themselves for growth in 2021. based on the latest reports, we now have fewer than 150 temporary international store closures.
now when we look at this recovery in our international business, india deserves a specific mention. after some strategic store closures earlier in the year, jubilant foodworks, our master franchise partner, dramatically accelerated growth with 50 net stores in their most recent reported quarter. as we look forward into 2021, i remain very optimistic about the long-term growth potential of our international business. the opportunity is there, our unit economics are strong and our master franchisees are committed. combined with our corporate support and best practice sharing around the globe, we have the recipe to take this business to its full potential.
so in closing, 2020 was a year like none other, but domino's is a brand like none other. i am proud of our franchise partners and our team members who once again proved to me that they are the best in the restaurant business. and as we look ahead to 2021, we aren't sure exactly what the new normal will look like or when we'll get there, but we will remain diligently focused on delivering for our customers, our team members, our franchisees, our communities and our shareholders.
at domino's, we have a long track record of profitable growth, driven by a disciplined operating model. this model served us well in 2020 and will continue to be the foundation for our growth in 2021 and beyond. this gives me a great deal of confidence in our ability to grow the domino's brand over the long-term. that confidence is demonstrated in this morning's release, where we announced our new two to three-year outlook of 6% to 10% global retail sales growth and 6% to 8% global net unit growth, as well as our new $1 billion share repurchase program.
so i'll end my remarks this morning with a heartfelt thank you to our franchise partners and team members. and that's not just for your efforts in 2020, but also for your continued perseverance in 2021 as we battled covid and the recent winter storms across the us. i am proud to serve you each and every day.
and with that, stu and i will be happy to take your questions.

[operator instructions] first question comes from the line of brian bittner with oppenheimer. your line is open.
brian bittner -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thanks. good morning, ritch. good morning, stu. appreciate all the remarks. and i appreciate the reinstallment of a two to three-year sales outlook. and i understand that this year you'll be lapping an unprecedented situation from 2020 and that the visibility may not be as high as normal. but when you're talking about 6% to 8% unit growth, 6% to 10% retail sales growth, though this view also specifically apply to how you are thinking and we should think about 2021, at least on the unit gross side, it seems like you had a really nice step-up in trends in the fourth quarter. so any additional color would be really helpful. thank you.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure. thanks, brian. appreciate the question. and our new outlook that we've published is a two to three-year look. but specifically to your question on the unit growth, we were really pleased to see some significant momentum building in the fourth quarter of the year, as you saw in the store growth numbers that we published both for the us business and for the international business. and the reality is, there was a lot of pent-up demand out there throughout the course of the year where we just had challenges getting stores opened up due to construction and permitting and other issues, but the fundamental unit level economics in the business have never been better.
stu shared a preliminary look at us store-level ebitda last month. and as we tabulate the final numbers, we expect it to be at least at $158,000 or higher. so, terrific economics in the business. our approach to fortressing in the us and in our international markets is still working very, very well for us.
and then, as it relates to the global retail sales growth number, while covid gave us some tailwind on that in the us, it was actually a headwind in the international side of the business. when you look at all the temporary store closures that we had back in the second quarter, where we were up around 2,400 units that were closed, which had a significant impact, as you know, on retail sales back then. so we're optimistic, brian, as we look forward. and that optimism is reflected in that new outlook that we published this morning.
operator
your next question comes from the line of sara senatore with bernstein. your line is open.
sara senatore -- bernstein -- analyst
thank you. i wanted to ask about the us kind of competitive background. i was interested, you said the story of 2020 was really about increased orders and spend from existing customers. i know that you always get a lot of questions about consolidation and independence. but i guess my sense would be then based on what you're talking about your business that maybe the whole categories are nice tailwind, including both big competitors and independence. so maybe less about share shifts to domino's and more about an aggregate kind of rising tide. and i was just wondering if you could talk a bit about that now that we're a year into the pandemic if you have a better sense of maybe where the traffic was coming from or going to and what the intra-segment dynamics look like? thank you.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure. thanks, sara. and, well, as i answer your question, i'll break it down a bit across the two businesses that we run out of each of our boxes across the country. so, if you start with the delivery business, most certainly the pandemic brought a tailwind in the delivery business, not just for domino's pizza but across the category and frankly across categories. and during the year, we saw strong growth in both your order counts and also growth in ticket in that delivery business's customers tended to order more pizzas.
as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, we also saw that in particular our 27 million active loyalty members ordered more from us. their frequency increased during the year. if you contrast that with the carry-out business, carry-out -- in the carry-out business, covid actually brought a headwind for us in terms of customer activity as fewer customers during the pandemic were comfortable going out and walking into restaurants, even to pick up carry-out. we did see some pressure on order counts in the carry-out business. and the growth story there in 2020 was really around ticket.
now prior to the pandemic that carry-out business has been a terrific source of customer acquisition and order count growth for us. so, as we look forward into 2021, that is one of the important drivers that we see in terms of our ability to continue to grow sales in the us is the restart of that growth on the carry-out side of the business.
stu levy -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and the one thing i'd add to that is, keep in mind, i think, as we've said before, in a lot of cases, the carry-out customer is different from the delivery customer. so it's not necessarily a shift from carry-out to delivery with the same customer base. it's an increase in delivery and a headwind in carry-out. and that's one of the reasons that we have such a high degree of confidence and kind of excitement about what that business can bring to us moving forward.

chris o'cull -- stifel -- analyst
thanks. good morning, guys. ritch, several restaurants have accelerated their investments in technology, given the increase we've seen in digital orders. and some of these companies are probably starting with newer technology that i'm guessing domino's might have even. so, do you believe domino's needs to ramp up its investment or accelerate plans to ensure its tech does not get surpassed by some of the competitors?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
yeah. chris, a great question. and the answer is, we've been investing for a long time and we continue to increase that investment each and every year in technology because you're absolutely right. the half life of any lead that you have is pretty short on that side of the business. our investments will continue. they did in 2020 and will continue to going forward. we're continuing to make great progress with the development of our next generation of our pulse software, which is really the heartbeat of our stores.
we're continuing to invest in our digital ordering platforms as well. and we saw a really nice growth in digital ordering during 2020. our digital sales for the year went up about 5 points over 2019. we ran about 75% digital sales throughout 2020. so we will continue to make investments there to drive the business on the customer side. we're also ramping up our investments in technology as it relates to how we operate our stores.
so i've talked a little bit about gps tracking. we invested in that in 2020. substantially rolled that out across the entire us system. we'll continue to invest there. and also, additional technology tools at the make-line and at the cut-table inside our stores to make the jobs easier for our team members and to help us to get pizzas out the door faster to our customers.

the next question comes from the line of john ivankoe with jpmorgan. your line is open, sir.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, thank you. i know you guys aren't going to for a lot of logical reasons, give quarterly comp guidance, especially with the comparisons that are about to change so meaningfully in coming weeks. but i just want to get your overall thoughts, especially as you do have some leading indicators of markets that have reopened. and most people talk about the reopening trade of people going back and dining in restaurants and a lot of the consumer packaged food companies seem to suggest that they're not going to lose very much of their own business that the generated through grocery in 2020.
so the question is, as we think about second half of '21 versus second half of '19, or even if we think about '22 versus '19, what's your sense? and i guess, at this point, it's a guess but you guys get to make an educated guess using some of the early market data that you have of kind of being able to grow sales versus the '19 level even if we do say, hey, comping against high teens comps, is this always going to be difficult for any business and we just shouldn't expect that. but how are we feeling second half of '21 and '22 versus '19, given what might be a way for at least certain groups of people to go back to dining inside of restaurants?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
hey, john. thanks for the question. i guess, what i would say at a high level is that, we see a lot of -- even with the tailwind that we had in 2020 in the delivery business, we had a headwind on the carry-out side of the business, as i talked about earlier. so when i look across 2021, one important growth driver for us is going to be to reaccelerate that growth on the carry-out side of the business. because we know lapping some of the delivery tailwind is going to be difficult.
we were also going to continue to invest in value in the business as we always have and making sure that as our customers continue to manage their households through what is going to be a fairly difficult economic time for a lot of americans, we believe that continuing to stay focused on value is also going to help us as a lot of folks who have been paying a lot to have food delivered to their houses. as behaviors start to change and other options open up, we're going to continue to have domino's as the unquestioned value leader in the qsr pizza segment. and frankly, broadly across the restaurant industry when you think about what it costs to have food delivered to feed a family of four, we really like our positioning in that space.
we'll also look throughout the year to reinitiate some of our boost weeks, our aggressive value weeks that have been an important part of our strategy to acquire customers over the last number of years. so, we're not going to do anything, john, just to lap a comp. that's not how we manage the business here. everything that we do is going to be around how do we continue to drive sustained and profitable long-term growth for our franchisees and ourselves.
stu levy -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and the only -- the other thing i just add to that is, we also think we benefit from the fact that our store base is everywhere. we're not urban dominated or suburban dominated. we hit all markets. and when you hear folks talking about the wave of people that are going to rush back into dine-in restaurants, they're generally coming from a more densely populated urban perspective where those restaurants are more prevalent as you start looking across the landscape and you look at that relative to our store footprint, it gives us a lot of confidence to be able to weather some of that.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and do you have any evidence in markets like georgia, mississippi, alabama, tennessee, maybe certain parts of florida that suggests that you are holding on to that businesses in '19 as some of the diamond business in those areas is strong?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
john, less -- we see kind of less -- i guess, you would say less trends about region in the country, but what we -- when you take a look at urban stores versus second city or suburban or rural, our business has been strongest in that rural and suburban area. it really is the urban centers where we've seen the most pressure on our business, frankly across the carry-out and the delivery businesses.

david tarantino -- baird -- analyst
hi. good morning. ritch, i was wondering if we could go back to your fourth quarter performance. and while still healthy, it was lower from a comp perspective in the us relative to the elevated levels you had during the middle of the year. and i was wondering if you could just opine on what the reasons were you saw a slower trend exiting the year and whether that has any implications related to your brand and the positioning in the market.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure. so, david -- and i hope i have a lot of quarters where i can talk about an 11% comp. so we're pretty proud of the comp as it is, but i will talk a little bit about some of the deceleration relative to the third quarter. and there's a couple of things. one is that there is no question that the stimulus dollars and the enhanced federal unemployment insurance certainly puts money in consumers' pockets and allows them to go out and buy food. and as we move further and further away in the fourth quarter from that stimulus that had been enacted earlier in the year, most certainly that had an impact on our business. as we continue to aggressively open stores, is that accelerated? certainly, the impact of some of those splits weighs a little bit on the comp. and then, frankly, as we got deeper into the fourth quarter and you started to see the covid-19 pandemic in a significant resurgence across the country, that has a material impact on the carry-out business when folks get less comfortable getting out in their cars and going to visit places of business.

ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure. thanks, pete. well, we've been working really hard on service times across the business. and what i'll tell you is that when we got the initial rush of demand back in the second quarter, we certainly saw our service times suffer a little bit. but team, both on the corporate store side and our franchisees as well, worked really hard to claw back and improve those times relative to the first wave of the pandemic. service time improvement is going to continue to be a significant, not just in 2021 quite frankly, but longer-term effort for us, that really is one of the important moats that we have to build around our business. and fortressing is certainly a big part of that. and we do continue to see where we fortress our markets we do see service time improvements, material improvements, as we shrink the radius around the stores allowing us to travel fewer miles and get to our customers with not just faster but hotter fresher food.
stu levy -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and on top of that, delivering our own food enables us to drive better service, right, because we can go from the oven out the door without having to wait for a third-party to come in and pick it up.

john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. and good morning, all. i wanted to come back, ritch and stu, to the market share question. i think you shared at icr some market share. it's a delivery and it was, if i remember correctly, like 36%. that really didn't change from '19. so if that's correct, or if it's not correct, let me know. but why do you grow share in the past? this year what you'd think would be a year where you could have grown share more just given your capabilities. so why do you think that's the case? is it just everyone got better? was it independence suddenly got stronger? what is it in that dynamic that maybe changed in 2020 and how you think what were the causes of it?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
yeah, john. i think what we saw in 2020 was just broad growth across the category. so while we had terrific growth in our delivery business, that was broadly across the category, a lot of growth, a lot of independence that maybe didn't have a big delivery business back in '18 and '19, they jumped with both feet into delivery to stay alive in 2020. and through the use of third-party aggregators to deliver their product, that certainly resulted in some delivery growth coming from some of the independence and regionals that maybe weren't -- wasn't there in the past.

your next question comes from the line of eric gonzalez with keybanc. your line is open.
eric gonzalez -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi. thanks for the question and good morning. regarding the potential wage increases, i was wondering how that might impact your ability to hold on to those $5.99 and $7.99 price points. or said a different way, recognizing that all good things might eventually come to an end, what would have to happen from an inflation perspective for you to need to back away from those platforms? and what can be done to protect those price points without having materially widen gap versus other items on the menu? thanks.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure, eric. so, the interesting thing is, today, as it relates to wage environment, we've operated in a really wide spectrum of wage rates across the country as it is today. and i know minimum wage in particular is certainly a topic that everybody is thinking about out there. but today, we operate in states that are at the federal minimum wage, all the way up to places like seattle, which are already in excess of $15, $16 an hour. and we've still been able to offer the $5.99 and $7.99 platforms across the country.
and there is a couple of things that enable us to do that. one is, the volumes that we run at, there's no way you can stay at that value level without having a high volume business like we have today. second is that our franchisees at the local level have flexibility around menu pricing and around delivery fees. and their transparent delivery fees at the local level, they're going to be higher in these higher wage markets than they are in some of the others.
so, we've been able to manage our way through a lot of minimum wage increases across the country. and i'll tell you, quite honestly, in our corporate store business, we're not paying the federal minimum wage anyway. you can't go out there and hire people at that rate anyway. we're above the minimum wage, both for our folks that work inside the stores and our tip drivers on the road. and then, in our supply chain business, we're in excess of $15 an hour everywhere we operate.
stu levy -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, if you think about the offers, they've been -- we've had them for years. and every year, we basically have wage rate increases and food cost increases and continue to drive additional profit. and for us, it's -- we do a ton of deep market research and analytics around where that profit maximizing price point is for us. so it's not -- it's certainly not set arbitrarily. and that is certainly a place where we provide a ton of value to the consumer. and we've been able to do it profitably and continue to do so.

lauren silberman -- credit suisse -- analyst

ritch allison -- chief executive officer
yes. much better. thanks, lauren.
lauren silberman -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. awesome. sorry about that. so, coming into covid, domino's and the pizza category in general is facing incremental competition from the growth in third-party delivery. richard, you mentioned through covid, the delivery channel overall has benefited with the acceleration of adoption. so as you look at the competitive environment today, do you think domino's is any better positioned with respect to third-party delivery now that restaurants will likely be more focused on bringing back in-store traffic and there's some kind of more regulatory requirements, or in a more challenging position given the breadth and depth of competition has increased?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
yeah, lauren, for us, it's i guess a little bit less about regulatory. i think, for us, we -- i'd be honest, we struggled a little bit understanding the long-term economics in some of the aggregator businesses. in 60 years, we've never made a dollar delivering a pizza. we make money on the product, but we don't make money on the delivery. so, we're just not sure how others do it. and in a world where we're trying to shrink our delivery area to get closer to our customer for better service, a lot of these third-parties are trying to expand to reach more customers, which we think just takes away from service.
and when you think about the profit equation, you get somebody who inserts themselves into the value chain and they have to make their money somewhere. and it's either got to come from the restaurant or it has to come from the customer. and we think overtime, that's going to put a lot of pressure, particularly on the independent restaurants to be able to continue to make margins in rising cost environments, while paying these aggregators.
and the customers overtime are going to start looking at the free delivery that cost them $15 to get $12 worth of food when they start digging in to look at service fees and service charges. so, we're just not sure how it all plays out. and you've seen that with some of the public players in that space who have commented about the challenge of driving long-term profitability as an aggregator. so, for us, we continue to just be the low-cost delivery provider, provide great value. and we think as long as we're providing a great product with great service at a great value, we'll let everything else shake out. and certainly we don't know how long it will take to all shake out. but from our perspective, we're in a pretty good spot.

dennis geiger -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
great. thanks for the question. ritch, i wanted to ask a little bit more on loyalty and new product innovation as we think about 2021 and even going forward. i'm just wondering if you could talk more about those two opportunities and kind of how those might allow you to keep some of the new customers that you might have gained in 2020, i guess, and or attract new customers going forward. just how those initiatives may help you to kind of hold or even gain category share going forward? thanks.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure. thanks for the question. so i'll talk about loyalty, maybe just even a little bit more broadly because there were a couple of metrics that i shared earlier that i think are important on this front. one is, the increase in the number of active members of our piece of the pie rewards program, which was up to 27 million plus. we also saw an increase in engagement and frequency among that group as well, which is a big focus of ours. once that program gets to that level of scale, 27 million plus. and we've got -- beyond that, we've got 40 million plus that at some point have been enrolled in the program and we've got 80 million plus customers that are in our database. so, we spent a lot of time on initiatives thinking about how can we continue to mine that treasure of customers and find ways to better serve them at their time of need to drive higher frequency.
another metric i shared earlier that is also important is, the increase that we saw in digital engagement with our customers, with digital sales going up from 70% to 75% during the year broadly across the customer base, that's yet another opportunity because those customers tend -- our ticket tends to be higher because we do a better job with upsell on them. and once they start ordering digitally, they tend to be stickier with us over the long-term. so we'll continue, as we always do, many efforts focused in that space.
and then, you asked about new products also. we had, as i mentioned earlier, three that we successfully launched in 2020. and that's going to continue to be part of our playbook going forward. we've got some exciting things that our culinary team has been working on that i certainly like. and based on our testing, a lot of our customers do as well. so you'll see some more news coming from us in that space during 2021 as well.

ritch allison -- chief executive officer
yeah. it's a great question. and prior to the pandemic, we had taken the carry-out mix up to about 45% of our orders. and that mix came down a bit during covid as we talked about earlier, given just the changing customer behaviors. we are very much focused on growing that carry-out business in 2021 and forward. and while the ticket is lower on a carry-out order, to your point, there's so much less labor cost associated with each of those carry-out orders that the higher the average hourly labor rate gets in your market, the more of the profitability equation tilts toward those carry-out orders. this is something that we've seen, frankly, in some of our international markets as well which have much higher labor costs than the us does. driving that carry-out business has been a really important part of continuing to grow profitability at the store level for our franchisees.

ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure. great question. what i would tell you is that we have such a fantastic base of franchisees across the us who are excited and eager to lean in, in 2021. and that's in a couple of ways, one that you mentioned, adding team members to their stores. i can tell you that everyone i go out there and talk to is aggressively trying to hire and add to their teams. because funny thing happens when you add more delivery drivers to your business, your sales go up over time.
but also, franchisees are also excited about continuing to invest in their businesses and in building new stores. because as we continue to grow sales and as profits have increased, the equation around those new store openings, particularly when we've got places where we're fortressing or splitting, gets even more attractive. so, we've got a committed group that's ready to lean in and invest in 2021.

great. thank you very much. just a follow-up on the aggregator question. i know you had previously talked about consolidation within that subgroup and maybe promoting more aggressively. and you guys were keen to remain solo. with that said, i think we will have seen that covid has driven large increases in at least traffic on these sites. so, even if you were to never allow aggregators to do your delivery, as stu mentioned, which would -- it allows you to retain the service levels and make sure you're still profitable. but would you ever think about having your brand on their platform just to reach the additional eyeballs and generate the sales? i'm just wondering what the risks might be on that front just to drive the traffic, but not necessarily pay the risk -- or pay the fees and have the risk of it impacting service. thank you.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
yeah, jeff. we've looked at it many, many times over the last couple of years. and as some of our international markets do gather some of their orders through aggregators. we don't allow aggregators to deliver our food anywhere. but in some context, in our international markets, it's made some sense. every time we look at it here in the us, it just doesn't make sense for us or our franchisees economically. and if it doesn't make sense economically, it certainly doesn't make sense to take the risk of sharing all of our customer data with these third-parties.

david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks. i guess, this is a follow-up on a lot of questions about market share, but also the legacies of covid in terms of your business going forward. do you view any of these market share shifts as perhaps more sticky than the others? you meant -- you've shown at the icr presentation that you gained a lot of share of overall qsr pizza, which probably means that the independents got hammered pretty hard on the pickup at store. i'm wondering maybe, are those scars that remain or do you expect a big snapback? and then conversely, you've talked about delivery share remaining flat in pizza. i would imagine it's down in overall delivery and that might have some influence or some stickiness long-term or not. how are you thinking about these things? thanks.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
yeah. sure, david. so, the way we look at it is, we are executing against strategies to continue to drive market share in both segments of the business, both the delivery and the carry-out segments. and certainly 2020 was a very unique year in terms of how some of this shifted around, in particular, with so many restaurants jumping into delivery, and frankly, with so many consumers having no choice but to go pick up food or have it delivered. but we feel very good about the plans and strategies that our teams have put in place to continue driving market share in both of those segments of our business.
stu levy -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and it's hard to really make a generalization on the independents because it really does vary market to market and area to area. and a lot of that data is not yet in or really hard to get. i do think certainly to the comments we made before on the aggregators where you have the smaller independents that jumped into delivery by using a third-party, like i said, we have some questions about the viability of that long-term if you're an independent paying exorbitant fees for a third-party to step in your value chain. so, when does that all shake out? your guess is as good as ours.

ritch allison -- chief executive officer
yeah. jeff, we're really excited about domino's carside delivery. and this is something that didn't even exist at the beginning of 2020. it was an idea, a concept that we had that the team just pulled forward and accelerated the development on. and now, we've fully rolled out across our system. and not only has it helped us in the pandemic to do safe carry-out for customers, but frankly, over the long haul, we look at carside delivery as the way we will compete against the drive-through. we've only got about 10% or so of our domino's in the us to have a drive-through window. so this is a great way for us to serve customers without them getting out of their cars.
post the rollout, we have continued to improve our service times in carside delivery. and our aspiration here, which is well within reach, is that we get to a point where you can get a carside delivery at domino's faster than you can wait in line at a qsr drive-through to get your food through the window. and to your point on mix, we don't -- we're not sharing that externally yet for competitive reasons. but we have seen a dramatic increase in customer usage of domino's carside delivery since we launched it. and part of our 2020 plans are going to be to drive that even higher.

ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure, andrew. so part of it is, with these types of programs, as they get bigger and bigger, the growth in active membership gets more difficult year-on-year. but a couple of things that we were most pleased with when we look back at the loyalty program over 2020 was, one, that we grew it without in the final three quarters, the use of any of our more aggressive boost weeks, which are an important tool to drive customer acquisition.
and then the second thing is that we were able to grow the number of customers active in the program, while also still growing the frequency with which those customers order. and when you take a look at driving volume in the business, it really is those two metrics in combination with one another that drive the overall increase in engagement and sales with those loyal customers.

ritch allison -- chief executive officer
yeah. we did terrific year on franchisee profitability in 2020. and what it's really driven by, it is driven by increasing order counts across the business, particularly on the delivery side of the business. but also increasing ticket, but smart ticket, not increases in prices, but increases in the number of items that customers bought on average for each of their orders. so, even in the face of some increases in labor costs and other fixed costs in the business, it really is that volume increase that drove the uptick in profitability during the year.

your next question comes from the line of james rutherford with stephens. your line is open.
james rutherford -- stephens -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. i'm curious about how domino's will navigate this mix shift that you're expecting back toward carry-out after the big year of delivery gain. it seems like from previous comments, the carry-out transaction is possibly more desirable than delivery from an operator's perspective given the margins. but i'd love to hear more color about the top-line impact, i mean, to the extent that certain customers turn a delivery order during covid into a carry-out order, for example, in the way home-for-work or something like that. what's the typical check size difference there? and what are some things you could potentially do to elevate that carry-out ticket without compromising the value proposition? i'm just trying to understand that potential impact to your royalty revenue stream. thanks so much.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure, sure. the objective for us will be to grow both of those channels. covid, we don't have all the data out of covid yet to fully understand all of the customer behavior changes. but prior to covid, there is only about 15% of customers that were both delivery and carry-out, because customers tend to be one or the other. so as we look at the business going forward and think about how do we grow it in 2021 and beyond, it is going to be through a unique set of strategies around each of those two channels.
so while we're certainly going to be aggressive on the carry-out side with domino's carside delivery and other initiatives that we have in place, we absolutely are not stepping away from the delivery side of the business also. and we've got a set of strategies that we're going to continue to execute on the delivery side as well so that we could hold on to those customers that we gained during the course of 2020.
stu levy -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we're not looking at it so much as a shift from one or the other as it is a reemergence or kind of gaining back some of those carry-out customers that have been on the sideline. the most notable difference obviously from a ticket perspective is just the delivery fee.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
and typically, it's just slightly -- a little bit lower item count in those orders as well. but both channels, very attractive and profitable businesses for our franchisees.
operator
there are no further questions at this time. i would like to turn the call back over to chief executive officer, ritch allison, for closing remarks. go ahead, sir.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the q1 2021 domino's pizza, inc. earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, chris brandon, director, investor relations. thank you, and please go ahead.
chris brandon -- director, investor relations
appreciate it, samantha, and good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us for our conversation today regarding the results of our first quarter 2021. today's call will feature commentary from chief executive officer, ritch allison; and chief financial officer, stu levy. as this call is primarily for our investor audience, i ask all members of the media and others to be in a listen-only mode. i want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in this morning's earnings release and 10-q also apply to our comments on the call today. both of those documents are available on our website. actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecasts. for more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our filings with the sec. in addition, please refer to the 8-k earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures that may be referenced on today's call. i'll request to our coverage analysts, we want to do our best this morning to accommodate as many of you as time permits. so, we encourage you to ask only one one-part question on this call, if you would please. today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for a replay via our website.
with that, i'd like to turn the call over to our chief financial officer, stu levy.
stu levy -- executive vice president-chief financial officer
thanks, chris. good morning, everyone. we're excited to share our strong first-quarter results with you today. overall, domino's team members and franchisees around the world generated impressive operating results, leading to a diluted eps of $3 for the first quarter. global retail sales grew 16.7% in q1 as compared to q1 2020. as a reminder, global retail sales growth includes both comp growth and unit growth, which i'll break down for you in a moment. when excluding the positive impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 14%. breaking down that global retail sales growth, our us retail sales grew 15.3% and our international retail sales grew 18%. when excluding the positive impact of foreign currency, international retail sales grew 12.8%. we continued to see positive momentum in both our us and international businesses in q1, leading to both strong same-store sales performance and net unit growth.
turning to comps. during q1, we continued to lead the broader restaurant industry with 40 straight quarters of positive us comparable sales and 109 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. same-store sales in the us grew 13.4% in the quarter, lapping a prior year increase of 1.6%. same-store sales for our international business grew 11.8%, rolling over a prior year increase of 1.5%. breaking down the us comp a bit further. our franchise business was up 13.9% in the quarter, while our company owned stores were up 6.3%. we observed a larger spread than we've historically seen between the top line performance of our franchise stores and our company-owned stores, which we believe was primarily a result of the heavily urban and higher income footprint of our company-owned stores relative to a more diverse mix across our franchise base. the corporate store comp was also disproportionately impacted by store splits resulting from our fortressing efforts as we opened more new corporate stores as a percent of the total corporate store base than we did franchise stores in 2020. the us comp this quarter included a healthy mix of both ticket and order growth. the ticket growth was driven by both an increase in items per order and a higher delivery mix, which also includes a transparent delivery fee. the 11.8% international comp was driven by ticket growth. similar to our us business, that ticket growth was driven by a higher delivery mix and an increase in items per order.
shifting to unit count. we and our franchisees added 36 net stores in the [technical issues] us during the first quarter, consisting of 37 store openings and the closure of one of our corporate stores. our international business added 139 net stores, comprised of 160 store openings and 21 closures. we're very pleased with our net unit growth during q1, which was an increase over the prior year quarter.
turning to revenues and operating margins. total revenues for the first quarter were approximately $984 million and were up approximately $111 million or 12.7% over the prior year quarter. the increase was driven by higher global retail sales, which generated higher revenues across all areas of our business. changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted our international royalty revenues by $2.1 million in q1 2021 as compared to prior year. our consolidated operating margin as a percent of revenue increased to 39.6% in q1 2021 from 39% in the prior year, due primarily to higher revenues from our us franchise business. company-owned store margin as a percent of revenues increased to 23.9% from 22.4%, primarily as a result of strong sales leverage. this was also up sequentially from 21.9% in q4 2020, driven by lower labor cost as a percent of revenue in q1 2021. supply chain operating margin as a percent of revenues decreased to 10.5% from 11.5% in the prior year quarter. as a reminder, in 2020, we opened two new supply chain centers in south carolina and texas, respectively, as well as a new press product line in new jersey, which increased our overall fixed operating costs as a percent of revenue.
g&a expenses increased approximately $2.8 million in q1 as compared to q1 2020 resulting from a combination of higher advertising expenses and labor costs, partially offset by travel. net interest expense increased approximately $0.9 million in the quarter, primarily the result of lower interest income. as previously disclosed, in q1 2021, we invested an additional $40 million in dash brands, our master franchisee in china, following their achievement of previously established performance conditions. accordingly, we remeasured the original $40 million investment we made in q2 of last year due to the observable change in price from the valuation of the additional investment. this $2.5 million gain was recorded in other income in the first quarter of 2021. our effective tax rate was 21.3% for the quarter as compared to a negative 3.7% in q1 2020. the effective tax rate in q1 2021 includes a 0.6 percentage point positive impact from tax benefits on equity-based compensation as compared to a 26 percentage point positive impact in q1 2020. this decrease was due to significantly fewer stock option exercises in q1 of this year and we expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to these equity-based compensation tax benefits. combining all of these elements, our first quarter net income was down $3.8 million or 3.2% versus q1 2020. on a pre-tax basis, income before provision for income taxes was up $32.3 million or 27.6%. our diluted eps in q1 was $3 versus $3.07 in the prior year, a decrease of 2.3%. breaking down that $0.07 decrease, most notably, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.61. the gain on the dash brands investment benefited us by $0.05. net interest expense negatively impacted us by $0.02. a lower diluted share count driven by share repurchases over the trailing 12 months benefited us by $0.03. and finally, our higher effective tax rate resulting from lower tax benefits on equity-based compensation, as i mentioned previously, negatively impacted us by $0.74.
shifting to cash. our economic model continued to generate significant cash flow throughout the quarter. during q1, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $153 million. after deducting for capex, we generated free cash flow of approximately $136 million. regarding our capital expenditures, we spent approximately $17 million on capex in q1, primarily on our technology initiatives. as previously disclosed, during q1, we also repurchased and retired approximately 66,000 shares for $25 million. as a reminder, in february, our board approved a new $1 billion authorization for future share repurchases. we also paid a $0.94 quarterly dividend on march 30. subsequent to the end of the quarter, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.94 per share to be paid on june 30. as it relates to our capital structure, on april 16, we refinanced our debt to keep pace with our growing business. we're very pleased with our gross issuance of $1.85 billion, which includes $850 million of seven-and-a-half-year to 2.662% fixed-rate notes and $1 billion of 10-year 3.151% fixed-rate notes. we used a portion of the proceeds to retire our 2017 floating rate notes in our 2017 five-year fixed-rate notes to pre-fund certain interest payable and to pay transaction fees and expenses. we expect to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include distributions to holders of our common stock, other equivalent payments, and/or stock repurchases. this recapitalization will reduce our weighted average borrowing rate from 3.9% as of the end of the first quarter to approximately 3.7%. and it will return our leverage to approximately 6 times ebitda, consistent with our leverage model following previous recapitalizations. additional information on this transaction is included in our form 10-q, which was filed this morning.
since the onset of the pandemic, in previous earnings calls, we've provided updates on the impact of covid19-related expenses, including safety and cleaning equipment, enhanced sick pay, and other compensation for our team members, and support for our franchisees, and our communities. the estimated impact of these items in the first quarter of 2021 was not material. in closing, our business continued its strong performance during the first quarter. and while we continue to closely monitor all aspects of our operations in these ever-changing times, we're confident in the strength and resilience of the domino's brand, and of the domino's franchisees, their team members, and our corporate teams worldwide. our results would not be possible without their tireless efforts each and every day and we sincerely appreciate them.
thank you again for joining the call today, and i'll now turn it over to ritch.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
thank you, stu, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. overall, i am very pleased with our results this quarter and our strong start to 2021. we are now more than one year into the covid pandemic, the most challenging operating environment we've ever experienced as a brand. i continue to be extremely proud of our global franchisees and their extraordinary efforts around product, service, image, and day-to-day execution. we remain focused on providing outstanding food through safe and reliable delivery and carryout experiences. and as a brand, we are also proud to continue our position as an industry leader on value at a time when our customers need it the most. today, i'll keep my comments rather brief as i highlight the first quarter results for our us and our international businesses. and then, after that, stu and i'll be happy to take some of your questions.
let's start with the us business. our us business performed extremely well during the quarter, highlighted by 15.3% retail sales growth and a 13.4% comp. this marked our 40th consecutive quarter of positive us same-store sales growth. we continue to see strong growth across our business in the first quarter and we did not witness any material differences between those markets that have largely reopened versus those that have remained more restricted. we certainly saw some sales benefits from the federal government stimulus at the beginning and at the end of q1, which were partially offset by the negative impact of the significant winter storms in february that impacted such a large portion of the country. due to the positive sales impacts from the stimulus, we elected not to run any of our aggressive boost week promotions during the quarter, but instead, we remain focused on providing great service and offering great value to our customers every day. now, like many of you, we are also watching the two-year stack on us same-store sales. at 15% for the first quarter, we saw a slight sequential improvement of the two-year stack when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. given the covid overlaps, we will continue to look at the business through both the one-and-two-year lenses as we report to you throughout 2021.
now, beyond the comps, when you look at the absolute dollars, our first quarter same-store average weekly unit sales in the us exceeded $26,000. i am also quite pleased with our performance in the first quarter on the other critical component of our retail sales growth that's new store openings. our addition of 36 net stores was a nice improvement over q1 of 2020 and we anticipate a strong pipeline of future openings. i want to highlight that we had only one corporate store closure in the us during q1, and we had zero-zero us franchise store closures, an impressive testament to the continued health of our us system. on many occasions, you've heard me say that net unit growth and by extension store closures are one of the most important ways to measure a brand's health within our industry. a single store closure in the quarter, on a base of over 6,000 units, demonstrates the elite economic proposition that we offer to our franchisees. and on that note, i'm thrilled to report yet another record-setting year of franchisee profitability, with our final 2020 estimated average ebitda number for us franchise stores coming in at just over $177,000; the highest in our history. while this result was certainly aided by the covid demand tailwind, it clearly demonstrates not only the power of the brand, but also the incredible work of our us franchisees and operators, and their relentless efforts throughout an incredibly busy 2020. our fortressing strategy continues to build best-practice case study showcasing franchisee enterprise growth and roi, which is a big part of the momentum and excitement behind the strategy. but equally, as important, it sets us up extremely well to compete in 2021 and beyond, as we continue to drive lower relative costs, better service, higher runs per hour, and therefore, better economics for drivers, along with meaningful, incremental carry-out within our stores in fortress territories. while our carry-out order count remained pressured in q1 as it was throughout the last year, we continue to grow awareness of domino's car-side delivery. this has created a new option to serve our customers effectively during covid and will remain an important part of our strategy as we continue to evolve the carry-out experience; not only to enhance the loyalty of our current carry-out customers, but also to reach a new, different, and largely untapped drive-through oriented customer, going forward.
on the advertising front, i'm excited about the national tv campaign we launched this week, highlighting our very exciting partnership with nuro. we are delivering a true autonomous pizza delivery experience to select customers in houston today, demonstrating our forward-thinking approach to innovation as we build and evolve the brand for the future. we also brought back our old nemesis, the noid, in this ad campaign, and it is already generating some incredible buzz around the domino's brand. now, the final thing i'd like to acknowledge as we close out the discussion on our q1 results in the us is the very difficult staffing environment that we are in today. the combination of covid, strong sales, the broader economy reopening, and the high level of government stimulus, it's creating one of the most difficult staffing environments that we've seen in a long time. this puts pressure on our operators to meet demand while continuing to deliver great service to their customers. i thank our us franchisees and our corporate store operators for the work they are doing to attract and retain great team members in a very tight labor market.
as we close out our discussion on the us business, i would simply highlight that the domino's brand is as strong as it has ever been and i remain confident in our ability to drive long-term growth. let's move on now to the international business. it was an outstanding quarter of performance for our international business. our 12.8% retail sales growth was supported by a very strong 11.8% comp, continuing the momentum we saw toward the end of last year. q1 also marked our 109th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales and international; a tremendous accomplishment by our international franchise partners. and, in fact, the q1 comp was the strongest result we've seen in more than a decade in that business. as i discussed earlier with our us business, we are also watching the two-year comp stacks for international and we'll continue to do so throughout 2021. q1 represented a 13.3% two-year stack, which was a 430 basis point improvement versus the fourth quarter of 2020. we also continue to build momentum on store growth in our international business. our 139 net stores in q1 was a 100-store improvement versus the first quarter of 2020. we expect that covid will continue to have a significant impact on many of our international markets for some time to come and will bring ongoing challenges to new store openings. but this acceleration in growth speaks to our outstanding unit-level economics and to the perseverance and commitment of our international master franchisees. we continue to have temporary store closures around the world, but those have come down dramatically over the last few quarters and were below 100 at the end of the first quarter.
now, i'd like to highlight a few markets that drove terrific growth during the quarter. india, china, and japan, once again, led our system in net unit growth. and i'd like to highlight another market, guatemala, that also delivered terrific store growth. china, japan, turkey, colombia, germany, and france, all drove impressive retail sales growth during the quarter. so, once again, i am very proud of our master franchisees and their operators for a great start to 2021. they are the best in the business and that's why i continue to be bullish about our international retail sales growth opportunity over the long term.
so, in closing, i'm very pleased with our quarter one results. our incredible base of franchisees and operators, combined with outstanding unit-level economics place us in an enviable position of strength within our industry. q1 reinforced our position as the global leader in qsr pizza, but there is still so much opportunity ahead of us to drive global retail sales growth and to capture additional meaningful share within the category. as we look ahead to the rest of 2021 and beyond, we will, as always, stay focused on winning the long game. and we remain confident in our two-year to three-year outlook of 6% to 8% annual net store growth and 6% to 10% annual global retail sales growth. so, thank you once again for joining us today. and at this time, stu and i, will now be happy to take your questions.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of brian bittner with oppenheimer.
brian bittner -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thank you. good morning. good morning, ritch; good morning, stu. obviously, the us business continues to be a phenomenal engine, and the long-term outlook there is pretty clear. but the topical question that i must ask is related to the us business as it begins to lap the meaningful upswing and strength from last year that really began around this time as we kind of sit here and we analyze your two-year trends in the first quarter, it does suggest actually an improving likelihood of successfully lapping that strength, at least with maybe the ability to perhaps hold on to those gains more than we all thought originally. can i get your reaction to that thought and what specific weapons do you have in your arsenal that you plan to deploy over the rest of the year to fight this lap? thanks.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
hi, brian, and thanks for the question. and you're absolutely right, we've got some pretty strong laps ahead of us from the second and the third quarters of last year. but what we're really focused on are continuing to make the investments to drive long-term growth in the business. and as i look out across the rest of the year, we are really in an enviable position. we've got a fantastic advertising war chest. we have not deployed some of the tools this year so far that we've used in the past around our boost weeks to drive incremental customer acquisition, so we have those in our arsenal. and i think, very importantly, the carry-out business, which on a relative basis, when you look at order growth during 2020 was weak relative to its historical run rate. and so, we've got an opportunity to continue to drive that carry-out business along with some, you know, some day -- and dayparts during the week as well. as it relates to last year, weekends and late-night were relatively weak relative -- versus weekdays and the earlier-in-the-day dayparts from last year.
so, as customer patterns continue to change, as the economy continues to open up, we feel confident that we've got a set of tools to allow us to continue to grow our business.
brian bittner -- oppenheimer -- analyst

operator
your next question comes from the line of peter saleh with btig.
peter saleh -- btig -- analyst
great. thanks. ritch, i think you mentioned the store level ebitda was about $177,000 per store, which i think that number was almost $20,000 higher than the original estimate that you guys provided, i mean back in january. could you just give us a little bit of a sense on maybe what the difference is between the original estimate and the new figure that you guys actually reported this morning?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure, pete. when we give the original estimate which comes back in early january, it's based on pretty limited sample of the franchisee p&ls that come in, and over the course of the first quarter, as those begin to roll in, we collect them and rarely does it move this much from the original estimate to the final number, but just the way the sample played out over time, the result ended up coming in quite a bit stronger. and when i think about where we sit within the industry today, that $177,000 in store-level ebitda really puts our system in an incredible position of strength. and when you see it, you're not surprised that we only had one store that closed in the us throughout the entire quarter.
peter saleh -- btig -- analyst
very impressive. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of sara senatore with bernstein.
sara senatore -- bernstein -- analyst
great. thank you very much. i just had a quick question, i guess, about some of the commentary about carry-out versus delivery in the us. i guess, in terms of the strength of the business, you said you're not really seeing any variability across us markets, but i would have associated sort of softer carry-out with mobility restrictions. i'm trying to kind of reconcile those two, that overall, i would think carry-out might be affected by restrictions and -- but those vary across markets. and maybe, if you can just talk about the share within the carry-out versus with delivery within pizza, that category so i can sort of understand what might be going out on between those two businesses? thank you.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure, sara. what we saw across the us was continued pressure on carry-out order count in total, but when we broke it down and looked state-by-state at the different pace of reopening across the country, there really were no discernible differences in our business, overall. so we still see a lot of opportunity for carry-out to continue to grow and come back as mobility increases broadly across the country. and i can also tell you that we have not been as aggressive as we've been in the past on promoting that carry-out business also. and so, there are opportunities there for us as we look across the rest of the year as well.
sara senatore -- bernstein -- analyst
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of john glass with morgan stanley.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
[technical issues] talk about the international business and you think about those two-year trends those materially inflected, how much of that was just a result of maybe the increased international lockdowns? you have any anecdotes as this -- is your underlying business trends just broadly strong or is it really just those lockdown markets are getting a benefit? and maybe, if you want to just highlight a few of the key drivers? i know you talked about development, but just on a comp perspective, what really contributed to that significant acceleration in the international markets?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure. john, thanks for the question. and it really is -- its -- performance is still quite mixed across the markets within the international business, as you might guess, that the dynamics as it relates to covid are still quite different, depending upon what parts of the world that we're in. but what we have seen is as we were able to, over the course of 2020, reopen our markets, you may recall this time last year we were, gosh, 2,000-plus units that were temporarily closed, and as we've been able to get units reopened and then to get the pipeline of new development going and turn the marketing back on across the international businesses, we've seen a strong resurgence in sales in many of the markets that we operate in. and it's going to continue to be choppy, market-by-market, as we look out across 2021, because in some places, we're going to be lapping very weak comps in retail sales from last year, and in other places on the planet, we're going to be lapping very strong numbers from last year.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of jared garber with goldman sachs.
jared garber -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. i actually wanted to follow up on that prior question on international. several years ago, ritch, when you took over, you came in from the international business and i wanted to get a sense from you, if you think that there are any sort of structural changes that are happening in some of these key international markets? be it maybe japan or australia, or india for that matter has talked about unit opens there, that we should be thinking about, the level of comps and unit growth in those markets, we're meeting at a higher level over the kind of the medium term?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
yeah. but as i look across the globe, jared, we still see so much opportunity for continued growth and share gain in that international business. so, while it's grown rapidly, certainly, over the last decade, you're still looking at an international business in total that grows in that kind of low -- market overall that grows in that kind of load-to-mid-single digits. and then, you've got much share gain opportunity as well. our share in the international business in total is significantly less than where we are in the us, today. so, as i look at it now, i still see a significant amount of opportunity to continue to grow the business. we're hitting scale in some of the key markets around the world. if you look at the places where we've been really strong recently, like japan, like india, we're starting to get there. in china, we've started to hit some really nice scale points in some of those markets as well that give us the wherewithal and the ability to invest at a high level in the business, going forward. and then, finally the -- i would just highlight, once again, as we talk about all the time, the growth really comes back to the unit level economics in the business. and while we still got some challenges in a few places around the globe, by and large, the unit-level economics remain really strong across the world and with covid loosening up certainly in some places, not as much in others, as it loosens up, it really gives those franchisees the opportunity to release some of that pent-up demand for unit-level investment in growth.
jared garber -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks for the color.

your next question comes from the line of andrew strelzik with bmo.
andrew strelzik -- bmo -- analyst
hey. good morning. i was hoping you could share some color or maybe some metrics on the frequency in retention of new or lapsed customers that you gained during the pandemic here in the us now that the environment is starting to normalize with the vaccine rollouts, etc? are you see higher retention and the crm initiatives driving frequency the way you would have expected? thanks.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think as we mentioned, you know, in the -- back in february, when we released the fourth quarter, you know, dynamics remained pretty consistent in the first quarter in that. we're getting a lot more of the growth out of retained customers versus newly acquired customers. and again, we've turned down some of the more aggressive promotions, which drive a lot of customer acquisition. what i am pleased to see is that our active loyalty membership continues to grow. and also, we continue to see really strong and steady order frequency among those active loyalty customers. so, strong continued engagement and sales from our existing customers and we've got some opportunities, i think as we look out through the course of the year, to really turn the volume back up on new customer acquisition as well.
stu levy -- executive vice president-chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, when you look at our loyalty numbers over the course of the last year and having not run some of those boost weeks and the things that we've traditionally done to attract new customers, obviously, pleased that the loyalty numbers continue to grow. but when you look at that relative to our sales is that obviously had to come from more repeat business in greater frequency from our core loyalty base.
operator
your next question comes from the line of chris o'cull with stifel.
chris o'cull -- stifel -- analyst
thanks. good morning, guys. ritch, it was my understanding that the carry-out pizza segment overall grew at a pretty healthy pace last year. i'm just curious why you think domino's is struggling to grow that business, especially in light of the system's marketing efforts, not just recently, but over the past few years. and just, the fortressing strategy, curious if you feel like there needs to be any changes in the approach to going after that business?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
so, chris, thanks for the question. we are continuing to grow sales in the carry-out segment. it really is the order counts in the carry-out segment that were under more pressure in q1, and then also, looking back into -- in the last year. so, we still -- we're still capturing growth in that segment, but it's come more from ticket through customers adding more items per order for the first quarter and also back into last year. as i mentioned earlier, we have not been as aggressive in our marketing of the carry-out segment just given some of the challenges around operating in the covid environment, but we see a lot of opportunity as we look across this year to continue to crank that back up. and our new service method of domino's car-side delivery, we see is a critical weapon to do that. we brought that forward to address the safety concerns that customers had around picking up their food in a covid environment, but over the long term, that's really a great tool for us as we compete for carry-out business against the drive-through lanes of other qsr concepts.
stu levy -- executive vice president-chief financial officer
the other thing, just to keep in mind, and this is a very covid unique thing, but, you know, all of that demand that was dine-in for a lot of restaurants, they -- their choice was to figure out how to do carry-out or delivery. so you've got players and carry-out players in delivery that were all still wondering whether they stay there permanently, whether they shift back into dine-in, how they split their dining rooms, etc., but it essentially changes that market in terms of the group of players playing in there, as well, which is one of the reasons you see that increase in the carry-out market size.
chris o'cull -- stifel -- analyst
that's helpful. thanks.

your next question comes from the line of john ivankoe with jp morgan.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi. thank you. the question is on us labor and i would like to ask it, one, in terms of supply chain and your ability to have people that work in the commissaries in sales and also distribution, and if you have a pricing mechanism with the franchisees to cover those costs? i think you're doing commodities, but mention whether you do on labor?
and then, secondly, ritch, something that we've talked about on calls before, things like service levels, you know, with the -- to the us consumer, can you talk about, at the current labor market, is changing some of the service levels, in other words lengthening delivery times that you're kind of seeing the swing -- the pendulum swing in an unfavorable direction and if there's anything you can do there -- continue to improve the service times? i think we used to [technical issues] discuss on a pre-covid basis? thanks.
stu levy -- executive vice president-chief financial officer
yeah, i think, john, i'll grab that. thanks for the question here. let me start on the supply chain side. we don't explicitly price with our franchisees based on a breakdown that says, well, this piece is labor, and this piece is food. and as i've mentioned previously, while we're trying to grow our overall profit dollars for the supply chain business, we're not trying to do it at the expense of our franchisees. we're trying to do it with our franchisees through the overall growth. so, we're absorbing a piece of that labor increase versus passing that automatically through; the same that we do with food cost inflation.
in terms of the store level, certainly, i think everybody right now, you see it in the news everywhere, is challenged from a labor perspective and a hiring perspective. we still believe that at the -- when all is said and done, you've got to be focused on service. service is where you drive your differential customer engagement and drive that loyalty part of -- one of the structural things that we do which helps us from a service perspective because we don't want to take our eye off that ball is fortressing. and we've obviously talked a lot about fortressing, but you get closer to your customers and you have the ability to serve them better. the second thing that we do is i think everybody sees a lot of the technology investments that we make on the front-end. there is a lot that we do on the back-end to try and improve the efficiency of the labor in store, take some of the labor out of stores and enable that same labor to be doing other things. so, whether it's tools related to the make-line or other initiatives that we're doing to try and drive throughput in the stores and trying to reduce the labor required on a daily, hourly basis, they're -- it's at the forefront of everybody's mind right now. but i don't think sacrificing services is the way to do it.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
definitely not. and as stu described, john, some -- a good bit of the work that we're trying to do around tech and around the store operating model is basically to keep drivers moving 100% of the time with the long-term goal that they never get out of their cars [phonetics] or delivering pizzas constantly as opposed to other tasks and other activities, kind of, that they had to perform in the old operating environment.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and if i may? i mean, have the service times materially changed either -- could -- to the customer when they finally order to the time that they get their pizza? and i guess, is that a risk or an opportunity at this point?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
yeah, john, no material change, which for us is not good enough because they've got to get -- they've got to continue to get faster. and so, that's really what we're focused on. we've absorbed the volume without any material change in the service times, but we got to get faster.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan -- analyst
understood. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of david tarantino with baird.
david tarantino -- baird -- analyst
hi. good morning. my question is sort of to do on the capital allocation. now, that you've done your refinancing transaction, i think [technical issues] a lot of excess cash on the balance sheet and you have a big buyback in place. but i guess, i don't want to assume anything. so, could you just kind of walk us through what you're thinking in terms of capital allocation and how quickly you might deploy that cash that you have?
stu levy -- executive vice president-chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, there is no fundamental change to our strategy from a capital allocation perspective and we were pretty upfront about this even as we went through our recapitalization. we will deploy that capital for investments in the business. and then, generally speaking, in one form or another returning that to shareholders over the course of time. but we don't have an intention of sitting long-term with a huge amount of excess cash on the balance sheet.
david tarantino -- baird -- analyst
great. thank you.
stu levy -- executive vice president-chief financial officer

your next question comes from the line of dennis geiger with ubs.
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks for the question. ritch, i wanted to ask a bit more about your comments on taking market share, going forward. and just kind of curious how you're thinking about share gain opportunities in the us this year, and perhaps, over the next few years? and if you care to kind of segment it delivery versus carry-out? stu, i know you kind of mentioned some players are kind of coming in and out of different channels. just kind of any latest thoughts on maybe where that share comes from, whether it's independent and small chains, continues, or if it's larger players? curious about your latest thoughts there.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure, dennis. thanks for the question. i guess i'll start by saying, we're relatively agnostic as to where the share gain comes from. and we see opportunities to continue to take share across the category, and it's why we're so focused on retail sales growth as the key metric, not only because it drives all the economics in our business, but obviously, that's how we ultimately gain market share over time. as i look this year and ongoing, fortressing is going to continue to be a big part of that strategy to gain share as we've talked about in the past. we are still relatively under-penetrated in terms of share in the carry-out business, specifically. and fortressing gives us an opportunity to go out and grab that largely incremental carry-out business.
and then, on the delivery side, we believe that we've got to continue to offer great value to our customers and terrific service to continue to gain share on the delivery side. and we've talked about how fortressing helps that over time. we're going to continue to invest in our technology initiatives and operating practices, procedures to continue to help us do a better job of service with the cust -- with our customers as well. and then you combine that with fantastic unit-level economics, which allow franchisees to invest in the service and a incredible war chest in terms of our advertising fund to go out there and drive customer awareness and acquisition. and we feel like we're in a very strong position to continue to grow.
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
thanks very much.

your next question comes from the line of lauren silberman with credit suisse.
lauren silberman -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks for the question. ritch, appreciate your comment here on the staffing. part of the labor challenge is certainly seeing trends that are in nature [phonetics] given the environment [indecipherable]. how do you think about the longer-term structural headwind given more optionality for delivery drivers, whether that be ridesharing or food delivery, at least a perception that these alternatives could offer a bit more flexibility?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
yeah. lauren, it's a great question, and something we think about a lot is both the availability and the cost of labor. and, in particular, the real pinch point in the business is drivers. so, part of what we're doing and working on is trying to continue to make that a great job with the best economics for drivers, relative to the other alternatives that they have out there. and we've talked about a number of strategies around that. we continue our work around fortressing to give drivers more deliveries per hour, which translates into higher wages. we're working on technology and operating practices that keep drivers in their cars. so, imagine a world where they don't come back into the store. we run the pieces out to their cars and they go and take the next order. so, we're trying to work on those economics for our drivers to keep them busy and earning higher-level wages. and then, also a big part of what makes domino's different and has made us different over time is that being a driver at domino's or -- or a pizza-maker inside the store is an opportunity to become an entrepreneur over time. and so, a big part of our job and our franchisees' job is also is to sell the opportunity going forward, because 90%-plus of them started off as drivers or insiders.
and then, the final thing i'd say about labor that will present an ongoing challenge, not just for domino's but for others across the industry is, the -- just the changes in minimum wage around the country. as that moves differentially from one market to another, certainly, it puts pressures in some places and not in others. and as we operate as a national brand, we always have to take those things into account as we plan our ongoing marketing and promotional calendar over the course of the year.
lauren silberman -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you very much.

your next question comes from the line of chris carril with rbc capital.
chris carril -- rbc capital -- analyst
hi. good morning. ritch, you mentioned the strong pipeline for store openings earlier when discussing the us business. so, can you provide a little bit more detail around the composition of the pipeline? are you seeing a step-up in demand from existing franchisees on the back of the very large increase in average store ebitda that you highlighted earlier? i presume you're also seeing more demand from potential new franchisees as well, so curious to hear more about what the pipeline looks like moving forward.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure. a great question. and it really is -- it's a mix of both. so, certainly, a lot of demand within our existing franchisee base, given the economics of our stores today and also the fact that the stores have gotten a lot busier, that creates a lot of ongoing opportunity for fortressing territories that are operated by existing franchisees.
you've also got here in 2021 some pent-up demand that wasn't satisfied in 2020 as we had so many more restrictions around construction and permitting, and everything else. and then, what you add to that is a healthy number of new franchisees coming into the system every year. and one of the things that makes us a little different from the rest of qsr and of franchising is that those new franchisees all come from within our system, so they could be corporate employees, they could be team members of our franchisees. but we've got a steady pipeline of folks that want to become domino's franchisees who already have the skills necessary and the experience necessary to run our stores.

your next question comes from the line of david palmer with evercore isi.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks. thanks for your comments too on the two-year trends. and i do think it makes sense to track those going forward. perhaps, you could help us think back to 2019 if we're going to look at those two-year trends and compare what you saw back then, what you did back to what you're seeing in terms of your internal plans this year, starting in the second quarter. i know the last year was a weird year in terms of maybe not doing as many boost weeks, and then, of course, the innovation has not been as robust as you might have had been doing, lately, and what we're seeing from your competitors, lately. so, perhaps, you can talk about how much sort of thunder you're going to be making in your business, or in the next few quarters versus what you did in 2019 as a benchmark? thanks.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure, david. we have a -- a lot of things did change in our approach in 2020 relative to what we were doing back in 2019, driven by covid. and i talked about some of those a little bit earlier on the call, some of the things that we kind of turned the volume down on a little bit, with the carry-out business being one of them. you might recall back at the beginning of 2020, we were running advertising on tv called -- a campaign called pie pass, where folks would walk into the store and see their name up on the screen as they pick their pizza, but we had to turn that off immediately when we couldn't allow customers to come into our stores. and then, throughout the remainder of the year, we were developing new, safe service methods for carry-out but we weren't pushing that business as hard as we had pushed, not just in '19, but in the years that -- with the five years or six years that preceded that.
secondly, we turned off the more aggressive promotional weeks that we had typically peppered across the annual calendar. we ran those in '19, we did run those in 2020. so, those may give you a little bit of a sense for some of the things that we -- arrows that we have in the quiver, if you will, that we can bring back and deploy in 2021 as we get to a more normal operating environment. we'll also continue to look at new product development and other relevant news to bring out to the market to attract customers into the brand. we actually did do a little bit of that in 2020 and looking forward to doing some more of that here in 2021.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
so, summing it all up, you could say that it feels like it will be relatively comparable in terms of the energy on boost weeks and innovation, this -- remainder of the year versus 2019, remainder of the year?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
well, we've still got -- david, things are still evolving on a real-time basis. and there's a lot of factors that we bring into play when we think about what we're -- what we're going to deploy going forward. we're certainly still, as not just domino's but across the economy, still riding a bit of the wave of government stimulus. and then, we've still got covid to deal with. we're making good progress with vaccinations across the us, but there is still a lot of work to be done there. so, one of the things that we always look to do and that we have the ability to do here is to be flexible and to be adaptive. and we've got a number of arrows in the quiver, as i mentioned, to drive the business as we look out across the year depending upon how things unfold.

your next question comes from the line of james rutherford with stephens, inc.
james rutherford -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
i wanted to follow up on the comment you made earlier about not seeing sales deterioration in markets that are more fully opened. given there were a lot of puts and takes throughout that first quarter, including weather stimulus and many other factors, can you share anything about more recent trends, given that customers [phonetics] are seeing a real spike in dine-in behavior? and it also puts a little more distance between us and those stimulus checks. and have you seen any impact on your more recent average weekly sales in light of that reopening?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
yeah. james, look, we're not going to comment today on anything post quarter one. but, we did -- during quarter one, as i mentioned a little bit in my prepared remarks, we certainly saw a quarter that was not an even quarter. you had stimulus on the beginning and then the end. and then, you had some rather extreme weather events in certain parts of the country in the middle, and then alongside all of that, you had the country reopening at different speeds all around. so, a lot of moving parts in the first quarter of the business.
we obviously continue to step on top of it, not weekly, but daily and hourly. and we'll have more to share obviously about the second quarter when we get together again in three months.
james rutherford -- stephens, inc. -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of jon tower with wells fargo.
jon tower -- wells fargo -- analyst
[technical issues] the question. just a quick clarification, and then second, a question on clarification. the franchisee ebitda of $177,000 per store, does that include any benefit from government support, like bbb loans? and then, secondarily, following up on the loyalty conversation, with others in the limited-service space kind of adding programs later this year, do you plan to alter some of the new loyalty member acquisition tactics, or perhaps, change the rewards programs to -- some of the rewards themselves to ensure that the high level of engagement you have today doesn't slip?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
hey, jon. on your first question on the $177,000, we don't count any government money in that number, that's the ebitda from running domino's pizza stores. and, you know, as a company, dpz, we didn't take any government money through the course of this -- through the course of the pandemic. and then, our loyalty. the loyalty program has to be a living thing over time. we're a little over five years into our loyalty program. we launched it back in 2015. and so, we are constantly looking at different ways that we can turn the dials on that program to attract customers into the program, to keep them engaged. so constantly thinking about how customers earn and burn points, over time. so, as we -- and we do learn from what we see out there in the marketplace as well as continuing to do an extensive amount of customer research on our own customers. we've been very pleased to see that the active enrollment in that program has continued to grow. so, it's continued to have appeal for new customers coming in. and then, also, as i mentioned earlier, we've been pleased to see that the order frequency of active loyalty members has continued to remain steady. because once you get [phonetics] your program to 27 million active, as we have today, big part of that value comes around -- comes from the -- just the ongoing and continued engagement and frequency of those customers.

your next question comes from the line of andrew charles with cowen.
andrew charles -- cowen -- analyst
great. thank you. ritch, you guys have previously spoken about the ad fund surplus in 2020 from the better-than-expected sales performance that would likely be deployed in 2021. and i recognize that you were on air, 52 weeks last year, and presume will be on 52 weeks this year. but how are you thinking about deploying that surplus across the year, in particular, are you concentrating on 2q and 3q when the toughest compares are lapped?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
andrew, thanks for the question. and you know, i won't comment on quarter-to-quarter and how we're going to deploy it really for competitive reasons, if you will. but, we are in a fortunate position to have a very strong war chest and surplus going into the year. and that gives us an opportunity as we look out across the year and we see what happens with sales trends in the business. it really does allow us to put a little bit more muscle against things when and where we need to.

your next question comes from the line of brett levy with mkm partners.
brett levy -- mkm partners -- analyst
thanks for taking the call. you've talked about -- you've talked a lot on this call and over the years about technology and your innovation. can you give us a little bit more clarity to how much of what you have right now is more about talk and how much we can really start to put into play and drive the -- drive greater efficiencies and show up more in the sales and the operational numbers? obviously, things like nuro are good. they showcase you're forward-looking. but for some, for right now, it's probably not something that's going to be material for some time. just how are you thinking about that framework? thanks.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure. brett, it's a great question and one that when we sit down every year and make our investment decisions around technology, we are [phonetics] always trying to invest against a portfolio both of near-term things that can have immediate value, but then also some of the longer-term investments that may not drive in immediate value, but that we want to make sure that we're out in the forefront on. when i think about the near-term component of that, we've got a significant amount of technology investment that is going to our stores today and improving the efficiency with which we operate our stores. you know, when you think about what some of the kind of the key pinch points or constraints are in the business, right now, it is labor and it is availability, and labor costs, at the store level. so, we're focused on a lot of time and energy on running more efficient stores, such that we can drive higher order accounts and higher sales per labor hour. so, there's a lot of effort there and a number of things that are rolling out through our system today. and then, on the longer term, nuro is a great example of that. we are doing some autonomous deliveries, as we speak, in houston, right now. but it's going to be a while before autonomous delivery is broadly deployed across the domino's system. but we want to make sure that we're investing in learning today. in particular, how the customer will interact with the robot and how the robot will interact with our operations at the stores.
and those are the key learnings that we're trying to drive now such that when we are able to more broadly deploy the technology, we're ready and have a good understanding of how it can impact our business and our customers.
operator
your next question comes from the line of jeffrey bernstein with barclays.
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you very much. i just wanted to ask about unit growth. we know that 2020 was a tough year, ultimately sub-4% versus, i think, your two to three guidance -- two-year to three-year guidance for 6% to 8% growth. it seems that covid caused a one-year setback for you guys and others as well. but i'm just wondering whether there is any lingering effects in terms of sites or i think you mentioned permitting and construction delays. you would think the pent-up demand would be huge and the big uptick in the store level ebitda would obviously help. i'm just wondering whether you think '21, it's reasonable to assume you get back within that range? whether you have any color on the us or, more importantly, on the international? and whether or not that hiring issue comes into play? we know that you're obviously struggling, as everybody is, to hire. i'm wondering whether any franchisees are talking about slowing down growth just because they need to staff those stores. so, whether they have creative ways to get labor in the stores? thank you.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure, jeff. and on the unit growth, yeah, we have already seen an acceleration and the pace. if you look at last year, we had 624 net openings for the year, and if you look in the first quarter of this year, when you look back, trailing four-quarter was 730. so, that pace has already accelerated up by more than 100 units. and when we look at the pipeline in the us and we look at the pipeline in our international markets, we see a really strong pipeline ahead and an opportunity to continue to accelerate that pace of unit opening. the unknown for us as we look out across the year still relates to covid, and you -- you turn the news on, you'll see there are some places around the world where covid is really still raging, and in some places, getting worse. to what extent that impacts our pace of unit growth, we're still monitoring and still have some uncertainty around that.
but the good news for the brand is that the unit economics are incredibly strong. the demand for franchisee investment is there and we expect to continue to see the pace of unit growth accelerate. the final part of your question, you know, was around the staffing, and that's always a challenge. but one that -- yeah, that we and our franchisees feel comfortable that we can manage over time. part of the beauty, particularly as it relates to the us, of opening these new stores is that the majority of these are opening in our -- it -- as part of our fortressing program. and giving us an opportunity to do two things: one is, to shrink the territory, so we can get more deliveries per hour of delivery driver labor, but also you get that incremental carry-out business, which is a much less labor-intensive business for our stores, which is one of the reasons we want to continue to grow and build that business.
stu levy -- executive vice president-chief financial officer
the other thing that i would just add to that is you -- and you've seen the increase in the growth, particularly q4, last year, in terms of new units. there is the unfortunate practical reality of even if you have the ability to grow, you have the demand or desire to grow, just the sheer bandwidth of trying to get that done, you don't -- it -- it just takes a while to make up for what stopped last year. you can't -- our franchisees, our master franchisees internationally, can't just double their numbers because they want to. they need this -- the resources to go build -- at the time to go build it. so, it's going to take a while, while we continue to accelerate. it's going to take some time before we make up for the period of time that we lost last year.

todd brooks -- c.l. king & associates -- analyst
hey. good morning. thanks for squeezing me in. we spent some time on the call talking about arrows in the quiver to kind of drive traffic against this period to tougher compares coming up. we've talked about boost weeks, we talked about focusing on carry-out. i'm wondering, with the incremental advertising dollars that you're carrying into the year, just wondering about anything you can share about shifts and tactics, whether more personalized marketing, more one-to-one marketing, or through crm platforms, really trying to stimulate frequency at the individual level? or more resources going into that versus broader medium and getting the message out that way when you look at kind of the mix of your spend in fiscal '21?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
hey, todd. thanks for the question. and it's something that we think about all the time because the vast majority of the dollars in that advertising fund are franchisees' dollars, so we spend it with great care. and it's one of the areas also -- we talk a lot about how we use analytics to make decisions at domino's. it's an area where we've got terrific analytics in terms of understanding the return on spending those dollars across a range of different channels or opportunities that we have to invest them on the part of our system. and so, we are constantly looking at that and managing the dials to use that investment for the greatest return for our system.

hello, thank you for standing by. and welcome to the q2 2021 domino's, inc. earnings conference call. [operator instructions] after the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, jenny fouracre, investor relations. please go ahead.
jenny fouracre -- director of investor relations
thank you so much, and thanks to everyone for joining us for our conversation today regarding the results of our second quarter 2021.
today's call will feature commentary from chief executive officer, ritch allison and from the office of the cfo, jessica parrish. as this call is primarily for our investor audience, i ask that all members of the media and others be in listen-only mode. i want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in this morning's earnings release and 10-q also apply to our comments on the call today. both of these documents are available on our website. actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. for more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our filings with the sec. in addition, please refer to the 8-k earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures that may be referenced on today's call.
i'll request to our coverage analysts, we would like to accommodate as many of you as time permits. we encourage you to ask only one one-part question on this call, if you could. today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for a replay via the website.
with that, i'd like to turn over the call to our ceo, ritch allison.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
thank you, jenny. and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. overall, i am very pleased with our results this quarter, which once again demonstrated the strength of the domino's brand around the world.
we are still navigating through the covid pandemic across the globe. throughout the last 18 months, our franchisees have continued to step up to the challenge in service to their customers, their communities and their team members. i continue to be extremely proud of our global franchisees and their extraordinary efforts to provide outstanding food through safe and reliable delivery and carryout experiences. you've heard me speak often about the importance of global retail sales growth and how that drives our business model.
during the second quarter, we delivered 17.1% global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, driven by a powerful combination of growth in us same-store sales, international same-store sales and global store counts. the second quarter marked our 41st consecutive quarter of us same-store sales growth and our 110th consecutive quarter of international same-store sales growth. we also reinforced our leadership position in the pizza category with a very strong quarter of global store growth, highlighted by the opening of our 18,000th store. we celebrated this terrific milestone with the opening of a beautiful store in la junta, colorado.
the pace of net store growth has accelerated significantly during the first half of this year. when you look at it on a trailing four-quarter basis, our pace of net store growth is increased from 624 in q4 2020 to 884 in q2 2021. during the quarter, we also completed our $1.85 billion refinancing transaction, lowering the cost of our debt and giving us the capacity to return $1 billion to our shareholders through our recently completed accelerated share repurchase transaction.
overall, the domino's brand continues to deliver, as our strong same-store sales, store growth and resulting retail sales growth deliver great returns to our franchisees and our shareholders.
i'll turn the call over now to jessica parrish, our controller and treasurer. she will take you through the details of the quarter and then after that, i'll come back and share some additional observations about the quarter and some thoughts around how we are approaching the business going forward. jessica, over to you.
jessica parrish -- vice president, corporate controller and treasurer
thank you, ritch, and good morning everyone. we are excited to share our strong second quarter results with you today.
overall, domino's team members and franchisees around the world generated impressive operating results, leading to a diluted eps of $3.06 for q2. our diluted eps as adjusted for certain items related to our recapitalization transaction completed during the quarter with $3.12. in q2, we continued to see positive momentum in both the us and international businesses in both same-store sales performance and net unit growth, leading to strong global retail sales growth.
global retail sales grew 21.6% in q2, as compared to q2 2020. when excluding the positive impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 17.1%. breaking down total global retail sales growth, us retail sales grew 7.4% and international retail sales grew 39.7%. when excluding the positive impact of foreign currency, international retail sales grew 29.5% rolling over a prior year decrease of 3.4%. the prior year decrease in international retail sales, excluding foreign currency resulted primarily from temporary store closures, changes in store hours and service method disruptions in certain international markets as a result of the covid-19 pandemic.
turning to comps, during q2, we continue to lead the broader restaurant industry with 41 straight quarters of positive us comparable sales and 110 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. same-store sales in the us grew 3.5% in the quarter lapping a prior-year increase of 16.1%. same-store sales for our international business grew 13.9% rolling over a prior year increase of 1.3%. breaking down the us comp, our franchise business was up 3.9% in the quarter, while our company-owned stores were down 2.6%. as we noted on our q1 call, we continue to observe a larger spread between the top line performance of our franchise stores and our company-owned stores than we have historically seen.
we believe this is primarily a function of the heavily urban and higher income footprint of our company-owned store markets relative to the more diverse mix across our franchise space. the us comp this quarter was driven by ticket growth due to increases in items per order in our transparent delivery fee as well as the mix of products we sell. order count on a same store basis were consistent with q2 2020 levels, which were higher than q2 2019 levels, as a result of customer ordering behavior during the pandemic. the international comp was driven by order growth due to the return of non-delivery service methods, the resumption of normal store hours and the reopening of stores that were temporarily closed in certain of our international markets in q2 2020.
shifting to unit count, we and our franchisees added 35 net stores in the us during the second quarter, consisting of 39 store openings and foreclosures. our international business added 203 net stores comprised of 217 store openings and 14 closures. turning to revenues and operating margins. total revenues for the second quarter were up approximately $112.4 million or 12.2% over the prior year quarter. the increase was driven by higher global retail sales, which generated higher revenues across all areas of our business. changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted our international royalty revenues by $4 million in q2 2021 as compared to the prior year quarter.
our consolidated operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 39.5% in q2 2021 from 38.8% in the prior year, due primarily to higher revenues from our us franchise business. company-owned store margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 24.5% from 23.1% primarily as a result of lower labor costs, partially offset by higher food costs. recall that we incurred additional bonus pay in the second quarter of last year for team members on the front lines during the covid-19 pandemic.
supply chain operating margin as a percentage of revenues decreased to 11% from 11.9% in the prior year quarter, resulting primarily from higher insurance and food costs, as well as higher fixed operating costs driven by depreciation and our new supply chain facilities opened last year. these increases were partially offset by lower labor costs. g&a expenses increased approximately $12.3 million in q2 as compared to q2 2020, resulting from higher labor costs, including higher variable performance-based compensation and non-cash compensation expense, partially offset by lower professional fees.
additionally, as we discussed on our q1 call, we completed our most recent recapitalization transaction during the second quarter in april. in connection with the recapitalization, we incurred approximately $500,000 of pre-tax g&a expenses for certain professional fees, which is included as an item affecting comparability in this morning's earnings release. net interest expense increased approximately $6.7 million in the quarter, driven by a higher average debt balance. this increase in interest expense also includes $2.3 million of pre-tax incremental interest related to the recapitalization transaction, which has been adjusted out as an item affecting comparability in this morning's earnings release.
our weighted average borrowing rate for q2 2021 was 3.8%, down from 3.9% in q2 2020. our effective tax rate was 19.6% for the quarter as compared to 4.7% in q2 2020. the effective tax rate in q2 2021 includes a 2.3 percentage point positive impact from tax benefits on equity-based compensation. this compares to an 18.5 percentage point positive impact in q2 2020. this decrease was due to significantly fewer stock option exercises in q2 of this year. we expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to these equity-based compensation tax benefits.
combining all of these elements, our second quarter net income was down $2 million or 1.7% versus q2 2020. on a pre-tax basis, we were up $20.6 million or 16.5% over the prior year. our diluted eps in q2 was $3.06 versus $2.99 in the prior year. our diluted eps as adjusted for the impact of the recapitalization transaction was $3.12, an increase of $0.13 or 4.3% over the prior year. breaking down that $0.13 increase in our diluted eps as adjusted, most notably, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.53, net interest expense adjusted for the impact of the items affecting comparability i discussed previously negatively impacted us by $0.08, a lower diluted share count driven by share repurchases over the trailing 12 months benefited us by $0.12, and finally our higher effective tax rate, resulting from a lower tax benefits on equity based compensation negatively impacted us by $0.44.
shifting to cash, our strong financial model continue to generate significant cash flow throughout the second quarter. during q2, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $143 million. after deducting for capex, we generated free cash flow of approximately $126 million. regarding our capital expenditures, we spent approximately $17 million on capex in q2, primarily on our technology initiatives, including our next-generation point-of-sale system.
as previously disclosed, during q2, we also entered into an accelerated share repurchase transaction for $1 billion. we received and retired approximately 2 million shares at the beginning of the asr. the asr settled yesterday and we received a retired an additional 238,000 shares in connection with this transaction. in total, the average repurchase price throughout the asr program was $444.29 per share.
additionally, and as noted in this morning's earnings release, subsequent to the end of the quarter, our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $1 billion of our common stock. we also paid a $0.94 quarterly dividend on june 30. subsequent to the end of the quarter, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.94 per share to be paid on september 30.
in closing, our business continued its strong performance during the second quarter and we are very pleased with the results our franchisees and team members around the world delivered. thank you all for joining the call today. and now, i will turn it back over to ritch.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
thanks, jessica. and i'll begin my comments with a look at our us business. for months now, many of you have been asking how we would lap the tough comparisons from q2 of last year. my answer has always been that we're not focused on managing to a 12-week quarter. we are focused on building the business for the long term and that long-term focus on great product, service, image and technology is precisely why we were able to deliver a terrific quarter, highlighted by 7.4% us retail sales growth, lapping 19.9% from q2 2020.
turning to same-store sales, perhaps the thing i'm most pleased about when i look at the 3.5% us comp is the fact that we were able to hold orders flat while overlapping the big gains from q2 2020. i'm also pleased that our ticket growth was driven by a very healthy balance of more items per order and modest menu price and delivery fee increases. we achieved positive comps in both our delivery and carryout businesses, with delivery driven by ticket and carryout driven by a balance of order count and ticket growth.
we continue to see strong growth across our business in the quarter. you've often asked, if our sales growth might be weaker in markets that had more fully reopened, but to the contrary, the opposite trend emerged through the second quarter where we saw higher levels of sales growth in the second quarter in the markets with fewer covid-related restrictions. similar to q1, we saw the comp growth in rural areas outperformed urban areas, and less affluent areas outperformed more affluent areas. these differences, combined with the impact of more aggressive fortressing, accounted for much of the same-store sales gap between our corporate store and franchise store businesses.
we saw sales benefits during the quarter from the federal government stimulus, particularly the checks that we delivered back in march. it's difficult to quantify the magnitude of the impact of the one-time distributions and the ongoing unemployment and other government payments to consumers, but we believe that they do continue to have some positive sales impact on our business.
due to the strong sales throughout the quarter, we once again elected not to run any of our aggressive boost week promotions, but instead remain focused on providing great service and offering great value to our customers every day. as we continue to experience covid overlaps, we believe it will be instructive to continue to look at the cumulative stack of comparable us same-store sales anchored back to 2019 as a pre-covid baseline.
at 19.6% for q2, we saw a material sequential improvement of the two-year stack when compared to the first quarter. beyond the comps, when you look at the absolute dollars, our second quarter same store average weekly unit sales in the us exceeded $27,000, another sequential uptick from the levels seen in the first quarter.
now turning to the other critical component of our retail sales growth, new store openings, our addition of 35 net stores was softer than we expected. we have a very strong pipeline of future openings, but had a number of stores delayed due to store level staffing challenges and construction, permitting or equipment delays. we hope to accelerate the pace of openings during the second half of the year as some of the delays in unit growth may subside.
i'll turn and speak now about the carryout and the delivery businesses. we saw the return of carryout order growth in q2 and we continue to build awareness of domino's car-side delivery. we ran a brief 49% off car-side delivery awareness campaign during the quarter and just recently launched a campaign highlighting our car side delivery 2-minute guarantee. this campaign hits on two key elements of the domino's brand, service and value. our franchisees and operators have fully embraced car side delivery and we are consistently averaging below 2 minutes out the door and on our way to the customer's cars.
this is a great technology enabled way to serve our customers and will remain an important part of our strategy as we continue to evolve the carryout experience, not only to enhance the loyalty of our current carryout customers, but also to reach a new different and largely untapped drive-through oriented customer going forward. for the delivery business, i was also very pleased to see positive delivery same-store sales growth during q2, while facing very difficult overlaps. we brought back the noise to highlight our partnership with nuro for autonomous delivery. this campaign hits on our technology and innovation leadership, while having a little bit of fun with our old nemesis, the noid. we continue to learn as we pilot a true autonomous pizza delivery experience to select customers in the houston market.
now turning to staffing, i'll reiterate something i said back in april. we continue to operate in a very difficult staffing environment for our stores and our supply chain centers. the combination of covid, strong sales, the accelerating economic growth across the country and the ongoing government stimulus continue to result in one of the most difficult staffing environments that we've seen in a long time. and frankly, this led to higher margins in our corporate store business than we would like to see. the reality is that we were operating during the quarter with fewer team members than we would like to have in many of our stores. this puts pressure on our operators to meet demand, while continuing to deliver great service.
in the back half of the year, we expect to implement additional wage increases across certain corporate store markets and positions. in the face of these challenges, i want to thank our us franchisees and our corporate store operators for their ongoing efforts to attract and retain great team members in a very tight labor market. and as we look forward in the us business, we will continue to make the necessary investments to drive retail sales growth into the future. we recently announced our plans to build another supply chain center in indiana, which we expect to complete by the end of 2022.
we are making solid progress on the rewrite of our pos point-of-sale system and we'll continue that multiyear investment, along with additional investment in our enterprise systems to support the business. we will continue to invest in technology, operations and product innovation to support our carryout and our delivery businesses. we are continuing to raise wages and invest in our hourly team members and of course as always we will remain focused on value for our customers.
so i'll close out our discussion of the us business by simply saying that the domino's brand has never been stronger and i remain confident in our ability to drive sustainable long-term growth.
now let's move on to international. it was an outstanding quarter of performance for our international business. our 29.5% international retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact was supported by an exceptional 13.9% comp, continuing the momentum we had in the first quarter. as i discussed earlier with our us business, we're also watching the two-year comp stacks for international, anchoring back to pre-covid 2019 and we'll continue to do so throughout 2021.
q2 represented a 15.2% two-year stack, a sequential improvement over the first quarter. i'm particularly pleased with our strong momentum on store growth as international provides a significant push toward our two to three-year outlook of 6% to 8% global net unit growth. our 203 net stores in q2 increased our trailing four quarter pace of international store growth to 653 net stores. our accelerated store growth continues to be driven by our outstanding unit level economics and the strong commitment of our international master franchise partners.
during the quarter, covid continue to have a significant impact on many of our international markets and we expect covid to remain a challenge in many parts of the world for some time to come. at the end of the quarter, we had fewer than 175 temporary store closures, with many of those located in india, which has been hit particularly hard by covid. and i want to take a minute here to thank jubilant foodworks, our master franchisee in india for their outstanding commitment to their team members during this very difficult time.
the company mounted a series of initiatives to support their employees and families through this unprecedented crisis. this included a cross-functional team that provided employee assistance 24/7 as well as several covid isolation centers with oxygen concentrator banks. jubilant mounted a massive vaccination drive for all of their employees and dependent family members. challenging times always bring out the best in domino's franchisees and i could not be more proud of our leaders in india and how they have responded to this crisis.
i'd also like to highlight a few international markets that drove terrific growth during the quarter. china passed the 400 store milestone during q2 and once again dash, our master franchise partner delivered outstanding retail sales growth for the brand. china is without question, one of the most exciting businesses in the domino's system with significant long-term runway for growth. japan reached the 800 store milestone in the weeks following the close of our second quarter and continued the outstanding performance under master franchisee domino's pizza enterprises ownership. the uk, germany, mexico and turkey were also large market highlights in a strong quarter of performance across our international business.
i am proud of our master franchisees and their operators for their great work thus far in 2021, and i remain optimistic about our international retail sales growth opportunity over the long term. so in closing, i'm very happy with our q2 results. great franchisees and operators, combined with outstanding unit level economics place us in an enviable position within our industry and give us a strong foundation for future growth. there is absolutely no question that domino's is the global leader in qsr pizza, but there is still so much opportunity ahead of us to drive global retail sales growth and to grow market share around the world in both our delivery and carryout businesses.
as we look to the back half of the year and beyond, you can be confident that we will remain focused on winning the long game. so thank you again for joining us today. and we'll now be happy to take some of your questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from brian bittner with oppenheimer and company. you may proceed with your question.
brian bittner -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thanks, good morning, congratulations. rich, you highlighted the importance of paying attention to the two-year same-store sales trend both in the press release and on this earnings call and that trend obviously accelerated meaningfully in the second quarter. is taking this two-year trend relevant in your mind for the rest of the year, including the fourth quarter because sustaining it would imply a pretty big jump in the one-year same-store sales in the fourth quarter and i just think in general, folks remain a bit confused how this accelerated business performance that domino's is generating is able to occur in this reopening environment. you actually suggested that more reopened footprints are outperforming. so can you just put some insights into the core drivers of this dynamic that you're seeing within your business?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure, brian. thanks, thanks for the question. and we do feel that it's instructive to take a look at the business comparing back to that pre-covid anchor if you will of 2019, because there is so many dynamics that have occurred over the last 18 months that for us as we look at the business internally and we think instructive for our investors as well, really understanding what is that longer-term trend in the growth in the business is important. we're not, i mean, we're not making any statements or projections today about the third or fourth quarters of this year.
just merely sharing with you how those trends are unfolding on a quarter-to-quarter basis because there's still so many factors there that are driving the business, obviously those things that we have under our control, but there are also many factors externally outside of our control that are difficult to predict. what happens with as covid continues to unfold, with the delta variant for example, what happens with respect to ongoing government stimulus and intervention in the economy. all of those things will continue to play a factor as we look at what happens with comps and what that resulting one and two-year comp profile looks like over time.
you asked about the dynamics going on in markets that are reopening. like many of you, we've obviously been watching very studiously you know what happens as some of these markets around the country reopening. i think it's important to remember that our business, it's a delivery business, but it's also a very robust carryout business. and so when markets closed down and i've talked about this several times over the last year, it had a negative impact on our carryout business. so as we see markets reopen, we get some positive tailwind on the carryout business and then also our -- for our delivery business, the fact that we've been able to stay very focused on value for our customers, we saw a positive comp in the second quarter on the delivery business as well even though markets had reopened.
so we'll keep track in the one and two-year basis looking across both of those businesses and as the year unfolds on a quarterly, quarterly basis will continue to share those insights back with you.
brian bittner -- oppenheimer -- analyst

thank you. our next question comes from peter saleh with btig. you may proceed with your question.
peter saleh -- btig -- analyst
great. thanks. ritch, i wanted to ask about the competitive environment now that it seems like the economy is somewhat reopened or mostly reopened. how do you feel the competitive environment is looking right now, especially with respect to independents. do you feel like independents are stronger today or weaker post-covid, just trying to get a sense on, if you feel like you guys are taking share from independents or where those market share gains are coming from. thanks.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure. thanks, thanks, peter. yeah, it's still, as the market continues to unfold here, there's still a lot of moving parts and so we're always a little careful to make definitive statements about market share movements until we see a few quarters behind us, but at least some of the indications that we have now are that the larger chains are driving most of the growth in the pizza category right now, with independents kind of more flat to down. so, best we can tell, growing market with share being gained by the larger chains and certainly as the largest chain, we are taking some of that share.
peter saleh -- btig -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from john glass of morgan stanley. you may proceed with your question.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks very much. ritch, i wanted to go back to your comments about the labor in the wage environment. when you talked about how much you're taking some pricing yourself at company stores maybe what that is to contextualize that? and how are franchisees managing that? you said they're taking moderate amounts of pricing or there is moderate amount of pricing in your -- maybe it's your company comps may be assumed that's the franchise as well. does that open the conversation about what the price point should be at domino's given this unique market environment? you're sort of locked into these 5.99, 7.99 [phonetic] price points, is there more friction around that conversation, given the cost of labor and if there is, how do you, how do you answer that question the franchisees might ask about pricing.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure. thanks, john. and this is certainly something that we think about all of the time. to the first part of your question, yes, most certainly, when we look at the labor and the wage environment, wages are only going in one direction over time and that is, that is up. some of that obviously is dictated by some of the minimum wage changes that are happening, another round of which occurred in -- here in july, but also just the general supply and demand equation in the labor market is causing wages to go up, and we're certainly continuing to invest more in our hourly team members, in our corporate store business to make sure that we can remain staffed and serve our customers.
when we think about how do we offset those wage increases and still deliver a terrific four-wall economic model, pricing is certainly one of the levers that is out there. and at the local level, we do this in our corporate stores and our franchisees have, they have the latitude to do this for their businesses. we have taken some increases in our single transparent delivery fee. we charge, wherever we are, we charge a single fee, it varies significantly market to market based on the local dynamics, but that's certainly a lever that we and our franchisees have pulled. and then menu pricing. our franchisees have control of that and in the higher wage markets, you will find higher menu prices at -- generally higher menu prices at domino's.
as it relates to the national offers, our 5.99 and 7.99 hero offers. we continue to test those on a very frequent basis, not just looking at which offers would drive the most top line but more importantly, what's going to drive the strongest four-wall ebitda for our stores and 5.99 and 7.99 have continued to emerge from the many, many offers that we test on a frequent basis. but what i will tell you is, if we find an offer or if the dynamics change such that a different offer drives higher levels of profit for our franchisees then we would move to that offer. 5.99 and 7.99 are not sacred.
the only thing it is sacred is that we're going to bring value to the consumer because that's what drives order counts and ultimately order counts over time are correlated with sales and with profitability at the store level. so, something we are always looking at, john and always talking to our franchisees about.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jared garber with goldman sachs. you may proceed with your question.
jared garber -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, thanks for -- thanks for the question. it's a little bit of a follow-up on some of the previous questions as it relates maybe to the competitive landscape. we've seen a little bit more menu innovation maybe some -- from some of the large direct pizza lsr competitors recently and maybe over the last six months or so, and i think the consumer is seemingly willing to, to pay more for some offers now and for some more maybe surprise and delight. so i wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about menu innovation going forward. obviously like the operations and the simplicity of everything makes sense from a franchisee economics perspective, but wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about innovation from here.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure, jared. appreciate the question. we're -- our overall philosophy and approach really, really hasn't changed around menu innovation. we are, we are constantly testing a robust pipeline of new products and platforms for the menu, but we hold to a pretty high standard in terms of what ultimately gets on our menu, because we're not, not just looking to put things on the menu to drive sales for a limited amount of time, so that you don't see us to use ltos and you shouldn't expect to see us using those into the future.
we are looking for products that can drive incrementality in revenue and in profit. so we test products not only for where they would mix on the menu, but more importantly, once you take into effect a potential cannibalization from other menu items, are we delivering incremental revenue and profit at the store level. you asked a little bit about premium and customers willing to pay more. when we introduced our two new specialty pizzas, the chicken taco and the cheeseburger, those were all about bringing some more premium products to that specialty line, which gives the franchisee an opportunity for some incremental revenue over and above our more traditional products that are offered on the 5.99 menu.
so we'll continue to look for opportunities there and when we introduce something like those two specialty pizzas, it's not just to drive sales of those two pizzas but we also see that that elevate sales of the specialty line in general, which is a more premium line. so as we look forward, you should expect to see us continue to roll out new products. as has been the past, you probably won't see us rolling them out or as fast or a significant quantity as some of the other players in the industry, simply because we've just got a different strategy in terms of how we look at it and i suspect it goes without saying, but a big part of that strategy is also just managing the level of change and complexity on our operators in our 6,000 plus stores across the country.
jared garber -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks, ritch. appreciate the color.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from andrew strelzik with bmo. you may proceed with your question.
andrew strelzik -- bmo -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking the question. i'm curious how your conversations more broadly are going with franchisees at the moment. i guess it wouldn't surprise me kind of going into this period against the tough compares, there was maybe a little bit of uncertainty among the us franchisees but now obviously that you're demonstrating the performance against those comparisons, i'm just curious how those conversations are unfolding? has it kind of unlocked anything with respect to the development pipeline or anything else with those conversations.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure, sure. thanks for the question. and it's, it's something that we've -- we're always actively engaged in discussions with our franchisees and those relationships and frankly one of the best things about the second quarter from -- for myself personally is that i've been out on the road a lot, out in stores and visiting with our franchisees as we've gotten ourselves vaccinated and are able to get out there and interact a lot more. and franchisees, i think certainly pleased with the top line growth that we've seen in the business and the fact that we've seen the sustained levels of sales that we've had here in -- here in the first and second quarters of the year.
you won't be surprised, because franchise -- to hear that franchisees are as -- just as we are concerned about staffing, about labor rates and where those are going over time, thinking about commodity costs and where those are going, all the things that you would expect restaurant operators to be concerned about. but when we take a look at the business in total, the four-wall economics of the business are still incredibly strong, the cost of entry or what it takes to get a domino's pizza opened relative to other qsr is still very modest. so the cash on cash returns in the business are still very strong. and that's really what drives the appetite for development.
so i still see a strong appetite for development and that's not just true in the us business, but it's around the globe and really kind of tying back to some of the comments i made earlier on this call, the real gating factor right now in terms of getting stores open is not the desire to do so. it is some of those other factors around staffing and just having teams ready to be in those stores day one, when they open, given some of the labor constraints. but also we have seen some continued delays in construction and permitting and then also just in some specific equipment categories that go into our stores. you probably won't be surprised to hear that there are still some significant supply chain disruptions out there and some of those have hit some of the equipment that we use to build out a domino's pizza store.
andrew strelzik -- bmo -- analyst
okay, thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from chris o'cull with stifel. you may proceed with your question.
chris o'cull -- stifel -- analyst
thanks. ritch, just a follow-up on the labor side. is the company able to monitor franchisee staffing levels? and what's the company doing to kind of help franchisees with staffing, so that it doesn't become a service issue?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure, chris. we don't monitor our franchisee staffing levels or really have any say or direction in what they do with their own people outside of the brand standards. so what we try to do is lead by example with what we do inside our corporate store businesses. and so that -- one of the most important things about running corporate stores is that we're out there across the country feeling exactly what our franchisees are feeling. and so when they're feeling pinched on staffing and wages and other things, we feel it in our own business as well. and it allows us to maintain a level of alignment that it's just impossible to have if you've sold all your corporate stores over time.
and so we communicate what we're doing in the corporate store business and do our best to lead by example with respect to the things that we're trying to do around hiring and wages and other things that we've got going on out there in the marketplace. but ultimately, they're going to make their decisions about how they choose to pay and staff their stores.
chris o'cull -- stifel -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from john ivankoe with jp morgan. you may proceed with your question.
john ivankoe -- jp morgan -- analyst
hi. first, just, i guess a topic i'd like to address, not really a question, and secondly a question. first, ritch, i mean could you address some of the senior level turnover that you've seen, i mean it has been fairly chunky. i mean it kind of came at a wave more or less and maybe some of the challenges but also opportunities that that may bring as you kind of think about the domino's over the next five to 10 years. so that's i guess is the first topic would be great to address.
and then secondly, your app, it gives you a lot of data that i mean others would love to have and some of that data may show customers that abandon their orders once they see a delivery time that has got to be quite long. talk about how much of an issue that's become and if there is a way for you to think like how much sales you could actually recapture or i guess in this case, actually grow if you were to get service levels materially down, which i assume would come through increase delivery driver staffing. thanks.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure, john. that's good creativity around a topic and a question since we said one question. so bravo! to address the first topic. we've had, we've had some turnover among the management team. but what i can tell you is that also creates opportunity for great leaders that we've had on the bench and who are ready to step up and take -- and really take things to the next level. so as i look across our team and that's not just the direct reports to myself, but also as i look broadly across our senior management team within the company, we've never been stronger than we are today.
we like -- i'm sure some others out there, we've still got a few positions that we still need to fill. but when i look across, i feel very good about the leadership team at domino's pizza, and i don't think we could deliver the kind of results that we've been delivering if we didn't have -- didn't have a great -- a great leadership team. the second question around taking a look at service and what we're seeing there in the business. with the challenges that we've had in staffing, we haven't made the service gains and improvements that i would like to see here in 2021 and you know we've slipped a minute or two in some places with respect to the average times in terms of getting food to our customers and that is a big area of focus for us as we look going forward.
we know, because we've got all the data, as you referenced. we know that when our mean delivery times get better and when our standard deviations around delivery times get tighter, we get more sales -- delivery sales per household for those customers that are in our delivery areas. so there is clearly an opportunity to continue to grow delivery by driving those service times down. some of that will come from getting our staffing levels back to where we need them to be. but also i can tell you we are spending a lot of time looking at how we can get more efficient in our stores. and frankly, how we can deliver those -- deliver, better delivery times with the same or in some cases even fewer drivers.
some of that is examining all of the wasted time that we have. if we want to be as efficient as we can possibly be then a driver should never get out of his or her car and should spend all of their time getting pizzas to customers. so we're trying to take some of those other things out, some of those other tasks, some of those things that drive efficiencies, so that we can keep the drivers moving. that's better for the customer in terms of delivery times, but it's also a lot better for the drivers, if we can get more deliveries per driver per hour that means more tips for those drivers and we know that when they are higher wages, their retention rates get better for us also. so we're working on all of those things, john to try to continue to drive improvements in service because we know what the value of that is over time.

thank you. our next question comes from david tarantino with baird. you may proceed with your question.
david tarantino -- baird -- analyst
hi, good morning. i was wondering, ritch, if you could comment on where the us businesses in terms of carryout sales relative to where you were pre-pandemic. and then in particular i guess a related question would be, what do you think this car side delivery option is doing for you in terms of growing that business and the opportunity going forward.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
great, david, thanks. and if you take a look at where carryout is and yeah, the most important metric that we look at around it is, what's, where are we in terms of carryout orders per store. and basically when we take a look at the q2, we were pretty well back to where we were in 2019 on carryout orders, slightly positive, lot of benefit in ticket growth that we've seen in carryout really driven by customers ordering more product per order. but we did see in the second quarter that we got back to the pre-covid levels in terms of orders.
in terms of the mix of our business, when you look at carryout orders versus delivery orders, we're still a little bit below where we were pre-covid and that's really driven by the fact that our delivery order counts on a two-year basis are significantly higher than they were back in 2019. so what i would say is that we are in kind of the first phase of that carryout order count growth resurgence that we've been thinking about and forecasting every while internally.
car side delivery, for us it's something that was on -- it was, it was on our work plan even before covid hit because we were looking at car side delivery really as the way at domino's to compete for that drive-through customer. now when covid hit, we kind of reshuffled our work plan and pulled all of that forward to get it rolled out more quickly because it also provides a safe and contactless experience for the customer, which became so important during covid. but we look at car side as a fantastic way to compete against the drive-through because while we've got pickup windows in a number of our stores out there, the reality is we're never going to get to 100% pickup windows in domino's pizza stores. and so we've got to have a way to get the product out to the customer.
i have been incredibly pleased with our franchisees in how they have embraced this, in particular leading up to now, during our 2-minute guarantee that we're running on tv, we're averaging well below 2 minutes across our system of getting those pizzas out the door and i don't know -- i don't know david if you sat in the drive-through line recently but i've sat at some qsrs for 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes and if you can pull into our order ahead, pull into our parking lot and we can get that pizza in your car in 2 minutes. i think that's a great customer experience.
and then for us another fantastic benefit of car side is the fact that these orders are they are pre-ordered digitally and they are prepaid. so pre-ordering digitally allows us to drive a higher ticket because we do a much better job of driving ticket for those digital orders because we've got all the technology built in there based on the a/b testing and everything else we do to give the customer a great experience and make sure they get in their basket the things that they would enjoy that even for dinner. and then on the prepayment, that's also great for us as well because it shortens the transaction time in the store and lets us get the customer out the door faster and using less -- less labor. and the digital obviously also gives us an opportunity then to invite those customers into our loyalty program.
so, early stages of car side. but i'm really happy with the adoption across the system and what this could mean for us as we continue to compete for more occasions with our consumers.
david tarantino -- baird -- analyst
great, thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from dennis geiger with ubs. you may proceed with your question.
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks. ritch wanted to ask you a little bit more about customer loyalty and then new customer acquisition that you're seeing and then how you're thinking about the go forward from here? maybe if you could talk a little more about the opportunities that you have to continue to attract new customers and also keep those that you have gained over the last, let's say 15 months or so. i'm sure it's a bunch of things but any thoughts around kind of what factors are most important for this if it's that service level opportunity that you mentioned, if it's new menu items, value, boost weeks, just curious how you -- what you're seeing and how you think about the opportunity? thank you.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure, sure. happy to -- happy to touch on that. as you take a look really over the course of the last year or so, the bulk of the growth in our business really has come from existing customers and that customer retention and purchase frequency and even more concentrated within our loyalty customer base that 27 plus million active loyalty members that we have at domino's. so i'm really pleased with what we've been able to do as the pandemic has unfold -- unfolded in terms of driving customer retention, staying relevant and keeping those orders, that order frequency up over time.
when i look forward, i think we do have more opportunities to continue to prime the pump further around customer acquisition. some of the most important tools that we've used historically to do that have been some of these periodic boost weeks that we've used and we haven't run any of those for quite some time. so that's certainly an arrow in the quiver that we have going forward. product introductions, certainly another opportunity to invite new customers in and we do have some robust products in the pipeline. so you should expect to see some news from us on that in the quarters to come as another potential opportunity.
and then what i would tell you also just kind of underlying all this, it's not a specific action or a catalyst for driving customer acquisition but i fundamentally believe that staying focused on value is perhaps our greatest customer acquisition vehicle over time because as you see prices being raised significantly at a number of other restaurant chains around the country and as we start to see some of this government stimulus come away as we go into the back half of this year, i think it's going to be really important for the families that we serve to stay focused on value, and i think that's always a consistent message from us and an opportunity to continue to bring new customers in the fold.
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks, ritch.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from lauren silberman with credit suisse. you may proceed with your question.
lauren silberman -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks for the question. so within the context of the current labor environment, can you talk about some of the in-store technology or back of house technology that you are testing or recently launched to enhance the in-store operating model? and then related, digital represents 75% of sales, now increased about 5% each year over the last several years. so how are you thinking about how high that penetration can go? could it be 90%, 95% just given some of the labor benefits?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
thanks, lauren. first on the labor environment, we are absolutely working on technologies and operating procedures to help us run our stores more efficiently, and with less labor. one of those, i spoke about earlier as it relates to our delivery drivers, which is that we're trying to take a lot of things off of their plates that cause them to do anything other than being in a car, delivering a pizza or on a bike, delivering a pizza to a customer. so an example of that is that -- that drove me crazy for years was pre-folding boxes, which was often a task that delivery drivers did. we've made enormous strides within our system and now have more than 2,000 of our stores in the us that no longer pre-fold boxes.
so that's taken work out of the store and by the way, it also makes for a much cleaner and better looking store as well. other things that we've been working on, we've rolled out our gps software out to our stores and it's in the hands of our drivers on their smartphones. that allows drivers to get proficient much more quickly. in the old way at domino's, a driver might take two, three months to learn the delivery area. but with the gps capability that we have, we can do a better job of routing and getting drivers to their -- to the location that they're headed to.
we're working on other things as well around how we schedule and staff the stores using machine-learning to really help us do a better job of predicting what our sales are going to be and therefore more appropriately matching the number of team members at the store at the times when we need them. so lot going on there. your second around digital. yes, around 75% of sales. how high is high? i don't know, but i know it's higher than 75%. the benchmark that we use in the domino's world to kind of inspire everybody else is china where more than -- more than 19 out of every 20 orders come in through digital channels. so that's really the inspiration for us. so i guess until we get close to 100%, i'm not going to stop pushing.
lauren silberman -- credit suisse -- analyst
great, thanks so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from chris carril with rbc capital markets. you may proceed with your question.
chris carril -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great, thank you. so returning to the [technical issues] thoughts on the third party and perhaps in light of the reopening and the gradual return of in-restaurant dining [technical issues]
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
hey chris, there is kind of static on your line.
chris carril -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
is that better?
jessica parrish -- vice president, corporate controller and treasurer
yeah.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
yeah, that's better. we couldn't hear anything you were saying.
chris carril -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
sorry about that. so i guess just returning to the theme of competition, ritch, just curious to get your latest thoughts on third-party delivery competition and your latest thoughts on how the shifting dynamics around the reopening will drive the next phase of delivery competition just more broadly, that would be great. thanks.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure. first on third-party, i mean i don't think there's any question at this point that third-party delivery is here to stay. you can pretty well get any type of food delivered anywhere in the country and frankly now broadly just about across anywhere in the world today. so we don't think that competition is going away. and in fact, in many ways, we look at that as our primary competitive set. as the leader in the pizza category, obviously we still continue to look at the pizza competition but frankly, the biggest competition over the long term for us in delivery is that third-party aggregator channel.
so when i think about what we've got to do, let's say. so let's assume regardless of where their economics sit today, we believe they're going to be here for the long haul. so we have to continue to make sure that we are the best value both for the consumer and for the restaurant operator. so we continue to believe that our owned fleet for us in our corporate stores and for our franchisees and their stores, having our own delivery drivers running point to point back and forth to the store, we continue to believe that's the most efficient operating model and gets even more efficient as we continue to fortress our markets.
and so having that very efficient model is important in order to put us in a position to continue to offer a very competitive delivery fee and overall value proposition to the customer. we also believe that the fact that we use a single transparent delivery fee we think over time is an important competitive advantage when i was a third party delivery, i have to really get my calculator out to figure out what i've actually paid to have that food delivered because maybe i got a discount on the delivery fee. but maybe i paid a service fee, maybe i paid a small order fee, maybe i have paid a fee, because i happen to be in a city where they were charging an incremental city fee.
we very much believe around a single transparent delivery fee over time we think will be important to customers. and then back on the other side of the equation, staying is the best value for the restaurant operator. we charge for a digital order, we charge our franchisees just a little bit over 1% of ticket that $0.275 digital order fee. that is so much lower than what you're going to see in terms of what the third parties are charging restaurants out there. so we think that gives us a competitive advantage in terms of continuing to make sure that we've got great four-wall economics for our operators because that's the only way we grow the business over time and they open more stores is if the four-wall economics, continue to be strong.
so i think you know, chris, we don't exactly know yet how all this ultimately shakes out and what all of the dynamics that may shift over time, but we're really focused on maintaining a competitive position with both of those groups to customers and the restaurant operators.
chris carril -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great, thank you. appreciate all that detail.
operator
thank you. and our last question comes from david palmer with evercore isi. you may proceed with your question.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks. i think this one touches on some of the things you've been talking about with regard to third party delivery, but you mentioned sales trends were best in less affluent and less dense population areas and i wonder if you could give us your best thinking about why that might be? and in your answer, if you could really touch on the influence of third-party delivery's competition and i don't want to leave the witness too much but i'm, but i'm thinking that their restaurants and the third party players themselves may be passing along particularly rapid menu price inflation lately, which is perhaps less accepted in the less affluent areas and that third-party may also be pulling back in service levels in these less profitable low density markets. but i'm just guessing there and you might have better data on this. thanks.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure, sure, david. thank you. i think, if we start with less affluent versus more affluent. yeah, i think certainly to the extent that these third-party delivery fees get more complex and increase over time that less affluent customer is absolutely going to feel more of a pinch on that and i think is and it was a brand the size of domino's, a big portion of the customers that we serve out there are these are not super wealthy folks and value is really, really important to them. and so i inspected in many of these less affluent areas, we stack up very favorably in terms of the all in value of having delivered food to serve to your family, whereas in some of the more affluent areas there may be less price sensitivity to some of these more significant delivery charges and/or if those consumers are ordering a higher overall ticket, if they're ordering $75 worth of food from a casual dining restaurant then paying the fee is less, less a pinch on a relative basis.
so we're still looking at this and seeing how it evolves, but i suspect that your hypothesis and ours there are reasonably, reasonably well aligned. and then i think on as it relates to the urban versus the rural, i do believe there that in those more rural environments there is -- where there is less density, i think our -- the cost model around how we deliver probably shines even more in some of those places where we can keep drivers busy running point to point back and forth from our stores. so we're continuing to watch it and evolve it.
there may be some other dynamics there, david that we look at such as some of the just the migration of people out of some of the urban areas during covid and not all of those folks have returned again back to -- back to the big cities or places where they previously lived. so still watching it and trends are still evolving.
well, folks, we really do appreciate your time and thank you all for joining us on the call this morning and we look forward to getting back together with you again in october to discuss our third quarter 2021 results.

jenny fouracre -- director of public and investor relations
thank you so much and thanks to all of you for joining us for our conversation today regarding the results for the third quarter of 2021. today's call will feature commentary from chief executive officer. ritch allison and from the office of cfo, jessica parrish. and this call is primarily for our investor audience. i ask that members of the media and others to be in a listen-only mode.
i want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in this morning's earnings release and 10-q also apply to our comments on the call today. both of these documents are available on our website. actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. for more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our filings with the sec. in addition, please refer to the 8-k release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures that may be referenced on today's call.
i'll request to our coverage analysts, we would like for you to accommodate that -- we would like to accommodate as many of you as time permits. so we encourage you to ask only one one-part question on the call if you could, please. today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website.
with that i'd like to turn the call over to our ceo, ritch allison.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
thank you, jenny. and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. overall, i'm happy with our results this quarter, which once again demonstrated the powerful growth potential of the domino's brand around the world. the third quarter presented significant challenges related to covid and specifically the rise in the delta variant across the u.s. and around the world.
our system had to pivot yet again in response to the resulting changes in public health guidance and requirements. as this pandemic extends deep into its second year, i'm proud to say that our franchisees have continued to step up to meet the ongoing challenge in service to their customers, their communities and their team members. throughout the domino's system, we'll remain committed to serving our customers with outstanding food through safe and reliable delivery and carryout experiences.
now, you've heard me say it many times. global retail sales growth is the engine that drives our business model. during the third quarter, we delivered 8.5% global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, driven by a combination of store growth and same store sales. that 8.5% result was lapping a 14.8% from the third quarter of 2020. the third quarter extended our unmatched streak of international same store sales growth to 111 consecutive quarters. while our 41 quarter streak of positive same store sales in the u.s. ended during the quarter, i'm pleased that we still grew our u.s. retail sales during the quarter, while rolling over 21.3% retail sales growth in q3 2020. during the quarter, we also accelerated our pace of global store growth on a trailing four-quarter basis, we have opened 1124 net new stores, that's an increase of 500 relative to where we were in q4 2020. over the last four quarters, we've averaged just a touch above three net new stores every day. so, overall the domino's brand continues to deliver.
i'll turn the call over now to jessica parrish, our controller and treasurer. she will take you through the details of the quarter and then i'll come back to share some additional thoughts about the business. jessica, over to you.
jessica parrish -- vice president, corporate controller and treasurer
thank you, ritch, and good morning everyone. we are pleased to share our third quarter results with you today. overall, domino's team members and franchisees around the world continue to generate healthy operating results, leading to a diluted eps of $3.24 for q3. in q3, we sustain our positive momentum in both our u.s. and international businesses, resulting in year-over-year global retail sales growth. global retail sales excluding the positive impact of foreign currency grew 8.5% in q3 as compared to q3 2020.
breaking down total global retail sales growth, u.s. retail sales grew 1.1% rolling over a prior year increase of 21.3%. international retail sales excluding the positive impact of foreign currency grew 16.5% rolling over a prior year increase of 8.5%. turning to comps. during q3, we continued our streak of 111 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. same store sales for our international business grew 8.8% rolling over a prior year increase of 6.2%. the u.s. comp was negative in q3 following 41 straight quarters of positive same store sales growth. same store sales in the u.s. declined 1.9% in the quarter rolling over a 17.5% increase in same store sales in q3 of 2020, the highest quarterly u.s. comp we have ever achieved since becoming a publicly traded company in 2004.
breaking down the u.s. comp, our franchise business was down 1.5% in the quarter, while our company-owned stores were down 8.9%. we continue to observe a larger spread between the top line performance of our franchise stores and our company-owned stores than we historically observed, which we believe is a function of the heavily urban and higher income footprint of our company-owned store markets relative to a more diverse mix across our franchise base. more aggressive purchasing in our company-owned store markets also contributed to the same store sales gap between our corporate store and franchise store businesses.
the decline in u.s. same store sales this quarter was driven by lower order counts. our u.s. order counts during q3 were pressured by a very challenging staffing environment, which had certain operational impacts such as shortened store hours or customer service challenges in many of our stores. additionally, since the onset of the pandemic, our comps had also benefited from significant economic stimulus activity in the u.s., the effects of which largely tapered off in the third quarter, which we believe pressured our order counts as compared to q3 2020. ticket growth partially offset the decline in order counts as we continue to see consumers or there are more items per transaction during q3. the ticket comp also benefited from increases to our transparent delivery fee as well as the mix of products we sell.
the international comp was primarily driven by order growth due to the return of non-delivery service methods across a number of international markets as well as the resumption of normal store hours in the reopening of stores that were temporarily closed in certain of our international markets in q3 2020 due to the covid-19 pandemic. shifting to unit count, we and our franchisees added 45 net stores in the u.s. during the third quarter, consisting of 46 store openings and only one closure. our international business added 278 net stores comprised of 287 store openings and 9 closures.
turning to revenues and operating margins. total revenues for the third quarter were up approximately $30.3 million or 3.1% over the prior year quarter. the increase was driven by higher retail sales, which generated higher international royalty, supply chain and u.s. franchise revenues. changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted our international royalty revenues by $1.3 million in q3. our consolidated operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 38.6% in q3 2021 from 37.4% in the prior year, due primarily to higher revenues from our global franchise businesses.
company-owned store margin as a percentage of revenues was flat year-over-year at 19.8%. as a percentage of revenues, food and occupancy costs were higher year-over-year, offset by lower labor costs. recall that we incurred additional bonus pay in the third quarter of last year for frontline team members and although we did make investments in frontline team member wage rates during q3, we continue to experience staffing shortages in certain of our company-owned stores.
supply chain operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 10.7% from 10.2% in the prior year quarter. while the market basket increased 2.1% year-over-year, higher product and supplies expenses related to certain covid related safety and sanitizing equipment negatively affected the supply chain operating margin in q3 2020, which did not recur in the current quarter. this year-over-year decrease in product costs was partially offset by higher labor costs.
g&a expenses increased approximately $4.7 million in q3 as compared to q3 2020 resulting from higher travel and labor costs, including higher non-cash compensation expense, partially offset by lower professional fees. net interest expense increased approximately $7.1 million in the quarter, driven by a higher average debt balance due to our recent recapitalization transaction completed in q2. our weighted average borrowing rate for q3 decreased to 3.8% from 3.9% in q3 2020 due to lower interest rates on our outstanding debt as a result of this recapitalization transaction.
our effective tax rate was 10.7% for the quarter as compared to 19.9% in q3 2020. the effective tax rate in q3 2021 included a 10.4 percentage point positive impact from tax benefits on equity-based compensation. this compares to a 2.8 percentage point positive impact in q3 2020. this increase was due to more stock option exercises in q3 of this year. we expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to these tax benefits from equity-based compensation. combining all of these elements, our third quarter net income was up $21.3 million or 21.5% versus q3 2020.
our diluted eps in q3 was $3.24 versus $2.49 in the prior year quarter. breaking down that $0.75 increase in our diluted eps, most notably, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.36. our lower effective tax rate, primarily due to higher tax benefits on equity based compensation positively impacted us by $0.34. a lower diluted share count driven by share repurchases over the trailing 12 months benefited us by $0.19 and higher net interest expense negatively impacted us by $0.14.
shifting to cash, our strong financial model continues to generate significant cash flows. during q3, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $189 million. after deducting for capex, we generated free cash flow of approximately $172 million. regarding our capital expenditures, we spent approximately $17 million on capex in q3, primarily on our technology initiatives, including our next-generation point-of-sale system and our new supply chain center. our strong free cash flow generation allowed us to continue our long-term commitment to returning cash to shareholders.
as we discussed on the q2 earnings call, we completed our $1 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction during q3. subsequent to the settlement of the asr, during q3, we repurchased and retired approximately 153,000 shares for $80 million or an average price of $521 per share. as of the end of q3, we had approximately $920 million remaining under our current board authorization for share repurchases. we have continued to repurchase and retire shares subsequent to the end of the quarter and through october 12, we had repurchased and retired an additional 205,000 shares for approximately $100 million or an average price of $488 per share. we also returned $35 million to our shareholders during q3 in the form of a $0.94 per share quarterly dividend.
shifting gears, as we look toward our fourth quarter, we wanted to provide an update on our annual guidance measures for full year 2021 provided earlier this year. we previously provided guidance that our store food basket pricing in our u.s. system would increase approximately 2.5% to 3.5% over 2020 levels. we previously provided guidance that foreign currency could have a $4 million to $8 million positive impact on royalty revenues as compared to 2020. we previously provided guidance of $415 million to $425 million for g&a expense. based on our current outlook, we expect each of these three measures to come in at the high end of these current estimates. we continue to expect that our full year capex investments will be approximately $100 million. keep in mind that these metrics can change based on economic and other factors outside of our control.
our g&a expense is also affected by our own performance versus our plan, which affects variable performance-based compensation expense. these estimates also reflect our normal 16-week q4, which will be rolling over the 17-week q4 we had in 2020 due to the inclusion of a 53rd week in our fiscal year. recall that the 53rd week last year contributed an incremental $0.39 to our eps in q4 2020 due to the additional week of revenues and the costs attributable to the 53rd week. this amount was adjusted as an item affecting comparability in our q4 2020 earnings release.
in closing, our business continued its solid performance during the third quarter and we are proud of the results our franchisees and team members around the world delivered. thank you all for joining the call today and now i will turn it back over to ritch.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
thanks, jessica. i'll begin my comments with a look at our u.s. business. retail sales grew 1.1% in the third quarter, lapping a 21.3% increase from q3 2020. our 1.9% same store sales declined during the quarter, was offset by the positive impact of 232 net new stores that we have opened over the trailing four quarters. domino's trailing four-quarter u.s. retail sales, excluding the impact of the 53rd week of 2020, were up 9.5%, a truly impressive achievement by our franchisees and operators, which shows the tremendous amount of growth in the brand across the u.s.
now let's take a few minutes to further break down the u.s. retail sales growth into it's two components: store growth and same store sales. our 45 net new stores in q3 was a sequential improvement over q2, but still came in softer than we would like to see. while cash on cash returns remain very strong and we continue to see a robust pipeline of future openings, we and our franchisees had a number of store openings delayed due to a variety of factors. we and our franchisees saw delays in construction, equipment, utility hookups and inspections. in addition, franchisee staffing challenges also resulted in some delays. we remain very bullish on the unit growth potential in the u.s., but believe that we may continue to see some of these challenges in the months ahead.
now let's turn to same store sales. as we continue to experience covid overlaps, we believe it's instructive to look at the cumulative stack of comparable u.s. same store sales anchored back to 2019 as a pre-covid baseline and we'll continue to do so for as long as we believe it is useful in understanding our business performance. at 15.6% for q3, we saw a sequential decline of the two-year stack when compared to the second quarter, bringing us back more in line with the two-year stack we saw in q1 of this year.
so what changed from q2 to q3. jessica highlighted several key drivers that i'll expand on here. first, we believe that government stimulus had an impact on our sales in q2 that waned in the third quarter as we moved further away from the spring one-time payments and as other enhanced benefits tapered off. second, we saw more pronounced staffing challenges across the country, resulting in reduced operating hours and service challenges in a number of stores across the network. we believe these challenges posed a more significant headwind on orders and sales during the third quarter than they did during the first half of this year.
we and our franchisees are taking a number of actions to address the staffing issues. a new applicant tracking system rolled out a few weeks ago that will make it easier for candidates to apply for openings and to be onboarded at both corporate and franchise locations across our u.s. system. we are also sharing operational best practices to eliminate unnecessary time-consuming tasks in the operation of stores, like pre-folding boxes, for example. they can drive both team member and customer satisfaction.
in our corporate stores, we have recently implemented meaningful increases in team member compensation and are also piloting new approaches to team member onboarding, training and development. while i'm optimistic about the efforts that we and our franchisees have underway, we believe that staffing may remain a significant challenge in the near term as the labor market continues to evolve.
now i'll share a few thoughts specifically about the carryout and delivery businesses. we saw a positive carryout same store sales growth during q3, as we continue to build awareness of domino's car side delivery. we are on air for several months with a fun campaign highlighting our car side delivery two-minute guarantee. this campaign hits on two key elements of the domino's brand. service and value. i'm very pleased with our car side delivery performance as our franchisees and operators have enthusiastically embraced this new service method.
our research shows. it's also bringing in new customers. we have consistently averaged below two minutes out the door and on our way to the customer's cars. in fact, we have many stores across the country that are consistently below 1 minute. it's a great technology enabled way to serve our customers and will remain an important part of our long-term strategy to serve our existing carryout customers and to attract new qsr drive through oriented customers going forward.
i'm also excited to talk about our latest menu innovations. just this past monday, we went on air to launch three great new products to support our signature $7.99 carryout offer. we call them dips and twists and they hit the mark for great taste and consumer appeal with terrific economics for our franchisees. i'm excited about the impact these can have on sales and on store level profitability. i really hope you'll get out and try them. we have one sweet and two savory dip options in this new product line. baked apple, five cheese and my personal favorite cheesy marinara.
turning to our delivery business. q3 saw a same store sales decline relative to 2020, but delivery sales remain significantly above 2019 levels. during the quarter, we believe that the stimulus wind down and the staffing challenges that i referenced earlier, had a disproportionate impact on our delivery business. just a few weeks ago, we launched a new ad campaign to support the delivery business. it plays on a key tension that consumers have with third-party delivery apps, the surprise fees that are often charged for service, for small orders or simply because you live in a certain zip code. consumers also tell us that they hate the fact that these charges are often confusing, hidden or buried in the receipt.
domino's and our franchisees never charge surprise fees. we charge one transparent delivery fee. so, we decided to give our customers surprise frees instead of surprise fees. during this campaign, one out of every 14 digital delivery orders receives a free item. that item could be a pizza, stuffed cheesy bread, lava cakes or any one of a number of other great items. over the course of the campaign, domino's and our franchisees will give away $50 million worth of surprise frees to delivery customers. now this campaign supports two of our key brand attributes: value and transparency. i'll also share a few important milestones that occurred in the u.s. during the quarter. first, we broke ground. just a few weeks ago on a new supply chain center in indiana, which we expect to complete and open by the end of 2022. and second, we are now running a pilot version of our new pulse point-of-sale system in a live store environment and we will continue to invest in that multi-year project going forward.
so, as we look forward in the u.s. business, i remain optimistic about our ability to continue driving long-term growth. we'll manage through the staffing and other challenges in the short term. frankly, that's what domino's franchisees and operators do and have always done and will continue to leave the brand with a clear focus on long-term profitable growth for our franchisees and dpz. i'll end the u.s. discussion with a big thank you to our u.s. franchisees, our corporate store operators and our supply chain team members for their ongoing efforts to serve their customers, their team members and their communities.
now moving on to international. it was another outstanding quarter of performance for our international business. our 16.5% international retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, was supported by a very strong 8.8% comp. when you look at it on a trailing four-quarter basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency and the 53rd week of 2020, domino's international retail sales grew by 16.2%. as i discussed earlier with our u.s. business, we are also watching the two-year comp stacks for international, anchoring back to pre-covid 2019. q3 represented a 15% two-year stack, which was very consistent with the second quarter.
international store growth was a highlight during the quarter. our international master franchisees opened 278 net new stores during the quarter, which increased the trailing four-quarter pace to 892 stores for the international business. this acceleration and international store growth combined with our u.s. store growth has driven the global pace of store growth back into our two to three-year outlook range of 6% to 8% global net unit growth.
i was also very pleased to see that we had only nine closures in international and only 10 closures on a global basis during the quarter. this low level of store closures is driven by two factors. first, our outstanding unit level economics and second and very importantly, the strong commitment of our franchisees across the globe. during the quarter, covid continue to have a significant impact on many of our international markets and we expect covid to remain a challenge in many parts of the world for some time to come.
at the end of the quarter, we estimate domino's had fewer than 175 temporary store closures, with many of those located in india and new zealand. i'll highlight a few of the international markets that contributed significantly to our growth during the quarter. we successfully converted 52 stores in poland as dominion pizza rebranded to become part of the domino's family. this provides important scale for us in poland, fast-forwarding us to 119 total stores in the market at the end of the third quarter. we now have 24 international markets with 100 or more domino's stores.
we opened our 93rd international market during the quarter, officially welcoming lithuania to the domino's family. we're off to a great start there with the first store opening and we have a second one coming very soon. india resumed an impressive pace of store growth, while becoming the first domino's market outside the u.s. to reach 1400 stores. i could not be more proud of jubilant, our master franchise partner, and the efforts they have made to fight through covid, taking care of their people, while still growing their business.
japan had another outstanding quarter, passing the 800-store milestone and continuing its impressive streak of growth. the transformation of the market by master franchisee domino's pizza enterprises has been remarkable. china delivered double-digit same store sales growth, while continuing its strong pace of store growth. with each passing quarter, we become even more confident about the long-term growth potential for the domino's brand in china.
in addition to those markets, the u.k., mexico, the netherlands, turkey and colombia were additional large market highlights in a strong quarter of performance across our international business. and along with those markets, we also saw robust regional growth across the middle east and northern africa during the quarter. i have long been convinced that we have the best international franchise partners in the restaurant business and they certainly prove me right during the third quarter. as we look forward, we have so much opportunity ahead of us to continue driving long-term growth for domino's outside the u.s.
so in closing, i'm pleased with our third quarter results. our outstanding franchisees and operators continue to battle through a challenging set of circumstances, while delivering strong growth for the domino's brand around the world. these passionate dominoids combined with our outstanding unit level economics, position us incredibly well for the future. there is no doubt that we will continue to experience challenges with covid, with staffing, and other factors. we also expect inflationary headwinds to continue impacting domino's and the broader restaurant industry over the coming quarters. but we will face all of these challenges and headwinds from a position of strength and with the unwavering commitment of our franchisees and team members who proudly wear the domino's logo. my team and i are proud to serve them each and every day. so thank you again for joining us today. and we'll now be happy to take your questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from brian bittner with oppenheimer.
brian bittner -- oppenheimer -- analyst
good morning. ritch, the labor staffing issues was obviously highlighted as an incremental challenge in the quarter. do you guys have any data to try to help us on the outside, quantify how these capacity and service issues from labor staffing challenges may be impacted the trends in the quarter and also the staffing issues, are they specifically preventing you from deploying traffic driving initiatives throughout the system like utilizing the 50% boost weeks etc.? thanks.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure, brian. thanks for the question. yes, staffing has been a challenge most certainly during the quarter as we highlighted. it -- i don't have a lot to share with you today in terms of specific stats about what that headwind is on the comp because it's always difficult to say what sales might have been without staffing challenges. but what i can tell you is that when you look at the third quarter relative to the first half of the year, we certainly saw more of an impact in the system around some things like reduced operating hours and some challenges with respect to delivery service times in particular.
and when we look at it in our own corporate store business, we certainly saw our staffing levels relative to ideal were lower than we saw during the first half of the year. so the impact on the comp in the u.s. was more pronounced in the third quarter than it was in the second quarter. and as it relates to how we think about the business going forward, the staffing challenges do impact our ability to be more aggressive, as it relates to promotional activities in the marketplace.
so we're continuing obviously to monitor the levels across our system. in our corporate store business, we are doing things proactively, like looking at our wages, compensation for our team members, and as i spoke about earlier, working across the system, rolling out an applicant tracking system to help with team member acquisition and hiring. and then we're also working on a number of operational improvements inside of our stores to allow us to operate more efficiently and frankly with less labor for every order that goes out.
and then finally i'd just highlight the carryout business will continue to be a focus of ours given the significantly lower amount of labor involved in those transactions in the fact that's been a big growth driver for us anyway. we're going to continue pushing there.

our next question comes from peter saleh with btig.
peter saleh -- btig -- analyst
great, thank you. so, ritch, you mentioned on couple of occasions, the impact of the labor challenges on the comps, but can you talk a little bit about the labor challenges and maybe the impact on the industry on independents. are you seeing more closures there? i suspect, if you're seeing these issues and feeling these issues on labor that you're competitive set is feeling it just as much if not more. any comments on closures in the industry?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
hey, pete, thanks. i certainly believe that the staffing challenges are impacting the restaurant industry more broadly. as i take a look across the industry and talk to leaders in the industry, it's certainly a common theme that you hear. in terms of how that's impacting independents. i don't have great statistics for you about what's going on with closures there, but i can tell you that i think the impact of staffing and rising labor costs and also frankly rising commodity costs, where independents are typically less able to buy -- are less able to buy with the scale and also to lock-in pricing as the larger players like we are, i suspect that there is a lot of pressure on the p&l among some of the independents and smaller regionals out there.

our next question comes from brian mullan with deutsche bank.
brian mullan -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, thank you. ritch, last fall, you indicated the carryout order counts in the u.s. had not quite reached the 2019 levels. just wondering if they got back to even or close to in the third quarter relative to where they were in 2019? we know that country was doing with delta, but there is also a broad reopening. so just any color on the carryout business, quarter counts would be great.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure. when we look at our carryout order counts, we are still not quite back to where we were two years ago on carryout order counts despite having positive carryout same store sales in the third quarter. but it continues to be a focus for us and an area where we continue to see strong opportunity to continue the long-term growth trajectory of that side of the business. we just launched these dips and twists that just went on air this week, as just yet another tool coming from our innovation team to help us continue to push carryout and push it at that $7.99 hero price point that we've got there.

our next question comes from john glass with morgan stanley.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks very much. it's just two follow-ups. one is, is the labor issue most focused on drivers that would make that maybe more of a delivery company issue or do you think is it in the restaurants as well? i just want to make sure we understand if it's more specific to your type of business versus others. and can you talk about, i know you talked about independence, but is there -- how do you think you are on a market share basis this quarter, just so we can understand how maybe you think you're doing versus your largest peers? do you expect you have insight into that if you gain share, lose share, is everyone sort of in the same boat given the external factors you've cited?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
thanks, john. first on the labor. what i would tell you is that it is more pronounced with respect to drivers. but we see labor challenges really across our business and as i look broadly across the industry, the restaurant industry, both the retail side and the distribution side of that, i think -- and frankly among suppliers, i think labor continues to be a significant challenge and you look at the number of open job positions across the u.s. right now. it's a pretty staggering number and a lot of those are certainly related to our industry. but drivers in particular have been challenging as we look over the last -- the third quarter.
and then as it relates to market share. we don't get great real-time data on that and we always take -- when we do get it on a quarterly basis, we always like to say a few quarters a trend before we get really comfortable about what these external views of the market look like. but we do continue to believe that we and the larger players in the market continue to gain share at the expense of some of the smaller chains and some of the locals.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst

our next question comes from jared garber with goldman sachs.
jared garber -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. obviously labor continues to be a topic of discussion, but i wanted to maybe taking a little bit of a different route, the offset there would obviously be pricing. so, ritch, i wanted to ask, how you're thinking about pricing across the menu and if there's any thoughts about maybe potentially increasing those $5.99 and $7.99 platforms that you're so well known for? and just how you think about offsetting some of these highly inflationary pressures?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure, jared, thanks. as we are -- currently as we do on a very frequent basis, taking a look at our price points, we test them on a pretty frequent basis over time and really with an eye to what are the price points in the marketplace that can help us to drive long-term profitable growth for our franchisees. so, we are certainly taking a look at those again. here as we look forward into 2022, there are cost pressures across the business as you highlight both on the labor side, but also inflationary pressures as it relates to commodities as well.
so we're taking all of those things into account as we think about what our pricing looks like in 2022. and what i'll tell you there is that we will as always do it with the long-term profitable growth of the franchisees in mind. and while we are wedded to value, we are not specifically wedded to any individual price points and if a better price point yields better long-term profitable growth for our franchisees and that's where we're going to go.
jared garber -- goldman sachs -- analyst

our next question comes from andrew strelzik with bmo.
andrew strelzik -- bmo -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking my question. i appreciate the commentary on some of the sales constraints that you mentioned. but i'm just curious. i know historically, you said these are two distinct occasions. but do you think as we're kind of normalizing from an operating environment perspective and trying to find an equilibrium or normal, do you think you're seeing more switching between carryout and delivery or do you continue to believe that that's really not the case even having this unique period here? thanks.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
yes, it's a great question because and as you highlight, historically, we've not seen a lot of switching across those two service methods. and in fact, only about 15% of customers would go back and forth between the two. but it's an interesting question that i think opens up to your point, as we work our way out of covid and as we and across the industry continue to see some of these staffing challenges and labor cost increases, which do result in higher delivery fees as jessica highlighted earlier. we've seen some increase in our single transparent delivery fees across markets and we've certainly seen prices go up as it relates to delivery charges or even what it takes you to go across the town when you hail an uber or a lyft.
so i think it's an -- i think it is an open question as to how much more switching we might see when the cost of delivery continues to rise for consumers. so those are some of the things that we're obviously thinking about and testing here. we're also really pushing on this car side delivery as a service method to try to make things significantly more convenient for customers to pick up product, eliminating the need to go into the store and pay and carry your own food out. we think it's a significant improvement in the consumer experience and may tip some more consumers over to come into the carryout channel as opposed to delivery.
andrew strelzik -- bmo -- analyst
good. thank you.

your next question comes from john ivankoe with jpmorgan.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, thank you very much. the question is on u.s. unit development. certainly, we understand labor, we understand the construction-related issues. but there was a comment made that fortressing is affecting company stores more than franchise stores. and if you look at -- excuse me, company store development is up something like 5% year-over-year, the comp is down, whatever it is at 8.9. if one were to assume that half of that comp decline was due to fortressing, would basically mean that the new stores actually aren't -- are basically getting all their volume from nearby stores.
i know that's, it's very bad math to mentioned this on the conference call, but the numbers are -- could potentially look fairly exaggerated in terms of the amount of sales transfer that's happening to a new store that acts as a fortress store. so can you comment on just kind of what the current algorithm is important seeing, i mean, when you open new stores for both company and franchise, the percentage of sales that is expected to get on its own versus the percentage of sales that expects to get elsewhere and considering the labor and the construction environment that we've talked about? are you prepared to talk about how materially lower potentially fiscal '22 development in the u.s. could be relative to '21, which i think would be consistent with some comments that you made of units being delayed in the overall u.s. system? thanks.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
hey, john, i'll try to pick off some of the parts of your question there. first of all on u.s. unit development, i'll just make a macro comment overall. there is still a very healthy demand out there among our franchisee base for unit development. i've highlighted some of the challenges in the near term of getting these stores open, but when we take a look at the profit -- four-wall profitability at the store level and the resulting cash-on-cash returns for domino's, which is ultimately what drives the store growth is still very, very strong.
and as we continue to desktop our models to take a look at what the u.s. holding capacity is for domino's stores, we continue to be very bullish about that holding capacity. i've talked about 8000 store potential in the past and we believe it's at least that if not more, as we continue to dust it off. when we open new stores, a significant portion of those are fortress stores in that they do take some number of addresses from existing stores service areas. when we take a look at the impact that that has on the comp, i have spoken in the past about that being a 1.0 and 1.5 or so. if you take a look at the third quarter, it was about a 1.0 when you look across the system and a bit higher than that on the corporate store side because to your point, we have been a little bit more aggressive in terms of percentage opens off the base, but also basically every store we open in our corporate store business is a fortress store.
but when we take a look at what the cash-on-cash return expectations are for those openings and we look at it not only on the individual new store, but we look at it on the impact of the store cluster that stores is a part of, we still see very positive returns on those stores and that's why we continue to be aggressive in the growth of our corporate stores. so fortressing is going to continue to be a key part of our strategy, john, and i haven't seen anything in the quarter that gives me any sense that we should be slowing down. there is still a lot of opportunity out there to continue opening domino's stores around the country.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and just because i think that there's going to be such a point of conversation and can you give us at least a soft guide of '22 u.s. development relative to '21? is that something that you're prepared to do at this point?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
we're not going to do that today, john.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan -- analyst

our next question comes from gregory francfort with guggenheim.
gregory francfort -- guggenheim -- analyst
hey, i -- my question is on the technology piece. but you have staffing as a percent of maybe where your target was in the quarter. just any quantification on that. but my question is, ritch, i know you've been putting a lot of investments and focus on upgrading the technology platforms pulse 2.0. can you just help us understand where that stands and when that may have an impact on the business? thanks.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure. yes, greg, in terms of staffing relative to where we'd like it to be. i don't have a specific percentage to share with you today. it varies pretty significantly market by market because the labor markets around the country is so unique and obviously we've got direct visibility into the corporate store markets that we operate, but not direct visibility into all of our franchise locations, who obviously manage their own employment base.
on tech, i made brief reference to this earlier in my prepared remarks, but we had a really -- we've got a really exciting milestone over the course of the last several months where we now have our new version of pulse operating on a continuous basis in a live store. so, the team has just done a terrific job of developing that to the point where we've got the minimum viable product to have out in a store today that allows us to continue to test and learn. and our expectation is that we continue to expand the initial phase of that rollout with a few more stores this year and then as we continue to learn and improve the product, we'll be able to come back to you in subsequent quarters to give you a little bit more of a sense of the pace of rollout of that product.
but when we go in and have a look at how it's operating in the stores, it is easier to manage transactions inside the store and significantly easier to get new team members up to speed on the use of pulse. and then as it relates to our ongoing development and evolution of the product, the architecture that we've used with pulse is transformational for us in terms of our ability to respond more quickly and add enhancements and updates to the product versus the architecture that that the current version of pulse is on. so we're excited about it and you'll hear a lot more about it from us in the future.
gregory francfort -- guggenheim -- analyst

our next question comes from david tarantino with baird.
david tarantino -- baird -- analyst
hi, good morning, ritch. i want to circle back on the issue related to staffing and get your thoughts on what you think needs to happen for you and the industry to get this resolved? it seems like the industry needs to consider maybe a structural step change and wage rates here and maybe much more aggressive than what's already been done. and i'm wondering if you agree with that. and then secondly, how your franchisees are approaching and it seems like they entered the year with all-time high profitability and should be willing to fund that to get the staffing levels, right. but maybe i'm missing that. so any perspective you can offer would be helpful?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
yes, david, it's a great question and i can tell you it's something we spend a lot of time on around here each and every day and have a lot of conversations with our operators and franchisees about it. when you think about what has to happen in the labor market for our industry, i think there are a couple of things that are under our control and then there are a couple of things that are more macro factors. if i start with kind of the -- with the macro factors, most certainly there have been a significant number of americans who have removed themselves from the workforce over the course of covid and haven't come back yet. if you look at labor force participation rates, they are down rather significantly from pre-covid.
we have not seen it yet as much as we would like, but we do expect there to be some relaxing of the labor market as covid continues to subside and as folks get more comfortable, have more options to care for their children, etc., to get back out into the workforce. i have no doubt that this delta variant over the course of the last several months has made that recovery more challenging. we also have not had much in the way of immigration into the u.s. here over the course of the last couple of years and in a country whose population is not growing as it used to, we in our industry and a number of others will need to see more immigration, i think, to continue to have a robust workforce, particularly in the younger age groups.
so, there's the macro things that we can't really control. what we spend our time thinking about is what we can control. wages is one of those levers. i spoke earlier about the fact that we have made some significant moves in our own corporate store business and we've done that in our supply chain business as well. and as we talk to franchisees, we don't control their employment practices or wages, but we hear from many franchisees that they are also investing in their team members and frankly with the profitability levels that we have in our stores, we are much better positioned than many players in the restaurant industry to be able to invest in our teams.
but then also as an industry and as a company, we also have to think about the jobs themselves and how do we make those jobs easier and more appealing to team members and we're spending a lot of time on that inside our business and piloting a number of exciting things in our corporate stores where we're looking fundamentally at the jobs themselves. how do we make it easier, how do we keep drivers in their cars 100% of the time and not have them do tasks inside the stores that they don't enjoy doing and that don't drive tips for them, how do we bring more technology into the stores to allow us to operate more efficiently with fewer labor hours per unit of sales. so, we're looking at all of these elements and while it's a challenge, i feel like we're very well positioned with the profitability that we've got in our stores and also really well positioned just based on the innovation and technology teams that we've built over time who -- this is power alley for them to go in and figure out how to solve these problems alongside our great operators.
david tarantino -- baird -- analyst

our next question comes from dennis geiger with ubs.
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
great, thanks for the question, ritch you talked about the impact from the waning benefits of stimulus and specifically curious if you're kind of able to identify any specific shifts that you've seen in customer behavior from that benefit feeding or anything else that would think you would kind of point out that's changed from 2q into 3q with them -- with that benefit starting to fade some? thank you.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
yes, dennis. thanks for the question. we saw a boost back in the second quarter when the $1400 stimulus payments went out. you had the one-time payment and then you also had the unemployment, which was introduced at that time and ultimately completed i believe in the first or second week of september. and i think what we saw was as consumers spent off that $1400 and as some of those unemployment benefits waned, the impact was really more pronounced we believe on our delivery business than it was on the carryout business. so i think we had more customers with money in their pockets also worried about covid and more of those were ordering delivery into their homes and we saw that taper off in the third quarter relative to what we saw in the second quarter.
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
makes sense. thanks, ritch.
operator
our next question comes from lauren silberman with credit suisse.
lauren silberman -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you. another one on labor. more broadly, it feels like some structural headwinds increased competition from three of your platforms, people have left the industry and then just higher manual labor costs. a follow-up in response to david's question, can you expand on the technology you're exploring to address labor headwinds over the medium to long term like automation, perhaps more so than you would have considered call it six to 12 months ago?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure. lauren, and we're looking at that really in several areas of our business at the store level, which we've spent most of the time talking about today. one of the key things that we're working on is in an environment where driver staffing is one of the constraints. key question is how do you keep drivers in their car more and how do you get more deliveries per hour through those drivers. we introduced some time ago our gps tools that are in the hands of drivers. that's a core technology that helps them to be more efficient.
the technology underpinning of domino's car side delivery and the operational practices that we've instituted around that are also key ways for us to think about driving more efficiency with our delivery drivers because if we can identify when a customer pulls into the parking lot and run a pizza out to that customer's car, there's no reason why and we're doing it in a lot of stores around the country. no reason why we can't just run pizzas out to drivers cars as well. and when i think about the domino's, i would like to see in the future, i don't see why drivers should ever have to get out of their cars. why can't we keep them turning to the store, back to the customer and maximizing deliveries per driver per hour, which also maximizes the wages that those drivers earn. so, there are number of different things going on there.
inside the stores, our next generation version of our point-of-sales system along with other store technology innovations are also helping us to get more productivity to drive more productivity in the stores. and then lastly, outside the stores if i shift gears over to our supply chain centers. as we build these new centers and as we go back and replace assets in existing centers, we're putting in place equipment and technology that reduce the amount of labor that is required to produce our dough balls and to manage the distribution of product out to our stores as well.

and our last question will come from chris carril with rbc capital markets.
chris carril -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking the question. so i wanted to ask about the surprise frees promotion. i mean to what extent do you think the promotion helped to offset some of those declining stimulus tailwinds and other delivery headwinds that you had pointed out? and i think the promotion continues into november. so are you planning on marketing it more over these next few weeks? thanks.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
yes, chris. we just rolled it out a few weeks back and we're getting a lot of exciting press out of it and i think it really -- it plays on attention, a consumer attention and that's one of the things we think about always when we think about great advertising at domino's is how does it play on a consumer attention. and consumers tell us that they get increasingly irritated about all of these fees that they get charged. so, we've decided to do the flip side of that and do surprise frees. so far, we're pleased with the customer reception to the campaign. we're going to continue to run it in the weeks ahead and excited about how that can continue to position domino's as the transparent and value-oriented player in the market. so, we remain excited about it. look forward to sharing results as the program continues to evolve and as we see how it behaves in the quarter. we look forward to talking to you about it in more depth when we report our fourth quarter results out.
chris carril -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. thank you.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
all right, folks. well, thank you so much for joining us on the call this morning and i look forward to getting back together with you in february to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results.

with that i'd like to turn the call over to our ceo, ritch allison.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
thank you, jenny. and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. overall, i'm happy with our results this quarter, which once again demonstrated the powerful growth potential of the domino's brand around the world. the third quarter presented significant challenges related to covid and specifically the rise in the delta variant across the u.s. and around the world.
our system had to pivot yet again in response to the resulting changes in public health guidance and requirements. as this pandemic extends deep into its second year, i'm proud to say that our franchisees have continued to step up to meet the ongoing challenge in service to their customers, their communities and their team members. throughout the domino's system, we'll remain committed to serving our customers with outstanding food through safe and reliable delivery and carryout experiences.
now, you've heard me say it many times. global retail sales growth is the engine that drives our business model. during the third quarter, we delivered 8.5% global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, driven by a combination of store growth and same store sales. that 8.5% result was lapping a 14.8% from the third quarter of 2020. the third quarter extended our unmatched streak of international same store sales growth to 111 consecutive quarters. while our 41 quarter streak of positive same store sales in the u.s. ended during the quarter, i'm pleased that we still grew our u.s. retail sales during the quarter, while rolling over 21.3% retail sales growth in q3 2020. during the quarter, we also accelerated our pace of global store growth on a trailing four-quarter basis, we have opened 1124 net new stores, that's an increase of 500 relative to where we were in q4 2020. over the last four quarters, we've averaged just a touch above three net new stores every day. so, overall the domino's brand continues to deliver.
i'll turn the call over now to jessica parrish, our controller and treasurer. she will take you through the details of the quarter and then i'll come back to share some additional thoughts about the business. jessica, over to you.
jessica parrish -- vice president, corporate controller and treasurer
thank you, ritch, and good morning everyone. we are pleased to share our third quarter results with you today. overall, domino's team members and franchisees around the world continue to generate healthy operating results, leading to a diluted eps of $3.24 for q3. in q3, we sustain our positive momentum in both our u.s. and international businesses, resulting in year-over-year global retail sales growth. global retail sales excluding the positive impact of foreign currency grew 8.5% in q3 as compared to q3 2020.
breaking down total global retail sales growth, u.s. retail sales grew 1.1% rolling over a prior year increase of 21.3%. international retail sales excluding the positive impact of foreign currency grew 16.5% rolling over a prior year increase of 8.5%. turning to comps. during q3, we continued our streak of 111 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. same store sales for our international business grew 8.8% rolling over a prior year increase of 6.2%. the u.s. comp was negative in q3 following 41 straight quarters of positive same store sales growth. same store sales in the u.s. declined 1.9% in the quarter rolling over a 17.5% increase in same store sales in q3 of 2020, the highest quarterly u.s. comp we have ever achieved since becoming a publicly traded company in 2004.
breaking down the u.s. comp, our franchise business was down 1.5% in the quarter, while our company-owned stores were down 8.9%. we continue to observe a larger spread between the top line performance of our franchise stores and our company-owned stores than we historically observed, which we believe is a function of the heavily urban and higher income footprint of our company-owned store markets relative to a more diverse mix across our franchise base. more aggressive purchasing in our company-owned store markets also contributed to the same store sales gap between our corporate store and franchise store businesses.
the decline in u.s. same store sales this quarter was driven by lower order counts. our u.s. order counts during q3 were pressured by a very challenging staffing environment, which had certain operational impacts such as shortened store hours or customer service challenges in many of our stores. additionally, since the onset of the pandemic, our comps had also benefited from significant economic stimulus activity in the u.s., the effects of which largely tapered off in the third quarter, which we believe pressured our order counts as compared to q3 2020. ticket growth partially offset the decline in order counts as we continue to see consumers or there are more items per transaction during q3. the ticket comp also benefited from increases to our transparent delivery fee as well as the mix of products we sell.
the international comp was primarily driven by order growth due to the return of non-delivery service methods across a number of international markets as well as the resumption of normal store hours in the reopening of stores that were temporarily closed in certain of our international markets in q3 2020 due to the covid-19 pandemic. shifting to unit count, we and our franchisees added 45 net stores in the u.s. during the third quarter, consisting of 46 store openings and only one closure. our international business added 278 net stores comprised of 287 store openings and 9 closures.
turning to revenues and operating margins. total revenues for the third quarter were up approximately $30.3 million or 3.1% over the prior year quarter. the increase was driven by higher retail sales, which generated higher international royalty, supply chain and u.s. franchise revenues. changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted our international royalty revenues by $1.3 million in q3. our consolidated operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 38.6% in q3 2021 from 37.4% in the prior year, due primarily to higher revenues from our global franchise businesses.
company-owned store margin as a percentage of revenues was flat year-over-year at 19.8%. as a percentage of revenues, food and occupancy costs were higher year-over-year, offset by lower labor costs. recall that we incurred additional bonus pay in the third quarter of last year for frontline team members and although we did make investments in frontline team member wage rates during q3, we continue to experience staffing shortages in certain of our company-owned stores.
supply chain operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 10.7% from 10.2% in the prior year quarter. while the market basket increased 2.1% year-over-year, higher product and supplies expenses related to certain covid related safety and sanitizing equipment negatively affected the supply chain operating margin in q3 2020, which did not recur in the current quarter. this year-over-year decrease in product costs was partially offset by higher labor costs.
g&a expenses increased approximately $4.7 million in q3 as compared to q3 2020 resulting from higher travel and labor costs, including higher non-cash compensation expense, partially offset by lower professional fees. net interest expense increased approximately $7.1 million in the quarter, driven by a higher average debt balance due to our recent recapitalization transaction completed in q2. our weighted average borrowing rate for q3 decreased to 3.8% from 3.9% in q3 2020 due to lower interest rates on our outstanding debt as a result of this recapitalization transaction.
our effective tax rate was 10.7% for the quarter as compared to 19.9% in q3 2020. the effective tax rate in q3 2021 included a 10.4 percentage point positive impact from tax benefits on equity-based compensation. this compares to a 2.8 percentage point positive impact in q3 2020. this increase was due to more stock option exercises in q3 of this year. we expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to these tax benefits from equity-based compensation. combining all of these elements, our third quarter net income was up $21.3 million or 21.5% versus q3 2020.
our diluted eps in q3 was $3.24 versus $2.49 in the prior year quarter. breaking down that $0.75 increase in our diluted eps, most notably, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.36. our lower effective tax rate, primarily due to higher tax benefits on equity based compensation positively impacted us by $0.34. a lower diluted share count driven by share repurchases over the trailing 12 months benefited us by $0.19 and higher net interest expense negatively impacted us by $0.14.
shifting to cash, our strong financial model continues to generate significant cash flows. during q3, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $189 million. after deducting for capex, we generated free cash flow of approximately $172 million. regarding our capital expenditures, we spent approximately $17 million on capex in q3, primarily on our technology initiatives, including our next-generation point-of-sale system and our new supply chain center. our strong free cash flow generation allowed us to continue our long-term commitment to returning cash to shareholders.
as we discussed on the q2 earnings call, we completed our $1 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction during q3. subsequent to the settlement of the asr, during q3, we repurchased and retired approximately 153,000 shares for $80 million or an average price of $521 per share. as of the end of q3, we had approximately $920 million remaining under our current board authorization for share repurchases. we have continued to repurchase and retire shares subsequent to the end of the quarter and through october 12, we had repurchased and retired an additional 205,000 shares for approximately $100 million or an average price of $488 per share. we also returned $35 million to our shareholders during q3 in the form of a $0.94 per share quarterly dividend.
shifting gears, as we look toward our fourth quarter, we wanted to provide an update on our annual guidance measures for full year 2021 provided earlier this year. we previously provided guidance that our store food basket pricing in our u.s. system would increase approximately 2.5% to 3.5% over 2020 levels. we previously provided guidance that foreign currency could have a $4 million to $8 million positive impact on royalty revenues as compared to 2020. we previously provided guidance of $415 million to $425 million for g&a expense. based on our current outlook, we expect each of these three measures to come in at the high end of these current estimates. we continue to expect that our full year capex investments will be approximately $100 million. keep in mind that these metrics can change based on economic and other factors outside of our control.
our g&a expense is also affected by our own performance versus our plan, which affects variable performance-based compensation expense. these estimates also reflect our normal 16-week q4, which will be rolling over the 17-week q4 we had in 2020 due to the inclusion of a 53rd week in our fiscal year. recall that the 53rd week last year contributed an incremental $0.39 to our eps in q4 2020 due to the additional week of revenues and the costs attributable to the 53rd week. this amount was adjusted as an item affecting comparability in our q4 2020 earnings release.
in closing, our business continued its solid performance during the third quarter and we are proud of the results our franchisees and team members around the world delivered. thank you all for joining the call today and now i will turn it back over to ritch.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
thanks, jessica. i'll begin my comments with a look at our u.s. business. retail sales grew 1.1% in the third quarter, lapping a 21.3% increase from q3 2020. our 1.9% same store sales declined during the quarter, was offset by the positive impact of 232 net new stores that we have opened over the trailing four quarters. domino's trailing four-quarter u.s. retail sales, excluding the impact of the 53rd week of 2020, were up 9.5%, a truly impressive achievement by our franchisees and operators, which shows the tremendous amount of growth in the brand across the u.s.
now let's take a few minutes to further break down the u.s. retail sales growth into it's two components: store growth and same store sales. our 45 net new stores in q3 was a sequential improvement over q2, but still came in softer than we would like to see. while cash on cash returns remain very strong and we continue to see a robust pipeline of future openings, we and our franchisees had a number of store openings delayed due to a variety of factors. we and our franchisees saw delays in construction, equipment, utility hookups and inspections. in addition, franchisee staffing challenges also resulted in some delays. we remain very bullish on the unit growth potential in the u.s., but believe that we may continue to see some of these challenges in the months ahead.
now let's turn to same store sales. as we continue to experience covid overlaps, we believe it's instructive to look at the cumulative stack of comparable u.s. same store sales anchored back to 2019 as a pre-covid baseline and we'll continue to do so for as long as we believe it is useful in understanding our business performance. at 15.6% for q3, we saw a sequential decline of the two-year stack when compared to the second quarter, bringing us back more in line with the two-year stack we saw in q1 of this year.
so what changed from q2 to q3. jessica highlighted several key drivers that i'll expand on here. first, we believe that government stimulus had an impact on our sales in q2 that waned in the third quarter as we moved further away from the spring one-time payments and as other enhanced benefits tapered off. second, we saw more pronounced staffing challenges across the country, resulting in reduced operating hours and service challenges in a number of stores across the network. we believe these challenges posed a more significant headwind on orders and sales during the third quarter than they did during the first half of this year.
we and our franchisees are taking a number of actions to address the staffing issues. a new applicant tracking system rolled out a few weeks ago that will make it easier for candidates to apply for openings and to be onboarded at both corporate and franchise locations across our u.s. system. we are also sharing operational best practices to eliminate unnecessary time-consuming tasks in the operation of stores, like pre-folding boxes, for example. they can drive both team member and customer satisfaction.
in our corporate stores, we have recently implemented meaningful increases in team member compensation and are also piloting new approaches to team member onboarding, training and development. while i'm optimistic about the efforts that we and our franchisees have underway, we believe that staffing may remain a significant challenge in the near term as the labor market continues to evolve.
now i'll share a few thoughts specifically about the carryout and delivery businesses. we saw a positive carryout same store sales growth during q3, as we continue to build awareness of domino's car side delivery. we are on air for several months with a fun campaign highlighting our car side delivery two-minute guarantee. this campaign hits on two key elements of the domino's brand. service and value. i'm very pleased with our car side delivery performance as our franchisees and operators have enthusiastically embraced this new service method.
our research shows. it's also bringing in new customers. we have consistently averaged below two minutes out the door and on our way to the customer's cars. in fact, we have many stores across the country that are consistently below 1 minute. it's a great technology enabled way to serve our customers and will remain an important part of our long-term strategy to serve our existing carryout customers and to attract new qsr drive through oriented customers going forward.
i'm also excited to talk about our latest menu innovations. just this past monday, we went on air to launch three great new products to support our signature $7.99 carryout offer. we call them dips and twists and they hit the mark for great taste and consumer appeal with terrific economics for our franchisees. i'm excited about the impact these can have on sales and on store level profitability. i really hope you'll get out and try them. we have one sweet and two savory dip options in this new product line. baked apple, five cheese and my personal favorite cheesy marinara.
turning to our delivery business. q3 saw a same store sales decline relative to 2020, but delivery sales remain significantly above 2019 levels. during the quarter, we believe that the stimulus wind down and the staffing challenges that i referenced earlier, had a disproportionate impact on our delivery business. just a few weeks ago, we launched a new ad campaign to support the delivery business. it plays on a key tension that consumers have with third-party delivery apps, the surprise fees that are often charged for service, for small orders or simply because you live in a certain zip code. consumers also tell us that they hate the fact that these charges are often confusing, hidden or buried in the receipt.
domino's and our franchisees never charge surprise fees. we charge one transparent delivery fee. so, we decided to give our customers surprise frees instead of surprise fees. during this campaign, one out of every 14 digital delivery orders receives a free item. that item could be a pizza, stuffed cheesy bread, lava cakes or any one of a number of other great items. over the course of the campaign, domino's and our franchisees will give away $50 million worth of surprise frees to delivery customers. now this campaign supports two of our key brand attributes: value and transparency. i'll also share a few important milestones that occurred in the u.s. during the quarter. first, we broke ground. just a few weeks ago on a new supply chain center in indiana, which we expect to complete and open by the end of 2022. and second, we are now running a pilot version of our new pulse point-of-sale system in a live store environment and we will continue to invest in that multi-year project going forward.
so, as we look forward in the u.s. business, i remain optimistic about our ability to continue driving long-term growth. we'll manage through the staffing and other challenges in the short term. frankly, that's what domino's franchisees and operators do and have always done and will continue to leave the brand with a clear focus on long-term profitable growth for our franchisees and dpz. i'll end the u.s. discussion with a big thank you to our u.s. franchisees, our corporate store operators and our supply chain team members for their ongoing efforts to serve their customers, their team members and their communities.
now moving on to international. it was another outstanding quarter of performance for our international business. our 16.5% international retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, was supported by a very strong 8.8% comp. when you look at it on a trailing four-quarter basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency and the 53rd week of 2020, domino's international retail sales grew by 16.2%. as i discussed earlier with our u.s. business, we are also watching the two-year comp stacks for international, anchoring back to pre-covid 2019. q3 represented a 15% two-year stack, which was very consistent with the second quarter.
international store growth was a highlight during the quarter. our international master franchisees opened 278 net new stores during the quarter, which increased the trailing four-quarter pace to 892 stores for the international business. this acceleration and international store growth combined with our u.s. store growth has driven the global pace of store growth back into our two to three-year outlook range of 6% to 8% global net unit growth.
i was also very pleased to see that we had only nine closures in international and only 10 closures on a global basis during the quarter. this low level of store closures is driven by two factors. first, our outstanding unit level economics and second and very importantly, the strong commitment of our franchisees across the globe. during the quarter, covid continue to have a significant impact on many of our international markets and we expect covid to remain a challenge in many parts of the world for some time to come.
at the end of the quarter, we estimate domino's had fewer than 175 temporary store closures, with many of those located in india and new zealand. i'll highlight a few of the international markets that contributed significantly to our growth during the quarter. we successfully converted 52 stores in poland as dominion pizza rebranded to become part of the domino's family. this provides important scale for us in poland, fast-forwarding us to 119 total stores in the market at the end of the third quarter. we now have 24 international markets with 100 or more domino's stores.
we opened our 93rd international market during the quarter, officially welcoming lithuania to the domino's family. we're off to a great start there with the first store opening and we have a second one coming very soon. india resumed an impressive pace of store growth, while becoming the first domino's market outside the u.s. to reach 1400 stores. i could not be more proud of jubilant, our master franchise partner, and the efforts they have made to fight through covid, taking care of their people, while still growing their business.
japan had another outstanding quarter, passing the 800-store milestone and continuing its impressive streak of growth. the transformation of the market by master franchisee domino's pizza enterprises has been remarkable. china delivered double-digit same store sales growth, while continuing its strong pace of store growth. with each passing quarter, we become even more confident about the long-term growth potential for the domino's brand in china.
in addition to those markets, the u.k., mexico, the netherlands, turkey and colombia were additional large market highlights in a strong quarter of performance across our international business. and along with those markets, we also saw robust regional growth across the middle east and northern africa during the quarter. i have long been convinced that we have the best international franchise partners in the restaurant business and they certainly prove me right during the third quarter. as we look forward, we have so much opportunity ahead of us to continue driving long-term growth for domino's outside the u.s.
so in closing, i'm pleased with our third quarter results. our outstanding franchisees and operators continue to battle through a challenging set of circumstances, while delivering strong growth for the domino's brand around the world. these passionate dominoids combined with our outstanding unit level economics, position us incredibly well for the future. there is no doubt that we will continue to experience challenges with covid, with staffing, and other factors. we also expect inflationary headwinds to continue impacting domino's and the broader restaurant industry over the coming quarters. but we will face all of these challenges and headwinds from a position of strength and with the unwavering commitment of our franchisees and team members who proudly wear the domino's logo. my team and i are proud to serve them each and every day. so thank you again for joining us today. and we'll now be happy to take your questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from brian bittner with oppenheimer.
brian bittner -- oppenheimer -- analyst
good morning. ritch, the labor staffing issues was obviously highlighted as an incremental challenge in the quarter. do you guys have any data to try to help us on the outside, quantify how these capacity and service issues from labor staffing challenges may be impacted the trends in the quarter and also the staffing issues, are they specifically preventing you from deploying traffic driving initiatives throughout the system like utilizing the 50% boost weeks etc.? thanks.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure, brian. thanks for the question. yes, staffing has been a challenge most certainly during the quarter as we highlighted. it -- i don't have a lot to share with you today in terms of specific stats about what that headwind is on the comp because it's always difficult to say what sales might have been without staffing challenges. but what i can tell you is that when you look at the third quarter relative to the first half of the year, we certainly saw more of an impact in the system around some things like reduced operating hours and some challenges with respect to delivery service times in particular.
and when we look at it in our own corporate store business, we certainly saw our staffing levels relative to ideal were lower than we saw during the first half of the year. so the impact on the comp in the u.s. was more pronounced in the third quarter than it was in the second quarter. and as it relates to how we think about the business going forward, the staffing challenges do impact our ability to be more aggressive, as it relates to promotional activities in the marketplace.
so we're continuing obviously to monitor the levels across our system. in our corporate store business, we are doing things proactively, like looking at our wages, compensation for our team members, and as i spoke about earlier, working across the system, rolling out an applicant tracking system to help with team member acquisition and hiring. and then we're also working on a number of operational improvements inside of our stores to allow us to operate more efficiently and frankly with less labor for every order that goes out.
and then finally i'd just highlight the carryout business will continue to be a focus of ours given the significantly lower amount of labor involved in those transactions in the fact that's been a big growth driver for us anyway. we're going to continue pushing there.
brian bittner -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thanks.
operator
our next question comes from peter saleh with btig.
peter saleh -- btig -- analyst
great, thank you. so, ritch, you mentioned on couple of occasions, the impact of the labor challenges on the comps, but can you talk a little bit about the labor challenges and maybe the impact on the industry on independents. are you seeing more closures there? i suspect, if you're seeing these issues and feeling these issues on labor that you're competitive set is feeling it just as much if not more. any comments on closures in the industry?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
hey, pete, thanks. i certainly believe that the staffing challenges are impacting the restaurant industry more broadly. as i take a look across the industry and talk to leaders in the industry, it's certainly a common theme that you hear. in terms of how that's impacting independents. i don't have great statistics for you about what's going on with closures there, but i can tell you that i think the impact of staffing and rising labor costs and also frankly rising commodity costs, where independents are typically less able to buy -- are less able to buy with the scale and also to lock-in pricing as the larger players like we are, i suspect that there is a lot of pressure on the p&l among some of the independents and smaller regionals out there.
peter saleh -- btig -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from brian mullan with deutsche bank.
brian mullan -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, thank you. ritch, last fall, you indicated the carryout order counts in the u.s. had not quite reached the 2019 levels. just wondering if they got back to even or close to in the third quarter relative to where they were in 2019? we know that country was doing with delta, but there is also a broad reopening. so just any color on the carryout business, quarter counts would be great.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure. when we look at our carryout order counts, we are still not quite back to where we were two years ago on carryout order counts despite having positive carryout same store sales in the third quarter. but it continues to be a focus for us and an area where we continue to see strong opportunity to continue the long-term growth trajectory of that side of the business. we just launched these dips and twists that just went on air this week, as just yet another tool coming from our innovation team to help us continue to push carryout and push it at that $7.99 hero price point that we've got there.
brian mullan -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from john glass with morgan stanley.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks very much. it's just two follow-ups. one is, is the labor issue most focused on drivers that would make that maybe more of a delivery company issue or do you think is it in the restaurants as well? i just want to make sure we understand if it's more specific to your type of business versus others. and can you talk about, i know you talked about independence, but is there -- how do you think you are on a market share basis this quarter, just so we can understand how maybe you think you're doing versus your largest peers? do you expect you have insight into that if you gain share, lose share, is everyone sort of in the same boat given the external factors you've cited?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
thanks, john. first on the labor. what i would tell you is that it is more pronounced with respect to drivers. but we see labor challenges really across our business and as i look broadly across the industry, the restaurant industry, both the retail side and the distribution side of that, i think -- and frankly among suppliers, i think labor continues to be a significant challenge and you look at the number of open job positions across the u.s. right now. it's a pretty staggering number and a lot of those are certainly related to our industry. but drivers in particular have been challenging as we look over the last -- the third quarter.
and then as it relates to market share. we don't get great real-time data on that and we always take -- when we do get it on a quarterly basis, we always like to say a few quarters a trend before we get really comfortable about what these external views of the market look like. but we do continue to believe that we and the larger players in the market continue to gain share at the expense of some of the smaller chains and some of the locals.

our next question comes from jared garber with goldman sachs.
jared garber -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. obviously labor continues to be a topic of discussion, but i wanted to maybe taking a little bit of a different route, the offset there would obviously be pricing. so, ritch, i wanted to ask, how you're thinking about pricing across the menu and if there's any thoughts about maybe potentially increasing those $5.99 and $7.99 platforms that you're so well known for? and just how you think about offsetting some of these highly inflationary pressures?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure, jared, thanks. as we are -- currently as we do on a very frequent basis, taking a look at our price points, we test them on a pretty frequent basis over time and really with an eye to what are the price points in the marketplace that can help us to drive long-term profitable growth for our franchisees. so, we are certainly taking a look at those again. here as we look forward into 2022, there are cost pressures across the business as you highlight both on the labor side, but also inflationary pressures as it relates to commodities as well.
so we're taking all of those things into account as we think about what our pricing looks like in 2022. and what i'll tell you there is that we will as always do it with the long-term profitable growth of the franchisees in mind. and while we are wedded to value, we are not specifically wedded to any individual price points and if a better price point yields better long-term profitable growth for our franchisees and that's where we're going to go.

our next question comes from andrew strelzik with bmo.
andrew strelzik -- bmo -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking my question. i appreciate the commentary on some of the sales constraints that you mentioned. but i'm just curious. i know historically, you said these are two distinct occasions. but do you think as we're kind of normalizing from an operating environment perspective and trying to find an equilibrium or normal, do you think you're seeing more switching between carryout and delivery or do you continue to believe that that's really not the case even having this unique period here? thanks.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
yes, it's a great question because and as you highlight, historically, we've not seen a lot of switching across those two service methods. and in fact, only about 15% of customers would go back and forth between the two. but it's an interesting question that i think opens up to your point, as we work our way out of covid and as we and across the industry continue to see some of these staffing challenges and labor cost increases, which do result in higher delivery fees as jessica highlighted earlier. we've seen some increase in our single transparent delivery fees across markets and we've certainly seen prices go up as it relates to delivery charges or even what it takes you to go across the town when you hail an uber or a lyft.
so i think it's an -- i think it is an open question as to how much more switching we might see when the cost of delivery continues to rise for consumers. so those are some of the things that we're obviously thinking about and testing here. we're also really pushing on this car side delivery as a service method to try to make things significantly more convenient for customers to pick up product, eliminating the need to go into the store and pay and carry your own food out. we think it's a significant improvement in the consumer experience and may tip some more consumers over to come into the carryout channel as opposed to delivery.
andrew strelzik -- bmo -- analyst
good. thank you.

your next question comes from john ivankoe with jpmorgan.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, thank you very much. the question is on u.s. unit development. certainly, we understand labor, we understand the construction-related issues. but there was a comment made that fortressing is affecting company stores more than franchise stores. and if you look at -- excuse me, company store development is up something like 5% year-over-year, the comp is down, whatever it is at 8.9. if one were to assume that half of that comp decline was due to fortressing, would basically mean that the new stores actually aren't -- are basically getting all their volume from nearby stores.
i know that's, it's very bad math to mentioned this on the conference call, but the numbers are -- could potentially look fairly exaggerated in terms of the amount of sales transfer that's happening to a new store that acts as a fortress store. so can you comment on just kind of what the current algorithm is important seeing, i mean, when you open new stores for both company and franchise, the percentage of sales that is expected to get on its own versus the percentage of sales that expects to get elsewhere and considering the labor and the construction environment that we've talked about? are you prepared to talk about how materially lower potentially fiscal '22 development in the u.s. could be relative to '21, which i think would be consistent with some comments that you made of units being delayed in the overall u.s. system? thanks.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
hey, john, i'll try to pick off some of the parts of your question there. first of all on u.s. unit development, i'll just make a macro comment overall. there is still a very healthy demand out there among our franchisee base for unit development. i've highlighted some of the challenges in the near term of getting these stores open, but when we take a look at the profit -- four-wall profitability at the store level and the resulting cash-on-cash returns for domino's, which is ultimately what drives the store growth is still very, very strong.
and as we continue to desktop our models to take a look at what the u.s. holding capacity is for domino's stores, we continue to be very bullish about that holding capacity. i've talked about 8000 store potential in the past and we believe it's at least that if not more, as we continue to dust it off. when we open new stores, a significant portion of those are fortress stores in that they do take some number of addresses from existing stores service areas. when we take a look at the impact that that has on the comp, i have spoken in the past about that being a 1.0 and 1.5 or so. if you take a look at the third quarter, it was about a 1.0 when you look across the system and a bit higher than that on the corporate store side because to your point, we have been a little bit more aggressive in terms of percentage opens off the base, but also basically every store we open in our corporate store business is a fortress store.
but when we take a look at what the cash-on-cash return expectations are for those openings and we look at it not only on the individual new store, but we look at it on the impact of the store cluster that stores is a part of, we still see very positive returns on those stores and that's why we continue to be aggressive in the growth of our corporate stores. so fortressing is going to continue to be a key part of our strategy, john, and i haven't seen anything in the quarter that gives me any sense that we should be slowing down. there is still a lot of opportunity out there to continue opening domino's stores around the country.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and just because i think that there's going to be such a point of conversation and can you give us at least a soft guide of '22 u.s. development relative to '21? is that something that you're prepared to do at this point?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
we're not going to do that today, john.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan -- analyst

our next question comes from gregory francfort with guggenheim.
gregory francfort -- guggenheim -- analyst
hey, i -- my question is on the technology piece. but you have staffing as a percent of maybe where your target was in the quarter. just any quantification on that. but my question is, ritch, i know you've been putting a lot of investments and focus on upgrading the technology platforms pulse 2.0. can you just help us understand where that stands and when that may have an impact on the business? thanks.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure. yes, greg, in terms of staffing relative to where we'd like it to be. i don't have a specific percentage to share with you today. it varies pretty significantly market by market because the labor markets around the country is so unique and obviously we've got direct visibility into the corporate store markets that we operate, but not direct visibility into all of our franchise locations, who obviously manage their own employment base.
on tech, i made brief reference to this earlier in my prepared remarks, but we had a really -- we've got a really exciting milestone over the course of the last several months where we now have our new version of pulse operating on a continuous basis in a live store. so, the team has just done a terrific job of developing that to the point where we've got the minimum viable product to have out in a store today that allows us to continue to test and learn. and our expectation is that we continue to expand the initial phase of that rollout with a few more stores this year and then as we continue to learn and improve the product, we'll be able to come back to you in subsequent quarters to give you a little bit more of a sense of the pace of rollout of that product.
but when we go in and have a look at how it's operating in the stores, it is easier to manage transactions inside the store and significantly easier to get new team members up to speed on the use of pulse. and then as it relates to our ongoing development and evolution of the product, the architecture that we've used with pulse is transformational for us in terms of our ability to respond more quickly and add enhancements and updates to the product versus the architecture that that the current version of pulse is on. so we're excited about it and you'll hear a lot more about it from us in the future.
gregory francfort -- guggenheim -- analyst
thanks.

our next question comes from david tarantino with baird.
david tarantino -- baird -- analyst
hi, good morning, ritch. i want to circle back on the issue related to staffing and get your thoughts on what you think needs to happen for you and the industry to get this resolved? it seems like the industry needs to consider maybe a structural step change and wage rates here and maybe much more aggressive than what's already been done. and i'm wondering if you agree with that. and then secondly, how your franchisees are approaching and it seems like they entered the year with all-time high profitability and should be willing to fund that to get the staffing levels, right. but maybe i'm missing that. so any perspective you can offer would be helpful?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
yes, david, it's a great question and i can tell you it's something we spend a lot of time on around here each and every day and have a lot of conversations with our operators and franchisees about it. when you think about what has to happen in the labor market for our industry, i think there are a couple of things that are under our control and then there are a couple of things that are more macro factors. if i start with kind of the -- with the macro factors, most certainly there have been a significant number of americans who have removed themselves from the workforce over the course of covid and haven't come back yet. if you look at labor force participation rates, they are down rather significantly from pre-covid.
we have not seen it yet as much as we would like, but we do expect there to be some relaxing of the labor market as covid continues to subside and as folks get more comfortable, have more options to care for their children, etc., to get back out into the workforce. i have no doubt that this delta variant over the course of the last several months has made that recovery more challenging. we also have not had much in the way of immigration into the u.s. here over the course of the last couple of years and in a country whose population is not growing as it used to, we in our industry and a number of others will need to see more immigration, i think, to continue to have a robust workforce, particularly in the younger age groups.
so, there's the macro things that we can't really control. what we spend our time thinking about is what we can control. wages is one of those levers. i spoke earlier about the fact that we have made some significant moves in our own corporate store business and we've done that in our supply chain business as well. and as we talk to franchisees, we don't control their employment practices or wages, but we hear from many franchisees that they are also investing in their team members and frankly with the profitability levels that we have in our stores, we are much better positioned than many players in the restaurant industry to be able to invest in our teams.
but then also as an industry and as a company, we also have to think about the jobs themselves and how do we make those jobs easier and more appealing to team members and we're spending a lot of time on that inside our business and piloting a number of exciting things in our corporate stores where we're looking fundamentally at the jobs themselves. how do we make it easier, how do we keep drivers in their cars 100% of the time and not have them do tasks inside the stores that they don't enjoy doing and that don't drive tips for them, how do we bring more technology into the stores to allow us to operate more efficiently with fewer labor hours per unit of sales. so, we're looking at all of these elements and while it's a challenge, i feel like we're very well positioned with the profitability that we've got in our stores and also really well positioned just based on the innovation and technology teams that we've built over time who -- this is power alley for them to go in and figure out how to solve these problems alongside our great operators.
david tarantino -- baird -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from dennis geiger with ubs.
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
great, thanks for the question, ritch you talked about the impact from the waning benefits of stimulus and specifically curious if you're kind of able to identify any specific shifts that you've seen in customer behavior from that benefit feeding or anything else that would think you would kind of point out that's changed from 2q into 3q with them -- with that benefit starting to fade some? thank you.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
yes, dennis. thanks for the question. we saw a boost back in the second quarter when the $1400 stimulus payments went out. you had the one-time payment and then you also had the unemployment, which was introduced at that time and ultimately completed i believe in the first or second week of september. and i think what we saw was as consumers spent off that $1400 and as some of those unemployment benefits waned, the impact was really more pronounced we believe on our delivery business than it was on the carryout business. so i think we had more customers with money in their pockets also worried about covid and more of those were ordering delivery into their homes and we saw that taper off in the third quarter relative to what we saw in the second quarter.
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
makes sense. thanks, ritch.
operator
our next question comes from lauren silberman with credit suisse.
lauren silberman -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you. another one on labor. more broadly, it feels like some structural headwinds increased competition from three of your platforms, people have left the industry and then just higher manual labor costs. a follow-up in response to david's question, can you expand on the technology you're exploring to address labor headwinds over the medium to long term like automation, perhaps more so than you would have considered call it six to 12 months ago?
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
sure. lauren, and we're looking at that really in several areas of our business at the store level, which we've spent most of the time talking about today. one of the key things that we're working on is in an environment where driver staffing is one of the constraints. key question is how do you keep drivers in their car more and how do you get more deliveries per hour through those drivers. we introduced some time ago our gps tools that are in the hands of drivers. that's a core technology that helps them to be more efficient.
the technology underpinning of domino's car side delivery and the operational practices that we've instituted around that are also key ways for us to think about driving more efficiency with our delivery drivers because if we can identify when a customer pulls into the parking lot and run a pizza out to that customer's car, there's no reason why and we're doing it in a lot of stores around the country. no reason why we can't just run pizzas out to drivers cars as well. and when i think about the domino's, i would like to see in the future, i don't see why drivers should ever have to get out of their cars. why can't we keep them turning to the store, back to the customer and maximizing deliveries per driver per hour, which also maximizes the wages that those drivers earn. so, there are number of different things going on there.
inside the stores, our next generation version of our point-of-sales system along with other store technology innovations are also helping us to get more productivity to drive more productivity in the stores. and then lastly, outside the stores if i shift gears over to our supply chain centers. as we build these new centers and as we go back and replace assets in existing centers, we're putting in place equipment and technology that reduce the amount of labor that is required to produce our dough balls and to manage the distribution of product out to our stores as well.
lauren silberman -- credit suisse -- analyst

and our last question will come from chris carril with rbc capital markets.
chris carril -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking the question. so i wanted to ask about the surprise frees promotion. i mean to what extent do you think the promotion helped to offset some of those declining stimulus tailwinds and other delivery headwinds that you had pointed out? and i think the promotion continues into november. so are you planning on marketing it more over these next few weeks? thanks.
ritch allison -- chief executive officer
yes, chris. we just rolled it out a few weeks back and we're getting a lot of exciting press out of it and i think it really -- it plays on attention, a consumer attention and that's one of the things we think about always when we think about great advertising at domino's is how does it play on a consumer attention. and consumers tell us that they get increasingly irritated about all of these fees that they get charged. so, we've decided to do the flip side of that and do surprise frees. so far, we're pleased with the customer reception to the campaign. we're going to continue to run it in the weeks ahead and excited about how that can continue to position domino's as the transparent and value-oriented player in the market. so, we remain excited about it. look forward to sharing results as the program continues to evolve and as we see how it behaves in the quarter. we look forward to talking to you about it in more depth when we report our fourth quarter results out.
chris carril -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. thank you.

with that, i'd like to turn the call over to jeff lawrence.
jeffrey lawrence -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, tim, and good morning everyone. in the third quarter, our positive global brand momentum continued, as we once again delivered great results for our shareholders. we continue to lead the broader restaurant industry with 30 consecutive quarters of positive us comparable sales and 99 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. we also continue to increase our global store count at a healthy pace.
our diluted eps was $1.95 which is an increase of 53.5% over the diluted eps, as adjusted, in the prior year quarter, which excluded the impact of our recapitalization completed in 2017. with that, let's take a closer look at the financial results for q3.
global retail sales grew 8.3% in the quarter. when excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 10.4%. this global retail sales growth was driven by increases in same-store sales and the average number of stores opened during the quarter. same-store sales for the us grew 6.3%, lapping a prior year increase of 8.4%. and same-store sales for our international division grew 3.3%, rolling a prior year increase of 5.1%.
breaking down the us comp, our franchise business was up 6.4%, while our company-owned stores were up 4.9%. both increases were driven primarily by higher order count in addition to some ticket growth, as consumers continue to respond positively to our overall brand experience.
our piece of the pie loyalty program once again contributed meaningfully to our traffic gains. our international comp for the quarter was driven entirely by order count growth. during the quarter, comps in our asia-pacific, americas and middle east regions were strong. and while still positive year-to-date, the comp in our european business was slightly negative for the quarter.
our teams on the ground are working hard with our european franchise partners to regain comp momentum. our retail sales growth in europe remains strong due to healthy store count growth and we remain optimistic, long-term, in the business there.
on the unit count front, we are pleased to report that we opened 59 net us stores in the third quarter, consisting of 61 store openings and 2 closures. our international division added 173 net new stores during q3, comprised of 192 store openings and 19 closures. on a total company basis, we opened 232 net new stores in the third quarter and 920 net new stores over the last 12 months, demonstrating the broad strength and attractive 4-wall economics our brand enjoys globally.
turning to revenues, total revenues were up $142.3 million or 22% from the prior year quarter. as a reminder, we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard in the first quarter of 2018. as a result, we are now required to report the franchise contributions to our not-for-profit advertising fund and the related expenses gross on our p&l.
although this did not have an impact on our reported operating or net income in the third quarter, it did result in an $82.5 million increase in our consolidated revenues. it is important to note, although these amounts are included in our financial statements, they are restricted funds that can only be used to support the domino's brand and are not available to be used for general corporate purposes.
the remaining $59.8 million increase in revenues resulted primarily from the following. first, higher food volumes driven by strong us retail sales resulted in higher supply chain revenues. second, higher us same-store sales resulted in increased royalties and fees from our franchise stores as well as higher revenues at our company-owned stores. store count growth also contributed positively to these increases. and finally, higher international retail sales resulted in increased international royalty revenues, but were partially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
fx negatively impacted international royalty revenues by $1.9 million versus the prior year quarter due to the dollar strengthening against certain currencies. for the full fiscal year 2018, we now estimate that the impact of foreign currency on royalty revenues could come in near the low-end of our prior 2018 guidance of flat to positive $4 million. as you know, there are many uncontrollable factors that drive the underlying exchange rates which makes this a harder part of our business to predict.
moving on to operating margin. as a percentage of revenues, consolidated operating margin for the quarter increased to 37.6% from 30.8% in the prior year quarter. this increase resulted entirely from the recognition of domestic franchise advertising revenues on our p&l from the new accounting guidance i mentioned previously. supply chain operating margin was negatively pressured by delivery and labor costs. procurement savings partially offset these margin pressures.
our supply chain center operations in both the us and in canada continue to have opportunities for improvement. we continue to invest heavily in both capacity and driving efficiencies in all of supply chain, and we remain committed to our franchise partners in making tangible headway in both capacity and efficiency in the near term. company-owned store margin was negatively impacted by higher food, labor and insurance expenses as compared to the prior year quarter.
g&a cost decreased $1 million as compared to the prior year quarter. this net decrease resulted primarily from a $5.9 million pre-tax gain on the sale of 12 company-owned stores, and a $4 million impact from the adoption of the revenue recognition guidance primarily related to the reclassification of certain advertising expenses out of g&a into domestic franchise advertising costs.
these decreases were partially offset by continued investments in our marketing, supply chain and corporate store teams as well as our planned investments in technological initiatives, including e-commerce and the teams that support them. please note that the company receives technology fees from franchisees that are recorded separately as franchise revenues.
we currently estimate that our g&a cost for the full year 2018 will come in near the low-end of our previously communicated range of $370 million to $375 million. keep in mind too that our g&a expense for the year can vary up or down based on, among other things, our performance versus plan, which affects variable performance-based compensation expense.
domestic franchise advertising costs were $82.5 million in the third quarter. as a reminder, we are now showing domestic franchise advertising in our revenues with an equal and offsetting amount of expense in our operating cost. interest expense increased $800,000 in the third quarter, driven by increased net debt from our most recent recapitalization. this increase was largely offset by $5.8 million of incremental interest expense recorded in the prior year quarter related to our 2017 recapitalization.
our weighted-average borrowing rate was flat as compared to the prior year quarter at 4.1%. our reported effective tax rate was 15.3% for the quarter, down significantly from prior year. this was primarily due to the lower federal statutory rate of 21% resulting from the federal tax reform legislation enacted at the end of 2017. the impact of tax benefits on equity-based compensation also resulted in a $7.4 million reduction in our third quarter provision for income taxes. this resulted in a 7.5 percentage point decrease in our effective tax rate.
we continue to expect that our ongoing tax rate, excluding the impact of equity-based compensation, will be 22% to 24%. we also expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to equity-based compensation. when you add it all up, our third quarter net income was up $27.7 million or 49% over the prior year quarter.
our third quarter diluted eps was $1.95 versus $1.18 last year, which was a 65.3% increase. as compared to our prior year diluted eps, as adjusted, of $1.27, our third quarter diluted eps increased 53.5%. here is how that $0.68 increase in diluted eps breaks down. our lower effective tax rate positively impacted us by $0.41, including a $0.31 positive impact from tax reform and a $0.10 positive year-over-year impact related to higher tax benefit on equity-based compensation.
lower diluted share counts, primarily as a result of share repurchases benefited us by $0.17. higher net interest expense, resulting primarily from a higher net debt balance negatively impacted us by $0.09; foreign currency negatively impacted royalty revenues by $0.02; and importantly, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.21 which includes $0.08 from the gain on the sale of company-owned stores.
now turning to our use of cash; during the third quarter, we repurchased and retired approximately 397,000 shares for $109 million at an average purchase price of approximately $275 per share. year-to-date, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.75 million shares for $429 million at an average purchase price of $245 per share.
we also returned $23.2 million to our shareholders in the form of a $0.55 per share quarterly dividend. all in all, our strong momentum continued and we are very pleased with our results for this quarter.
and with that, i'll turn it over to ritch.
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
thanks, jeff, and good morning everyone. i'm very pleased with our third quarter performance and i'm extremely proud of our great franchisees and operators around the world, particularly within our us business who executed at high levels during the quarter. our focus on global retail sales growth and franchisee economics continues to shape our steady, long-term strategy and approach.
my first three months on the job have only reinforced my point of view about what it takes to succeed in this business; the brand with the best people, the strongest franchisee relations, a focus on forward-thinking innovation; and most importantly, the courage to take smart risks and tackle the steep hills needed to create meaningful change and improvement will win. i am very proud to be leading an organization that continues to play the long game by taking this winning approach.
focusing first on the us business, it was an outstanding quarter with strong retail sales growth driven by a solid balance of same-store sales and unit growth. the launch of domino's hotspots and the paving for pizza program both generated terrific attention and are two good examples of how we continue to make news for the brand in unique and different ways.
we see these as more effective than the limited time offering, product of the month approach which differentiates us from others, not only in pizza, but across the qsr landscape. we continue to drive healthy traffic in order counts and as always, remain focused on our own strategy and execution rather than specific competitive or macro factors.
for years now, we've stressed the importance of franchisee profitability and cash-on-cash returns as important drivers of long-term growth for domino's or any restaurant brand. store openings are an obvious measure of the health of cash-on-cash returns, but it is also important to take a look at the rate of store closures.
closures are a key indicator of brand momentum and franchisee confidence. i am pleased to note that year-to-date in 2018, we have only closed seven stores in the us. i'm just going to repeat that; year-to-date in 2018, we have close just seven us stores while opening 140. i credit the many efforts related to sales and efficiencies made by our team and our franchisee-base toward the industry-leading unit economics that are keeping stores open and profitable.
on our last call, we spoke about the need to accelerate supply chain capacity to support our industry-leading retail sales growth. i am pleased to report that during the quarter, we opened our new state-of-the-art supply chain center in edison, new jersey; the first domino's us supply chain center to open in more than a decade.
i am very pleased to see us making progress on these efforts to expand capacity. and as jeff mentioned earlier, continuing to address needed efficiency improvements as we invest toward upgrading capabilities within our centers both old and new.
i'd like to call out one more event during the quarter that makes a big statement about the strength of the domino's brand. stan gage, a former member of the domino's leadership team left domino's and then became a 12 store franchisee in the carolinas. stan, in a familiar domino's story, started as a driver more than 30 years ago and worked his way up through the company. most recently he ran our company-owned stores.
i note this not only because it is one more outstanding talent to add to our nearly 800 franchisees in the us today, but also because it shows ultimate confidence in the brand. stan, we wish you all the best as you build your domino's business.
many of you have told us we make this look easy at times, but the retail sales results, franchisee energy and momentum within our us system don't come easily. they take hard work each and every day. the us business results are driven by a system, culture and collection of franchisees and corporate team members that refuse to be complacent or to rest on past success. this collective energy and drive motivates me and my leadership team each and every day.
turning to the international business, we had a good quarter, generating strong retail sales growth and improving store growth trends across all regions. three of our four regions delivered positive same-store sales with our europe region being the exception. while there is work to do in a few key markets, overall, i continue to be very pleased to see our international same-store sales growth being driven by order growth.
across the international business, our master franchisees continue to perform at a very high level with excellent unit economics. we have the best master franchisee partners in the restaurant business and we will continue to work closely with them in driving home elements from the proven playbook used in the us and many other markets including, customer insights, franchisee alignment, technology innovation, and a clear focus on value and transaction growth as the main drivers of top line results. we are a work-in-progress brand and we will never rest in our quest to achieve a dominant number one position in every market where we compete.
on the technology front, our hotspots program was featured front and center this past quarter. beyond any sales expectations at this early stage, the thing i'm most pleased with has been the incredible engagement from this program, with our customers, our franchisees and the media. hotspots received much attention because it is a program that is completely unique within our industry.
i couldn't be more proud at the store level execution of our franchisees and operators around the country as they delivered delicious domino's pizza to parks and beaches in more than 200,000 hotspots across the us. not all technology innovation is television commercial worthy and some that happens behind the scenes is as valuable as anything else. we continue to consider tech when discussing operational efficiencies with our franchisees, seeking to innovate and support their needs wherever possible. from this, we have recently incorporated voice and mobile capabilities into some of our store level activities, including inventory management and other areas.
while not a customer facing digital platform, which i'm still pleased to see us doing plenty of, these launches can also drive value. we are constantly striving to create a better experience in our stores. utilizing technology to benefit our franchisees, managers and store team members in ways that improve efficiencies and make their lives easier is something we will continue to do wherever and whenever possible.
in closing, i am pleased with our third quarter results. as i mentioned during my opening remarks, i am very proud to be part of a brand with such a winning attitude and mentality, a winning strategy and approach and a winning collection of people that are, no doubt, the best in the industry. this is what gives me the upmost confidence that we can maintain our energy, momentum and success.
and now, operator, we'll open it up for questions.

(operator instructions) our first question comes from the line of brian bittner of oppenheimer & co.
brian bittner -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
thank you, good morning guys. first question is, just when you look at the us business and you look at the fourth quarter last year, the comps of 4% in 4q last year was still obviously very solid, but it also was a very clear temporary slowdown that we saw in the business. can you just remind us what drove that temporary slowdown last year, so we can better understand your fourth quarter this year? was it mostly driven by external issues or internal issues in the fourth quarter last year?
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
brian, we were pleased with the fourth quarter last year. the 4.2% was within our three to five year outlook that we've been giving you guys for quite some time and we don't see any material -- didn't see any material challenges back then that gave us a cause for concern. when we take a look at the momentum in the business this year and on a multi-year stack looking backwards, we're very, very pleased with the performance.
brian bittner -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
okay, and just in the international business, i know your australian franchisee is going to be doing a conversion, how do you expect that to impact the international openings over the next few quarters?
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
we are in the midst with our partner domino's pizza enterprises of a conversion of hallo pizza in germany as we speak. so, brian, that is a work in progress and conversions are -- been happening for several months now and will continue to go forward in the months to come. we won't comment on any specific unit count impact as it's an ongoing process.
brian bittner -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
okay, thank you ritch.

our next question comes from the line of karen holthouse of goldman sachs.
karen holthouse -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking the question. this is the first quarter in a while that we've seen really only a moderate increase in year-over-year supply chain cost. is there anything specific you would point to that's sort of helping the cost curve there? is that early benefits of the new facility that's been opened in the us? are you starting to see changes on the freight or shipping side of things? really just any color there.
jeffrey lawrence -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes karen, it's jeff. in supply chain we've really taken our role as a franchisor. seriously we're investing materially as you know, both in capability building as well capacity building. as ritch mentioned in his prepared remarks, we were super excited to get our first supply chain center in more than a decade opened and running to our (inaudible) running down the line as we speak in edison, new jersey and that's something that we're going to continue to do.
it's a great division. guys are working really hard and our franchisees need that comfort that we're going to continue to get them high quality, safe food supply so that they have the confidence to continue to grow. they have that confidence in our supply chain. we're going to continue to invest again in even more capacity and more capabilities over time.
as i mentioned, i believe it was last quarter we raised our guidance on capex for 2018 to reflect the fact and the optimism and where we're going in the us business to pull forward supply chain centers number two and three in the us. so, lot of opportunity for improvement there like we have in lots of parts of our businesses, but it's a great business, a good roi and most importantly, getting good food supply to our franchisees in the us and canada.

our next question comes from the line of gregory francfort of bank of america.
gregory francfort -- bank of america -- analyst
hey, i got two questions for ritch. one is just a clarification, i think you said 3% to 5% long term algorithm, i think you meant 3% to 6%, just maybe clarify that. and then, the other question i had was just on the european sales and what the reason for the pressure there is and i guess what you're doing right now to address that market and maybe sort of bend the arc back?
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
sure, thanks greg. and yes, you are correct, 3% to 6% is our three to five year outlook. so thank you for correcting me on that. first, around the business in europe, our three other regions were very strong in q3, but within the europe region we've got a couple of markets where we've got some improvements to address and some of those are short term and some of those are going to take a little bit of time.
when i take a look at the business over there, the issues that we have are by and large in our master franchisees control and we share a joint commitment to take whatever steps we need to get the business back to the performance on comps that we're all used to. if you take a look at it, holistically in europe, i still feel very positive about our overall market position. we still have strong cash on cash returns across the region, and our retail sales growth performance has still been quite solid even in the face of a quarter where we didn't achieve the comp result that we'd like to see.
gregory francfort -- bank of america -- analyst

our next question comes from the line of david tarantino of baird.
david tarantino -- baird -- analyst
hi, good morning. my question is on the domestic unit growth. i think this is maybe the seventh year in a row where the pace of growth has increased and i think that's probably an outcome of your fortressing strategy. but just wondering if you'd expect that pace to continue to move higher as we move forward and is it possible, in your view, that we could see domestic growth in line with your long run target for the global unit growth outlook?
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
sure david. we're very pleased with what has now been a multi-year acceleration of the pace of unit growth in the us. and certainly, the strategy of fortressing and driving retail sales growth plays a big part of that. also, the fact that we have seen consistently improving over the last couple of years, store level profitability which, as we reported out to you has been in the mid-130s on a store level basis. that's driving a lot of confidence in the franchisee base in building new stores. you know you combine that with the fact that we've got a lot of stores out there in the us right now that are really busy.
on friday and saturday nights, we've got some stores where we have a tough time putting an incremental pizza in the oven because they're so busy. take all of that and you roll in a historically low rate of closures in the business and it's driven a nice acceleration and we're very optimistic about us store growth going forward. we've shared with you that we think the us, within a 10-year horizon, is an 8,000 store business. and so we're optimistic about the forward growth also.
david tarantino -- baird -- analyst
and ritch, maybe a related follow-up. are you seeing any signs of concern among the franchises related to the overall labor environment? i know the cash flows are still quite good but is there any sort of pause or concern you're seeing anywhere in the system in the us on development?
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
i think labor is tight in any business in the us today and we're certainly no exception to that, with unemployment now under 4% for a while. but our franchisees out there are making it happen and they're hiring drivers. the fact that our drivers are so busy helps us. when we take a look at what a driver can make at a domino's pizza relative to delivering or driving for some other businesses, it's very, very attractive.
but yes, labor pressures are certainly on the minds of -- on the minds of our franchisees. on the flip side of that, one of the things or the thing that drives sales of pizza, as much as anything, is having people gainfully employed and earning good wages out in the marketplace. so as the number one player in the pizza business, we also get a nice top side benefit from a strong labor market.
david tarantino -- baird -- analyst

our next question comes from the line of will slabaugh of stephens inc.
hugh gooding -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for taking my question. and this is actually hugh on for will this morning. i think this is really the first full quarter with the hotspots now in, and can you provide any learnings from the program and maybe any color on the adoption or topline contribution from this program?
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
yes, hotspots, it's been a really fun program for us. it's another one of our anywhere platforms with our goal of making domino's pizza accessible to our customers anytime and anywhere they want it. what i've been most pleased about on this is just the terrific brand engagement that we've seen on this platform and it starts with our franchisees who've set up these 200,000 plus hotspots around the country. our customers who've been excited about the program and also this has gotten a terrific amount of media attention as well which has been quite a bit of fun. so overall, we're quite pleased with the program.

(operator instructions) our next question comes from the line of matt mcginley of evercore isi.
matt mcginley -- evercore isi -- analyst
good morning. my question is on the g&a, when you back out that $5.9 million gain you had in the impact for asc 606, your g&a dollars were up about $10 million in the quarter. is that just a normal g&a increase or is there some sort of lumpiness in the quarter that that should go down. and just to confirm, the full year guide on g&a reflects that gain, meaning you went a little bit higher given that, that would have been an offset?
jeffrey lawrence -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes matt, it's jeff. the $370 million to $375 million remains the guide and that is inclusive of some of the noise that you see including the gains, so it's inclusive of that. we're guiding to the low end of that range or near the low end of that range, in part because of that gain that you saw from the store sales, so it kind of, i think, compensates for that a little bit.
as far as the rate and pace, what we're probably going to continue to give you is just one year at a time is our best guess on what's going to go into g&a because we are in such a dynamic environment. we have been in periods where we've decided to accelerate some strategic investments if we see the opportunity in the marketplace. and so, given one year at a time is what we feel responsible to do now. so any one quarter, you might always get some bounce around things like that. but $370 million to $375 million is what we'll invest this year. again, possibly at the lower end of that range.
but again, if we outperform in q4, that's going to go up. you have things like advertising that flows through on corporate stores and such. and if we underperform, we could be at even the lower end or below the range. so, i think the key point here is, is it continues -- the increases continue to go in strategic areas, it's in marketing, it's in analytics, it's in technology, it's in the things that are driving the profitable retail sales for franchisees around the world and that you're going to see more of, not less of, as we go forward.
matt mcginley -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of john glass of morgan stanley.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks very much. could you just talk a little bit about the us competitive environment? it's not lost on you or anyone on the call that one of your key competitors ceded some share this quarter but it's hard to see if you actually got a benefit or how much that benefit is, so -- and even what the store overlaps are? can you can you talk about; one, the overall us competitive environment and the changes? but specifically to that comment on the competitor that's losing share, do you pick it up or is it too hard to measure, because from the outside, it's hard to see if you picked up share from that or not?
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
yes, john. we're in -- as you're aware, we're in a very fragmented category and if we have a competitor donating share, it doesn't simply fall in our pocket, we've got to earn it. and sometimes, share that's donated doesn't necessarily all fall into the pizza category as well and that specific competitor has a relatively small share within the category. so the impact of this on the overall landscape isn't necessarily as heavy as some might assume.
when we take a look at the category overall, we're really more focused on our own competitive strategy than we are on kind of the short-term ups and downs with any specific competitor. and we think if we can continue to stay focused on bringing value to our customers and also on delivering terrific unit-level economics to our franchisees, we think we can continue to be successful and can continue to take share from competitors, small and large, in the pizza market.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got, it. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of peter saleh of btig.
peter saleh -- btig -- analyst
great, thanks. yes, i want to circle back on the category as well. can you guys talk a little bit about the growth of the pizza category? have you seen that growth moderate or accelerate at all? and then also, anything you can discuss on the closure rate of some of your competitors, primarily the independent operators. are you still seeing the closure rate accelerate and more closures in the system?
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
peter, first of all on the overall market, we aren't seeing any significant swings one way or another, on what is just a pretty steady low single-digit growth of the category in the us, and then globally the pizza category continuing to grow, we believe, in that 3% to 5% range. so no significant changes that we've seen there.
with respect to closures, as i commented earlier, in our business, very strong unit-level economics have led to our franchisees maintaining confidence in keeping their stores open, seven closures across the entire us year-to-today.
as you look elsewhere broadly across the industry, i don't have any specific comments about closures at competitors small or large, but what i will say is that overtime, my experience has always taught me that it's going to follow unit-level economics. and if we have players in the marketplace that are struggling to generate returns at the unit-level, then that's what's going to drive either closures on the downside or openings on the upside going forward.
peter saleh -- btig -- analyst
alright, thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from the line of sara senatore of bernstein.
sara senatore -- bernstein -- analyst
hi, thank you. ritch, you mentioned both value (technical difficulty) economic to franchisees but i think sometimes in other systems we see those in conflict and the system struggle to stay on message around value because of franchisee pushback. so maybe could you just address how you're franchising about value and consistency in that $5.99 price point. are there offsets that you're continually finding? is it the mix stays sort of a fixed amount? just trying to understand how you are able to be so consistent around value and others kind of float in and out?
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
sure. sara, i think you used exactly the right word in your question, which was the word consistent and that's really been the key within our system. so we've been on our $5.99 mix and match which is our hero offer in delivery. we've been on that for effectively about nine years now. and in our carry-out business, for multiple years now, we've been consistently at our $7.99 offer there.
and the key with value is consistency because it's really hard to offer those price points in the marketplace if you're not driving volume growth overtime. and you can't just jump on value for a quarter or for one promotional window and jump back out. that's just not a recipe to driving long-term transaction count gains in the business. and everything that we have experienced here at domino's in the us and in our other large international markets is that, it is that transaction count growth over time that correlates not only with sales growth but with profit growth.
and staying consistent and focused on that value has helped us to drive the kinds of unit level profitability numbers that you've seen from us over time. so consistency and alignment is the key. franchisees also have levers at their fingertips as well with local menu pricing, with how they price their delivery charges et cetera that allow them outside of the national price point to manage pricing and some of the profit dynamics in their business at a local level as well, and we think that mix of a strong consistent national price point with flexibility at the local franchisee level is the recipe for a profitable and growing business.
sara senatore -- bernstein -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from the line of chris o'cull of stifel.
chris o'cull -- stifel -- analyst
thanks. ritch, i had a follow-up regarding labor. several restaurant companies have stated they are having difficulty fully staffing the restaurants in the current market, and obviously this becomes a major concern if it hurts your customer service. so, are you able to monitor whether franchisees are properly staffing restaurants and can you tell us whether customer satisfaction or drive time performance has changed much in recent quarters?
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
we don't monitor franchisees staffing at the local level. they're independent business owners. and that's their job to track and manage their staffing at a local level. certainly, as we look broadly across the business, service is critically important to us and it plays, chris, into the fortressing strategy that we've been driving in the business.
getting our stores closer to the customer is going to help obviously with that service dimension, but also when we get our stores closer to the customer, our drivers can execute more runs per hour, because the distances are shorter and more runs per hour means happier customers and it also means more tips, which helps us to attract and retain delivery drivers into our business over time.
chris o'cull -- stifel -- analyst
have you seen a decline in customer satisfaction or changes in it in recent quarters?
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
no, we haven't seen any decline in customer satisfaction.
chris o'cull -- stifel -- analyst
great, thanks.

our next question comes from the line of alton stump of longbow research.
alton stump -- longbow research -- analyst
i just had a question, i think about (inaudible) delivery providers. a, is that sort of have any have bigger impact from what you can see on your demand and then; b, kind of how do we model out increased labor costs from a driver standpoint that are most likely going to result, of course, of the growth in easter party providers?
jeffrey lawrence -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey alton, it's jeff. on aggregators, we don't have that much more to add than what we've already said, been saying over the last 18 months to two years. it's more about what we're doing, our strategies, our great execution in more than 90 markets around the world, and we're -- as you see again we're hitting more often than not in that 8% to 12% global retail sales growth with really good flow through to the bottom line. so i don't think we have anything really to add to the conversation around this aggregator phenomenon other than to tell you that we're going to grow regardless.
alton stump -- longbow research -- analyst

our next question comes from the line of jeffrey bernstein of barclays.
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays -- analyst
great, thank you very much. just have a question on the unit growth. i mean it's hard to look at any system quarter-to-quarter, but there's a couple of quarters we've been sitting in the 6% range, which is the lower half, i guess of your 6% to 8% annual guidance and i recall last quarter there was talk about the international maybe coming in a little light of expectations.
so i was wondering if you could talk about whether the third quarter results saw the uptick you were anticipating or whether there is any reason why we might see more modest growth or particular regions that might see more modest growth on the international front, although as it does seem to imply a pretty big uptick as we think about fourth quarter growth and just wondering to get your thoughts there specific to the international?
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
thanks, jeff. first, keep in mind, that 6% to 8% unit growth outlook is a three to five year range in terms of outlook. specifically related to the third quarter, we were pleased to see the pickup in international growth, 173 net units in the third quarter. we were pleased with what we saw there and when we take a look forward at the medium and the long-term, we've got solid unit economics across the international business and that's across all of the regions that we operate in and that is really the leading indicator of what is going to -- that gives us confidence in that 6% to 8% unit growth range that we give you on a global basis. and then, as we've talked about previously on this call, the unit level economics in our business in the us also continue to be very, very strong and at a level of returns that encouraged our franchisees to invest their hard earned dollars into building domino's pizza stores.
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays -- analyst

our next question comes from the line of jeremy scott of mizuho.
jeremy scott -- mizuho -- analyst
hey, thank you. good morning. just bigger picture on international, the next 2,000, 3,000 stores versus the last 3,000 stores. can you talk about the difference in contributions from your core market versus some of your younger markets that were launched in that 2013 to 2015 period when i believe ritch you were leading the effort?
i have your long-term store targets in front of me, but just thinking about the momentum over the next three years which markets may surprise us and accelerate versus those that -- where the growth might level out. and then maybe just a follow-up on the previous comment, you mentioned that you share a joint commitment to drive business in your international franchisees. wondering if you can expand on that a little bit, is there a threshold of underperformance in a major market that would induce you to step up with capital support or is there something else that you had in mind? thanks.
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
sure. well, jeremy, i'll start with your first question. when i think about the composition of store growth in international, the good news there is that it has been a pretty balanced portfolio of growth if you look overtime, in that we continue to get strong store growth out of long established core markets and you've seen that in the last couple of years in places like the uk and australia for example, while also driving strong growth in some of the newer or more emerging markets that we've got around the world and you've seen a lot of units over the last couple of years come from places like india and russia and brazil and places that are relatively undeveloped for it.
when i take a look forward, honestly i don't see a lot of change in that dynamic. we still have very attractive unit level returns in our core markets and also a good bit of wide space for growth in those markets. if you take a look at the top 15 markets that we operate in by unit count, there's still another 4,000 or 5,000 units of opportunity available in those places.
and then beyond that, markets that wouldn't appear on that list, like places like, china and russia and places like that, we're optimistic about the forward growth in some of those emerging markets as well. and having this balanced portfolio really helps us overtime, because frankly not all markets are going to be performing at any particular point in time, so you need that balanced portfolio to be able to consistently drive unit growth in that 6% to 8% range.
i'll turn now to your second question. we have a really deep partnership with our master franchisees around the world and i think that is one of the things that has allowed us to be successful over a sustained period of time. so our teams work side by side with our master franchisee teams to make sure that we're driving the business forward with our customers in those marketplaces, but also working hand-in-hand on the unit level economics in the business as well.
so, it's not so much stepping in with capital or other financial support as it is really making sure that we're taking the best of the learnings that we have whether that's from here in the us or from the more than 85 countries that we operate in and making sure that we don't repeat some of the same mistakes and making sure that we take advantage of those things that work. so that's how we look at it, is really a partnership that is driven by a shared set of expectations and a shared opportunity to create value for dpz and for our master franchisees.
jeremy scott -- mizuho -- analyst

our next question comes from the line of john ivankoe of jpmorgan.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, thank you. ritch, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about taking risk and climbing steep hills and i did think that in and of itself was an interesting quote. and then secondly, jeff and i think it was you at -- perhaps in answer to a question that talked about looking at g&a one year at a time which i understand, but also you mentioned accelerating strategic investment.
so i guess maybe i'm trying to connect two things that aren't necessarily directly connected, but what does that mean in terms of your future spend in g&a? obviously this year $370 million to $375 million. but going forward, are you the organization at this point that wants to spend more-get more or are you beginning to think about potentially getting leverage out of the dollars spent that you're currently committed to?
jeffrey lawrence -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes john, this is jeff. the first thing i would tell you is the overarching way that we view the business is to be front footed and really try to invest to get the gains that we want. we're not going to take our foot off the gas pedal and just hope that things continue to get better or we can continue to perform in a high fashion.
we really want to make sure that we're targeted with incremental investments in the areas that we think are going to drive the consumer experience, drive great franchise economics; all those things rolled together, hopefully we can do double digit retail sales growth out into the next three to five years. we are not a brand that is going to circle a number and say, you know g&a must be this percentage of revenues or this percentage of retail sales. we think that that's limiting and we think that that ultimately -- if we had that kind of mentality over the last three, five, 10 years, we would not be sitting in a competitive position that we are today.
so, we are going to continue to be front footed. we're going to continue to take smart risks. to ritch's prepared remarks, i've been at the brand now for almost 19 years. i think the courage that patrick, and now ritch, have shown, our franchisees have shown to take on the really difficult challenges of the quick service restaurant industry and continue to fight through them and win is really energizing not only for the folks here in this building, but more importantly, the franchisees and team members in 90 markets around the world.
so we're going to continue to be front footed. we're going to continue to try to make the right choices, but we're not going to run off the clock john. we are going to be aggressive and try to grow share.

alex slagle -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks, good morning. as you think about building traffic over the next couple of years, how do you envision the balance between building frequency of existing guests, where you've done a great job with loyalty and analytics versus the opportunity to accelerate growth in new customer visits and perhaps thoughts on how you go about identifying those groups and reeling them into the domino's loyalists?
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
sure. well, first and foremost the opportunity is there to continue to drive frequency among folks that buy from domino's already. and when the loyalty program was first developed, our piece of the pie rewards program three years ago, the foundation of that program was built on driving frequency. that's why points are earned based on the number of purchases as opposed to the amount of dollars that are spent. so as we look across the landscape, we still see a significant amount of opportunity to get the customers who buy from us already to buy more.
also, getting trial is important as well and reducing these kinds of veto votes that may keep folks away from domino's is important. that's one of the reasons that you saw one of the few product introductions that we've done over the last couple of years was salads and that was a way to attract potentially some customers and some households into the brand that maybe otherwise weren't using us before. but i see -- i still see lots of opportunity in driving frequency.

hi, thanks for taking the question. first, a clarification, i believe last year, at least according to my notes, there was roughly a 50 basis point headwind to us same store sales from the hurricanes. so first, is that correct? second is, was there one this year from florence? and then, the question is for ritch, is there any sort of level of us market share that you feel like domino's could get to or perhaps some other metrics that you're looking at where you'd consider monetizing the technology platform to other operators outside your franchise base?
jeffrey lawrence -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey jon, this is jeff. i'll take your comp/hurricane question and then i'll kick it over to ritch for the second part of your question. the short answer is, last year and in this year we did not see a material either benefit or detriment to the us comp because of weather, including hurricanes or anything else. to the extent that we do see measurable stuff like that in the future, we'll point it out, but it's -- i know everybody in the industry likes to talk about weather when things aren't as good, but for us it wasn't either last year or this year, a material part of our comp performance.
richard e. allison -- chief executive officer
and then jon, to the second part of your question on market share. one of the great things about this segment of the qsr industry is that, we as the market leader still only sell about one in six pizzas that are sold in the us and only about one in 15 that are sold outside the us. so i think there is significant headroom for market share growth.
if you take a look at benchmarks across other segments of qsr whether you're looking at burgers or coffee or chicken or other places, the market leader is typically going to have a 25% or higher share and we see that in some of our own domino's businesses around the world as well. so in my opinion, lots of room to continue to grow.
and that's really where we're focused, is on continuing to do what we do really well. i like the fact that we have more than 300,000 people around the world wearing the domino's logo who wake up every day and think about selling more domino's pizza. and as long as we've got a lot of runway for growth, i want to remain focused and not distracted by trying to take some elements of our business across to other brands or other sectors of the restaurant industry.
jon tower -- wells fargo -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
our final question comes from the line of stephen anderson of maxim group.

one comment you want to make is on your commodity outlook, i just want to see if there has been any change to that and if you're looking at any trends heading into 2019?
jeffrey lawrence -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes stephen, this is jeff. our guidance for 2018, as you may recall, is 2% to 4% up on the food basket that our us franchisees are expecting. we're not updating that guidance at this point. year-to-date we're in that kind of 3% to 4% range, so we're at the high end of that, but our franchisees have done a great job at executing at the local level, driving volume and continuing to drive really good dollar profit in their operations. so, no change to the food basket guidance in 2018. and as far as it relates to 2019, we're not giving any commentary or guidance on that today.
stephen anderson -- maxim group -- analyst
alright, thank you.
