operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the q4 2020 akamai technologies, inc. earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, tom barth, head of investor relations.
thank you. please go ahead, sir.
tom barth -- head of investor relations
thank you, operator. good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining akamai's fourth quarter and fiscal-year 2020 earnings conference call. speaking today will be tom leighton, akamai's chief executive officer; and ed mcgowan, akamai's chief financial officer. before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance.
these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, the factors, including stemming from the covid-19 pandemic and any impact from unexpected geopolitical developments. additional information concerning these factors is contained in akamai's filings with the sec, including our annual report on 10-k and quarterly reports on form 10-q. the forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on february 9, 2021. akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.
as a reminder, we will be referring to some non-gaap financial metrics during today's call. a detailed reconciliation of gaap and non-gaap metrics can be found under the financial portion of the investor relations section of akamai.com. and with that, let me turn the call over to tom. 
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
thanks, tom. and thank you all for joining us today. i'm pleased to report that akamai delivered excellent results for both the fourth quarter and the full year in spite of extraordinary challenges that we all faced in 2020. q4 revenue was $846 million, up 10% over q4 in 2019 and up 8% in constant currency.
this strong result was driven by the continued rapid growth of our security business and continued high-traffic levels on our intelligent edge platform. non-gaap operating margin in q4 was 30%, up 1 point over q4 in 2019. and q4 non-gaap eps was $1.33 per diluted share, up 8% year over year and up 6% in constant currency. for the full year, we surpassed our expectations on the top of the lines, setting new records for our business and positioning us well in the future.
full-year 2020 revenue was $3.2 billion, up 11% over the prior year in constant currency and topping the $3 billion mark for the first time in our history. we're especially pleased to report that we expanded non-gaap operating margin to 31% in 2020, over achieving our target of 30%. this is up dramatically from 24% in 2017. i think it's worth noting that we achieved this expansion over the past three years while also investing for future growth.
non-gaap eps for 2020 was $5.22 per share, up 16% over 2019, and exceeding $5 per share for the first time. we also generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations last year, up 15% over 2019 and representing 38% of revenue. our security portfolio continued to be the fastest-growing part of our business in q4, generating revenue of $296 million, up 23% year over year in constant currency. for the full year, security revenue exceeded $1 billion and grew 25% over 2019.
this puts akamai in rare company as new firms generate more than $1 billion in annual revenue from cybersecurity solutions and fewer still grew at 25% last year. security represented one-third of our revenue last year, which is up 29% -- up from 29% in 2019 and 24% in 2018. bookings were especially strong for our prolexic service in q4 as we helped dozens of major enterprises defend against a huge wave of ransom ddos attacks that began in q3. ddos production has been a mainstay of our portfolio for years and has never been more relevant for customers.
we also saw strong bookings for our bot manager solution. op manager helps defend against credential abuse attacks, which are about four times greater in 2020 than the year before. 2020 was also a strong year for innovation with the release of page integrity manager and secure web gateway. bookings for both are off to an excellent start as enterprises increasingly need to deal with malware, third-party software and applications.
and the addition of secure web gateway to our enterprise threat protector service better positions us to compete in the fast-growing enterprise security market. we were also pleased to close our acquisition of asavie in q4, which helps advance our security capabilities for cellular devices and networks. new asavie customers signed after the integration include a national health agency which adopted asavie to secure its covid vaccination application, and digital promise, a nonprofit organization that works to close the digital learning gap for students with equitable access to technology. our media and carrier division also delivered a strong fourth quarter as a result of continued high levels of traffic for ott video services and downloads of e-gaming software.
on november 10, traffic on the akamai platform reached an all-time high of 181 terabits per second, 50% greater than the peak in 2019. nobody in the marketplace comes anywhere close to our capacity to serve customers at the edge on a global scale. in fact, we already exceeded last year's traffic peak just last week. on the application performance side of the business, q4 was a crucial quarter for e-commerce with major buying events, such as black friday and singles day.
the unmatched reliability, scale, global reach and security of our intelligent edge platform is a major reason why 40 of the world's top 50 retailers and 23 of the top 25 in the u.s. use akamai to accelerate their commerce applications. overall, we're very pleased with our performance last year on both the top and bottom lines, and i want to thank our employees for enabling akamai to achieve such strong results as they cope with the challenges of the pandemic. as we look to the future, we see substantial opportunity for enterprises to increase their use of the akamai intelligent edge platform.
we believe the edge is where new applications and new business models will come to life, where intelligence will be built into how data is collected and analyzed, where the promise of 5g and iot will be realized and where security will provide the online world's first and most important line of defense. to better take advantage of these opportunities and to better serve our customers, we announced today that we'll be realigning our organization around two major groups of products, products that enable business online and products that protect business online. both product groups will be supported with a single, unified sales organization. products that enable business online will be the focus of our new edge technology group, which will be led by adam karon as coo and general manager.
this group will be responsible for our media delivery, web performance and edge computing solutions, as well as the edge platform that underpins everything we do. these products generate about two-thirds of our total revenue today with strong margins and cash generation to fuel our innovation firepower. the group's mission is twofold: first, to ensure that our edge platform remains the unparalleled market leader for scale, performance, reliability, ease of use, agility and cost; and second, to generate additional growth through the innovation of new products and services for emerging customer needs in areas such as iot, 5g and serverless computing. products that protect business online will come together in a new security technology group to be led by rick mcconnell as president and general manager.
this new group will be responsible for all our security solutions, including our market-leading web security products, such as kona site defender, bot manager and prolexic; our enterprise security products, such as enterprise application access and enterprise threat protector; and our carrier security products, such as our d&s-based secure business offering and our new secure mobile service from asavie. in 2021, we'll go to market with a unified, mobile sales organization to better serve our customers, deepen our channel relationships and provide our customers and partners with easier access to the full breadth of our portfolio. p.j. joseph, who previously led our sales for media and carrier, will lead global sales, reporting to me.
as part of the new alignment, bobby blumont will become our chief technology officer to guide innovation and be an evangelist for our technology vision and leadership in the marketplace. kim salem-jackson, who has successfully led akamai field marketing and global communications for the last three years, will become our new chief marketing officer as part of a plan of transition. kim will succeed monique bonner, who has done a fabulous job of transforming our marketing organization over the last four-and-a-half years. mo will stay on with akamai in a senior advisory role, which will allow her to devote more time to her family while still ensuring the success of key marketing initiatives currently under way.
you can read more about our organizational announcement in the press release issued today, and you'll be able to hear directly from our leadership team at our investor summit on february 25, where we will outline our strategy and plans to drive akamai's next phase of growth. akamai made amazing contributions to the world in 2020, but we believe the best is yet to come. looking ahead, we have the potential to greatly expand our business in enterprise and carrier security as we strive to further grow our leadership position in web security. we plan to grow the capacity of our unparalleled intelligent edge platform by another order of magnitude as we continue to improve our market-leading performance reliability.
we seek to bring innovative new services to market to support emerging iot and serverless computing applications. we want to help enable the world to take advantage of the incredible potential of 5g. and we'll continue our efforts to build value for our shareholders with our world class talent, technology leadership, strong profitability and cash generation to fuel our future growth. now i'll turn the call over to ed to provide further details on our 2020 results and the outlook for 2021.
ed?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
thank you, tom. as tom outlined, akamai delivered another excellent quarter in q4. we were very pleased to exceed the high end of our guidance range on revenue and earnings. q4 revenue was $846 million, up 10% year over year or 8% in constant currency, driven by another quarter of very strong security growth, higher-than-expected gaming traffic and the weaker u.s.
dollar. revenue from our web division was $438 million, up 5% year over year or 4% in constant currency. revenue growth for this group of customers was again led by our security business. and while we saw stronger-than-expected seasonal traffic growth from some of our retail and commerce customers, other customers in this vertical and in our travel and hospitality vertical continued to be negatively impacted by the pandemic.
revenue from our media and carrier division was $408 million, up 15% year over year or 14% in constant currency. as noted, we benefited from higher-than-expected gaming and video traffic, along with continued momentum in security. revenue from the internet platform customers was $58 million, up 11% from the prior year and above our expectations due to higher-than-expected traffic. security revenue for the fourth quarter was $296 million, up 24% year over year and 23% in constant currency, driven by continued global demand across our web security product portfolio and higher-than-expected revenue from our recently closed asavie acquisition.
asavie contributed approximately $8 million in q4, driven by a combination of much better-than-expected strength in the educational vertical and a faster-than-expected revenue ramp from a recently added carrier in the u.s. foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $6 million on a sequential basis and positive $9 million on a year-over-year basis. international revenue was $379 million, up 16% year over year or 13% in constant currency. sales in our international markets represented 45% of total revenue in q4, up 3 points from q4 2019 and consistent with q3 levels.
finally, revenue from our u.s. market was $467 million, up 5% year over year. moving now to costs. cash gross margin was 76%, in line with our expectations.
gaap gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 64%. non-gaap cash operating expenses were $280 million, slightly above our guidance, in part, due to higher sales commissions given the revenue outperformance we saw in q4. moving on to profitability. adjusted ebitda was $364 million, up $45 million or 14% from the same period in 2019.
our adjusted ebitda margin was 43%, up 2 points from q4 2019. non-gaap operating income was $256 million, up $34 million or 15% from the same period last year. non-gaap operating margin came in at 30%, up 1 point from last year and in line with our guidance. capital expenditures in q4, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $195 million.
gaap net income for the fourth quarter was $113 million or $0.68 of earnings per diluted share. it is worth noting that our q4 gaap results include two onetime items: a $27 million restructuring charge, primarily related to the company realignment that tom mentioned; and a $20 million additional endowment to the akamai foundation. non-gaap net income was $220 million or $1.33 of earnings per diluted share, up 8% year over year, up 6% in constant currency and $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range due to higher-than-expected revenues. taxes included in our non-gaap earnings were $39 million based on a q4 effective tax rate of approximately 15%.
now i will discuss some balance sheet items. as of december 31, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $2.5 billion. after accounting for the $2.3 billion of combined principal amounts of our two convertible notes, net cash was approximately $197 million as of december 31. now i'll review our use of capital.
during the fourth quarter, we spent $73 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 700,000 shares. we ended q4 with approximately $572 million remaining on our previously announced share repurchase authorization. our long-term plan remains to leverage our share buyback program to offset dilution resulting from equity compensation over time. i'm very proud of all of our employees who delivered these outstanding q4 and 2020 results, especially during a very challenging year for us all.
now before i provide guidance, i thought it would be helpful to talk about how we see the year unfolding and highlight some key items you may want to consider as you build your models. our revenue outlook assumes that the pandemic-related impacts to areas like work from home and travel will last at least for the first half of 2021. as a result, we expect to see continued challenges in our retail and travel verticals. from a traffic perspective, as life returns to a more normalized pre-pandemic state, we do not expect to see our traffic on our platform decrease.
we believe the pandemic has accelerated consumer usage of the internet in areas like ott video, gaming and e-commerce, and we believe this usage pattern will likely persist going forward. however, we expect to see traffic continue to grow in 2021 but at a rate more in line with pre-2020 historical levels. in addition to revenue, there are some other items we expect in 2021 that are worth calling out. first, in 2020, our travel and related expenses were much lower than normal.
our guidance assumes that these expenses begin to return to a more normalized level beginning in the second half of 2021. second, in light of the recent decline in interest rates, we expect our interest income to decline on a year-over-year basis. specifically, we expect interest income to be about $8 million lower year over year, which will have a negative impact of about $0.05 on our non-gaap earnings per share compared with 2020. third, i wanted to remind you of the typical seasonality that we experienced on the top and bottom lines.
in the first quarter, we usually see a revenue step down sequentially from q4, our strong seasonal quarter. also in q1, remember that our employee payroll taxes and 401(k) matching programs reset. these costs will decline throughout the year as employees begin to max out. finally, as tom mentioned earlier, we are reorganizing the company around a product-driven group structure and moving away from the current vertically aligned division structure.
in q1, we will report revenue results under the new edge technology and security technology groups, as tom outlined. the revenue splits will look familiar to you as they align to our current cdn and other and cloud security revenue reporting that we have historically provided. to assist with the transition, we will continue to report web and media and carrier division results on our website for the balance of 2021. and finally, as a result of the reorganization, we expect to record an additional restructuring charge of approximately $7 million in q1.
looking ahead to full year, we expect revenue of $3.37 billion to $3.42 billion, which is up 4% to 6% year over year in constant currency. this outlook assumes that foreign exchange contributes about $45 million on a year-over-year basis. we expect security revenue growth in the range of 18% to 20% over 2020 levels. we also expect non-gaap operating margin of approximately 30%.
we expect non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $5.33 to $5.46, and this non-gaap earnings guidance is based on a non-gaap effective tax rate of approximately 15% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 165 million shares. and finally, full year capex is expected to be approximately 16% of revenue. this is down 7 points year over year as we expect to leverage the significant network capacity investment we made in 2019 and 2020. moving on to q1 guidance.
we are projecting q1 revenue in the range of $822 million to $836 million, were up 5% to 7% in constant currency over q1 2020. the current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a positive $4 million impact on q1 revenue compared to q4 levels and a positive $16 million impact year over year. at these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 76%. q1 non-gaap operating expenses are projected to be $265 million to $270 million.
we anticipate q1 ebitda margins of approximately 44%. and now moving on to depreciation. we expect non-gaap depreciation expense to be between $111 million to $112 million. factoring in this guidance, we expect non-gaap operating margin of approximately 30% for q1.
moving on to capex. we expect to spend approximately $150 million to $155 million, excluding equity compensation in the first quarter. and with the overall revenue and spend configuration i just outlined, we expect q1 non-gaap eps in the range of $1.28 to $1.31. this eps guidance assumes taxes of approximately $37 million to $38 million based on an estimated quarterly non-gaap tax rate of approximately 15%.
it also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 165 million shares. in summary, as you heard tom highlight, we achieved several significant milestones in 2020, including delivering 11% top-line revenue growth with total revenue exceeding $3 billion for the first time in company history; growing security revenue 25% and surpassing $1 billion; exceeding our 30% operating margin target; and generating non-gaap eps of more than $5 a share. we are very pleased with our performance in 2020, and we believe we're well-positioned for 2021. we look forward to providing you a deeper look into our business and our plans for the future at our upcoming investor summit on february 25.
thank you. tom and i would be happy to take your questions. operator?

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of sterling auty from jpmorgan. your line is now open.
sterling auty -- jpmorgan chase -- analyst
yeah. thanks. hi, guys. so i guess the big item that crosses my mind is the comment that you're expecting traffic to continue to grow, not really fall off, but at pre-pandemic levels.
and given that security is now a bigger part of the mix, i'm kind of curious why the level of deceleration that's factored into the guidance for 2021.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
hey, sterling. this is ed. so i think there's a couple of things you need to think about there. so obviously, 2020 was an unusually high-traffic year for us, and the point i was trying to make there is that we're not seeing that decline.
but what we're expecting going into this year is what i'd call a more normal traffic year. so you start to get into some tougher compares as you get into q2 and throughout the rest of the year and you still have the normal dynamics in the media business. most of the traffic is coming from media, obviously. so there'll be a series of renewals and that sort of thing, which is pretty normal.
and then the second thing that we called out is that we are starting to see a bit more pressure in travel and hospitality and retail. the first wave was customers coming to us, asking us for extended payment terms, some credits or some help within a quarter. now we're getting into a renewal cycle, so we're expecting to see some pressure from that area. and keep in mind, that's about 20% of our total business, about 40% of our web division, our prior web division business.
so that's going to have a little bit of an impact on us as well.
sterling auty -- jpmorgan chase -- analyst
that makes a lot of sense. and then, tom, maybe one for you. the structural changes that you're making to the business, what's the motivation of doing that now?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
well, i think the time has come to bring all of our security teams together. when we created the current structure five years ago, we didn't really have a security business to speak of, a few million dollars. now it's over $1 billion, and we had, the products there were split among three different groups: the web security group, which is most of it; enterprise security, which we've talked a lot about; and carrier security, which is very closely tied to enterprise. and enterprise and carrier are getting to a real scale now that we can bring them out of incubation and bring all of our security teams together in a division that just focuses on security.
and i think that will provide even stronger growth going forward. also, unifying sales makes sense now. before, we had a media sales force that were selling to customers who are buying media products. we had a web sales force selling to verticals that were buying web products.
so splitting made sense then. but now all of our customers buy security. in fact, some of the big media customers are our biggest buyers of security products. and so i think it makes sense to bring the field force together, and it's more efficient.
so i think the end result is that we will operate more efficiently. we'll have stronger innovations and continued very strong growth in our security product group. and also on the cdn side of the house, as ed talked about, we've got some tailwinds there, also some challenges in the commerce and travel vertical but i think very interesting future growth with areas like iot, 5g and serverless computing. and bringing those teams together, i think, again, will enable us to be more efficient moving forward.
sterling auty -- jpmorgan chase -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of keith weiss for morgan stanley. your line is now open.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
excellent. thank you, guys, for taking the question. i wanted to dig into the restructuring a little bit as well. so the restructuring charge, does that imply that there were some headcount reductions associated with this? and given that sort of the operating margins stay relatively stable for the full year, maybe down a little bit, it seems like you're hiring to offset debt.
so if you could talk us kind of through kind of where are you taking sort of investment away and where you're adding investment, that would be helpful. and then the second part of the question, from like a go-to-market or from a customer-facing perspective, what are the customers going to see differently here? are the salespeople going to go in with like a bigger tool set? or like what changes from that dynamic?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah. so keith, this is ed. i'll take the first part. so yes, we had about a 2% reduction in heads, and most of that was due to overlap, primarily in the go-to-market area.
obviously, we had two leaders in different regions and things like that. in terms of investments, we added over 500 heads this year, investing in security r&d as a percentage. so i think we've done a really good job of cutting costs and scaling but being able to invest back in the business. so this is really was about the cost-savings initiative.
it was more about better efficiency confinement. so we're keeping margins in that 30% to be investing a bit in the business moving forward as well. and as we've said in the past, we think 30% is a pretty good place to be running the business.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yeah. and in terms of the areas we're investing more, because we are, net headcount went up quite a bit last year and will grow again this year despite the current reduction taking place. we're investing in innovation, new products, particularly in the security area, also in our platform, making it more of a programmable platform for our customers with projects such as edge workers and making it easier for customers to just deploy their code straight on to akamai. in terms of what the customer sees, they're going to see the same rep they saw before, by and large.
when we had split the sales force before, it was by vertical. and so when we bring it together, it doesn't mean that there is an account breakage per se or that you're going to have a different rep. now that said, it will be a more efficient management structure. we'll have a deeper focus on channels.
it's especially important for our growing security products, particularly in the enterprise and carrier security products. and it will be easier, i think, for a rep to sell everything than maybe it was before. now i think reps were, for example, in media, as i mentioned, selling security products, and they were versed in the whole product set, but i think that becomes even easier now.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. that's super helpful. thank you, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of james fish from piper sandler. your line is now open.
james fish -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for the question. i want to pick on a couple of questions that were already asked and get into it in greater detail. so maybe first, the last couple of weeks, you've been hearing a little bit tougher pricing on the media delivery side.
i mean, what can you say about some of the larger renewals that took place in the back half of '20, as well as that take place in the first half of '21, especially on the streaming side and some of those new streaming services?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure. so i would say in terms of pricing, there's -- in the media side, i'm not seeing anything unusual. these one or two accounts where we've had some competitors get a little bit more aggressive than normal. but as far as '21 goes from a media's perspective, not a ton of renewal.
nothing worth calling out that's outside the norm. in the past, i've mentioned when we've had items that i thought was worth calling out. i don't see anything here which would qualify as average contract lengths of between one and two years. so you'll always have mix, i would say, for the ones that occurred in q4 and the back half of the year came in where we expected.
so no real surprises there.
james fish -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. and then, obviously, a few weeks ago, you announced that updated channel partnership, specifically on the security side. and now, today, you're talking about this unified sales organization. can you guys give us a little bit more color as to how much the business, especially on security, is actually coming from the channel already? and then additionally, how does the greater investment around channel impact to p&l versus the consolidation of the sales structure?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah. so right now, about a third of the business, in total, goes through the channel. in terms of breaking it down a little bit further, if you think about the -- for example, asavie, 100% of that goes through the channel. we believe the enterprise business more and more, that's going to go through the channel.
as far as the split goes, between security and content delivery, there'll be a bit more on the content delivery side because we've been in the business a lot longer. it's a bigger percentage of our revenue. but the way to think about it is, as we move forward especially in enterprise channels will be a much bigger part of our go-to-market strategy.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of james breen from william blair. your line is now open.
james breen -- william blair -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions. just first, fred, i think you said the ebitda margins in the first-quarter guide were around 44%, but you also talked about some of the payroll expenses and some of the expenses at year end being higher in the first quarter. if that's the case, where are you seeing better margins to sort of offset some of those increase in expenses? and then secondly, i think, tom, you talked about some of your media customers taking more security products. can you just talk about your total customer base and what you're seeing in terms of customers taking multiple products from you guys across the base?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah. so yeah, the ebitda margin was 44%. i think, just in general, we've done a good job of scaling our back office and getting leverage out of most of our g&a functions, plus we're doing all the stuff we do on the server side, making our service more efficient, etc. so i just called that out because, q1, we typically have vesting in stock, bonus payouts, etc., so we do tend to see a bit of uptick in our operating expenses.
but also, it's -- you had a very high quarter in q4 from a commissions perspective. so that sort of normalizes out. so the two kind of offset each other. but as you kind of think about your modeling, q1 tends to be a bit on the opex side as you go forward.
and then obviously, q4, if we're having a good year, it tends to be a high quarter as well as we get into accelerators from the commission side.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yeah. and in terms of media customers buying security, our media customers are the biggest brands out there, and they very much need their content stay secure and not have sites to face. they're worried about accounts being taken over, that media accounts, gaming accounts from the account hijackers, and that's where our bot management and account protection capabilities are very important. and since these are such large enterprises, they tend to be very large security customers.
when we get together on the 25th, we'll give a -- really a much deeper breakdown into our various security products, how we think about them, their growth rates and what we're projecting over the next several years. in terms of growth, we'll also give you updated counts on how many buys, how many security products.
james breen -- william blair -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of tim horan from oppenheimer. your line is now open.
tim horan -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
thanks, guys. can you give us a sense of last year? how much were volumes on the different businesses above trend? do you estimate? i mean, there's a lot of moving parts. any color on that would be helpful.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure. so on the traffic side, i would say last year was probably above double what we normally see from a traffic growth perspective. and then as far as other volumes, obviously, our bookings were pretty much in line with what we expected. and outside of the traffic, there was really nothing that was unusual or worth calling out.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
and one thing is that the attack traffic, the bad guys out there, their volumes were way up across the board, malicious log-in attempts, attempts to embed malware, those kind of things, ddos attacks, huge increases, really, across the board last year. and so that -- and of course makes a big difference for akamai to be able to help our customers because we're unique in being able to stop the largest denial of service attacks and being able to stop the account highjack attacks.
tim horan -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
and did on term in volume or did -- sorry. did volume price discounts kick in as a result of volumes being so strong?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
well, it depends on the contract. a lot of our big media companies do have tier pricing. so that would have kicked in. but again, nothing unusual, other than the fact that just traffic was just much higher than we had expected.
tim horan -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of colby synesael from cowen. your line is now open.
colby synesael -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you. two questions. one is, we're getting a lot of questions just in terms of what the company is likely to guide to at the upcoming analyst day. obviously, not asking for the numbers themselves.
but what are, from a financial perspective, your intentions in terms of what you're going to provide at the analyst day? and then secondly, as it relates to your guidance for 2021, your security growth of 18% to 20%, and i think it's below that, i think, what had been message more of a goal for plus 20%. is there anything to kind of flag there? is that just typical conservatism? is this simply the law of large numbers as you now reach that $1 billion? or do you think that there's an opportunity to kind of accelerate that or reaccelerate that growth again?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah, i'll take the second part first. so it is a bit of the large numbers, i guess, we're getting much bigger. we do have a lot of newer products that are ramping fast, but it just takes a while in a recurring revenue business. i think if you go back in the past, we've talked about last year, getting to $1 billion.
we exceeded that. the year before that, mid-20s, we did high 20s. so there's always a possibility to overachieve, but i think that's a reasonable guide. the other question was on the intentions of what to talk about at the analyst day.
as far as 2021 guidance, that's only in two weeks, so i'm not going to see any difference that i haven't seen yet. so i don't anticipate updating guidance from what we just talked about now. but what we will do is get into a lot more detail. you'll hear from all the leaders talking about what's the different groups and what they're going to be working on, some of the growth dynamics.
we'll be exposing a lot more about what's going on within the security buckets. we'll be showing you different growth rates and different products. so i think there's a lot of good information that will come out of that. but in terms of updating guidance, there won't be any to do that, just given that it's two weeks from today.
colby synesael -- cowen and company -- analyst
so there's no -- i think if i go back to your analyst day, i think it might have been in 2018. there was talk about that 30% operating margin. no expectation to give a new bogey, if you will, for a few years out from there.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
no, no. we're not going to give a new bogey for new operating margin. what i will do is talk about the dynamics of the different business and how, over time, you can see margins expand if we get to be -- a greater percentage of our business comes from security.
colby synesael -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of brad zelnick from credit suisse. your line is now open.
brad zelnick -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thank you so much for taking the questions. ed, there's been so much pent-up demand on the gaming side, and it seems like gaming was a strong contributor again this quarter. how should we think about the impact the gaming vertical might have in 2021 versus maybe other console launches in the past?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah, you're right. it was a very strong quarter for gaming. and for us, again, just as a reminder, we work with the publishers, as well as the major platforms. so the upside coming from a variety of different customers.
we're seeing more interest in gaming. the console releases drove a lot of upside in the quarter. it's always hard to predict what games are going to be popular, and there is a bit of seasonality in gaming, depending on a quarter that has many releases versus one that may not have as many. but it's a very fast-growing vertical for us.
and we expect that with these new consoles, there should be some continued demand throughout the year.
brad zelnick -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. that's very helpful. and maybe just a follow-up on a different topic. ed, as we think about the 0 overage plans you put in place within the web division and the strong e-commerce holiday season, what might the impact have been? and is this a model which you might expect to be more pervasive throughout your customer base as we move into 2021 and beyond?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah, good question. so as you know, we introduced this probably about 20 months ago. it was at the summer of our customer conference back in -- it was june of '19. and we have gotten a lot of traction, mostly in retail.
that's where we're seeing most of the requests for that type of structure. right now, we've got over half of our customers in the commerce vertical are adopting that structure, and it makes a lot of sense. it's actually a good strategy when you're faced with a customer base that's got some macroeconomic challenges when they're looking at ways of getting -- saving money or getting more predictable spend. so it's been well received by the customer base.
i would imagine that would continue to tick up. it's not for everyone. and like i said, we've seen the primary adopter of that is in the retail space.
brad zelnick -- credit suisse -- analyst
awesome. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of will power from baird. your line is now open.
will power -- baird -- analyst
ok, great. yeah, thanks for taking the question. maybe just to come back to security. i'd love to try to get a little more color on page integrity.
i know you've been seeing strong trends there for a while. is that on path to be a $100-million product? and anything else you can share there? and i guess the second piece that ties into that, just like to get an update on what you're seeing in terms of revenue, bookings, etc., for some of the enterprise products.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yeah. i'll take those. page integrity manager is off to a great start. we had really very good bookings.
now of course, it just got launched in middle of last year, so it will take time to grow into $100-million business, but that's very exciting for us. and in terms of bookings for the enterprise business, again, very strong. and as you know, we've been looking forward to getting our enterprise and carrier security products to the point where they're $100 million of revenue. and we think that we can do that this year, at least get on that run rate, so that, combined with the enterprise and carrier security, now that we have asavie onboard.
and we're going to talk a lot more about that at the upcoming analyst day.
will power -- baird -- analyst
are there any particular areas within the enterprise component where you're seeing particular strength?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
it's across the board. enterprise application access, really important because of all the malicious log-in attempts. enterprise threat protector, with solarwinds, becomes more important than ever to know what employee devices and enterprise devices are talking to. are they trying to contact, command and control outside the enterprise? that's something that we can help catch and stop.
asavie has done incredibly well, much better than we'd expected post acquisition. and for example, things like students that need to gain access for remote learning, to protect them, to make sure that their environment is secure. there's been a lot of development, of course, with carriers there. they sell this product, and we're behind the scenes but very strong pickup there to secure the enterprise cellular networks.
and then you think about iot in the future, all those devices have to be secured and probably all going to be connected with 5g, so i think a lot of potential upside there. and our secure business solution that's resold by major carriers under their brand for small and media business -- medium business, again, doing very well. so i would say, across the board with the enterprise and carrier products, very strong growth. and we might have a good chance of doubling revenue this year and reaching $100 million.
will power -- baird -- analyst
ok, great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of jeff van rhee from craig-hallum. your line is now open.
jeff van rhee -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
great. thanks. two for me. tom, just in terms of restructuring, i'm just curious sort of the thought process or the history of the thought process there.
how long has it been percolating? and if there were, as you think about it, kind of one or two key triggers that really made this the time. and then secondly, very high level. when you look at the 11% annual growth, a lot of puts and takes as it relates to covid. at least, to the extent you can dial it in, what do you think growth would have been ex covid impacts? obviously, pro and con, but any color there?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yeah. we've been thinking about a rework along these lines for really an extended period. it's something the senior management team would discuss, at least on an annual basis. and in terms of the trigger now, our security business has reached $1 billion, and that's an important milestone.
we're also seeing really strong growth for the enterprise and carrier security products, as i mentioned, and they were both in the incubation phase and in different parts of the company. we had the enterprise group, had the enterprise security products and for the carrier products, that was on the media and carrier division. and of course, most of security revenue was in the web division. and increasingly, as the smaller product areas grew, you start to have overlap.
for example, anybody that buys asavie, we want to sell him kona site defender, makes perfect sense. same thing for enterprise security. if you buy eaa, you want kona. and so i think it really makes sense now they've reached critical mass to bring them together into one team focused on security.
and as i mentioned, with the sales organization is something we have thought about, over the last couple of years, certainly more efficient to have a single sales organization and the advantage of having them be split had disappeared really once all our customers are buying really all our products but certainly security. so again, the time is right to do it. and you don't like doing something in the middle of the pandemic, but at the same time, you can't wait. at akamai, we always have a sense of urgency.
we want to get this done because i think it will help our growth going forward. now in terms of 11%, we're very pleased to see that, this year, we definitely got some tailwinds for overall traffic levels. and so the media and carrier division did well. we also deployed a ton of capacity for, as ed mentioned, increased growth this year and next year.
just the rate of growth, probably less this year, next year, more like normal traffic increases as opposed to twice that, that we experienced this year. i think we got hurt in revenue and our web performance products, as ed talked about. a big part of their revenue comes from commerce, which has gotten -- most commerce companies have really been pounded with covid. there's a few big names that have done very well, probably picked up business.
the amount of commerce going online has increased dramatically. but when the parent company is hurting, that creates a more difficult environment to negotiate a contract. and in many cases, as we've talked about, we've worked with the customer to give them some relief and on pricing as well. we've gone to 0 overage, so they can plan better.
and that hurt, i think, revenue this past q4, don't get a lot of bursting. on the other hand, it preserves that business more for us long term. and we're in this for the long haul, and it means we aren't going to share that business with the many competitors out there would like to have just a tiny piece of our commerce business. and so it seems a little paradoxical that, on the one hand, it probably hurt us on revenue.
on the other, as we talked about, we serve 40 of the global 50 leaders in commerce and retail and 23 of 25 in the u.s., and we're working very hard to maintain that business over the long term and grow it, particularly with our security products.
jeff van rhee -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. got it. thanks, tom.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of brandon nispel from keybanc capital. your line is now open.
brandon nispel -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you. two questions for ed. ed, could you provide the contribution from acquired businesses included in the revenue outlook for 2021, i think, in particular around asavie and then inverse? and then secondly, how should we think about ipc revenue contribution in 2021 versus 2020?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure. so as far as inverse goes, there's really no revenue. that was a very small company. it was more of a tech tuck-in, similar to others that we've done in the past.
so there's no real contribution from that directly. as we integrate, it will help accelerate some of our other products. asavie, probably about $30 million incremental. if you look kind of year over year, we had about $8 million this quarter, so somewhere in that range.
so call it a little less than a point. and then as far as the internet platform customers, i'm going to tip my cap to the team that's been working on those. they've done a fantastic job, not only maintaining that business, but growing it. i haven't provided specific guidance, but i'd expect kind of a similar year where you're kind of maintain where you're at and maybe a little upside.
q4 was particularly strong, so maybe it's in that $50 million range, plus or minus a few million bucks, depending on what's going on in the particular quarter.
brandon nispel -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of rishi jaluria from d.a. davidson. your line is now open.
rishi jaluria -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks so much for taking my question, and nice to see continued strong execution. i wanted to go back to an earlier comment that was made with reference to the solarwinds breach. i wanted to get a sense what are you seeing out there in terms of any changes in demand or pipeline or inbound interest as a result of that breach, especially given your kind of leadership in the zero trust area that's becoming increasingly important for csos.
and then i've got a follow-up.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yeah. obviously, it illustrates the importance of zero trust. it was obviously a devastating attack, and it highlights the need for products, for example, like our enterprise threat protector. it's one thing to try to stop the malware from getting inside.
that's hard. you look at an example like this. but once it's inside, it has to go out and contact command and control. and that's something that you can pick up and detect and block in many cases, and then alert the cso that they got a problem.
and that's what our enterprise threat protector product is meant to do and has done in many, many cases. so i think in the long run, it just heightens the need for products that we provide. and the need for zero trust, in general, stepping up a level. with third-party malware showing up everywhere, that's the same problem you have with page integrity and why our page integrity manager service is so important.
because today, so many websites link to third parties or use third party or open source code that has malware. and what that means is when a client or one of our users goes to their website or uses their app, the client gets infected and their personal information's exposed. and it's just another example of a third-party malware that's become infected that the enterprise is using, a different particular use case. one's the website.
the other's internal enterprise apps, same problem and same devastating result, and akamai has solutions to help stop that.
rishi jaluria -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then i wanted to go back to the reorg. look, i think it makes a lot of sense why you're doing the reorg.
maybe philosophically want to understand what steps are you taking or how are you thinking about avoiding disruption? because in enterprise software, every time there's a reorg, there's always a worry of it's going to disrupt the business, especially when you're running on such a hot hand like you are right now. and you've done reorgs in the past. so maybe kind of a thought process on just how to avoid that from really disrupting your business would be helpful.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yeah. that's a great question. it's something we put a lot of time and effort into. this is a kind of thing we would plan for, really, for six months.
it's important to know we're doing it from a position of strength. i think the last thing you want to do is rewire when you're in a position of weakness because that's where you can get the disruption and the problems. and as you can see, we're as strong as we've ever been. and so i think that is a good time to do a reorg.
as we mentioned before, i don't see a lot of account disruption, a lot of account breakage. you do worry whenever you change the go-to-market operation that you could have some disruption that way. i don't think that's likely here because, as we mentioned, a lot of the accounts have the same person they had before that they're dealing with. so i don't think that will be a problem for us.
and as you mentioned, we do have experience at doing this, and we have great employees. and i would say morale in the company is very high. and so i don't anticipate serious disruption to the business here.
rishi jaluria -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
yeah. that's wonderful. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of robert majek from raymond james. your line is now open.
robert majek -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thanks. i think investors appreciate the sales synergies between your web performance offerings and your cloud security offerings, and the sales force consolidation there makes perfect sense. but it would be great to get your thoughts on whether or not it still makes sense to build a dedicated sales force to help accelerate your enterprise security adoption.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yeah. we do have a sales specialist already, and that is being maintained with the new organization. so there'll be no change there in terms of the specialist for not only the enterprise security products, but the carrier security products, which are very close. also prolexic has sales specialists there.
so that won't change.
robert majek -- raymond james -- analyst
great. and one more, if i can. just building on brad's questions. the year-over-year cdn growth rate decelerated 4 points from last quarter.
so just wondering what we should make of that dynamic. we know that overall traffic, especially around gaming, was strong, but perhaps it was offset by the introduction of 0 overage fixed-fee pricing. so any additional clarification there would be helpful as we think about cdn growth rate going forward.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes. i think you pretty much nailed it. just remember, last q4 was an exceptionally strong quarter from a traffic growth perspective, so you've got a bit of a tougher compare. and like i said earlier, starting in q2 when we saw the big ramp in traffic, you're going to start to see a little bit tougher compare on the media side and then the dynamics that we've talked about, really over the last couple of quarters on the retail and commerce vertical.
make it a bit more of a challenging year from a cdn perspective, but we still think we're in a great position, and we've got some really good tailwinds going on. we're just talking about it a minute ago, teaching video's also growing very strongly. so there's a lot of puts and takes in there. but in general, i think that's kind of the key driver is just a bit of a tougher compare and then that challenge with retail and travel.
robert majek -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks a lot.
tom barth -- head of investor relations
ok. well, this is tom barth. we want to thank everyone in closing. as tom and ed mentioned, we would look forward to you joining us virtually for our investor relations summit on february 25.
additionally, we will be presenting at several investor conferences and events throughout the rest of the quarter. details of these can be found on the investor relations section of akamai.com. thank you for joining us, and all of us here at akamai wish continued good health to you and yours, and have a wonderful evening.

2021-Q1,AKAM,2021-05-04 16:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the akamai technologies first-quarter 2021 earnings call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. [operator instructions] i'd now like to hand the conference over to your host today, mr.
tom barth, head of investor relations.
tom barth -- head of investor relations
thank you, operator. good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining akamai's first-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. speaking today will be tom leighton, akamai's chief executive officer; and ed mcgowan, akamai's chief financial officer. before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance.
these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. the factors include uncertainty stemming from covid-19 pandemic and any impact from unexpected geopolitical developments. additional information concerning these factors is contained in akamai's filings with the sec, including our annual report on form 10-k and quarterly reports on form 10-q. the forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on may 4, 2021.
akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. as a reminder, we will be referring to some non-gaap financial metrics during today's call. a detailed reconciliation of gaap and non-gaap metrics can be found under the financial portion of the investor relations section of akamai.com. and with that, let me turn the call over to tom. 
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
thanks, tom, and thank you all for joining us today. i'm pleased to report that akamai delivered excellent results in the first quarter. q1 revenue was $843 million, up 10% year over year and up 8% in constant currency. this strong result was driven by the continued rapid growth of our security business, accelerated growth in our edge applications business, and continued high-traffic levels on our intelligent edge platform.
non-gaap operating margin in q1 was 31% and q1 non-gaap eps was $1.38 per diluted share, up 15% year over year and up 11% in constant currency. with a strong start to 2021, we're proud that akamai has continued to enable and to protect remote work, homeschooling, e-commerce, and online entertainment for billions of people around the world amid very challenging circumstances. our security solutions portfolio performed especially well in q1, generating revenue of $310 million, up 29% year over year and up 27% in constant currency. the very strong growth was experienced across most of our security products, including our new page integrity manager solution.
page integrity manager helps enterprises defend against malware and third-party software and applications. customers that adopted page integrity manager in q1 included maersk, the world's largest container shipping operator; and groupon, the global e-commerce marketplace. maersk uses more than 4,000 scripts, half of which are third-party scripts to drive millions of dollars of online business every hour. managing this complex and dynamic environment had become an increasingly difficult security challenge for maersk and so they now use page integrity manager to improve visibility into security threats and to prevent the loss of critical data.
our bot manager solution also continued to perform very well in q1. bot manager is designed to mitigate a wide variety of automated attacks, including account stuffing attacks where credentials stolen from one website are checked for validity at thousands of other websites. when valid credentials are found, a manual attack is then often used to extract value from the compromised accounts. losses from account takeovers and new account fraud are estimated at over $10 billion annually in the u.s.
in order to forge such manual attacks, we launched the beta for our new account protector solution in q1. account protector shields organizations from account takeover and other kinds of fraudulent human activity without increasing friction for legitimate customers. account protector works by detecting in real-time whether a user logging into an application is the legitimate account owner or an impostor in possession of stolen credentials. one of our beta customers for this new solution is a well-known restaurant franchise.
it was under attacked by cybercriminals who were compromising the loyalty accounts of their diners. the criminals were stealing loyalty reward points and then reselling them on the dark web. the digital theft outraged the diners whose points were stolen and angered restaurant owners who unknowingly provided meals to fraudsters. with help from akamai, the franchise can now identify the situations where humans are impersonating valid diners and take action to stop the illicit transfer of loyalty points, thereby stopping the fraud and enabling the franchise to focus on accelerating sales.
we're also excited about the success of akamai's fastest-growing security segment, access control, which reached an annualized revenue run rate of $100 million in q1, up more than 170% over q1 of 2020 and up over 60% organically. our access control segment provides secure connectivity for users, applications, workloads, and iot systems, regardless of their location. products in this area include enterprise application access, enterprise threat protector, and our new secure mobile and secure iot solutions that we acquired from asavie in october. our secure mobile and secure iot products provide security, visibility, and control for mobile devices at the edge.
these services deter malicious activity and support acceptable use policies without needing to install a client on the device. the solutions are sold to our carrier partners such as at&t, where it forms the basis for their accessmylan solution. these capabilities have been especially important in helping school districts secure student devices during the pandemic so that students can learn from home safely. our security solutions also continued to gain recognition from the leading analyst firms in q1.
our market-leading web application firewall capabilities earned gartner peer insights customers' choice distinction. and forrester named akamai as a leader in ddos protection for the third time, saying large enterprise clients that want an experienced trusted vendor to make their ddos problem go away should look to akamai. turning to our cdn portfolio. q1 marked another quarter of very strong traffic growth for akamai, led by ott video services and downloads of e-gaming software.
on march 16, traffic on the akamai platform reached an all-time high of 200 terabits per second. this is 19% higher than the peak in q1 of last year and 2.5 times the traffic peak in q1 of 2019. daily peaks were also high in q1, averaging 143 terabits per second. in fact, traffic on our platform exceeded 110 terabits per second, pretty much around the clock in q1.
overall, our cdn products and services generated revenue of $532 million in q1, up 2% year over year and flat in constant currency. the edge application segment generated $45 million in revenue last quarter, up more than 30% over q1 of 2020. as you may recall from the discussion at our investor summit in february, this revenue amount includes edge computing solutions, such as edgeworkers, that we build discreetly, but does not include the wide array of services that use our computing capabilities at the edge. as we discussed during our recent investor summit, we believe that there is the potential for substantial future growth in the area of edge computing, as we anticipate more enterprises moving their compute workloads to our edge platform for offload, improved performance, security, and global scale.
a timely example of such a shift is manifested in our new vaccine edge solution, which is enabling over two dozen public health agencies and pharmacy chains around the world to deliver and secure covid vaccine registration sites in the face of extraordinary flash crowds. in multiple instances, akamai was called in to rescue government agencies whose websites had crashed under load, resulting in frustrated citizens who waited for long times before getting kicked out without a reservation. in some cases, these websites have been using solutions provided by competitors that were not able to handle the load. we're pleased to partner on vaccine edge with salesforce.com, and we're proud that our edgeworkers solution has made a real difference to the many millions of citizens trying to get the vaccine as quickly as possible.
our customers are now using edgeworkers for a wide range of applications. for example, a leading theme park operator is using edgeworkers to help manage demand as they plan to reopen parks. a publicly traded sports and entertainment company has implemented geofencing using our edgekv data store, together with edgeworkers, to ensure that users access only relevant broadcast content for their location. a nationwide home improvement retailer and a global credit card company are using a/b testing logic at the edge to deliver fast and personalized user experiences.
we're enabling devops workflows for our global sportswear brand by managing canary releases, where only a targeted group of users can see a new experience. and we're enabling a leading global manufacturer of devices to authenticate their users at the edge, which improves performance and reduces their cloud costs. we're also proud of the progress that we're making with our sustainability efforts. in the past year, we doubled our platform capacity with no increase at all in our platform's carbon footprint.
and just two weeks ago, on earth day, we announced that by 2030, akamai intends to power 100% of our global operations with renewable energy, improve the energy efficiency of our platform by an additional 50%, mitigate 100% of our platform emissions and continue to recycle 100% of our electronic waste. these goals reflect akamai's commitment to be a responsible, efficient, and forward-looking company. in summary, we're very excited about the innovative technology that we're developing, the strong demand from customers for our security and edge computing solutions, and our q1 financial performance on both the top and bottom lines. the growth strategy and goals that we outlined to you in our investor summit on february 25, set our direction for the future, and we believe that our strong q1 results show that we've been executing according to plan.
now, i'll turn the call over to ed to provide further details on our q1 results and the outlook for next quarter and 2021. ed?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
thank you, tom. before i provide additional details on our q1 performance, i'd like to remind everyone that as a result of the reorganization we announced last quarter, we've refocused the company from a vertical-aligned divisional structure to a product-oriented lens. i will therefore be focusing my discussion today on our security technology group and our edge technology group. the security group, as you might imagine, encompasses all of our security solution.
the edge group includes our media delivery and web performance cdn business, along with our edge compute solutions. we plan to provide additional revenue detail for the different product lines within our security technology group and edge technology group on an annual basis. however, we might highlight specific subgroup details from time to time on our quarterly earnings calls if we feel it will help provide greater context on our results. finally, as i mentioned on our last call, we will continue to report both web division and media and carrier division results, along with our internet platform customer results on our website for the balance of 2021 to assist with this reporting transition.
so with all that said, as tom outlined, akamai delivered another excellent quarter in q1. we were very pleased to exceed the high end of our guidance range on both revenue and earnings. q1 revenue was $843 million, up 10% year over year or 8% in constant currency, driven by continued strength across most major product areas in our security business, better-than-expected traffic from ott video and gaming customers, and very strong performance in our edge applications business. revenue from our security technology group was $310 million, up 29% year over year or 27% in constant currency, driven by broad-based strength across most of our security products.
revenue from our edge technology group was $532 million, up 2% year over year or flat in constant currency. we benefited from strong traffic growth driven by ott video and gaming, as well as strong growth in our edge applications business, as tom mentioned earlier. as expected, foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $3 million on a sequential basis and positive $16 million on a year-over-year basis. international revenue was $380 million, up 13% year over year or 8% in constant currency.
sales in our international markets represented 45% of total revenue in q1, up 1 point from q1 2020 and consistent with q4 levels. finally, revenue from our u.s. market was $463 million, up 8% year over year. moving now to costs.
cash gross margin was 76%, in line with our expectations. gaap gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 64%. non-gaap cash operating expenses were $267 million, in line with our expectations. now, moving on to profitability.
adjusted ebitda was $375 million, up $49 million or 15% from the same period in 2020. our adjusted ebitda margin was 45%, up 2 points from q1 2020. non-gaap operating income was $264 million, up $34 million or 15% from the same period last year. non-gaap operating margin came in at 31%, up 1 point from q1 last year and above our guidance range due to leverage from our revenue outperformance.
capital expenditures in q1, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $150 million, consistent with our guidance range. we continue to expect q1 capex to represent the high watermark for quarterly capex spending in 2021. gaap net income for the first quarter was $156 million or $0.94 of earnings per diluted share. our q1 gaap results include a $7 million restructuring charge related to the company realignment we announced last quarter, which was in line with our expectations.
non-gaap net income was $228 million or $1.38 of earnings per diluted share, up 15% year over year, up 11% in constant currency, and $0.07 above the high end of our guidance range due to our revenue outperformance. taxes included in our non-gaap earnings were $38 million, based on a q1 effective tax rate of approximately 14%. now, i will discuss some balance sheet items. as of march 31, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled approximately $2.5 billion.
after accounting for the $2.3 billion of combined principal amounts of our two convertible notes, net cash was approximately $154 million as of march 31. now, i will review our use of capital. during the first quarter, we spent $58 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 600,000 shares. we ended q1 with approximately $514 million remaining on our previously announced share repurchase authorization.
our plan remains to leverage our share buyback program to offset dilution resulting from equity compensation over time. as a result, based on current market conditions, we expect to spend at least $350 million for the full year 2021. moving on to q2 guidance. we are projecting q2 revenue in the range of $839 million to $853 million or up 6% to 7% as reported or 3% to 5% in constant currency over q2 2020.
there are two factors to consider as you think about year-over-year comparisons for q2. first, in 2020, we saw a significant uptick in traffic on our network starting at the end of march and continuing through the remainder of the year as a result of global lockdowns. as our excellent q1 results demonstrate, traffic has continued to grow on our network this year, but we don't expect to see the same traffic growth rates from a year ago going forward. this creates more challenging year-over-year comparisons for our edge delivery business starting in q2 and continuing for the remainder of 2021.
second, the q2 year-over-year growth comparison also reflects the continuing ban of some chinese-based apps in india. as a reminder, these apps, which were banned in q3 of last year, contributed revenue of approximately $15 million in q2 2020. foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $3 million impact on q2 revenue compared to q1 levels and a positive $18 million impact year over year. at these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 76%.
q2 non-gaap operating expenses are projected to be $261 million to $266 million. we anticipate q2 ebitda margins of approximately 45%. moving now to depreciation. we expect non-gaap depreciation expense to be between $116 million to $117 million.
factoring in this guidance, we expect non-gaap operating margin of approximately 31% for q2. moving on to capex. we expect to spend approximately $133 million to $138 million, excluding equity compensation in the second quarter. and with the overall revenue and spend configuration i just outlined, we expect q2 non-gaap eps in the range of $1.35 to $1.40.
this eps guidance assumes taxes of $37 million to $39 million based on an estimated quarterly non-gaap tax rate of approximately $0.14 -- excuse me, 14%. it also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 165 million shares. looking ahead to the full year, we are raising our guidance for both revenue and eps. we now expect revenue of $3.4 billion to $3.435 billion, which is up 6% to 7% year over year as reported or up 5% to 6% in constant currency.
we now expect security growth to be in the low 20s for the full year 2021. we are estimating non-gaap operating margin of approximately 30% to 31% and non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $5.45 to $5.52. and this non-gaap earnings guidance is based on a non-gaap effective tax rate of approximately 14% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares. moving on to capex.
full-year capex is expected to be approximately 16% of revenue, unchanged from our prior outlook. we are very pleased to have delivered such strong results in q1 and to be able to increase our outlook for the full year. thank you. tom and i would be happy to take your questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from colby synesael with cowen. your line is now open.
michael elias -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. this is michael on for colby. two questions if i may. first, could you give us an update on your m&a pipeline for security and how the number of opportunities you're seeing compares to this time last year? and secondly, one of your cdn peers flagged that they saw a loss of market share due to performance.
is there anything that you can flag related to market share gains or potentially losses during the quarter? that would be helpful. thank you.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
sure. i would say the m&a pipeline is comparable to last year. there's a lot of companies for sale. and the pricing for typical companies in the security area remains very high.
and i think, in many cases, unrealistic. so i think overall, the dynamics there are pretty comparable to where they were last year. as you know, akamai is always looking for opportunities. we're also very disciplined in terms of actually -- what we end up buying.
in terms of cdn market share, the very large media companies do compare the cdn vendors in terms of their traffic share. and if a vendor is doing better than others, they tend to get more share. and that's why akamai has such a large share when it comes to delivery of media traffic. and if a vendor has outages or is performing poorly, which we see a fair amount out there among our competition, they can lose share.
and so that's a very typical dynamic. nothing new there. it's been that way for several years. and that's why akamai put such an effort to have the world's best performance.
and it's why we have so much of the traffic.
michael elias -- cowen and company -- analyst
perfect. thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from james fish with piper sandler.
james fish -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, guys, congrats on the quarter. first, can you just give us more color behind the media cdn business in terms of, especially the gaming vertical specifically, just really trying to understand how fast either revenue or traffic from gaming itself is growing and what the exposure to gaming overall given what we're seeing with the console cycle as well? and then normally, ed, you don't typically raise in -- following q1. i guess what gives you the confidence at this point of this -- at this point of the year versus normal?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah. hey, jim. so first, i'll take the first question, which was around the media -- it's the gaming growth in particular. so we don't break out specific growth rates, but i can say that gaming, in particular, was one of the stronger verticals in terms of growth, very pleased with what we saw.
the other thing is, i'd say, the names of the number of customers that we saw growing. it wasn't just your normal handful of gaming customers. so we saw some benefit from the continuation of the gaming console releases we saw in q4. but we also saw a lot of publishers have some pretty significant releases during the quarter.
so in general, it was a really good gaming quarter. we're off to a pretty good start here in q2. and as you know, the gaming release can be a bit seasonal, but so far, it's been a pretty good start to the year. and like i said, i'm pretty happy with the performance across many different customers.
in terms of guidance, yes, we just start off having a great year. traffic has been very strong. you saw the security performance. it's a little bit -- we got a lot of exposure on the fx side.
so having one quarter down and having the first month of the second quarter down gives you a little bit more confidence going into the year. so we felt that we had enough visibility at this point to raise guidance. as you know, the second half of the year is always little bit more challenging, where q3, you tend to see summer seasonality. we didn't see that last year because of the pandemic.
we'll probably see a little bit of that on the media side. and then q4, obviously, tends to be our strongest seasonal quarter where you have strong e-commerce and strong media. so we're feeling pretty confident at this point, so we thought it was appropriate to take the guidance up a touch.
james fish -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks. congrats again.
operator
our next question comes from keith weiss with morgan stanley.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
excellent. thank you, guys, for taking the question and a very nice quarter. on that last question, and this kind of increased confidence in the year. is it more on the, like, cdn side or more on the security side? because it does sound like you feel good about some of those new products ramping pretty nicely on the security portfolio, and you're talking about the low 20s growth for the year.
so i was hoping you could clarify that. and then i have a follow-up question on margins if we have time.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yeah. we had a very strong start to the year. it's great to see the security business growing at 29%. and as we talked about, it's really across the board.
it's not a single product doing well, but just strength everywhere in security. and when you see that kind of performance and we look ahead to the back part of the year, we are confident that we're going to do better than we had thought coming into the year, just great performance. there's also a good performance on the cdn side. happy to see that up 2%.
as ed talked about, you do worry about fx there and what can happen. but on balance, business, very strong and off to a great start. ed, do you want to add any color to that?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
no, i think you covered it, tom. i think, seeing the strength in security and being able to take that up a touch. and last quarter, we were in the 18% to 20% range. now we're in the low 20s.
and then on the cdn side, we do have some tougher compares, but we're seeing really strong traffic and not seeing any decrease from what we've seen over the last year. so we're feeling pretty good about that.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. that sounds great. and then on the margin side of the equation. we're past the peak in terms of capex, sort of spending -- or capex intensity, but it's going to take some time for that to flow through to gross margin.
so that's probably more of like a calendar '22 impact. but you did come in a little bit ahead on operating margins this quarter. and next quarter, we're looking for 31%, the expectation that you're going to try to sort of kick that up with increased investment in the business. or is there potential for kind of more flow-through of upside into better margins for the year?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah. ok. so, keith, two things to think about there. the first one is, we have our -- biggest expense line is our payroll.
and we have our annual, what we call, our merit increase cycle that kicks in july 1. so you'll see a little bit of an increase in our operating expense just for carrying our current employees, but we will be investing in security. so we've got some planned investments in the back half of the year. but we took the guidance range up from what we said approximately 30 last time, to 31.
so running at 31 here, might be a touch under in q3 as we go through our merit cycle. and then q4 is always a little bit of a wildcard in terms of how strong the revenue performance is. but we want to make sure we're investing back in the business. we see really good growth in security but also in our edge applications business as well.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. and is there a potential for gross margins to start to become a little bit of a tailwind into the back half of the year?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, you got to keep in mind the mix there, keith. over time, i think as you get into, as we talked about in the investor relations day, where you saw our security margins, gross margins are higher. you've got your -- media margins are lower.
so it really is a mix. and while we're exceeding our plan so far on security, it's going to take a bit for that to really manifest itself in higher gross margins. you just need to get a bigger percentage of the business coming from security. and if you look at the part of the business and media that's growing, it's primarily the high volume, video, high-volume media.
that tends to be where you have probably the most competition and pricing pressure. so you kind of balance those two out and you kind of keep the gross margins flattish year for the year. and then i'd say over time, there's a chance that we could see some expansion there, but we're not going to call that out right now.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. excellent. thank you so much for the color, guys.
operator
our next question comes from sterling auty with jpmorgan.
sanjit singh -- morgan stanley
hi. this is sanjit on for sterling auty. can you give color on the organic growth in the security for the quarter?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure. this is ed. we had about $10 million of contribution from asavie, which would be about 4 percentage points. i would say though that when we acquired asavie, our plan was to do roughly $30 million in revenue in the first year, and we're obviously exceeding that.
so we've been able to take that asset and really start to scale it. so while it's technically inorganic, i'd say we deserve some credit for being able to significantly accelerate that growth rate. so if you back out the 4%, you'd be -- i said 29%, it'd be 25% and 22% on a constant-currency basis.
sanjit singh -- morgan stanley
ok. and then just to follow up on that. like the gross margins and sales and marketing are down seasonally. so can you give colors on that as well?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah. so on the sales and marketing, what you'll find is, q4 tends to be our highest quarter for sales and marketing expenses where you have, especially last year when we were exceeding our plan, we get into accelerators. so you get a reset on the compensation, and then you'll see it spike up again in q4 of this year.
sanjit singh -- morgan stanley
good. and on gross margins?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah. so gross margins were flat quarter over quarter. that's in line with what we expected. so really, there's nothing to call out there.
sanjit singh -- morgan stanley
cool. thanks.
operator
our next question comes from tim horan with oppenheimer.
tim horan -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
thanks, guys. great security quarter. was there any one-time items, any license deals, or anything else that would suggest why the growth would slow down so much after an acceleration like this? and can you comment on how enterprise security is doing? is it meeting your expectations at this point?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah. sure, tim. i'll take the first one and, tom, if you want to talk about enterprise afterwards. so yes, there was really nothing to call out in terms of license revenue, but i'm glad you reminded me, because when you guys are building your model if you remember last year in q2, we did have an unusually strong license quarter.
so as you kind of build your models and look at your compares, just remember, last year, we had $7 million of license revenue in q2. we don't expect that again in q2 of this year. and in q1, there was really nothing unusual. as tom said, it was really strength across many different products in security.
it'd be easy for us to just call out one thing, but the good news for us is we see strength everywhere. and, tom, i don't know if you want to talk a bit about enterprise.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yeah. the access segment performed very well. as we noted, we're now at $100 million revenue run rate. so it's great to start the year in q1 there.
very strong growth, over 170% over last year. now, of course, that includes asavie. if you take that out, organic growth, still over 60% in that segment. so very pleased.
and as ed noted, we're pretty excited about the asavie acquisition, especially as you get the emergence of 5g and you get iot applications, but the ability to secure enterprise devices across the board, i think it's very exciting for the future. and we're really in a unique position to do that, and we have great relationships with the carriers. so we think we'll really be able to scale that business to a global basis.
tim horan -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
and just following up on the m&a question. with new security products, do you think you can shift more to internal development from your own r&d as opposed to acquisitions? or how has that been trending the last few years?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
i think it's a good, healthy mix. as you know, we've made several acquisitions, mostly tech tuck-ins, occasionally something a little bit larger. and we do a lot of organic investment in research and development, very active. they're very innovative.
maybe a good example is page integrity manager, which we launched last year and doing really well in the marketplace. and we did -- that was a blend of a tech tuck-in about seven to 10 employees in the company we acquired and a lot of organic development at the same time, to make a very successful product quickly, bring it to market and very strong adoption in early days.
tim horan -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from alex henderson with needham.
mike cikos -- needham & company -- analyst
hey, guys. you have mike cikos on the line here for alex henderson. could you comment on the security growth you're experiencing? i'm just trying to, i guess, think about this demand and the increased expectations you guys have now. is any of this at all related to, i guess, budget finally coming to market following the headlines that we saw earlier in the year around solarwinds and the microsoft exchange server hack? and then the second comment on that would be the improved outlook that you have for security.
is it also expected to be broad-based on a go-forward basis?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yeah. let me take the first question there. and that's a, yes, really good question. the attack landscape is just breathtaking.
you think you've seen it all. and then next week, you read the next headline. and the attackers are very powerful. you have nation states, large-scale organized crime, just -- and what they're doing is, well, pretty scary.
now the great news for akamai and our customers is that we have solutions that can protect enterprises for a large majority of those attacks. a great example is the recent exchange server hack, where many thousands of enterprises got hacked, lost their emails, which is really bad. akamai, our it department was running an exchange server, just like all those other companies. and the difference is, we didn't get hacked because we use our own enterprise security solutions.
and we had enterprise application access sitting in front of our exchange server. and that meant that the vulnerability couldn't be exploited, because the employee doesn't just get to go contact the exchange server. if they did, then somebody can come in. and before you're authenticated by the exchange server, you can exploit the vulnerability.
instead, they got to get to -- they come to akamai's enterprise application access product, we authenticate them, and if it's a bad guy outside trying to do something, no way they get in. and not only that, they don't get directly to the exchange server because they have to pass through our security. so if they're trying to do bad things, we'll stop it. and it's all about our approach to zero trust.
and yes, we can protect enterprises from these sorts of things. and even in zero-day attacks, we didn't know about the exchange hack before other enterprises or microsoft did, and yet we were protected at zero day because of our solutions. so i think as the attacks increase, that does increase awareness, and that does help drive our security business. and i see no end to the attacks coming.
there's more on the way. and we're in a great position to be able to help the leading enterprises stay safe against those attacks.
mike cikos -- needham & company -- analyst
great. and then just following up that broad-based strength that we're talking to in q1. is that -- that's expected on a go-forward basis with the updated outlook we have today?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yes. it was strong across the board, and we're anticipating that through the rest of this year. and of course, at our investor day, we talked about the three- to five-year cagr goals. and as you go back to that material, you'll see it's pretty strong across the board there in terms of our anticipated growth over the longer term.
mike cikos -- needham & company -- analyst

our next question comes from james breen with william blair.
james breen -- william blair & company -- analyst
thanks. thanks for taking the question. just wondering if you can give some color on the u.s. versus the international mix.
it seemed like u.s. had a pretty good acceleration on a year-over-year basis this quarter. is this pandemic-driven? or is it more around the products that's getting sold? and then just secondly, on the margins thread. ebitda margin is 45%.
you've guided to that for the next quarter. given the business mix now, is that sort of the starting point in terms of margin structure given capex coming down and investments, etc.? thanks.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah. hey, jim. so on the â i'll take the ebitda margin question first. yes.
so 45 is a good spot for this quarter. obviously, we get a little bit of expense coming in q3. so 44, 45-ish, but i think you're thinking about it in the right range. on the u.s.
versus international, yes, u.s. was pretty strong. we've been having pretty decent u.s. growth.
if you remember, go back in a year or so, a little over a year ago, we were kind of flattish and we started to turn things around there. a lot of it has to do with the strength that we're seeing in media, a lot of the companies are in the u.s. in terms of international, still having very strong growth internationally. we do come up against some tougher compares.
there's pretty strong media business outside the u.s. so you'll see some tougher compares on the media delivery side. and as i called out, from an international perspective, we're still lapping that $15 million of lost revenue associated with the bank apps in india.
james breen -- william blair & company -- analyst
and then just one other question. are there any sectors that you're seeing that were particularly hit hard by the pandemic that are maybe starting to come back a little bit more as the vaccines' gotten rolled out? thanks.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah. yeah, it's a good question, jim. so i would say the hotel and travel is probably stabilizing a little bit. i wouldn't say we're in the growth phase yet.
you're starting to see some early signs. it's probably still a few quarters before we start to see that business return to a growth engine for us. on retail, it's still a mixed bag. you've got some that are doing well, some that aren't doing well.
and just keep in mind that that's 20% of our -- your total business, 40% of your old legacy web business. but it's -- i'd say we're optimistic but still a ways to go before we declare victory there.
james breen -- william blair & company -- analyst

our next question comes from brandon nispel with keybanc.
brandon nispel -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. two questions for ed, one for tom. ed, could you just outline how we should be thinking about working capital for the year? and then for the full year '21, what's embedded in your outlook for fx versus your prior expectations? then for tom, how should we think about the growth in edge applications sequentially as we move throughout the year? i think you mentioned it was about $45 million this quarter. thanks.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
hey, brandon, yeah, i'll take the second one first. in terms of fx, so the fx rates, what we do is at the beginning of the quarter, we sort of take a look at where the fx rates are, assume that's going to stay for the balance of the year. in terms of how it was relative to the beginning of the last quarter, we gave guidance, some currencies are up, some are down, but it's roughly somewhat in line. i talk about in the prepared remarks that fx sort of came in as expected.
we got a little bit of a headwind here quarter over quarter, mostly weakness in the yen. but i would say just keep an eye on it though. you just -- if you kind of just step back and do the math, we get a little over $1 billion worth of non-u.s.-denominated revenue. so to the extent that you get a 1% swing, that can swing you $10 million on an annual basis.
the major currencies for us are euro, yen, pound, and then it kind of drops off from there. and other currencies aren't as impactful, but those are the three to keep an eye on. and then working capital, i'd say, like any other year, you'll see nothing unusual in terms of working capital. this year, in q1, you see us from a cash flow perspective, we pay out our bonuses early in q1.
you see cash flow, the working capital pick up a touch. to call out in terms of collections, they've actually been fantastic. nothing on the payable side. it's unusual.
and as we talked about, capex is already hit its high point. so nothing really unusual to call on working capital.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yeah. and in terms of the edge applications question, you're right, about $45 million in q1. we don't guide separately on an annual basis for that. you just saw over 30% growth in q1.
and at ir day, we did talk about the three- to five-year cagr. goal there is over 30%. and so at a high level, i'd expect to see us continue with very strong growth through the rest of the year in edge applications.
brandon nispel -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions.
operator
our next question comes from robert majek with raymond james.
robert majek -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thanks. just two questions for me. one, good to see the guide up on the security business to a low 20s rate.
but you did just report security growth of 29%. so just, how should we read into that? why should we expect that growth rate to decelerate materially? and then two, just what are you seeing on cdn per unit pricing? is the level of price decline getting more steeper than usual as larger customers renegotiate their now-larger cdn contracts in a clearly boosted traffic environment?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah. so i'll take both of those. so on the low 20s, the way to think about it is, i just called out when tim asked the question about license revenue, you've got a tougher compare in q2 with $7 million of license revenue, we don't anticipate repeating in q2. you also have the asavie acquisition that will anniversary in q4.
so when you take those two factors into consideration, you'll see the growth rate come down a touch as those sort of work themselves out. on the cdn pricing environment, nothing really to call out there. i've been in this business for a little over 20 years and have sort of gotten numb to pricing at this point. and i don't see anything that is unusual.
and also, if there was anything in our top -- in our earnings -- analyst day, we called out our top eight customers, anyone who's over 1% as a metric. and if there's anything in that group of customers worth calling out, i'd certainly do that and there's really nothing at this point to call out. and as far as renewals are going, we do a pretty good job of anticipating, what to expect, and there hasn't been negative surprises so far. thanks, rob.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from jeff van rhee with craig-hallum.
rudy kessinger -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
hey, guys. this is rudy on for jeff. thanks for taking my questions. i know in security, you've said that there's broad-based strength in the quarter and you expect that to continue.
were there any products in there, maybe one or two that were just a little bit weaker or saw some challenges or slowdowns, just anything you'd call out?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
i don't think there's anything to call out there, just really is outstanding quarter across the board. we're very pleased with how the security business is doing.
rudy kessinger -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
got it. and then with the sustainability goals by 2030, is there any balance you can put around maybe how much expense for those investments there you're factoring in for '21? or just what the expected impact of margins might be from investments there, maybe on the longer term?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah. so i tell with the team that went through this, and there's really not any significant expenses that we anticipate for several years. and even then, the cost that the team has rolled up is not all that significant. we've actually been able to do some pretty creative deals, with certain projects on renewable energy that have worked out to be, from a pricing perspective and overall net economics, have been neutral to even favorable in some cases.
so nothing really there to note. team's doing a fabulous job on it. and as time goes on, if there's anything we need to call out we'll certainly let you know.
rudy kessinger -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst

your next question comes from charlie erlikh with baird.
charlie erlikh -- baird -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking the question. it's chuck erlikh on for will power. i was hoping to dig in a little bit more into the legacy web division. could you maybe talk a little bit more about maybe the puts and takes in that segment and the declines we're seeing there? and then what it might take to stabilize that segment?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah. so i would say, similar to what we've talked about in the past, right? you've got obviously strong security growth. you've got -- from a verticals perspective, you have two verticals, retail and travel, which make up 40% of the legacy web division vertical -- or division, excuse me. and we're still, like i said on a, a few questions ago, we're not quite out of the woods there yet.
we're starting to see some stability, but we're not seeing the type of growth yet there. so it's going to take a bit for that to recover. we're doing a nice job of dealing with certain pricing pressure in those verticals with opening up other shares of the wallet, whether it's additional security products or really starting to see a lot of interest in our edge computing and edge applications business as well. so we'll see dollars potentially shift delivery into to that category as we go through pricing negotiations, but that's pretty normal.
and once we start to see, probably a couple of quarters hopefully, the travel and retail business get back to normal, if these vaccines hold and life returns to normal, hopefully, start to see that segment of the business growing again.
charlie erlikh -- baird -- analyst
ok. and then on the internet platform customers, continuing to see some growth there, which is great. is there anything specifically that's driving that growth? and what should we expect for the rest of the year from that cohort?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah. so it's becoming less impactful. so that's why we're kind of going away from that metric, you didn't hear me talk about in our prepared remarks. i think years ago, people were concerned that that may go to zero.
and we talked a couple of years ago about stabilizing that and getting it back to growth. and the team has just done a phenomenal job. so i'd first tip my hat to the team that's managing those accounts. they've done a nice job of finding areas for us to add value to incredibly innovative technology companies that have their own cdns, and we found a nice spot to pick up business, whether it's adding security or delivering graphics for video and gaming, for big-scale events or for live video or even on-demand video.
we're just finding a nice niche there. and that continues to grow. it's up about $1 million quarter over quarter. very impressive growth rate.
i'd say stability is probably a good way to think about that going through the year. there's always upside with these accounts. teams identifying new areas of opportunity all the time. so very pleased with where we are with those customers and expect to see probably similar numbers, what you're seeing now, down a little bit quarter to quarter, depending on certain things that are going on in those accounts.

our next question comes from alex henderson with needham.
mike cikos -- needham & company -- analyst
hey, guys. mike cikos here again. i did just want to follow up. just looking at my model versus where you guys came in, the sales and marketing expense this quarter was much lower than what we had anticipated.
even if i'm removing the accelerators from 4q and even just looking at q1 '21 versus q1 '20, the amount of leverage in the model. can you talk to how we should expect the sales and marketing to play out over the course of the year? are there savings being realized from that realigned division or the reorganization you guys have talked to earlier this year?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah. that's a good point, mike. so as part of the reorganization here, some shift between sales and marketing, research, and development, a few million bucks, if i remember correctly. and then there was some savings as we moved from the divisional model to one sales force.
there was some synergy, mostly at the management level. so you'll see some of those costs go away as well.
mike cikos -- needham & company -- analyst
great. thank you for clarifying that.
tom barth -- head of investor relations
ok. well, thank you, everyone. in closing, we will be presenting at several investor conferences and roadshows throughout the rest of the second quarter. details of these can be found in the investor relations section of akamai.com.

2021-Q2,AKAM,2021-08-03 16:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the q2 2021 akamai technologies inc. earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, tom barth, investor relations for akamai technologies.
please go ahead.
tom barth -- investor relations
thank you, operator. good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining akamai's second-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. speaking today will be tom leighton, akamai's chief executive officer; and ed mcgowan, akamai's chief financial officer. before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance.
these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. the factors include uncertainty stemming from covid-19 pandemic and any impact from unexpected geopolitical developments. additional information concerning these factors is contained in akamai's filings with the sec, including our annual report on form 10-k and quarterly reports on form 10-q. the forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on august 3, 2021.
akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. as a reminder, we will be referring to some non-gaap financial metrics during today's call. a detailed reconciliation of gaap and non-gaap metrics can be found under the financial portion of the investor relations section at akamai.com. and with that, let me turn the call over to tom. 
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
thanks, tom, and thank you all for joining us today. i'm pleased to report that akamai delivered excellent financial results in the second quarter, coming in at or above the high end of our guidance range for both revenue and eps. q2 revenue was $853 million, up 7% year over year and up 5% in constant currency. non-gaap operating margin in q2 was 32%, which reflects our continued focus on operational efficiency, even as we've continued to invest for future growth.
q2 non-gaap eps was $1.42 per diluted share, up 3% year over year. akamai security solutions continued to perform especially well in q2, generating revenue of $325 million, up 25% year over year, and up 22% in constant currency. cyberattacks generated headlines throughout the first half of the year, and our strong growth reflects the criticality of security to organizations in every sector and geography of the world. akamai is increasingly recognized as a security leader that offers not just innovative and market leading solutions, but also insights into an enormous amount of internet data and threat intelligence, a massive distributed platform at the edge of the internet where most attacks originate.
and the technical expertise of one of the industry's largest and most experienced teams of security professionals. the strong growth of our security portfolio was driven by several product lines, including our market-leading solutions for web app firewall, bot management, ddos prevention and access control. our recently released akamai page integrity manager continued to have rapid adoption in q2. page integrity manager helps businesses protect their users from having credit card data or other personal information stolen by malware embedded in third-party content.
it's also designed to prevent user data from being intentionally or inadvertently sent to third parties, such as advertisers or social networks, which can result in a violation of privacy laws and steep fines. as an example, one of our customers is a leading furniture retailer. page integrity manager detected that one of their partners, a major social media platform, was taking their shoppers' email addresses in violation of their data privacy rules. page integrity manager blocks such transfers of personal data and immediately notifies our customers so that appropriate business actions can be taken.
in june, we entered beta with a related solution that we call audience hijacking protection. audience hijacking protection is designed to detect and block malicious or unwanted activity from client side plug-ins, browser extensions and malware. for example, it can quickly identify vulnerable resources, detect suspicious behavior and block unwanted ads, pop-ups, affiliate fraud and other malicious activities that attempt to hijack a retailer's audience. initial customer interest in this new capability is very strong.
akamai bot manager also continued to perform very well in q2, with revenue growing 40% year over year. bot manager now has nearly 800 customers with an annualized revenue run rate of nearly $200 million. our customers use bot manager to fort a variety of unwanted activities and attacks, such as price scraping, inventory manipulation, credential stuffing, and account takeover. recently, we enhanced our ability to defend against account takeover attempts with the beta launch of akamai account protector.
it's designed to proactively identify and block human fraudulent activity using advanced machine learning, behavioral analytics and reputation heuristics. account protector intelligently evaluates every login request to determine if it's coming from a legitimate user or an impersonator. q2 bookings were also strong for our prolexic service, which helps organizations defend against the surge of ransom ddos attacks that began in q3 of last year. as an example, a leading financial analytics company recently adopted prolexic to protect them from this growing threat.
prior to that, the company faced operational and technical challenges from needing to manage multiple security technologies from various niche vendors and cloud service providers. since consolidating with akamai, they have greatly benefited from reduced complexity, improved security, and greater consistency for compliance and risk management across their many business units. as you all likely know, there have been widespread ransomware, data theft and other malware attacks against major enterprises this year. included were well-publicized attacks on critical infrastructure at a major pipeline company, the world's largest meat packer, and a freight operator that serves as the lifeline for two popular island destinations in new england.
the need to stop these kinds of attacks is driving organizations to adopt new zero trust and secure access service edge, or sase solutions, such as those offered by akamai. for example, when the exchange server attack hit thousands of organizations in march, akamai's email wasn't compromised, because our it department uses akamai's enterprise application access solution, which prevented unauthorized access to our exchange server. our access control suite of products continue to be akamai's fastest-growing security segment in q2, with revenue up 161% year over year, including the acquisition of asavie, and up 57% on an organic basis. as one example of a new customer, we closed a large security contract in q2 with a company that helps maritime operators manage risk.
this company has thousands of employees and hundreds of offices throughout the world. they adopted our enterprise application access and kona site defender solutions to secure the access to their applications and to protect their internal systems from malware and other threats. i'll now turn to our cdn portfolio, which generated revenue of $528 million in q2, down 1% year over year and 4% in constant currency. this result was in line with our expectations and reflects the challenging comparison against last year's pandemic-related jump in traffic and the loss of revenue from chinese applications that were banned from india in july of 2020.
traffic on our platform remained strong in q2, with peaks exceeding 130 terabits per second every day throughout the quarter. this enormous amount of traffic provides strong evidence of how much customers were live on our platform's unparalleled scale and reach, which is enabled by more than 4,200 points of presence at the edge in 135 countries around the world. our tremendous global presence is especially important to the world's major broadcasters, who continue to look to akamai to deliver the world's most significant events. for example, during the recent european football tournament, the peak traffic that we delivered globally for more than 30 broadcasters was 35 terabits per second, nearly five times the peak observed in 2016.
our fast-growing edge applications segment delivered $47 million in q2, up 35% year over year and up 32% in constant currency. this rapid growth rate reflects the shift of compute workloads from core data centers, on-prem or in the cloud, to our edge platform for offload, improved performance, security, and global scale. for example, each time a user accesses one of our retailer customer sites, the retailer's geo location code is executed on an akamai edge server to identify the user's location and then deliver content tailored for that location. overall, we're now supporting an average of five billion such edge computing instantiations per day on our platform.
in summary, i'm pleased to report that we've executed according to the plan we outlined for investors during our february analyst day. in particular, we continued to achieve strong demand from customers for our security and edge computing solutions, diversification of our business across products, geographies and sales channels, and strong financial performance on both the top and bottom lines. before turning the call over to ed, i'd like to formally welcome sharon bowen to our board of directors. sharon's had extensive experience in financial and securities transactions for large global companies, and we're very much looking forward to benefiting from her engagement and counsel.
in addition, as many of you know, our board is now chaired by dan hesse, who succeeded fred salerno in june. dan has held senior management positions in the telco industry for many years, including as ceo of sprint. he's also recognized as a leader in esg and is providing valuable advice and oversight to our senior management team. of course, we all deeply appreciate fred's many years of outstanding leadership and service to akamai, and we wish him the very best in his future endeavors.
i'll now turn the call over to ed to provide further details on our q2 results and our outlook for next quarter and the full year. ed?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
thank you, tom. as tom outlined, akamai delivered another excellent quarter. q2 revenue was $853 million, at the high end of our guidance range and up 7% year over year or 5% in constant currency. revenue growth was led by broad-based strength across our security business globally.
revenue from our security technology group was $325 million, up 25% year over year or 22% in constant currency. security now accounts for 38% of our total revenue. we saw strong performance across our major security products, including bot manager, prolexic, and our access control product suite. revenue from our edge technology group was $528 million, down 1% year over year or 4% in constant currency.
these results were in line with our internal expectations, which factored in challenging comparisons from our outstanding cdn results in q2 a year ago. the tough year-over-year compares within our edge delivery business offset the continued strong growth in our edge applications business. foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $2 million on a sequential basis and a positive $19 million on a year-over-year basis, largely in line with our expectations. international revenue was $403 million, up 15% year over year or 9% in constant currency.
sales in our international markets represented 47% of total revenue in q2, up three points from q2 2020 and up two points from q1 levels. as a reminder, our q2 results last year included approximately $15 million of revenue from china-based apps that were banned in india from q3 2020 onwards. adjusting for this impact, international growth would have been approximately 20% year over year and 14% in constant currency. finally, revenue from our u.s.
market was $450 million, up 1% year over year. moving now to costs. cash gross margin was 76%, in line with our expectations. gaap gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 62%.
non-gaap cash operating expenses were $259 million, slightly below our guidance range due to lower-than-expected hiring during the quarter. now, moving on to profitability. adjusted ebitda was $386 million. our adjusted ebitda margin was 45%, in line with our guidance.
non-gaap operating income was $270 million, and our non-gaap operating margin was 32%, slightly favorable to our guidance due to lower operating expenses i just mentioned. capital expenditures in q2, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $138 million, consistent with our guidance range. gaap net income for the second quarter was $156 million or $0.94 of earnings per diluted share. non-gaap net income was $233 million or $1.42 of earnings per diluted share, up 3% year over year, down 1% in constant currency and $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range.
taxes included in our non-gaap earnings were $39 million, based on a q2 effective tax rate of approximately 14.5%. now i will discuss some balance sheet items. as of june 30th, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $2.6 billion. after accounting for the $2.3 billion of combined principal amounts of our two convertible notes, net cash was approximately $281 million as of june 30th.
now i will review our use of capital. during the second quarter, we spent approximately $96 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 900,000 shares. we ended q2 with approximately $417 million remaining on our previously announced share repurchase authorization. our plan remains to leverage our share buyback program to offset dilution, resulting from equity compensation over time.
moving on to q3 guidance. we are projecting q3 revenue in the range of $845 million to $860 million, or up 7% to 9% as reported, or 6% to 8% in constant currency over q3 2020. foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $3 million impact on q3 revenue compared to q2 levels and a positive $5 million impact year over year. at these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 76%.
q3 non-gaap operating expenses are projected to be $257 million to $262 million, and we anticipate q3 ebitda margins of approximately 45%. moving now to depreciation. we expect non-gaap depreciation expense to be between $120 million to $121 million. factoring in this guidance, we expect non-gaap operating margin of approximately 31% for q3.
moving on to capex. we expect to spend approximately $135 million to $140 million excluding equity compensation in the third quarter. and with the overall revenue and spend configuration i just outlined, we expect q3 non-gaap eps in the range of $1.37 to $1.41. this eps guidance assumes taxes of $38 million to $39 million based on an estimated quarterly non-gaap tax rate of approximately 14.5%.
it also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 165 million shares. looking ahead to the full year, we are raising our guidance for both revenue and eps. we now expect revenue of $3.42 billion to $3.45 billion, which is up 7% to 8% year over year as reported, or up 6% to 7% in constant currency. we now expect security revenue growth to be in the low to mid-20% range for the full year 2021.
we are estimating non-gaap operating margin of approximately 31% and non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $5.54 to $5.65. and this non-gaap earnings guidance is based on a non-gaap effective tax rate of approximately 14.5% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares. finally, full-year capex is anticipated to be approximately 16% of revenue, consistent with our prior guidance. we are very pleased with our excellent financial results in the first half, and we look forward to delivering a strong second half.
thank you. tom and i would be happy to take your questions. operator?

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of james breen from william blair. your line is now open.
james breen -- william blair & company -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. can you talk about some of the seasonality around the business, second, third quarter? obviously, the olympics is happening right now and sort of how you see the impact in the business, given how the traffic patterns have been so far. and then it seems like operating income 31% is moving up a little bit. can you just talk about some of the dynamics and where you see that going as security maybe becomes a bigger part of the business? thanks.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
jim, thanks for the question. this is ed. in terms of seasonality, q3, typically, we tend to see a little bit of slowdown in traffic over the summer months. we were calling for sort of a flattish quarter to q2 here with the guide.
we'll see a little bit of slowdown in august. i would expect -- we've got the olympics in there. not expecting a ton from the olympics this year, it's a couple of million bucks that we have in the quarter. we did see in terms of seasonality in q2, we did see a bit of a lighter gaming quarter in q2.
we would expect to see that probably pick up a bit here in the back half of the year. and then obviously, in q4, that's our most challenging quarter to call, which you've got really 2 seasons there. you've got the commerce season and then the -- we typically see a large media season as well. so we're expecting that in q4.
and we'll update you as we go we'll get more information as the year goes on. and for the next call, we'll update you on what we're seeing for the q4 seasonality. the margin question, yes, we had a better quarter from an operating margin perspective. hiring was a little bit lighter than normal.
just a couple of things to keep in mind on the margin front. july is when we have our annual merit increase or our salary increases, so that comes into effect beginning in q3. then also, we do expect that we'll see some travel expenses and some costs related to offices reopening in the back half of the year as well. tom and i have talked about, we plan on operating the business in the 30% range.
this year, we'll do a little bit better, but we do want to continue to invest for the opportunities we see in front of us in security.
james breen -- william blair & company -- analyst
great. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of sterling auty from j.p. morgan. your line is now open.
sterling auty -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yes, thanks. hi, guys. i'm curious to understand, how you're thinking about the investment on the go-to-market, specifically sales headcount in the security side of the business, given the strength that you're seeing.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
we do have a specialist team for our newest security products. and that's very helpful until the field can get up to speed. but our entire go-to-market operation is now well versed in selling security products. so they really only need the assist for the newly released products.
and so we don't have a bifurcated sales force now.
sterling auty -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
understood. and then just one follow-up in terms of the security competitive landscape, especially on the newer solutions like page integrity manager. who is the point person you're selling into? and are these uncontested, or what other solutions do they tend to consider when they're looking at it?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yes. for our new solutions, you might see a start-up out there with something similar. our normal competition doesn't have these capabilities. and it's a big advantage to be able to offer these capabilities with the existing platform because once you're on akamai, for example, you're using our web app firewall, which is a market-leading solution, it's very easy to add page integrity manager on top.
we just take care of that. the customer says they want it and we turn it on. and the request -- the data flow is not changed. the same will be true with audience hijacking protection, same thing, built right on top of the web app firewall, and our other solutions.
so it really is very convenient for customers to buy from us. and there really isn't something that's comparable in the marketplace. and these are adding great value. in terms of the buyer, audience hijacking protection, that could really go the range.
probably it ends up more toward the marketing side of the house because literally, their audience is being hijack today. any retailer has a problem where because of malware that's on the user's browser or plug-ins or extensions they have, that malware and those plug-ins are looking for somebody about to do a transaction. and what they'll do is put some pop-up over at saying, wait a minute, go here instead. or even worse, it will be some fraud, where they'll change the refer header and claim credit for this buyer and our customer now has to pay more.
so if for products like that, it could be anywhere from the security side all the way through the website and through the marketing side of the house because it provides so much value. it reduces cost, increases revenue and provides greater security. really, it's very nice to see that because it's a very good blend between our delivery and performance solutions and our security solutions all wrapped up in one package.
sterling auty -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
makes sense. thank you. 
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of will tyler from baird. your line is now open.
charlie erlikh
this is charlie erlikh on for will. thanks for taking the question. i had a sort of a two-part question on contract renegotiations. i guess, first, are there any big contracts coming up that we should be aware of, or is it pretty spread out over the back half of the year and into next year? and then part two, for the contract renegotiations that you've already had, kind of curious what you're hearing in terms of sort of the health of the customers? and are they still asking for price concessions? or are we closer to back to pre-pandemic levels in that respect? thanks.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes. so in terms of the big contracts up for renewal, we had a few that we did this quarter. and then, i'd say, the rest are sort of spread out fairly evenly. if there's ever anything that is major, i tend to try to call that out.
but as we disclosed in our ir day, we don't have significant customer concentration risk. but sometimes, you can get a few of them all together that can make a little bit of noise in the quarter, but they're pretty much spread out. and in terms of the health of the customers, it really varies by vertical. we do see, i would say, pretty standard pricing discussions.
this industry traditionally has had deflationary pricing when it comes to especially volumes, it's driven by volume. and i don't see any major change there. really nothing to call out. i think it's still too early to call an end to the pandemic, obviously.
so we've got some significant business with commerce and retailers, and that's still kind of playing itself out at this point. we've seen some pickup in volume, but we're not out of the woods yet there. but in terms of overall pricing, really nothing to call out in terms of any major changes.
charles erlikh -- baird -- analyst
great. thanks, ed. and just if i can just squeeze in another one. you used to give this helpful metric on the percentage of customers that are taking one security product and the percentage that are taking multiple security products.
is that something that you could provide us now, or you're not giving that metric anymore?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure. i can give you that number. so right now, we've got about 55% of our customers that are buying one security product and about 32% that are buying more than one. but just keep in mind that our customer base has grown over the last year, it's up probably by 5% or 6% over the last year.
so we're doing a pretty good job of getting penetration into the base. but the base is also growing. if i go back a year ago, q2 of 2020, that number for folks that have acquired a security product was around 59%. so we're seeing really healthy growth in terms of the overall number of customers, both from penetration of the base, but also just the size of the customer base is growing as well.
charles erlikh -- baird -- analyst
great. thanks very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of keith weiss for morgan stanley. your line is now open.
mike wilson -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. it's mike wilson on for keith weiss. thank you for taking our question. i'd like to dig a little bit deeper into the edge applications.
what type of use cases you're seeing? and what other verticals you're kind of seeing traction in besides retail? you gave a nice example in your prepared remarks, but anything additional would be helpful.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
sure. it really is useful, i think, across all verticals. gaming is another example of the big -- our big gaming customers have interest there. they want to get local decisions made in terms of who's playing who, what master server maybe they go back to for the gaming instructions.
another great example is the covid vaccine registration sites. in this case, it was a third-party company unrelated to us, built a queuing application on top of our edgeworkers solution that is used today by, i think, dozens now, governments and pharmaceutical companies to assist in getting vaccine registrations. and of course, in the early days in the u.s. and still in many countries, there's a lot more people that want to get a vaccine than you have capacity for and so you want to be fair.
so if somebody comes into the website, they get into the queue, and they know how long the queue is and that whole process is managed. and again, that's an ideal application to run with our edge computing service. and also handles all the excess load and the flash crowd around the site when you announced, ok, we got a lot of vaccines available in a certain period of time. a lot of people come at once.
so maybe they know when that's going to happen, and so we provide the overflow capacity for that. but really, anything you could imagine that involves locality, the need to rapidly scale would be a suitable use for our edgeworkers solutions. iot applications, i think, in the future is a big driver of demand there. and i think that gets enabled by 5g as that gets deployed, and you get a lot more devices connected.
but there, you've got a lot of devices with a lot of communication back and forth, very chatty protocols, data being sent in and you need to aggregate that and make decisions quickly locally on the fly, edge computing, edge applications is a good example for that. tailoring the content based on the device type and the local connectivity is another example. we do that with our image and video manager applications, where if you're on a, say, a cellular device, you don't have a big screen and maybe you don't have great connectivity, we will automatically, at the edge with the edge computing, put in a smaller -- a lower resolution version of the image. and on your device, it will look the same.
so there's no real reduction in quality, but the less traffic needed to convey the image means you get better performance for the end user. so there's just all sorts of applications that people are using. and now we're doing those kinds of things five billion times a day on our edge platform using edge java.
mike wilson -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's really great color. and then pivoting to the cdn solutions within the edge technology group, anything to call out in terms of pricing? and then how should we think about revenue from the internet platform customers and the second half of 2021?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes. i'll take that one, tom. so in terms of pricing, as i just mentioned, really nothing to call out on the pricing side. as far as internet platform customers go, the team's doing a great job executing there, we continue to grow that group of customer's obviously very highly innovative customer base, a lot of them have their own cdn, but we're doing a good job of growing that business and very happy with the performance there.
i expect that revenue stream to continue to run along about the same pace that it's going now for the rest of the year, maybe see a little bit of upside in this fourth quarter.
mike wilson -- morgan stanley -- analyst
all right. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of james fish from piper sandler. your line is now open.
james fish -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for the questions. first, on the external and internal-based cloud access solutions, what one is really leading the charge at this point? and what has been the pushback from customers that are evaluating other solutions that may pick a competitor? and do you plan on building or acquiring into the rest of that sase stack like in dlp or casb?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
so yes, we're interested in the entire sase stack. i would say we're really focused though on stopping malware, stopping these ransom ddos, ransomware attacks, stopping data exfiltration. and that puts us in the direction of a focus on access to make sure that we do the access control of the application layer, not as it's traditionally done at the network layer. and that makes a huge difference in terms of the malware getting inside in the first place.
also, we have secure web gateway capabilities, probably market-leading dns capabilities, which makes a big difference in terms of data exfiltration. and we do have some dlp capabilities today with our newest version of enterprise threat protector. casb, less capabilities there today, potentially of interest, but not the primary mission in terms of stopping the data exfiltration, the ransomware attacks, the malware attacks on enterprises. and of course, ransom ddos, which our prolexic solution helps a lot along with kona.
so good traction there. as you see the growth on the access side of the house now, well over 50% organically. and of course, if you account the asavie acquisition, over 160% year over year. we plan to continue investing there organically.
also through potentially m&a, we're always looking there. and i think that has a lot of future potential for us.
james fish -- piper sandler -- analyst
that's helpful, tom. and i guess i'll be the one to take the bait. obviously, 2 outages during the last couple of months here. can you just walk us through, maybe add what the financial impact could be in terms of any sla refunds or what you heard back in terms of feedback from customers regarding the dns and the ddos issues? thanks, guys.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yes. in terms of financial impact, de minimis. we lost, at the peak, about 2% of our traffic for up to one hour. so not any financial impact per se.
that said, we care a lot about reliability at akamai. it is core to everything we want to do. and we've put a ton of effort into making our solutions be reliable over the last 10-plus years. in fact, you have to go back to 2004 to find anything comparable in terms of what's happened on our platform.
in 2004, we actually took the entire platform down for about an hour, which was disastrous. that didn't happen in this case, but we did hurt hundreds of our customers, and we deeply regret that. we impacted them and their users, and that's unacceptable. in both cases, there was an update that caused a problem.
and we have invested a lot in infrastructure to make sure that updates are done safely. in this case, the updates were totally different and totally different systems at akamai. but as a result of this, we are taking a fresh look at how we release updates to make sure that something like this won't happen again. and meanwhile, we've locked down all update channels as we do a thorough investigation of each one.
people don't often realize it, but we are constantly doing updates. we have a platform with dozens of services. we have many, many thousands of customers. any given customers maybe wanted to make an update to their site on an hourly basis or more.
and so it's just thousands and thousands a day of updates that are taking place in the platform. and because of the really very intense work that we've done over the last decade, we have had an excellent track record of keeping any problem with an update from spreading. humans making updates will make mistakes. and our goal is to catch them early and prevent them from spreading.
and in this case, there were two different channels where that didn't happen the way we want it to. and so we are putting in a lot of effort to look at every possible channel and make sure it is working the way we want to. and not only do we not want to have any more incidents this year, we don't want to be having this happen in the next 10 years. and so there's a lot of effort going into making sure that's the case.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of tim horan from oppenheimer. your line is now open.
timothy horan -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
thanks. tom, just maybe two really higher-level questions. can you just talk about how important edge compute do you think is going to be in the cloud in terms of for specific applications? what percentage will have some edge component to it? and how do you think your infrastructure holds up compares to competitors for providing that edge? and then on the security front, another just really high-level question. do customers understand how much better cloud-based security is than on-prem? and where are we with that process?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yes, good questions. i think edge computing is really important in the future. and when i say edge, i really mean edge, and that's a big difference with the competition, none of whom really have an edge platform. of course, for the last couple of years, everybody says they have edge everything.
it's just it's not true. we're in over 4,000 locations, in about 1,000 cities and 135 countries, and nobody is anywhere, anywhere close to that. and we offer native javascript support now, which a lot of the folks that talk about edge computing don't. and we spin up our apps in a few milliseconds, and that's a factor of 1,000 better than some of the folks that talk a lot about edge computing out there.
so i think we stack up very well against the competition there. and i think you see that reflected in our very strong growth. that segment now well over 30% growth year over year. we think we can maintain that.
and on a reasonable size number, last year, $150 million. we're now almost up to a $200 million annual revenue run rate for our edge applications business. so i think very strong future potential. and as you grow in your 30% a year on a number that's about $200 million now, after a few years, that starts really being meaningful.
and i think that drives accelerated growth for the cdn business. and remind me again of the security question you had.
timothy horan -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
well, it seems like security is rapidly moving to the cloud. i guess the customers understand how much better that is. where do you think we are in the process?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yes, that's a good question. it's interesting because we started with application firewall. and if you go back five or six years, pretty much everybody bought a device and managed it in their data set. and today, there's still a few enterprises that do that.
but pretty much all the major b2c companies on large -- majority of them are now using akamai for that as a cloud service. and we're the market leader by far in application firewall. you look at ddos. and again, go back five-plus years, that was managed either in the data center or with a single carrier.
and that just doesn't work anymore. you can't handle the volume. and so now akamai is the market leader by far with a cloud service there. i think you will see the same thing happen with enterprise security.
today, it is done, you get your vpn and you get your boxes and you manage them in your data center. that is not a good way to do it. that's why you have all these breaches. when you're providing network layer access, it's a disaster.
you look at the big pipeline company that had a problem. it's just one of many thousands of enterprises. credentials to the vpn are stolen, put on the dark web, somebody gets them. and that just gives them access to the entire network.
and you can't do it that way. and that's why our solutions are so important with application layer access. now sure, you can steal somebody's credentials, but of course, you want multi-factor authentication. and then you only get access to the app.
and if you're using akamai, you don't even get access to the app directly. you got to come through us, and we'll make sure there's no malware going to that app or you're not exploiting vulnerabilities, and then you don't have those kind of situations. so i think if you look at the exchange server situation, which i talked about a few minutes ago. again, by having akamai in front with our enterprise application access, our email wasn't stolen, even though we had the vulnerable software like everybody else did.
so it will take some time. we're at the beginnings of, i'd say, zero trust approach and moving to the cloud, in particular to the edge  my edge platform for enterprise security, but i do think there's a tremendous future there because we're in a position to really stop those breaches.
timothy horan -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of colby synesael from cowen. your line is now open.
colby synesael -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you. two modeling questions, if i might. the first one, just looking at the guide increase for 2021, just curious if you're going to agree with how i'm thinking about it, which is it seems like it reflects a 2q upside, maybe a little bit of upside in terms of your expectations for 3q, but really no change as it relates to your assumptions for 4q. and it sounds like that's more a function of just lack of visibility opposed to some type of step-down or negative impact, if you will, that you're now anticipating? just curious, if i'm thinking about that correctly.
and then secondly, it sounds like in response to one of questions, regarding m&a. tom may have been suggesting that you guys obviously continue to look and may even be close to something. are you guys still holding a line where m&a is expected to be accretive within some short period of time? or are valuations getting to a point now, where if you were, in fact, to do something of materiality, it could actually be relatively meaningfully dilutive just given what you'd have today? thank you.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
all right. so i'll take the first question, colby. so in terms of q4, i think you're thinking about it correctly, we always talk on q4 being the hardest quarter to call. and then obviously, there's been a bit of a flare-up here with the delta virus.
so we're going with what we see now, as i said earlier in the call, we'll update you as we get more visibility. there's two seasons to call. there's the commerce season, and commerce is a very important vertical for us. and then also, as we've seen in the last several years, there tends to be a big jump step-up in media.
so we'll get some more information as we go. but i think you're thinking about it correctly.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yes. and in terms of the m&a question, we're always looking for companies that have novel capabilities that we can use to build products for our customers that are synergistic with our platform and our solutions we have today. and you're right, there are areas, particularly in security and also edge computing that have very high valuations to that. and that makes it harder to do acquisitions that make sense because we're not going to do something that's crazy.
now when you're looking at acquisition, we look at it over the long term. and so that we want it to be accretive, certainly over the long-term. in addition to the purchase price, we also worry about the hit margins. especially when you do an acquisition, often as you know, the first year, you have revenue recognition issues where you don't get to recognize all the revenue right away.
and so in the first year, you can take a hit to your margins. and if we find the right acquisition that is really helpful to us in growth over the long term and it will be accretive to margins over the long term, there may be a situation where we would take a short-term hit to margins, and then we would improve them from there.
colby synesael -- cowen and company -- analyst
okay, great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of brandon nispel from keybanc capital. your line is now open.
brandon nispel -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. ed, i'm curious about, you mentioned headcount growth slowed and actually was down sequentially. can you update us on your hiring plans for the rest of the year? and do you believe the company needs another phase of investment in headcount in order to sustain the current growth trajectory? thanks.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure. so i talked about headcount being a little bit behind hiring. obviously, last year, we had record low attrition. and we're still not back to the attrition levels that we saw pre-pandemic.
but we're just a little bit behind on our hiring. i expect that will catch up. we're scaling the company very well. as you can see, our margins have improved quite a bit.
but we still want to make investments in security. you've seen some of our newer products have grown to a pretty material size. we've got some very fast and exciting growing businesses with our edge computing business along with very deep product bench for security. so we're going to continue to invest there.
there will be some investments in go-to-market. and then, obviously, as we continue to grow, there'll be some scaling heads that we have to add. but nothing in terms of like a major investment cycle or anything like that that we anticipate coming.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of mike cikos from needham & company. your line is now open.
mike cikos -- needham & company -- analyst
hi, team. thanks for taking the questions. i wanted to focus on the security and the improved outlook you guys provided today. it seems like the security, in general is facing broad-based demand, but are there any solutions specifically that are driving this improved outlook? and then i guess a follow-on, with the current threat environment, the headlines we're seeing, is this driving a material change in customer interest? are you seeing any noticeable impact on sales cycles or budget flowing into this space as a result of that?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
the good news is we're seeing strong demand across all of our major security product lines. and also, the new security products are obviously not contributing a lot of revenue yet, but we're seeing strong interest in those as well. so it's a good picture across the board. the threat environment certainly increases the awareness and need for our solutions.
in terms of sales cycle, obviously, if a customer is under attack, the sales cycle can be very short. in many cases, we'll integrate the customer within a matter of hours or days and often a follow up with all the details of the contract later. and we've seen a lot of that with these ransom ddos attacks, dozens and dozens of major enterprises in that situation that very quickly become happy akamai customers. so it's a good environment, i would say, in terms of security sales for all of our security products right now.
mike cikos -- needham & company -- analyst
thanks for that. and if i'm just thinking about the traffic trends, trying to parse out between the typical seasonality where there's a slower leg, if you will, in the summer months. and i'm matching that up against what we have with covid and this delta variant we're seeing, trying to -- can you guys better comment on that? i'm just trying to put those two pieces together to see what's baked into the guidance as we stand today, or how you see that traffic playing out over the last month, now that we're in q3. thank you.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah, good question. so what we've assumed here is that there really isn't going to be a major step-up in demand like we saw last year. so not anticipating major lockdowns or anything like that. so then, obviously, if something like that were to happen, it could increase our traffic in the quarter.
we do see typical seasonality in the summer months, typically august. europe, in particular, tends to be lighter than expected. so we're anticipating that. it's offset a little bit by the olympics.
again, i told you not a ton there, a few million bucks for the olympics. but security growth is also not necessarily impacted by traffic. so we could see -- if we do see lockdowns, we could see traffic accelerate a bit. and we're not really anticipating that, it's not in our guide at this point.
we are expecting to see a strong seasonal q4. and like i said a couple of times now, we'll update when we talk to you again, when we get more visibility. but traffic has got back to, what i would call, more normal growth rates. obviously, we went through a year and a half of accelerated traffic growth with the launch of some major ott platforms along with the pandemic.
so we're modeling what i would consider to be sort of a more normal cdn outlook.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of ben rose from battle road research. your line is now open.
ben rose -- battle road research -- analyst
yes. good afternoon. a question for tom and then a question for ed. for tom, you mentioned at the outset, the akamai account protector that you're working on in beta.
i was curious to know if you could provide a little bit more information on the kind of benefits to customers that would come from this product that may not be available in akamai's security portfolio currently.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
sure. account protector is sort of the next step beyond bot manager. bot manager detects whether it's a human being that's trying to, for example, to log into an account. and as you probably know, there's a ton of account stuffing going on.
we see every day now about 1 billion illegitimate attempts to log into an account of some kind, a bank account, a gaming account, a commerce account. and the vast, vast majority of that is bot traffic. credentials have been stolen somewhere and a bot network is used to check out those credentials against a lot of websites to see if you get a hit. now the adversaries have evolved, the attackers have evolved, and now will use humans to attempt to log in and steal accounts.
now you can't do that at the same scale as you can with a bot army. but you use things that you think may well get in and now the human will do it. and so we need to decide, well, ok, it's human, but is it the right human? and that's what account protector is all about. and it will use information about the human that's been using that account before with a variety of inputs and trust scores and then using machine learning to the side on the fly based on everything we can see here, is this the right human for this account? and we give a score that is used to decide, are we going to provide access directly? do you go to some other security mechanism, like you get asked questions or a capture test of some kind, or do you just block? and that's what account protector does.
so it is one-step deeper analysis that will now deal with human-based fraud and then specifically around the login function. now of course, bot manager covers a lot of other things, too, like price scraping, inventory stealing, inventory -- reserving all the seats in a hotel or an airline by a competitor, that kind of thing. so this is really focused on fraud and login that's being done by humans.
tom barth -- investor relations
ben, you had a question for ed, maybe you could restate it.

ben, what was your question for ed? thank you, everyone. in closing, we will be presenting at several investor conferences and road shows throughout the rest of the third quarter. details of these can be found on the investor relations section of akamai.com. thank you for joining us, and all of us here at akamai wish you continued good health and have a wonderful evening.

operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to akamai technologies inc. third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to tom barth, head of investor relations.
thank you. please go ahead.
tom barth -- head of investor relations
thank you, operator. good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining akamai's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. speaking today will be tom leighton, akamai's chief executive officer; and ed mcgowan, akamai's chief financial officer. before we get started, please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance.
these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. these factors include uncertainty stemming from the covid-19 pandemic, the integration of any acquisitions and any impact from unexpected geopolitical developments. additional information concerning these factors is contained in akamai's filings with the sec, including our annual report on form 10-k and quarterly reports on form 10-q. the forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on november 2, 2021.
akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. as a reminder, we will be referring to some non-gaap financial metrics during today's call. a detailed reconciliation of gaap and non-gaap metrics can be found under the financial portion of the investor relations section of akamai.com. and with that, let me turn the call over to tom.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
thanks, tom, and thank you all for joining us today. i'm pleased to report that akamai delivered excellent financial results in the third quarter, coming in at or above the high end of our guidance ranges for revenue, operating margin and earnings per share. q3 revenue was $860 million, up 9% year over year and up 8% in constant currency. non-gaap operating margin in q3 was 32%, which reflects our continued focus on operational efficiency, even as we've continued to invest for future growth.
q3 non-gaap eps was $1.45 per diluted share, up 11% year over year. akamai's strong performance in q3 was largely driven by our security business, which is now one of the leading cloud security businesses in the world. with an annualized revenue run rate of more than $1.3 billion, up 26% year over year and up 25% in constant currency. over the last several years, we've grown our security portfolio from point solutions into a comprehensive platform that provides defense in depth to address our customers' biggest threats.
the unique breadth of our defenses is important to our customers who want more security capabilities from fewer vendors. our security solutions are highly differentiated and recognized as best-in-class by our customers. who see us as a leading provider of services that protect their most critical assets, including enterprise websites, applications, data and access. we routinely earn top rankings in multiple categories from major industry analysts.
for example, akamai disrupted the web app security market when we launched kona site defender in 2012. since then, we've continued to extend our leadership position in the web app firewall sector with gartner recently naming akamai as a market leader for the fifth year in a row. akamai has been the market leader in ddos protection since we acquired prolexic in 2014. forrester recently said, ""large enterprise clients that want an experienced trusted vendor to make their ddos problem go away, should look to akamai."" as new threat vectors have emerged, we've extended our platform to defend against them.
for example, we created the first comprehensive bot management solution to protect our customers from sophisticated bot operators who try to steal content, disrupt operations or penetrate user accounts. according to forrester, akamai is best for companies wanting to fort bots at the edge. bloomberg business week, even quoted a hacker, calling akamai bot defense, ""the hardest to crack."" more recently, we released akamai page integrity manager to identify malicious code in third-party scripts and websites that's designed to steal end user data. page integrity manager helps to address a major threat that's been costing businesses, hundreds of millions of dollars and fines as well as serious reputation damage.
we plan to extend our web app protections further in the coming months with the release of account protector and audience high jacking prevention. account protector is designed to reduce fraud by making sure that the entity logging into an account is the true owner of that account. audience hijacking prevention can help businesses protect sales by fording malware that diverts a customer just before the completion of a transaction. since founding akamai over 20 years ago, our vision has always been to help our customers solve their toughest internet challenges.
and today, that includes stopping ransomware. ransomware is a huge problem for enterprises around the world with a new attack striking every 11 seconds. the damage resulting from ransomware is expected to amount to over $20 billion this year alone. guardicore is critical to stopping the spread of ransomware, and that's a key reason why we acquired the company.
akamai is already selling solutions, such as enterprise application access, that help prevent attackers from gaining access to enterprise infrastructure and applications. but to be secure in today's world, you also need a second layer of defense to block the spread of malware that has gained a foothold in the enterprise. and that's where guardicore comes in. guardicore helps detect when a breach has occurred by identifying anomalous data flows within enterprise networks.
guardicore also helps prevent the malware from spreading through a capability known as micro-segmentation. guardicore's micro-segmentation solution limits access within the enterprise to only those applications that are authorized to communicate with one another. denying communication as the default greatly limits the spread of malware and protects the flow of enterprise data across the network. and that's the key to stopping ransomware.
we believe guardicore's best-in-class micro-segmentation solution is the perfect addition to our zero trust portfolio, enabling akamai to offer customers a comprehensive solution to stop the damage being caused by ransomware and malware. during the call we held on september 29, we spoke about the parallels between our acquisition of guardicore with our acquisition of prolexic in 2014. just as the acquisition of prolexic propelled us to a leadership position in helping to stop ddos attacks. we believe that the acquisition of guardicore will establish akamai as a leader in helping to stop the damage caused by ransomware as well as other forms of malware.customers see akamai as a strategic partner in security, not only because of the strength and breadth of our solutions, but also because of the depth of our security expertise and threat intelligence and the scale of our platform.
the same platform that underpins our world-leading cdn. akamai cdn handles over five trillion requests every day. in addition, we resolved more than three trillion dns queries each day. this gives us unmatched real-time insight into the world's internet traffic, which we analyze to provide best-in-class threat intelligence, protection and support.
we also have one of the industry's largest and most experienced teams of security professionals with thousands of engineers and consultants working on security for our customers. our security solutions are tightly integrated into the world's largest and most distributed edge platform, and that provides unmatched global scale to defend customers against not only the largest ddos attacks, but also against the vast spot armies that are waging attacks from the edge. the integration of our security solutions with our cdm solutions also provides benefits to our customers in terms of improved performance and ease of use. with akamai, security and performance go hand in hand.
you can buy them together as a single protect and perform package, which makes purchasing and integration easy for the customer. and when you buy security from akamai, your performance has automatically improved. that's because we apply the security layer as we are delivering the content from the world's true edge platform. this means that the processing needed for security stays close to the end user, which makes for much better performance.
akamai's unique combination of security and delivery provides a powerful offering in the market. which is one reason by we're the market leaders in both security and cdn. our cdn business also generates substantial cash that we can use to invest in future growth, as we've recently done with the guardicore acquisition. for example, our cdn business generated revenue of $526 million in q3 and contributed substantially to our overall free cash flow of $273 million, enough to cover almost half of what we spent to acquire guardicore.
we believe that having the world's largest and most distributed edge network also provides a great foundation for the growth of our edge applications business. as 5g rolls out as iot applications proliferate and as more data is created and processed at the edge, akamai's edge compute platform is very well suited to support the high throughput and low latency applications that are not well served by traditional cloud providers today. from delivery and performance to compute and security, the world's leading brands want our help. that's because the internet is getting more complicated, with more traffic, higher user expectations and more cyber threats every day.
and the world's leading enterprises know that akamai can help keep their digital experiences close to their end users and the threats farther away. they know that what we do makes life better for billions of people, billions of times a day and that nobody powers and protects life online like akamai. i'll now turn the call over to ed to provide further details on our q3 results and our outlook for the rest of the year. ed?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
thank you, tom. as tom just outlined, akamai delivered another excellent quarter. q3 revenue was $860 million, up 9% year over year or 8% in constant currency. revenue was again driven by very strong results in our security business.
revenue from our security technology group was $335 million, up 26% year over year or 25% in constant currency. security now accounts for 39% of our total revenue. revenue from our edge technology group was $526 million, flat year over year and down 1% in constant currency. foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $5 million on a sequential basis and positive $4 million on a year-over-year basis.
international revenue was $412 million, up 16% year over year or 15% in constant currency. sales in our international markets represented 48% of total revenue in q3 and up three points from q3 2020 and up one point from q2 levels. finally, revenue from our u.s. market was $449 million, up 3% year over year.
moving now to costs. cash gross margin was 76%, in line with our expectations. gaap gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 63%. non-gaap cash operating expenses were $261 million.
now moving on to profitability. adjusted ebitda was $396 million. our adjusted ebitda margin was 46%. non-gaap operating income was $277 million, and non-gaap operating margin was 32%.
capital expenditures in q3, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $129 million. this was below our guidance range, primarily due to continued progress on network capex efficiency projects. gaap net income for the third quarter was $179 million or $1.08 of earnings per diluted share. non-gaap net income was $239 million or $1.45 of earnings per diluted share, up 11% year over year, up 10% in constant currency and $0.04 above the high end of our guidance range.
taxes included in our non-gaap earnings were $39 million, based on a q3 effective tax rate of approximately 14%. moving now to cash and our use of capital. as of september 30, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $2.8 billion. after accounting for the $2.3 billion of combined principal amounts of our two convertible notes, net cash was approximately $452 million as of september 30.
during the third quarter, we spent approximately $97 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 800,000 shares. we ended q3 with approximately $321 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization, which runs through the end of this year. as noted in today's press release, our board authorized a new buyback program of up to $1.8 billion, beginning january 1, 2022, and running through the end of 2024. as we previously discussed, our primary intention is to buy back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time.
however, our repurchase authorizations also allow us to opportunistically deploy capital if or when we believe there is a valuation disconnect in the market based on business or market conditions. combining the two authorizations, we currently have more than $2 billion available for share repurchases through the end of 2024. we believe our strong balance sheet and significant free cash flow generation, which totaled $273 million or 32% of total revenue in q3, also provides us with significant financial flexibility to pursue a balanced capital deployment strategy. as such, we plan to continue to invest organically in r&d and product development, expand our capabilities through m&a, as you saw with our most recent acquisition of guardicore and return capital to shareholders via share repurchases.
moving on to q4 guidance. there are two factors to consider as you update your models for the fourth quarter. first, we closed the acquisition of guardicore on october 20. our guidance assumes guardicore will contribute approximately $6 million to $7 million of revenue in q4.
it also assumes that guardicore will be approximately $0.05 dilutive to our total non-gaap earnings per share in q4. second, as in prior years, seasonality plays a large role in determining our fourth quarter financial performance. we typically see higher than normal traffic for our large media customers and from seasonal online retail activity for our e-commerce customers, which are both difficult to predict. with that in mind, we are projecting q4 revenue in the range of $883 million to $908 million or up 4% to 7%, as reported, or 5% to 8% in constant currency over q4 2020.
foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $3 million impact on q4 revenue compared to q3 levels and a negative $6 million impact year over year. at these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 76%. q4 non-gaap operating expenses are projected to be $290 million to $201 million. we anticipate q4 ebitda margins of approximately 43% to 44%.
we expect non-gaap depreciation expense to be between $120 million to $121 million. factoring in this guidance, we expect non-gaap operating margin of approximately 30% for q4. moving on to capex. we expect to spend approximately $128 million to $133 million, excluding equity compensation in the fourth quarter.
this represents less than 15% of anticipated total revenue. and with the overall revenue and spend configuration i just outlined, we expect q4 non-gaap eps in the range of $1.37 to $1.44. this eps guidance assumes taxes of $38 million to $39 million based on an estimated quarterly non-gaap tax rate of approximately 14.5%. it also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares.
looking ahead to the full year, we are raising our guidance. we now expect revenue of 3.439 million to $3.44 billion, which is up 8% year over year as reported or up 7% in constant currency. we now expect security revenue growth to be in the mid-20% range for the full year 2021. we are estimating non-gaap operating margin of approximately 31% and non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $5.63 to $5.69.
and this non-gaap earnings guidance is based on a non-gaap effective tax rate of approximately 14.5% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares. finally, full year capex is anticipated to be approximately 16% of revenue, consistent with our prior guidance. we are very pleased to deliver another quarter of excellent financial results, and we look forward to closing out a strong 2021. thank you.
tom and i would be happy to take your questions. operator?

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of james fish from piper sandler. your line is now open.
jim fish -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi guys. thanks for the questions. a couple of your competitors are starting to get a little bit louder on the security side with getting a foot in the door with government and zero trust architectures. so i guess my question is, how is the federal vertical for you this quarter? and what will it take for akamai to become more part of those conversations, especially when you guys already do service some government stuff?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yes. our government business is very strong, particularly in security. we defend most all the major agencies in the government, pretty much every branch of the military. so i would say we have a very strong business there.
jim fish -- piper sandler -- analyst
all right. and then on guardicore, how long until the 100-plus reps are likely selling the entire security portfolio? and really also any update to the go-to-market until security stand-alone sales channel partners as well as what you guys are doing to target developers better with edge applications? thanks guys.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
jim, it's ed here. i'll take the first one and then maybe tom can follow up on the developers. but in terms of the sales force, we're going to maintain the sales force that we acquired from guardicore. this is pretty typical what we do with our acquisitions.
they'll be primarily in an overlay function. it's a little bit different of a sale, very similar to some of our enterprise sales, and we just will build out that team a bit. it'll probably take maybe a year or so as the reps start to introduce guardicore into their accounts that they begin to get comfortable with the selling guardicore. it's been our typical model.
so i think we've got a pretty good acquired a great team from guardicore, and we just combine that with our existing enterprise sales team. and then as far as channels go, we did pick up a few channel partners as a result of garlic and we're so actively out recruiting more and more channel partners.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
and in terms of the developer focused question, we've done a lot of work to make our platform be very accessible to developers a lot of effort there and strong progress. and in fact, on a daily basis, we're now spinning up about five billion applications on edge workers and that's every day. so strong adoption of our capabilities in terms of edge computing.
operator
your next question comes from the line of sterling auty from jpmorgan.
sterling auty -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
thanks. hi guys. so you gave us the security growth on a constant currency, but can you give us a sense of what it was on an organic constant currency basis? and tom, you highlighted a number of different areas, the strength in ddos, etc.. what was kind of the tip of the spear that drove the growth this quarter in particular?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
sterling, this is ed. so the organic security growth in constant currency would be about 22%. so we added about three points of growth. tom, do you want to take the other part?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yes. and the strength was really across all of our product categories, all of them growing at close to 20% or more. infrastructure doing well, app and api protection, fraud well into close to 30% growth and access the best of all. and of course, that will get a lot stronger now with guardicore and the ransomware solution.
so i guess it's across the board in security.
sterling auty -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
that's great. maybe one real quick one. given the contribution you're expecting from guardicore in q4, does that mean that the run rate in terms of what the contribution in '22 might actually be better than what you thought at the time of the acquisition?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes. sterling, two points on that. so yes, i think we should see better contribution from guardicore. and also, we've been off to a pretty good start here in the first couple of weeks since we've closed the acquisition.
they finished very strong. i was very impressed to see several multimillion-dollar deals in several different verticals across the different geos. we saw a couple in the u.s., a couple in emea and apj, we saw deals in transportation, which isn't really a huge vertical for akamai, as well as other verticals were strong in like insurance and finance. so off to a pretty good start, pretty optimistic so far, and i do think they'll contribute a bit more next year.
we'll give you a full guidance on our next call for next year. but so far, off to a pretty good start.
sterling auty -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
excellent. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of colby synesael from cowen & company.
michael elias -- cowen and company -- analyst
this is michael on for colby. two questions, if i may. first, as you think about the incremental security offerings that could make sense to add via m&a moving forward, what comes to mind? and then second, what are you seeing from the customer verticals that have been more heavily impacted by the pandemic as we go into the holiday season?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
thank you. yes. we continue to look and invest in new capabilities in security, both organically and through m&a. as we talked about, page integrity manager released in the last year, a very exciting technology.
going forward, we have account protector. there's a lot of customer interest there. and then early next year, audience hijacking protection. i think a lot of customers have asked for that, and that stops malware or plug-ins from stealing or hijacking their audience right before the point of sale or the transaction is executed.
obviously, in the access segment, i think that's a huge area of future growth. really excited about the guardicore acquisition. that combines very nicely with our zero trust solutions. it combines with enterprise application access to give you the full combination of north, southeast, west, i think will be compelling in the market.
so we're continuing to invest across the board. and of course, with the existing solutions that we continually work on those to add features, stay ahead of the new attack vectors. and so it's not just like you build a web app firewall, you're constantly adding new capabilities to it to stay ahead the attackers to keep our customers safe.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
and on your second question -- yes, sure. so the second question was around the verticals that are impacted. and if you recall, we called out commerce and travel. i'd say in travel, we're starting to see a bit of improvement there, starting to see traffic pick up a little bit.
as a reminder, that's about 4% of our total revenue. so it doesn't have a huge impact in terms of what we're seeing as far as an improvement. but it's good to see that, that's starting to pick up a little bit. commerce, i would say, is pretty mixed.
we're seeing good strength in security, still seeing some pressure, especially in the u.s. commerce vertical, that's a much bigger vertical that's around 15% of total revenue. so we're not quite out of the woods yet with commerce, again, especially in the u.s., that's the area that we're probably seeing the most weakness and that's still persisting from the pandemic.
michael elias -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of keith weiss from morgan stanley. your line is now open.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you guys for taking the question. two kind of areas that i was hoping to dig into. can you talk to the disparity in growth between the u.s. and international? i thought it had more to do historically with sort of platform customers in the u.s.
underperforming. but now the platform customers are actually doing really well and growing pretty well. so i kind of lost the thread on why the u.s. is still underperforming international regions.
and then a second question on sort of the operating margin side of the equation. any kind of guidelines you could give us and how we should think about calendar year '22? a lot of companies are talking to us about reiteration, if you will, maybe more spending on travel and people come back to the office and marketing events ramping back up. on the flip side of the equation, you've been kind of underspending on capex versus the original target and then that's coming down as a percentage of revenue. so perhaps there's some gross margin benefit that you could see in calendar '22 could offset that.
so any kind of sense you could give us on how to start thinking about calendar year '22 margins?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
sure. so i'll start with the second part on margins. so yes, you're correct. i mean next year, we'll be expecting that we should start traveling again.
so there'll be a little bit more opex there. you're right to call out capex as i think the team's doing a fantastic job on a lot of capex efficiency projects that we've got going with both software and hardware, being able to drive that down. we would expect that capex to be back to those normal levels that we've seen, maybe even a touch lower. so that impacts your depreciation, but it takes a while for that to flow through the model.
so you won't get a ton of benefit of that right away, but certainly, down the road, you will. i'd given some prior guidance when we had the guardicore call about operating in the 29% to 30% range for next year, and then hopefully getting back or we will get back to over 30% in '23. obviously, we'll update you. i had mentioned earlier to sterling that guardicore's contribution will probably be a bit better than what we said earlier on.
i don't have a number to call out yet, so that will obviously help out the operating margins a touch there. and then you asked about u.s. and international and the disparity between the two. i'd sort of flip it around and say that it's not so much the u.s.
being weak, but really just strong international growth. i mean, u.s. is kind of low single digit. i mentioned on the previous question, that's where we're having the most trouble with our u.s.
commerce vertical, which is a pretty significant vertical in the u.s. and then we also have a lot of large media customers that are in the u.s., and that's where you tend to see more of the splitting of traffic and pricing pressure. so those things combined sort of put a little bit of pressure in terms of the growth rate in the u.s., but really, the strength outside the u.s. is something that i think is a significant advantage for us.
we made a lot of investments both in the network and the sales teams, etc., and we've been able to drive pretty significant growth. very happy with what i'm seeing in terms of participation as far as strong growth in countries like korea, spain, brazil, mexico, hong kong, singapore, taiwan, i mean, across the board, we're seeing very strong growth. latin america, in particular, has been very strong. we made an acquisition there a couple of years ago, starting to get some good scale out of that.
so a little bit of a mixed picture in the u.s. with some challenges in commerce. but really, i look at it as just very strong international presence and growth.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. i mean should the takeaway be that like if we just looked at the security side of the equation, the growth in u.s. and international will be more even on the security side of the equation than it would on the edge tech side?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes, i think that's a good way to look at it, keith. i mean if i look at the web performance, especially in commerce, that's where the primary challenge is right now. but if i look at security, obviously, the u.s. was the first to adopt.
we're still seeing very, very strong growth. as a matter of fact, now 67% of our customers are buying one security product, 34% are buying two. to sort of put that into perspective in a year, we've gone up six points in terms of security adoption of the customer base. that's adding over 600 customers.
so we're seeing good broad-based strength in security, both here in the u.s. and also internationally. but i think you're thinking about it in the right way in terms of having strong security growth in both regions.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. excellent. that's very helpful. thank you guys.

your next question comes from the line of james breen from william blair. your line is now open.
jim breen -- william blair and company -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. just on the cash flow side, it seemed like a particularly strong quarter given some of the improvements you've had, the network and just expense control in general, how should we think about that cash flow going forward? is this a particularly strong quarter and it could tend to drift down over time? or is it going to be lumpy? or are we at a sort of a new run rate in terms of cash generation?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes. great question, jim. q1 tends to be the lower quarter from a cash flow perspective just because of working capital is when you say your bonus is off. but i think if you peg your capex to that sort of 15% range, you're looking at pretty significant improvement.
so i think if you use that as your guide, kind of working off the operating margins we gave you and think about q1 as probably being a low point as you're modeling out your free cash flow. but yes, very, very strong free cash flow generation this quarter for sure.
jim breen -- william blair and company -- analyst
great. thanks. and then just one other one. as you look at the revenue growth, excluding the platform customers, the platform customers were down about $3 million sequentially.
is there a range now where you feel like in the sort of low 60s range is where that revenue is going to hover for those companies given the amount of growth you've seen in the last kind of 12 to 18 months from that?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes. i think that's probably not a bad place to peg it, jim. i mean the q4 always tends to be a bit of a stronger quarter and that vertical is a little bit of seasonality there. you always have renewals.
so whenever you have a renewal, you'll see pull back a couple of million dollars depending on the timing and that sort of stuff. but i think in the 60s, low 60s is probably a decent place to peg it.
jim breen -- william blair and company -- analyst
terrific. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of frank louthan from raymond james. your line is open.
frank louthan -- raymond james -- analyst
yes. just wanted to talk a little bit about the buybacks. you said you'd opportunistically use that to take advantage of the market valuation what level seem appropriate here. that's kind of the first question.
then i've got a follow-up.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
so primarily, we've used the equity buyback to offset the equity dilution from employee grants. and from time to time, we do buy back additional shares, and we've seen that over the years. and we use an approach such that as the stock price declines, we will buy back more. and i do feel that in this market, akamai has a very strong presence both in cdn and security.
our security business growing at 25% on a very big number. and i do feel that akamai is worth a lot more in this market. and so you may see us buy back additional shares, especially depending on how the stock price fluctuates.
frank louthan -- raymond james -- analyst
all right. great. and then you've done a good job adding together some m&a for the secure on the security side. any other tools you think you need to make yourself more competitive in the market? do you feel like you've got kind of the right mix here for that product set?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yes. we're always looking at new capabilities, as i mentioned. of course, the attackers are always in abating with new forms of attack. but i am very excited about the guardicore acquisition.
and i think it really does fill out and complete our access story, our ability to stop ransomware and malware. as i mentioned, we already have capabilities that prevent the malware from getting in. enterprise application access in particular, governs what employees can touch and access. and even then it has to come through akamai's application firewall.
so we're making sure that malware doesn't come in. we also have multifactor authentication, which make sure that the employee is who they say they are. and now with guardicore, we stop the spread of the malware, if it does get in. and there are a lot of ways into the enterprise today.
it is really despite all the defenses you try to put in place, somebody, for example, in the capital pipeline case, a password or potential gets out there. now we still have ways of catching that somebody is using a stolen credential. but malware does get in still. and so the real key there is stopping the spread, and that's what guardicore does.
and so now i think it's really nice because you stopped the ransomware with guardicore, but we've got the whole package and whole solution now. and i think that's really unique in the marketplace and very exciting.
frank louthan -- raymond james -- analyst
all right. great. thank you very much.
operator
your next question comes to the line of amit daryanani from evercore. your line is now open.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
yes. thanks a lot and good evening everyone. i have two questions as well. the first one, i was hoping to talk about.
as i look at the midpoint of your guide for december, is there a way to think about how are you thinking about seasonality in edge and security. and the bottom really trying to get to is the security numbers may imply a much more severe deceleration on what people are modeling. so i just love to understand how you're assuming those two segments stacking up in the december quarter.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes, sure. so i'll take that. so we'll start with the edge. obviously, edge is quite a busy quarter in q4.
as i talked about, you have seasonality from e-commerce. i think it's obviously a tougher quarter to call here with some supply chain disruptions and things like that. does that drive more or less internet traffic and what does that holiday season look like. typically, a very strong media quarter where you see new devices and games coming online devices, consoles, etc., coming online.
and then you also have a lot of sporting events in q4, back-to-school, you've got lots of game releases. so it can be a pretty robust season for us, obviously challenging to call. i kind of looked at the events calendar, it's pretty full. so we provided we can see some good traffic.
you can see good upside we delivered that in the last couple of years. in terms of security, it's not as seasonal. certainly, there are some bundles we have where there is traffic can impact that a bit. but i think to take our security guidance, we've been pretty conservative in the way that we've approached security, and we've been over delivering every quarter.
i think -- we've had, obviously, guardicore is off to a good start. so i wouldn't imply that as a seasonal downtick or anything like that in our security growth.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. and then if i could follow up, the capex number for september quarter and really for december as well, i mean capex as a percent of sales, i think, will be 14%, 15% for the back half of the year versus 19%, 20% for the last several quarters prior to that. i'm curious, is capex coming down because you feel like there's enough capacity you have out there and you can scale it lower? or is it more that you just can't get your hands on the supply chain and the products you need to drive capex. i'm just trying to understand what's taking capex lower? and then how do i think about this as we go into 2020?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes. so i would say it's good execution. and if anything, with the supply chain, we're not seeing supply chain disruptions in terms of the fact that actually, if you remember a few calls ago, we talked about in the pandemic, we took capex up, and we were pretty cautious in terms of making sure that we had plenty of extra capacity available if we see the pandemic continue and see traffic grow, etc.. so we leaned in.
we built up our inventory a bit. we bought a lot of small equipment. so that we're not concerned right now anyway with the supply chain. so i'd say that's part of what's driving it is we built out ahead of demand.
we're pretty smart in the way we did that. but also, i mentioned there's a number of capex efficiencies that adam and his team are working on, not only just software but network design, deployment optimization, looking at different hardware improvements and just any way to drive a big focus on lowering our need for capex. and also keep in mind, we have great relationships with the networks and isps. so in terms of doing optimizations inside of their networks, we're able to do that as well.
so i'd say it's really a great execution on the team's part and capex has come down pretty significantly. you see that in our free cash flow results.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
i'm sorry, does that sustain next year, like this mid-teens capex as a personnel sales? is that the right year to model this out?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes. so i mean, right now, if i must, you see another pandemic or some major events, and we see some crazy unexpected traffic growth. yes, i think it's a sustainable number certainly going into next year. i don't want to get into giving guidance.
but i think that i've talked about in the past that we'd be getting back to this level, and we're actually operating a little bit better than that.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
perfect. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of rishi jaluria from rbc. your line is open.
rishi jaluria -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hey guys. thanks so much for taking my questions. and nice to see security growth hold up and actually accelerate this quarter. two questions.
first, i wanted to go a little bit deeper on the supply chain issues. i appreciate you've obviously overinvested capacity with the ott launches and the pandemic last year. you seem pretty well insulated from the rising cost. but at what point that this continues dragging out? does it begin to become a worry and you might have to overspend in order to keep capacity and not have to turn away business? and maybe related to that, as we think about the environment heading into q4, how do we expect that to shake out, especially given q4 is such a traditionally such a strong commerce season? a lot of companies are telling us, they're not going to be able to meet demand, especially when it comes to electronic goods.
so is that a worry that you have? and maybe how are you thinking about embedding that in your guidance?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
thank you. yes. so i'll take the second part first. that's why we gave a pretty wide range.
i just mentioned on the last question that it's hard to predict what the commerce season looks like. and obviously, when you're in the business of delivering internet traffic, one model could suggest that while shells are not stock, people are doing more surfing to find things. another model would suggest that there's not as much shopping and people are giving cash and gift cards. so hard to tell, but we did put out a pretty big range there.
also keep in mind that a lot of our commerce customers, about half of our commerce customers have taken, we call our zero overage. so you've kind of flattened out that bursting. so the burst thing for commerce is not as big of an impact, q4 still has an impact. in terms of the device cycle, that's an interesting one.
we do expect and we've seen over the last several years, especially in the last couple of weeks of the year as new devices come online, there's a lot of firmware updates and things like that. i still expect to see that. but there's other things that are not as dependent on that, for example, gaming releases, new video content that comes out if you don't have a new machine, you're watching it on your old machines. so i still think that we'll have a pretty big immediate quarter for sure.
but that's why i've given a pretty wide range to try to take those things into consideration. and then on your supply chain question, you had asked about when does this become a problem. it's funny, i asked the same questions to my team as we go through our capex build-out. we've done a nice job of building out several quarters' worth of inventory here.
and we've diversified our supply chain, and the team has done a good job of ensuring that we're not seeing any significant increase in pricing or anything like that. a little bit on the freight side, but it's not really material, and i think that should start to work itself out. but if we do see another massive growth in traffic, maybe we start to run into some problems. but so far, so good.
and like i said, the team did a really good job preparing not expecting this type of a disruption in the supply chain, but expecting that the result from the pandemic would last a lot longer. so we did some scenario planning. so we're in pretty good shape at the moment.
rishi jaluria -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
all right. that's really helpful. thank you so much.
operator
your next question comes from the line of alex henderson from needham. your line is now open.
alex henderson -- needham and company -- analyst
thanks. looking at the guidance and the commentary, it does sound like you're security business is expected to decelerate to below 20% growth in the fourth quarter. certainly, if i add in some of the inorganic that would imply even lower growth, is it reasonable to think that the security business can sustain a 20% growth rate organically in '22? or is that too aggressive of an expectation for $1.3 billion business?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes. so i think one thing to keep in mind, alex, is you've got the anniversary of asia, your growth rate lapse in q4 for [inaudible] and then we also got in guardicore. when we did our analyst day that we expected to be able to grow 20% cagr three to five years with acquisitions being part of the strategy, and you can see that the guardicore acquisition with the prior guide is only a couple of points of growth. we obviously did much better this year than we expected going into the year.
security has overperformed every single quarter. we still feel pretty comfortable with our 20% growth rate, as we talked about, as a matter of fact, coming out of this year, we're doing a bit better than that. so i think if you're taking the super low end of the range, maybe you could come up with that formula, but we're expecting pretty solid growth here with security in q4.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yes. let me just add, our strategy in security is to combine organic development with intelligent and timely acquisitions, and we'll continue to do that. and of course, when you buy a company after a year, its growth becomes organic. and it's no longer counted as an acquisition growth per se.
and i think we've had a really great track record of doing that in security. going back all the way to the prolexic acquisition in 2014. and as i mentioned, i think guardicore fundamentally like that in terms of really transforming our enterprise security business just like prolexic transformed our ddos business, which, of course, today is very, very successful. we're the market leader by far.
and our goal is to do that on the enterprise security side for things like stopping ransomware and stopping malware. and as ed said, as we continue to want to grow our security business over the longer term at 20-plus percent, that will include acquisitions. and i think acquisitions are a good thing. it gives you a jump start on technology in an important area.
guardicore has been working for a long time to develop their micro segmentation approach. i believe it is a market being in what they do, they're the best folks out there. and now we have the benefit of all of the users of effort that they put into that at a perfect time because a lot of companies are rightly worried about stopping ransomware, and now akamai is in a position to help them do that. and of course, it fits with a lot of our organic development on technology around ea is an ideal combination.
so we'll continue to do both and working hard to continue our security growth at 20-plus percent.
alex henderson -- needham and company -- analyst
ok. i got it. that's helpful. can you talk a little bit about the pricing environment, where there's been any change in competitive landscape? have you seen more competition or less competition? how should we think about the environment? i think we're also seeing enterprises spending more this year, do you think that, that sustains into '22, given the first half of spike in attacks caused a flurry of spending intentions.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
i think the competitive environment is very similar to what it's been in the past. it is a very competitive environment across the board from cloud giants who are also our largest customers all the way down to start-ups. obviously, cdn is a mature environment competitively. and so i don't see there's any fundamental change there.
security is really a great impairment for us. we're the market leader by far in the core areas of defending and protecting websites, applications and apis, the leader by far in ddos prevention, those are areas that have a lot of attacks taking place. and now sort of the new category for us, where we will encounter new competition because we're moving into that space in a big way would be enterprise security. we already have a very strong access solution there.
and now we have what we believe is the best solution to stop ransomware or with micro segmentation. and by adding that to akamai, we now have a new set of competitors there because we're entering their space, and we think there's a lot of potential gain for akamai there, it's really to help major enterprises.
alex henderson -- needham and company -- analyst
great. thank you very much.

your last question comes from the line of brandon nispel from keybanc capital markets. your line is open.
brandon nispel -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
awesome. could you unpack the growth in the edge technology group, please? what was the growth in the quarter for edge applications? and what does that imply for the growth in the edge delivery business? and then how do you expect these two segments within that larger group to try and exiting the year? thanks.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes. so brandon, we're not going to break out edge apps every quarter. i mean we talked about it last time growing at over 30%, and we think that business can continue to sustain that. i think we'll exit the year on a run rate over $200 million, which is a pretty good healthy growth rate there.
and then again, we're not breaking out the edge delivery business this quarter. we'll do it at the end of the year.
brandon nispel -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
if i could just follow up on that, when you back out some of the onetime items that are affecting comparability in the edge technology business, specifically, i think the india app and you're still lapping. is that business growing? and what's going to cause that business to return to growth next year?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes. so it's obviously just a tougher compare. this is the first quarter that we don't have that compare and you saw that we were roughly flat in terms of total edge tech. i think as we get into next year, it's an easier compare.
i think we're comfortable with our longer-term growth, and the low single digits for the edge business over time. obviously, with the edge applications business much faster growing as that becomes more material that could change the growth rate. but i think it's just continued execution and traffic growth going into next year on a much easier compare, i think you'll start to see a bit of growth rate pick up a little bit there.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
ok. thank you, everyone. in closing, we will be presenting at a number of investor conferences and road shows throughout the rest of the fourth quarter, and details of these can be found in the investor relations section of akamai.com. we appreciate you joining us and all of us here at akamai wish continued good health to you and yours, and have a great evening.

2021-Q4,AKAM,2022-02-15 16:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the fourth quarter 2021 akamai technologies earnings and acquisition of linode conference call. [operator instructions] i'd now like to hand the conference over to tom barth, head of investor relations. please go ahead.
tom barth -- head of investor relations
thank you, operator. good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining akamai's fourth quarter 2021 and acquisition of linode conference call. before we get started with the linode acquisition that we just announced, today's earnings call format will be a bit different than normal. we will be presenting slides and associated content, and the link to the webcast can be found in the events section of our investor relations website.
we plan to post the full slide deck following the call, and i am now on slide 2. as you can see from our agenda, speaking today will be tom leighton, akamai's chief executive officer; adam karon, akamai's chief operating officer and general manager of the edge technology group; and ed mcgowan, akamai's chief financial officer. moving to slide 3. please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance.
while i don't intend to read this slide, these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. these factors include uncertainty stemming from the covid-19 pandemic, the integration of any acquisitions and any impact from unexpected geopolitical developments. additional information concerning these factors is contained in akamai's filings with the sec, including our annual report on form 10-k and quarterly reports on form 10-q. the forward-looking statements included in this call represent company's view on february 15, 2022.
akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances. as a reminder, we will be referring to some non-gaap financial metrics during today's call. a detailed reconciliation of gaap and non-gaap metrics can be found under the financial portion of the investor relations section at akamai.com. and with that, let me turn the call over to tom, and he'll start on slide 4. 
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
thanks, tom, and thank you all for joining us today. today is a very exciting day for akamai. this afternoon, we announced that we've signed a definitive agreement to acquire linode. we see this as a tremendous opportunity for akamai, and we believe that it will be transformational as we expand our business into adjacent markets, become even more strategic for our customers and accelerate our growth and evolution as a company.
we'll talk more about linode in a few minutes. but first, i'd like to review some of the highlights from a very strong q4 and 2021. turning to slide 5. q4 revenue was $905 million, up 7% year over year.
our revenue growth was driven by the continued strong demand for our security products as well as our fast-growing edge applications business. non-gaap operating margin in q4 was 31%, up 1 point over q4 in 2020. q4 non-gaap eps was $1.49 per diluted share, up 12% year over year. for the full year, revenue was $3.46 billion, up 8% over 2020.
we expanded non-gaap operating margin to 32% last year, and we achieved this result while investing for future growth. non-gaap eps last year was $5.74, up 10% over 2020. 2021 was also a very strong year for cash generation at akamai. we generated $859 million in free cash flow last year, an increase of 78% over 2020.
i think it's important to note that our excellent cash generation has allowed us to make strategic acquisitions like guardicore in q4 and now linode to fuel our future growth, while also returning capital to shareholders. in q4, we spent $271 million to buy back just over 2.4 million shares of stock. over the course of the full year, we spent $522 million to buy back approximately 4.7 million shares. our primary use of cash is for m&a and offsetting the dilution from our equity compensation programs.
over the past 10 years, akamai has also engaged in opportunistic buybacks that have resulted in a reduction of our fully diluted share count by about 12%. last quarter, security products continued their rapid growth, generating revenue of $365 million, up 23% year over year. for the full year, security revenue reached $1.33 billion and grew 26% over 2020. security represented 39% of our revenue last year, up from 33% in 2020.
in recent years, akamai has built one of the world's leading cloud security businesses. our security solutions are highly differentiated and recognized as best-in-class by our customers, who rely on akamai to protect their most important digital assets from very determined and highly capable attackers. results in q4 were especially strong for our bot manager solution, which helps to defend against a wide range of automated attacks. our new account protector solution, which provides account takeover protection, also performed very well in q4 in only its second quarter of availability.
our web app firewall offerings also posted excellent results in q4. and akamai was recognized as a leader in gartner's 2021 magic quadrant for web application and api protection, scoring the highest of 11 vendors in ability to execute. in october, we acquired guardicore to extend our zero trust solutions to help stop the spread of ransomware. as a part of akamai, guardicore has continued its strong growth momentum and closed major deals last quarter at one of the largest freight railways in the u.s.
and at one of the largest telecommunication companies in south america. we're very excited about the value that guardicore's micro-segmentation capabilities bring to our customers. and as ed will talk about shortly, we now believe that guardicore will drive significantly more revenue this year than we'd initially forecast when we announced the transaction last fall. our cdn business generated revenue of $541 million in q4, down 2% from q4 in 2020.
traffic on our platform continued to be strong in q4, peaking at over 200 terabits per second. our edge application solutions had a great q4, exiting the year with an annualized revenue run rate of more than $200 million and growing 30% for the full year. our akamai edgeworkers solution was adopted by a top sporting equipment company, a global business travel service and one of the largest banks in the u.s. overall, we're very pleased with our performance last year on both the top and bottom lines.
we achieved our goals in 2021 and then some. and i want to thank our employees for delivering such strong results as they continued to cope with the challenges of the pandemic. i'll now move on to slide 6. as many of you know, akamai's mission is to power and protect life online.
and our purpose in doing that is to make life better for billions of people, billions of times a day. akamai has been doing this for more than 20 years, enabled in part by a series of market-defining innovations, starting with the invention of content delivery networks in the late 1990s. as you can see on the next slide, no. 7, we follow this breakthrough in internet technology with fundamental advances in video streaming, application acceleration and web security.
in each of these areas, akamai was a major pioneer in enabling new capabilities. and in each of these areas, we're still the market leader today by far. throughout the past 20 years, we've also been a pioneer and a leader in edge computing, beginning with the invention of edge side includes in the early 2000s, a technology that's still used by thousands of our customers today. and now turning to slide 8.
we're taking the next major step in our evolution by creating the world's most distributed compute platform from cloud to edge, making it easier for developers and businesses to build, run and secure their applications online. as you can see in this afternoon's press release, we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire linode, the privately held company that makes cloud computing simple, affordable and accessible. linode is known for its developer-friendly services, the quality of their support and as a trusted infrastructure-as-a-service platform provider. by combining linode's developer-centric cloud advantages with akamai's deep enterprise strengths, we believe that we can provide tremendous value to developers and enterprises as they build cloud applications on akamai.
we see plenty of opportunity for a differentiated offering among customers who desire ease of use, wider reach beyond just a few pops, lower latency, stronger security and greater resiliency, all from a single platform and all at an affordable price point. akamai's highly distributed edge platform has the global reach to enable any cloud application to deliver the best end-user experience anywhere that users or services consume apps, from the cloud to the edge, where more compute services will live as 5g and iot take hold and expand. the akamai platform is uniquely suited for workloads that require high throughput, low latency and instant scalability on demand. akamai has been perfecting this capability for many years, and it's very hard to do.
akamai also has the capabilities needed to integrate seamlessly with both diy cloud apps and third-party cloud vendors as part of the larger cloud ecosystem. we believe that this flexibility will appeal to enterprises that want a multi-vendor cloud strategy to mitigate their vendor concentration risk and to ensure resiliency and seamless availability in case one vendor service experiences an outage. and with akamai's category-leading security solutions, customers will be able to secure their apps from their point of origin to the edge, all under akamai's protective umbrella. security delivered at the edge offers unique advantages since it enables customers to manage security policies across all their apps and infrastructure wherever they're located.
we believe that such an end-to-end security approach will appeal to customers who want increased efficiency and greater resiliency along with lower security risk. the net of all this is that we believe that akamai and linode can solve customers' needs in ways that are not addressed in the market today, forming a powerful winning combination that will enable customers to build, deliver and secure their apps on the platform that powers and protects life online. moving to slide 9. we see the acquisition of linode as a transformational opportunity for akamai.
this slide shows the way that we presented our business at our investor day last year. with linode, akamai will expand beyond security and delivery into the world's most distributed cloud services provider with leading solutions for security, delivery and compute, as shown here on slide 10. we'll offer customers a breadth and depth of services uncommon in the cloud space today, a massive content delivery platform, the best application performance, easy-to-use cloud and edge compute and category-leading security solutions, all backed by expert services and support professionals to help power and protect life online. given that we're announcing this acquisition at the same time as our earnings, i thought it would be helpful to have adam karon join us on the call today to talk more about linode.
adam is our coo, and he's responsible for running our compute and delivery businesses. later this year, we'll also plan to hold an investor day, when you'll be able to hear from mani sundaram, who leads our security business, as well as from other akamai executives. after adam speaks, ed will cover the financial aspects of the acquisition and provide our outlook for 2022. adam?
adam karon -- chief operating officer and general manager of the edge technology group
thanks, tom. i'll start on slide 12. tom just spoke about the three core product pillars we have at akamai: security, delivery and compute. i'm going to focus a bit deeper into the compute portfolio and what we think it will look like after the integration of linode.
turning to slide 13. i'll start with the existing linode product portfolio, which is split into four product groupings. the first being compute, which has offerings like dedicated and shared cpus, bare metal, gpus and kubernetes. the next being storage, which provides services like block storage, object storage and a managed database service in beta.
next, cloud orchestration and finally, an award-winning set of developer tools that make it really easy for developers to use their platform. their products are sold in traditional cloud models using online trials and online purchases. turning to slide 14. after the acquisition closes, the akamai compute product portfolio we envision would consist of five product groupings.
the first being compute inherited from linode, containing shared and dedicated cpus, gpus, kubernetes. storage, which would contain the block and object storage that came from linode but would also now include akamai's net storage. we'd have cloud optimization that would include akamai's global traffic manager, cloud wrapper and direct connect solutions. next, the developer tools we get from linode as well as the existing akamai developer tools now make the akamai compute platform easy and accessible to developers all over the world; and last, but certainly not least, our edge applications, which contain our edgeworkers and edgekv products that execute compute right at our edge.
it will also include our cloudlet's image and video manager and, of course, our api acceleration product. one of the exciting synergies would be in go to market. akamai's compute products would not only be sold online, but because our current globally located enterprise sales force works closely with the buyers for cloud compute, they have the right relationships, and we would not need to create an overlay sales force. another exciting go-to-market synergy would be our existing robust and global channel ecosystem that could also take these cloud compute offerings to market.
and in both cases, new wallet share within the customer base could be open for future growth. turning to slide 15. now let's talk about how we think about compute. now computing at the edge or near end users and devices brings unique benefits for critical use cases that are in many locations and where data is in motion or ephemeral, whereas computing in the cloud brings other benefits that are usually for applications running in a smaller number of locations and where data is stored and persistent.
our combined platform would have both edge and cloud computing. and since modern applications are built as a collection of services, each with differing compute needs and data needs, only by combining the edge and cloud can we fulfill the varied needs of our customer base like data localization and low-latency containerized compute as well as more typical compute needs that are persistent and in fewer locations. the unique capabilities can come together when we are able to combine akamai's edge platform with linode's cloud computing capabilities and then add in our global traffic manager product to route across multiple clouds and cloud locations our global large private network that efficiently connects cloud and edge locations and messaging, bringing it all together, coordinating cloud and edge services. you end up with the world's most distributed compute platform from cloud to edge making it easier for developers and businesses to build, run and secure applications.
now on slide 16. while linode and akamai can solve a number of customer use cases separately, i thought it would be useful to cover just a few examples of the use cases we believe we can help fulfill for our customers with this unique combination of products. in the sports vertical, you could imagine a sports league could leverage the new akamai platform to deploy webrtc services to enable a watch along app that allows a group of friends to watch a game in sync while communicating with each other in real time. and they would be able to do that using our distributed bms, load balancing and high-throughput egress.
when you think of iot and fleet management, you could see a shipping company building a distributed app to collect in parts video and telemetry data from trucks in route before backhauling the data to their data warehouse. and they'd be able to do that using our support of mqtt, our distributed vms and direct connect capabilities. an e-commerce site can leverage akamai to dynamically personalize their site based on the user's previous and current browsing activity without having to go back to their data lake, all using our managed database services, kubernetes and functions-as-a-service. in the metaverse, we can help create a persistent virtual experience when a game studio needs to connect users from across the globe in a fully immersive vr experience from any console, mobile device or browser, all using our distributed gpus, low-latency and private backbone.
and in healthcare, a hospital could leverage akamai to create a platform that captures and archives and videos of surgical procedures to help train doctors on new and emerging techniques using bare metal and our object store. now, turning to slide 17. the combination of akamai and linode can be a truly unique offering in the market. we plan to combine ease of use and developer-friendliness linode is known for with the wider reach, lower latency, strong security and greater resiliency that are akamai's hallmarks.
we expect our new combined offering to appeal to developers by offering core cloud compute functionality, ease of use and tools they need appeal to enterprises with security, uptime and reliability and drive future use cases as new applications can take advantage of the throughput performance and distribution of a market-leading global network. turning to slide 18. so with akamai and linode, we can have highly secure, elastic compute along with storage capabilities on the world's largest edge network, category-leading security, an edge computing platform for latency-sensitive workloads, all on akamai's large global private network with a globally located enterprise sales force and robust channel ecosystem, all setting us up to win in the marketplace. and now, i'll pass it to ed to discuss the transaction details.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
thank you, adam. i will start my remarks with brief highlights of our very strong q4 results, then provide some insight into the financial aspects of the linode acquisition and then close with our q1 and full year 2022 guidance. so moving to slide 20. starting with the q4 highlights.
we are very pleased with our strong q4 results, capping off an excellent year for akamai. q4 revenue was $905 million, up 7% year over year or 8% in constant currency. revenue was led by another quarter of very strong growth in security as well as strength in our edge applications business. security revenue growth in q4 was 23% year over year or 25% in constant currency, with guardicore contributing revenue of approximately $10 million.
we are very pleased with the initial momentum we've seen from guardicore as well as the continued growth of the pipeline. it is also worth noting that our edge applications business surpassed a $200 million annual revenue run rate in q4 and grew 30% for the full year in 2021. international revenue growth was another bright spot with revenue increasing 13% year over year or 16% in constant currency. sales in our international markets represented 47% of total revenue in q4, up 2 points from q4 2020.
these strong results were despite foreign exchange fluctuations, which had a negative impact on revenue of $7 million on a sequential basis and negative $10 million on a year-over-year basis. non-gaap net income was $243 million or $1.49 of earnings per diluted share, up 12% year over year, up 14% in constant currency and $0.05 above the high end of our guidance range. finally, as tom mentioned, we had an exceptional year from a cash flow perspective. moving to capital deployment.
during the fourth quarter, we spent approximately $271 million to buy back approximately 2.4 million shares. our intention is to continue to buy back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time and to be opportunistic, both m&a and share repurchases. turning now to linode on slide 21. as you heard from tom and adam, we believe the combination of akamai and linode will create the world's most distributed platform for developers and businesses to build, run and secure their applications.
under the terms of the agreement, akamai has agreed to acquire linode in exchange for approximately $900 million of cash. the transaction will be treated as an asset purchase for tax purposes. and as a result, we anticipate significant cash income tax savings over the next 15 years. while this benefit will not impact our non-gaap effective tax rate, we estimate the present value of these savings to be approximately $120 million.
turning to slide 22. we believe that linode currently has a very attractive financial profile and that there are considerable revenue and cost synergy opportunities in the future. assuming a late q1 close, in 2022, we expect the acquisition to add revenue of approximately $100 million, have no material impact to our non-gaap operating margin and be accretive to non-gaap eps by $0.05 to $0.06 per share. looking beyond this year, we expect linode to be additive to our non-gaap operating margin as we continue to capitalize on revenue and cost synergies, including leveraging our go-to-market channel and marketing organizations to accelerate revenue from enterprise customers, realizing significant cost savings by utilizing our very large global private network that adam previously talked about as well as leveraging our significant scale and supply chain along with our network deployment expertise.
from a capex perspective, we expect linode to add approximately 2 points to capex as a percentage of revenue in 2022 as we plan to expand linode's capacity and locations to meet anticipated customer demand. however, over the long term, we do not expect the acquisition to meaningfully change our previously communicated goal of capex being in the mid-teens as a percentage of revenue. turning to slide 23. as tom and adam previously mentioned, upon closing the acquisition, we plan to update our revenue reporting to reflect three separate business groups: security, delivery and compute.
the first revenue grouping, security, will remain unchanged from the existing reporting of our security technologies group. the second revenue group will be delivery. delivery will be comprised of edge delivery and services portion of our existing etg organization, but will exclude our net storage and edge application businesses that were previously included as part of etg revenue. for context, our edge applications business, which had revenue of approximately $196 million in 2021 and our net storage business, which had revenue of approximately $57 million in 2021, will move to our new compute business.
the third and final revenue group will be called compute. compute will include linode, plus our edge applications and net storage businesses i just mentioned. we believe that with strong execution, we can deliver more than $500 million of annual compute revenue in 2023. turning to slide 24.
before i provide our q1 and 2022 guidance, i wanted to highlight a couple of factors to consider for your models. first, the q1 and full year 2022 guidance i am about to provide does not reflect the revenue and non-gaap eps contribution we anticipate from linode that i previously mentioned since the acquisition has not yet closed. we plan to update our full year guidance to include linode on the first earnings conference call after the deal has closed. second, international revenue now represents nearly half of our total revenue.
and the dollar has continued to strengthen since we reported in early november. therefore, we currently expect a meaningful foreign exchange headwind in 2022. at current spot rates, our guidance assumes that foreign exchange will have a negative $45 million impact on revenue on a year-over-year basis. finally, similar to 2019, we have eight of our top 10 customers renewing in the first half of the year.
as a reminder, we define our top customers as anyone contributing revenue of 1% or more. and that customer, that group of customers contributed approximately 19% of total revenue in 2021. although we expect to see a negative impact to revenue growth in the near term, we expect to see incremental revenue over time as these customers' traffic grows with us. i'd also note that while the cluster timing of these renewals is unusual, the pricing, contract terms are consistent with the broader trends in the market, and these renewals have been factored into our guidance.
so with all that in mind, turning to our q1 guidance on slide 25. we are projecting revenue in the range of $896 million to $910 million or up 6% to 8% as reported or 8% to 10% in constant currency over q1 2021. foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $2 million impact on q1 revenue compared to q4 levels and a negative $17 million impact year over year. at these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 76%.
q1 non-gaap operating expenses are projected to be $292 million to $296 million. we anticipate q1 ebitda margins of approximately 43%. we expect non-gaap depreciation expense to be between $123 million to $124 million, and we expect non-gaap operating margin of approximately 30% for q1. moving on to capex.
we expect to spend approximately $120 million to $124 million, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest in the first quarter. this represents approximately 13% to 14% of anticipated total revenue, which is down approximately 4 points from q1 2021 levels. and with the overall revenue and spend configuration i just outlined, we expect q1 non-gaap eps in the range of $1.39 to $1.43. this eps guidance assumes taxes of $38 million to $39 million based on an estimated quarterly non-gaap tax rate of approximately 14.5%.
it also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 162 million shares. moving to slide 26. looking ahead to the full year, we expect revenue of $3.673 billion to $3.728 billion, which is up 6% to 8% year over year as reported or 7% to 9% in constant currency. we expect security revenue growth to be at least 20% for the full year 2022.
this includes an expected guardicore contribution of approximately $50 million to $55 million. we are estimating non-gaap operating margin of approximately 29% to 30% and non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $5.82 to $5.97. and this non-gaap earnings guidance is based on a non-gaap effective tax rate of approximately 14.5% and a fully diluted share count of 162 million shares. finally, full year capex is anticipated to be approximately 13% to 14% of revenue.
in closing, we are very pleased with our 2021 performance and are excited to close on linode and help customers build, run and secure their applications. now i'd like to turn the call back over to tom to say a few words before we take your questions. tom?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
thanks, ed. i'll wrap up now on slide 28. as i mentioned earlier, akamai has had a rich and exciting history of innovation that has fundamentally enabled the internet to provide enormous benefit to billions of people around the world. we are truly making life better for billions of people, billions of times a day.
as incredible as akamai's contributions to the internet have been, i want you to know that i couldn't be more excited about akamai's potential for the future as we expand our business with linode and guardicore, provide even greater value for our customers and shareholders and make life even better for internet users everywhere. ed, adam and i will now be happy to take your questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from sterling auty with j.p. morgan.
sterling auty -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. thanks. hi, guys. i wondered if you could give us some context in terms of what kind of growth was linode experiencing before the acquisition? and then when you talked about kind of 2023 and beyond, i want to make sure i understand that new compute area, the $500 million, what kind of growth rate do you expect out of that segment? thank you. 
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
sterling, this is ed. thanks for the question. so before the acquisition, they were growing at about 15%, give or take. the bigger customers were growing faster.
and they were sort of containing their growth a bit. it was a very closely held company. so they were holding back a bit on their investment in go-to-market and their build-out. so obviously, that's one of the major synergies we bring.
so we think we can accelerate that business pretty considerably. now, when i talked about the different components of the business, if you take the net storage business plus the edge applications business plus where linode is, assume i talked about how we grew the edge applications business 30%. and if you remember back on investor day, that was our long-term target. our net storage business, as it is today, is kind of a flattish business, kind of grows like the cdn.
we expect that to obviously accelerate as we add new capabilities. and then the linode business should accelerate quite a bit. so if you were to put those pieces together, and i talked about in '23 that i expected that we would be above $500 million in revenue, that sort of gets you to that 30% to 35% kind of growth rate in that business once you get through the acquisition.
sterling auty -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
right. and then -- but given those pieces, would you expect that growth to be durable at that level or kind of settle back into more of a 15% to 20%, just so we understand the longer-term context? and that's all for me. thank you.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes, that's a great question, and i'll ask adam to chime in a little bit here as well. obviously, we're getting into a very, very big market. and what pushed us into this market was our customers. we were getting more and more requests for folks to continue to come with different use cases ourselves.
we're spending quite a bit on third-party cloud today, whether it's through acquisitions or through it projects. just the overall growth of this market is so significant that we think there's certainly the market there to do that. i'll let adam talk a little bit about some of his plans in terms of future integration and the growth prospects going forward. but it's quite possible that, that could be a durable growth rate going forward for that business.
adam karon -- chief operating officer and general manager of the edge technology group
yup. i agree, ed. i think we see that market growing very rapidly outside of what akamai had before, and we see that with our customers and demand of our edge applications and asking us for this type of cloud computing as well. so we do expect it to be durable as that market continues to grow quite rapidly.
sterling auty -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from keith weiss with morgan stanley.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
excellent. thank you guys for taking the question. maybe two questions. one on the linode acquisition.
i just want to kind of better understand kind of like the buy versus like a partner decision. can you help us understand what's interesting about sort of buying this asset, what you could do owning sort of linode versus partnering with linode or other type of cloud computing platforms out there, number one? and then number two, for ed, just in looking at fy '22 and the margins coming down. ed, nice margin performance in q4 and all throughout 2021. can you talk to us a little bit about what's going to be pressuring margins into 2022?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yeah. by owning linode, we can really scale up that business. we have a lot of expertise in network deployment and doing that in a cost-effective way to get enormous scale. also, we've got a large enterprise sales force and a customer base that is hungry for us to bring them this kind of capability.
we know how to make large-scale systems be reliable and perform well. and we can bring it all together as part of an end-to-end solution so that our customers can take their major applications, build them easily on akamai, and that's where linode comes in, run them. of course, we have the world's largest and best content delivery platform to deliver it, and then wrap it all together under our security umbrella to make sure it stays secure. and so that's a compelling reason for us to make the acquisition here and provide the end-to-end service versus just partnering with the various cloud providers.
ed, do you want to take the margin question?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes. sure, keith. and just to add on that, if i just look at the financial profile of the business we just acquired, think about getting up to that sort of scale of revenue, the type of investment you need to make, how long it will take you to get there. it's rare that you find companies that have profitability margins like we do.
so to be able to bolt that on, it's immediately accretive, gets us to market much faster, there's a brilliance to the simplicity in terms of how they approach and how simple it is to use their system. that's an expertise that we're acquiring as well. so there's a lot to like about that. now, in terms of the margins.
so there's a couple of things going on there. one of the points that i made in my prepared remarks was about foreign exchange. that's a big headwind for us, and we're very profitable outside the u.s. so that does put a little bit of pressure on margins for us.
but also, we're making investments. and keep in mind, you have the full guardicore business. we only had about two -- a little over two months in the first -- in the fourth quarter. so in the first quarter, we have the full guardicore and the cost in the business.
and you've got in the middle of the year is when we do our merit increase. that said, two things to point out. number one, we're going to be -- as i said we do about 30% in q1. we've done very well managing costs.
and then we also told you when we did the acquisition of guardicore that in '23, we'd expect to get above 30% margins again. so will it be expanding margins? might be slightly under 30% this year, as i said, somewhere between 29% and 30% but we anticipate to get back above that in '23.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
excellent. thanks so much guys.
operator
our next question comes from james breen with william blair.
james breen -- william blair -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. just looking at the edge technology group growth this year has been flattish off of some pretty high numbers from 2020 as a result of the pandemic. as you think about that going forward and with some of the repricing this year, can we just talk about some of the puts and takes relative to repricing some of those contracts as well as some of the sectors that were hit most by the pandemic potentially improving? thanks.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
this is ed. i'll take that one. so yeah, as far as the renewals go, as we've talked in the past, whenever we have a combination of renewals, we'll always call it out for you guys. here's what i would expect with that group of customers.
typical renewal pricing, nothing unusual in terms of anything in the market to call out there. i'd expect that group of customers to decline a bit in q1, decline a bit in q2 because like about half of the renewals already done, then i got about half coming up here in april. and then i would expect that revenue to start to grow again. it's pretty typical of what you see in the cdn business when you have a cluster of renewals.
now those customers have varying contracts. some of them are one year, some of them are two, some of them are three and some of them have revenue commitments that will be used up before the contract is over. so it's very unusual to have this sort of a cluster. so that will put some pressure on growth here for the next couple of quarters, but then i expect that customer group to grow.
they've been very busy buying up our security products, our compute product. so i expect now they're great targets for the new acquisition we just picked up here. so i expect to expand the wallet share within those group of accounts. and this is just something that's pretty typical in the cdn business.
and where we're seeing the pricing pressure is on the delivery side. we're not seeing it in the security side, not seeing it at edge. we're seeing it just in delivery. as far as the pandemic, we are starting to see a little bit of improvement in travel and hospitality.
and as a reminder, that group was about 4% of our total revenue. i think that will sort of ebb and flow with how the pandemic goes. as we start to have these waves of new variants, travel slows down. as it goes away, travel picks up.
retail is still a bit sluggish, not really seeing a significant improvement. and just remember, we had set up a 0 overage, and the biggest acquirers of that type of contract are the retailers, especially in the u.s. so you see a little bit of a muted seasonality here in q4 related to retail. but still some way to go here on retail.
travel is improving a bit. and in general, as we get past these renewals, you'll start to see the delivery business improve a bit.

our next question comes from colby synesael with cowen.
unknown speaker -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. this is michael on for colby. two questions, if i may. first, following this acquisition, you also did guardicore.
how would you describe the appetite for additional m&a? and as part of that, how does this acquisition impact the way that you're thinking about additional buybacks? i thought there was a pretty notable step up in the fourth quarter. and then one other question, if i can squeeze it in. with this acquisition, $100 million of revenue coming in and you talked about 15% growth that seems durable, how does this change the way you're thinking about the long-term revenue growth profile for the company? thank you.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yeah, good questions. obviously, we've done two large deals, the largest deals we've done in about 20 years over the last several months. i wouldn't expect to see us continue at that rate, certainly. we probably will do more tech tuck-ins and smaller acquisitions.
in terms of the buyback, our primary use of cash is for m&a and to buy back equity to offset the dilution from compensation programs. now as i mentioned, that said, we do also opportunistically buy back additional stock. and if you look over the last 10 years, it's averaged a little more than 1% a year. and so i think our general approach to use of capital is not changing here.
just we saw two exceptional opportunities, first with guardicore and now with linode. guardicore really is a huge boost to our enterprise security business, zero trust capabilities. we believe they have the best solution to stop the impact of ransomware. and that's a huge, huge deal.
and you see that in the improved guidance we've given. and just we closed the deal a few months ago, and we're looking at this year then of doing $30 million to $35 million and now, as you heard from ed, substantially more than that. and i can tell you from talking to many of our customers, many of the world's major banks, they are very interested in what guardicore can do, both the visibility it gives customers into their own networks and the ability to mitigate the impacts of ransomware. now, in terms of the durability of revenue growth from linode, in the past, they were doing 15%.
i think ed and adam talked about, we think we can do a lot more than that. just consider that linode doesn't really have a sales force, never mind a sales force like akamai has going after major enterprises. and you combine that with the fact that our major enterprise customers have wanted us to have this capability for them. so we think we can really accelerate their growth and that it could well be that the 30% is sustainable.
so we're certainly going to try to do that. and if we're successful there, you can see akamai as a whole back in double-digit revenue growth on a more sustainable basis, and that's certainly our goal.
unknown speaker -- cowen and company -- analyst
awesome. thank you for the color. really appreciate it.

our next question comes from james fish with piper sandler.
james fish -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for the question. so curious, grew 22% -- actually, i'm sorry, 25% constant currency. but seem like new business slowed and the normalized security number was slightly down versus last quarter.
so really, why aren't we growing faster in the segment when the market has come directly toward sase, and it's been as healthy of a security market as we've probably seen since 2014? and have we seen a pickup at all in selling security outside of the existing cdn installed base? and just squeezing in another one here, but what was the growth of our annual customer metrics you guys typically give in q4 regarding the individual products and subsegments like an access control?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
i'll start with that and then hand it over to ed. we're very pleased to see our security business grow 25% in constant currency. you talk about sase, and that is a very small portion of our business today. in fact, sase technically wouldn't even include micro-segmentation.
i would imagine that's going to change in the near future because it's so important and it's going to become a requirement, i believe, for many of the world's major enterprises, certainly in the financial vertical. so the sase framework is a small amount of akamai revenue. and with guardicore growing rapidly, the vast majority of our security revenue is in the web security area, where we're protecting, think of it as b2c apps, from denial of service, from content corruption, from account staffed, from data exfiltration, those kinds of attacks, which technically isn't part of the sase framework. and so what you would think of is maybe more toward a sase.
we're getting very good growth on a small number. and of course, the lion's share of our security business is in the web security, api protection, where with market leaders and growing at a very fast clip on a good size number for us. and ed, maybe you want to take the rest of the question.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes. so jim, we don't break this out every quarter, but i'll just go back to the ir day. we set targets for application security, network security and security services. and as a reminder, those goals were for application security, 20% to 25%, 20% to 25% in network security and then security services of 10% to 15%.
i can tell you that we had achieved all of those and exceeded, in many cases, those metrics. are there any other metrics that you were looking for? i think you mentioned something about customers?
james fish -- piper sandler -- analyst
yeah, i mean we used to kind of talk about penetration of number of customers that are on your waf solution at this point. and i thought at the analyst day, we were going to get the annual update on those subsegments. maybe you're saving that for the analyst day.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah. that's what we're going to do. on analyst day, we'll have a deep dive on that. what i'll do is i'll provide -- i provided this metric before in terms of the number of customers that buy a security product, that's up to 68.5%.
so that's up about 6% year over year. two or more is up to 34.5%. that's up about 3%. three or more is up to 20%.
and we increased our customer base by about 6% for the year. our total customer base is up about 6%. security penetration is up about 6% year over year.
james fish -- piper sandler -- analyst
helpful. if i can squeeze in one more. one knock we've heard on some of the smaller developer-focused solutions like a linode is that organizations tend to kind of graduate from these solutions to an aws or azure. what investments are you looking to make to prevent this sort of graduation and make it more enterprise-grade for the akamai installed base? or is it more about taking akamai downmarket and be that developer focus that we've been looking for?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
i'll hand this over to adam in just a minute, but we're interested in the developer base for sure because our large enterprise customers, their apps are built and, in many cases, managed by the developers. so we really care about a developer-friendly solution. but we are going to take this to our large enterprise customers. and adam has a robust road map of added capabilities.
and adam, why don't you talk a little bit about that?
adam karon -- chief operating officer and general manager of the edge technology group
sure, tom. i think tom mentioned earlier, our -- some of our expertise is just building and deploying larger network presence all over the globe. so that would be our first area to go and make those locations that linode has just more robust and available to our customers. but building in things like availability zones, bpc, identity access management and then building in compliance like soc 2 and pci are really on the core parts of our road map so that customers can not only bring their apps onto the platform but graduate and continue to grow and scale globally as they build, run and secure the application right on the akamai platform.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
and i just would add, our customers have been pretty explicit with us that they are very interested in us having this capability and putting it together with the world's best content delivery capabilities, the world's best application performance and the world's best security solutions to provide an end-to-end solution. so i think you will not see this be a situation where they migrate from, say, a linode to a hyperscaler. but our customers are interested in alternatives and end-to-end solutions that -- maybe there are some functions on hyperscalers today that i think would migrate to akamai's new cloud platform. we'll be the world's most distributed cloud platform with now market-leading solutions in not just delivery and security but also compute.
james fish -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks, guys.

our next question comes from rishi jaluria with rbc.
rishi jaluria -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
wonderful. thanks so much for taking my questions. just two. one on linode and maybe an inverse of the last question.
obviously, they have great traction down market, when we think about the ability of akamai to cross-sell into that linode base, you're obviously very, very strong in the larger enterprises with both security as well as the core delivery and edge applications business. can you talk about your ability to actually take some of your more enterprise-grade products and actually sell them successfully down-market once the linode acquisition closes? and then i wanted to drill a little bit more into q4 and what you saw from the e-commerce season. i know you talked a little bit about retail bounce-back being sluggish. but i know when we were on this call three months ago, one of the concerns was just with supply chain concerns and the tough comps, e-commerce was going to be a little bit challenged in q4.
just wanted to get a sense for what did you see specifically on the e-commerce side in q4. thanks.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
i'll take the first question. ed will take the second. yes, we certainly can cross-sell into the linode base. that's not our primary objective here.
the primary objective is to take linode and really scale that up and sell it into the large enterprise base. i think that's far more lucrative for us than taking our existing solutions and selling into the large number of small customers. and the focus will be moving linode's capabilities into our platform and having a comprehensive solution for large enterprise customers. and ed, you want to take the next one?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah, i got it. so rishi, on the commerce, you're right. when we had the q3 call, we did talk about sort of a variety of potential outcomes with commerce. i would say that we pretty much landed where we expected.
we didn't really bake in a ton of upside clearly for two reasons. one was just uncertainty around supply chain, people potentially ordering earlier in the year. but the bigger factor was around the zoff the zero overage. we've been in market now for over two years, and we've got a pretty high penetration so that you don't see as much of a bursting in q4 as you do from the commerce customers.
and as i've said, it's been a mixed bag. some companies are doing pretty well, some aren't doing so great. so again, i'd say it's kind of as expected, but we weren't going in expecting a ton out of our retail vertical this q4.
rishi jaluria -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. thank you so much.

our next question comes from fatima boolani with citi.
fatima boolani -- citi -- analyst
good afternoon. thank you for taking the questions. maybe a jump ball for you all, just with respect to some of the new revenue classifications that we're going to be expecting in the next couple of months here. as i think back to your last analyst day, what was certainly helpful for us is to get a sense of what type of traffic mix you're expecting in the delivery franchise.
so i'm curious with linode in the family or soon to be, how you expect that mix of traffic to change relative to some of your expectations within the long and medium-term guide. and then i had a quick follow-up, if i could.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
well, the traffic measured by bytes delivered is 95-plus-percent big media and software downloads, gaming downloads. that's the vast majority of the traffic. that won't change with linode. in fact, i would expect we'd be selling compute services to those same big media customers.
in fact, several of them have expressed interest in that capability. so linode won't change our traffic mix. and when we get together at ir day, we'll do the deep dive in each of these categories to get a better feel of how the revenue is breaking down.
fatima boolani -- citi -- analyst
that's very helpful. and for ed, i wanted to talk a little bit about the margin upside in the quarter. with the media business having some nice outperformance, we were still able to see a nice leverage fall through the model. so i'm just curious if you can walk us through some of the puts and takes within the cost-control elements of the business in the quarter.
that would be helpful. thank you.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes, sure. good question. so a couple of things to note on that. one is just a mix issue.
so we obviously had a strong security quarter. i did a little bit better on security. so that drives very high incremental margins in the business. the other thing on the cost of goods sold line, the margins came in on the gross margin line a little bit better.
teams' done a phenomenal job on driving down our bandwidth costs. as i look out toward next year, we expect traffic to grow sort of at normal rates. and my bandwidth costs are not really going up very much. so able to drive down bandwidth costs, that would be the big thing.
we're getting good efficiencies, starting to see capex come down quite a bit. we won't see the depreciation fall off. you have to get a peak in, say, the next year and a half or so, then it will start to come off. but just around all the different organizations, which is doing really focused on efficiency.
and we've seen good flow through when we get a little bit of a revenue upside.
fatima boolani -- citi -- analyst
appreciate that detail. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from alex henderson with needham & company.
alex henderson -- needham and company -- analyst
thank you very much. i was hoping we could talk a little bit about the architecture that you're anticipating as we go forward, whether you're planning on integrating the platforms at the edge or whether you're -- as described in the slide deck, whether the linode nodes are, in fact, relatively separate from your edge compute platform. do you anticipate moving to a single software stack within each node or will these be separate nodes in that context?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
i'll start with that and then turn it over to adam. you want to think of akamai's platform as hierarchical. there's a core where functions such as storage would live, where there's dozens of locations for archive storage, migrating out all the way to the edge, where there's 4,000 pops, where most of our capabilities live today. something else that's closer to the core in dozens of locations would be the prolexic service.
but things like delivering video, delivering software, accelerating your bank statement and most all the security other than prolexic all live on the very edge out in 4,000 locations. edgeworkers lives out there too. edgekv lives out there. and linode starts in the core in 11 locations, and we'll be expanding that quite a bit, and it will all be integrated together as part of one hierarchical platform.
and then maybe adam, you could get a little bit deeper into that in terms of the software stack and so forth.
adam karon -- chief operating officer and general manager of the edge technology group
yes. i think you covered most of it, but i think the way you can think about it is that the linode stack itself can be segmented into multiple components. just like tom just described, you might have storage or databases that might exist closer to the core. and as you have more ephemeral-type instantiations of applications, you push those components further out toward our edge, ultimately culminating in our deep edge, where you'd have our chrome v8 engines that can be instantiated on demand right on the edge itself.
so that's our edgeworkers solution. but you can see kind of a linode kind of stack like spanning the entire span and what tom just described as the core all the way out to the edge.
alex henderson -- needham and company -- analyst
if i could follow up. you talked about the coder-centric capabilities of linode. can you talk about the degree to which coders are writing to this platform? and for that matter, to the akamai platform, how many coders do you have writing to your platform at this point?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
adam, why don't you take that one?
adam karon -- chief operating officer and general manager of the edge technology group
yeah. on the linode platform, they have over 150,000 customers today on their platform writing and deploying applications. on our -- was that the question?
alex henderson -- needham and company -- analyst
the degree to which the coders are writing to the platform, yes, as opposed to, necessarily, customers. i assume the customers are -- actually do some writing.
adam karon -- chief operating officer and general manager of the edge technology group
the customers of linode are -- yes, they're primarily developers, which is one of the reasons for the benefit of bringing the developer-centric community that linode brings to the akamai community. and then those developers, as tom described, a lot of them are the decision-makers inside of our enterprise customer base developing and deploying and, in some cases, managing those applications. and thus, that developer community becomes appealing -- appeals through those enterprise customers right back to akamai. so it's kind of a great system that they have.
alex henderson -- needham and company -- analyst
can you give us the akamai-related data point relative to how many coders are writing to your edge compute capabilities?
adam karon -- chief operating officer and general manager of the edge technology group
i don't think i have that stat on hand right now.
alex henderson -- needham and company -- analyst

our next question comes from tim horan with oppenheimer.
tim horan -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
thanks, guys. will it take much investment to consolidate and integrate linode both from a software and hardware perspective? and will you be operating on relatively similar hardware? and i guess same thing for the go-to-market strategy and, i guess, customer care just a little bit about the overall investment. and then i just had a quick follow-up.
adam karon -- chief operating officer and general manager of the edge technology group
sure. so we are looking at the ways we can drive synergy between the hardware that the linode platform runs on today and the akamai platform. and you can imagine, we have a significant deep expertise in our network group and hardware engineering organizations that spend all of their time optimizing for that, which gives us our great cogs and capex benefits inside of akamai. so we'll look to do that as we integrate linode.
and then can you repeat the second half of the question? i think it was on go-to-market?
tim horan -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
yes. just same thing for like customer care and go-to-market? will you have to invest much to integrate?
adam karon -- chief operating officer and general manager of the edge technology group
yes. no, the great thing about the linode platform is it is very self-service, very frictionless for developers to come on board. they have amazing documentation that make developers use of their platform easy. and they have a great customer care group inside of linode that we've worked very closely with your -- and build up to the signing of this.and so we expect to have them operate more as a tier 2 to our existing akamai customer care organization.
and of course, our existing enterprise sales force will be the sales force that goes to market, selling those products along with their existing self-service model they have today.
tim horan -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
and you mentioned you have a very large network, obviously. do you think you can get into the enterprise private line or global wan market or just overall enterprise network indirectly?
adam karon -- chief operating officer and general manager of the edge technology group
well, can you ask -- i think in terms of enterprise win or whatnot, we do partner very closely with our telco partners, and that's something that we work very closely with them when they have opportunities. we use our network in combination with theirs, where it makes synergy with those customers that want to use both our telco partners and akamai. i'm not sure if that's what you were getting at or something.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
think of akamai as providing internet connectivity to enterprises. that's not our business. we -- that's our partners business. now we do provide clean access so that an enterprise can sort of hide behind akamai.
and only akamai can come through so that they maintain safety and security for their data centers. so we do that, but we're not -- we don't provide base connectivity. that would be our partners, which would be the carriers.
tim horan -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst

our next question comes from franklin louthan with raymond james.
franklin louthan -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you. you mentioned earlier bringing scale to the business here. and i'm just curious what the strategy is for bringing scale to compete increasingly with large cloud companies that have some of the biggest scale in the world.
and why the strategic decision to move in that direction and not bolster more of the security or the core cdn business? thanks.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yeah. when you think of scale, there's a couple of ways to do it. one is just how many servers do you have? obviously, we have a lot. but the way we think about scale is more in terms of being distributed.
and none of the hyperscalers come anywhere close to us in terms of being in 4,000 pops and having a real edge network. now, what we haven't had before is the managed vm, managed container services. and our customers have asked for that. that's been the one missing piece on our platform.
because customers for many of their apps would like to take the entire app, build it on akamai run it on akamai, deliver it through us, where they know they get fabulous performance, instant scalability, where it becomes relevant to do so to have the edge computing really done on the edge and then to have it all be secure so that we can provide the end-to-end service. and so that's why we're doing this. and in some cases, there may be some -- of course, we've been competing with the hyperscalers for 15 years, and i think that will continue. and i think the hyperscalers themselves, several of them are our largest customers.
and several of them are already using us for our compute capabilities, and i expect that to increase with the acquisition of linode. and so it's an environment where we compete, of course, have and for many years and successfully. and what we do, we do really well. and that will be taking an application, making it easy to build and deploy on akamai and then to have the world's best performance, scalability, global reach and security.
and that's where akamai excels. and that's the goal in making this acquisition is really to complete that story to be able to have the end-to-end capability to handle their applications.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes. and just to add, i mean this -- i was going to -- this doesn't take away from our investment in security. and another way to think about it is you've now got two very exciting, fast-growing businesses inside of akamai, led by two different leaders in the company. and the scale that we can bring -- turn the question around and think about if you're a $100-plus million company trying to scale to $1 billion, what would you need? you'd need an enterprise sales force.
you'd need a global private network. you'd want to have a low-cost deployment model. you'd want to have access to customers and channel, and we bring all that. so this, to me, was a very natural adjacency for us.
and i look at ourselves and what we're spending in third-party cloud, looking at bringing that in-house driving some additional synergies and savings there. it's just a natural extension of what we're doing and entering a really, really big, exciting market. and again, it doesn't take away from our ability to invest in security. as you saw, we did two very large acquisitions.
one in security. one here in cloud. and we're very fortunate with our profitability and our cash flow generation to be able to do that.
franklin louthan -- raymond james -- analyst
so is the end goal to be able to provide some of these cloud computing functions on yourself that would -- that the large cloud companies would white label? or are you going to be providing aspects that they just can't do themselves in their larger server farm requirements?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
i think both. there's things that we do today at a level that the hyperscalers don't do. i mean they have competing services, but in many cases, the hyperscalers use us and use our services for their own properties even though we compete with them. i do expect us to be partnering with, well, certainly many of the world's major carriers and white labeling our services.
of course, the carriers are major channel partners with us today, and i think that will increase through the acquisition of linode because they've had an interest in being able to offer that kind of capability, and now it comes hand-in-hand with, well, the whole solution all put together.
franklin louthan -- raymond james -- analyst
ok, thank you very much.

our next question comes from rudy kessinger with d.a. davidson.
rudy kessinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question guys. i want to go -- two things here. starting off, going back to said customers that are going to have the repricing.
you said basically declined first half and then return to growth in the second half. for the year in '22 over '21, what's your expectation for that group? are they going to be slightly down or about breakeven, on a growth basis?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah, good question. so i would expect those customers to be slightly up year over year. so as you declined in the first two quarters, you start growing the back half. now there's also significant upside with the linode products as well.
you can imagine these guys have -- they spend tons of money in this area. so there's a potential there you could continue to grow that base of customers. so not expecting that this year, but it's possible that we could start to tap into that. obviously, we're going to have to build a pipeline, get customers lined up, but that's obviously certainly a very target-rich group of customers.
rudy kessinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. and then secondly, going back to guardicore, a pretty substantial outperformance thus far. i think you said $10 million in the quarter. initial expectation in q4 was $6 million to $7 million, then obviously, $50 million to $55 million expected in '22 versus $30 million to $35 million originally.
just what's really driving that upside? what's really resonating well with this product, both with new customers and those that you're cross-selling?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
well, obviously, ransomware is a big problem. and we believe that guardicore has the best solution. it is easier to use than competing solutions, and micro-segmentation has a reputation for being really hard to implement and inflexible. it gives you great visibility in terms of what's going on in your network.
customers have really appreciated that. it's really important with security. and they have a solution that works with legacy systems that the competition doesn't have. they have built their own custom firewall.
and the competing services will have to rely on the existing firewalls and whatever operating systems being used by a particular application and, in some cases, doesn't even exist and so they can't cover it. so it's the best solution and to a big problem that's rapidly growing. and so we've seen very strong interest in our customer base. and of course, we have a very large enterprise sales force that now can bring guardicore into the large banks and the large enterprises, and the initial reception has been very strong.
so yeah, i'm very excited by their performance this year and i'm looking forward to substantial growth in the future.
rudy kessinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions.
tom barth -- head of investor relations
all right. operator, we probably have time for one more question. thank you.
operator
this question comes from jeff van rhee with craig-hallum.
jeff van rhee -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
just under the wires. so two quick ones for me. first, i guess, on the cross-sell back into your base of linode product. how critical is it to win over the developers in your base? i mean, obviously, you've got the relationship.
maybe you can come in and try to make the cross-sell, but there's a lot of power sitting in those developers. what is it about these tools that the developers will see as their best option and how do you win them over?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
adam, why don't you take that one?
adam karon -- chief operating officer and general manager of the edge technology group
sure. i mean that's one of the most attractive things to the linode platform is that their developer-centric tools make it really easy for customers who use their kubernetes engine use their managed vms. it's just very simple to configure. onboard comes with a ton of documentation, makes it very simple for somebody to learn how to use and onboard themselves and try their applications very quickly on their platform.
we heard from developers inside of our own company as well as developers inside of our customers that they love to use the linode tools. they're simple, easy, and that's really why we think we're going to win over the developers using that type of platform. something that's simple, easy to use and has great documentation.
jeff van rhee -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
yes. and you may have missed it -- mentioned it. if i missed it, apologies. but in terms of the customer base, how many customers? what's an average spend per year for the linode base? and any particular concentrations in the base from vertical or other segmentation that matters?
adam karon -- chief operating officer and general manager of the edge technology group
so the linode customer base is around 150,000 customers. we don't break them down like that, at least not yet. but we can tell you, i think ed mentioned this earlier on the call, that the larger segment of their customer base is growing much faster than the very, very small developers. but we don't give out the arpu yet on the customer base.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes. just to add, there's no customer concentration risk in terms of any significant customers making up a large percentage of the revenue. and earlier, it was adam who mentioned that from a go-to-market perspective, they didn't focus on selling into large enterprises. that's where we can bring in that synergy.
so i would expect that over time, that customer base could change and look a lot more like our customer base. and obviously, that small developer base will just continue to grow as we continue to market and that sort of thing. but it also opens up opportunities in some of our underserved verticals that you think about the spend in certain places that may not have as large websites or web presence, but they're spending an awful lot in this area. so i do expect that customer base to change.
when we get to analyst day, we'll try to break that down a little bit for you, give you some views in terms of how we're thinking about growth in the future. and then as we get some months under our belt of operating the company, as we come up with new metrics that we think are helpful, we'll obviously bring them to the table and disclose them for you.

2022-Q1,AKAM,2022-05-03 16:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the first quarter 2022 akamai technologies earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, tom barth, head of investor relations. please go ahead.
tom barth -- head of investor relations
thank you, operator. good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining akamai's first quarter 2022 earnings call. speaking today will be tom leighton, akamai's chief executive officer; and ed mcgowan, akamai's chief financial officer. please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance.
these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. these factors include any impact from macroeconomic trends, uncertainty stemming from the covid-19 pandemic, the integration of any acquisitions and any impact from geopolitical developments. additional information concerning these factors is contained in akamai's filings with the sec, including our annual report on form 10-k and quarterly reports on form 10-q. the forward-looking statements included in this call represent company's view on may 3, 2022.
akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect new information, future events or circumstances except as required by law. as a reminder, we will be referring to some non-gaap financial metrics during today's call. a detailed reconciliation of gaap and non-gaap metrics can be found under the financial portion of the investor relations section at akamai.com. and with that, let me turn the call over to tom. 
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
thanks, tom. and thank you all for joining us today. our q1 revenue was $904 million, up 7% year over year and up 9% in constant currency. this solid result was driven by the continued rapid growth of our security and compute businesses.
q1 non-gaap operating margin was 30%. q1 non-gaap eps was a $1.39 per diluted share, up 1% year over year and up 4% in constant currency. as ed will discuss later, eps came in at the low end of our guidance range, primarily due to an adverse tax impact of $0.03. since our last call with you on february 15, we've seen the development of several major global events and financial headwinds.
it's remarkable how quickly the world has changed with the war in ukraine, the significant strengthening of the u.s. dollar, escalating inflation, increasing concerns about a recession and a moderation of internet traffic growth, as many countries remove mask mandates. since these developments are all fairly recent, they had a relatively small impact on our q1 results, but it's prudent to assume that they'll impact our results more meaningfully for the rest of the year. for example, at current spot rates, the strengthening dollar will adversely impact full year 2022 revenue by about a $100 million.
about $55 million of that impact has come since we issued guidance on february 15. as we disclosed in our 8-k filing on march 7, about 1% of our revenue comes from russian companies or is derived from delivering traffic into russia. we have since terminated our business with several majority state-owned russian companies and our traffic delivered into russia and ukraine on behalf of other global customers has declined dramatically since the war began. as a result, it's reasonable to assume that we will no longer generate most of the revenue that had been associated with russian and ukraine.
lastly, data from some of our large customers in the media and commerce verticals suggest that they may be transitioning from an environment of above normal online consumption, fueled by covid-related restrictions to an environment with more macroeconomic uncertainty, which could moderate their traffic growth in the near term. discussions with many of our large carrier partners across the world have reinforced the view that traffic growth rates may be moderating across the internet as a whole. in particular, they've told us that they've recently seen a moderation in their year-over-year traffic growth, and that the current levels of traffic on their network are less than what they'd expected. this is consistent with what we've recently seen.
traffic is still growing at a fast pace on the akamai platform, but at a more moderate pace than we've observed over the last few years. as a result of these largely external factors and to be conservative in our outlook, we feel it's prudent to lower our expectations for the full year. ed will provide more detail shortly. that said, and this is important to emphasize, akamai's business continues to be very strong and highly profitable.
traffic growth on our platform remains substantial. and the data we've received from customers and carrier partners indicates that our market share remains stable or is modestly increasing. in addition, our customer churn levels continue to be at record lows. lost annual revenue from churned accounts in q1 amounted to less than one half of 1% of total annual revenue.
and churn due to competitors was much less than half of that already small amount. as a result, our market leading delivery business continues to generate substantial cash and to power our unique edge platform. our security business has reached an annual revenue run rate of over $1 billion and continues to grow over 20% annually in constant currency. and we believe that our compute business is poised to achieve about $400 million in revenue this year with a growth rate of over 60%.
and perhaps most important of all the combination of our security and compute businesses now represents the majority of our revenue. we expect these businesses to generate about $2 billion of revenue this year with a growth rate of about 27% in constant currency. i'll now talk about each of our three major business lines, starting with security, which we believe will soon become our largest business line. our security solutions generated revenue of $382 million in q1, one up 23% year-over-year and up 26% in constant currency.
this very strong growth was driven primarily by our flagship security products, kona site defender and bot manager. and also by our new guardicore micro-segmentation solution to stop ransomware. in q1, we finalized the largest deal in guardicore's history, valued it more than $10 million over the next three years, expanding our longtime relationship with one of the largest banks in the world. the size and scope of the deal illustrates why we're so excited about our opportunity in micro segmentation.
financial services firms in particular are frequent targets of ransomware and malware and large banks with security risks, face financial penalties from regulators if they fail to address them. so from a compliance perspective, adopting micro segmentation can reduce risk and prevent large fines in the process. by reducing spending on their legacy static firewalls, the bank that's adopting our micro segmentation solution will free up resources to implement stronger defenses as they move to a new zero trust security architecture. and by converting to our more flexible software-based solution, they can achieve greater agility to compete with fast moving fintech services.
this example demonstrates how guardicore can help akamai expand longtime relationships with customers to become a more valuable strategic partner in the future. guardicore is also helping us win new accounts and verticals such as critical infrastructure. for example, one of the largest railroads in the world recently became a multimillion dollar guardicore customer. on april 20, cybersecurity authorities in the u.s.
and other major countries warned that the war in ukraine raises the risk of cyber attacks. their recommended defenses aligned well to akamai security solutions from microsegmentation, ddos protection and web app firewall. web application attacks experienced by customers grew by nearly 200% year over year in q1. the largest increase we've seen in several years, web app attacks are a critical vulnerability for any company moving to the cloud, building microservices or integrating third parties via apis, which is why app and api protection is a critical priority for major enterprises.
akamai is a leader in gartner's magic quadrant for web app and api protection. and in q1, akamai's web app and api protection on gartner peer insights customers choice distinction for the third year in a row, also in q1, forrester named akamai a leader in its new wave for microsegmentation. as we discussed during our last call with investors in february, we will be reporting on our delivery and compute product lines separately, going forward. in q1, our delivery products generated revenue of $444 million, down 6% year over year and down 4% in constant currency.
revenue for our compute product group was $78 million in q1, up 32% year-over-year and up 35% in constant currency. as i mentioned earlier, traffic on our platform has been growing at a substantial rate. in fact, just last week, we set another record when we delivered over 250 terabits per second of peak traffic, more than 20% higher than our previous peak reached in february. the akamai edge platform continues to be the top choice for large media companies worldwide due to its unique scale and performance.
in a recent review of cdn vendors worldwide, idc said akamai's balanced and comprehensive portfolio spanning media and web delivery, emerging edge applications, extensive security capabilities, and programmable edge addresses the needs of all enterprise segments and the developer community. the report also noted how akamai's appetite for innovation is showcased by the fact that it continues to expand its services and capabilities beyond cdn to address new areas. akamai is the market leader in delivery by far, and the income generated by our delivery business helps to fund our investments in the fast growing areas of security and compute, including our game changing acquisitions of guardicore and linode. our compute product group includes akamai's capabilities in compute, storage, cloud optimization, developer tools, edge applications, and now linode, which joined akamai on march 21.
we are encouraged by how customers and industry analysts have responded to our acquisition of linode. in fact, several of used the word transformational to sum up the potential impact of our combination of the marketplace, the ceo and co-founder of macrometa, linode partner that enables web and cloud developers to run and scale data heavy real-time cloud applications has called akamai's acquisition of linode, a watershed moment for the cloud because it fundamentally reconfigures the landscape in many ways. those are his words and he says that akamai provides that layer of reach and distribution in a way that cloud providers are very challenged to be able to do. i'm excited about that he said.
of course, we're excited too. linode was an early pioneer in creating the market for alternative clouds, offering developers a platform to build new applications in ways that are simple to use and affordable. with high performance, a competitive, transparent, and predictable price points and backed by strong customer support after the sale. today, nearly three quarters of enterprises are pursuing multi-cloud strategies, which means that new workloads will be cloud agnostic and portable, free to move and choose the best place to be.
in fact, idc just issued a report on workload deployment optimization that urges buyers to consider suppliers of infrastructure-as-a-service beyond the hyperscalers. our acquisition of linode was the first alternative idc highlighted as an example that can offer better cost and performance while retaining the level of redundancy and coverage demanded by enterprises. in the coming years, we expect that customers will have a growing need for a continuum of compute from the cloud to the edge, to be closer where billions of end users are and where tens of billions of connected devices will be, especially as 5g and iot take hold and grow. building the bridge that enables developers to move from the cloud to the edge and have one place to build, run and secure apps is a key reason why we're expanding our offering with linode.
at our analyst day, coming up on may 18, we'll talk more about the potential for substantial future growth in this new and exciting part of akamai's portfolio. as we become the cloud company that powers and protects life online. the soundness of our overall strategy was validated in visits i had with dozens of akamai customers across emea and apj last month. common concerns expressed by customers and prospects included the war in ukraine, the heightened level of cyber attacks, as well as risk to trade and supply chains, energy costs, and currency evaluations.
customers express very strong interest in our security strategy and guardicore, in particular. as you can imagine, their boards are asking them how they can prevent a crippling ransomware attack. and guardicore is the perfect solution. they know that malware always finds a way in, the key is identifying it and stopping it spread before it can cause serious damage.
and that's exactly what guardicore is designed to do. most of the customers i met with, were also interested in exploring our cloud compute offering as a more affordable and easier way to build, run, and secure their new applications. the tight labor market, employee attrition, and the desire of employees to work remotely were also top of mind for customers in every location. several companies that i met with are reducing their real estate footprint.
and one of them told me they could only do this because they secured their remote work environments with akamai's enterprise application access. here at akamai, we face the same macro trends as our customers, but in spite of the headwinds, we feel good about the growing demand from customers for our security and compute solutions, the expertise of our team in the addition of capabilities and talent from guardicore and linode. and how all of this gives akamai not one, but two, rapidly growing and highly synergistic businesses, further diversifying our revenue, we've also performed well on the retention of our talent, employees appreciate our flexible workplace policy and culture of teamwork.akamai scores very high on third-party rankings of the best places to work. i'm proud of the way that our employees have managed.
and i want to thank our extended team around the world for doing such a great job for our customers. they are truly making life better for billions of people, billions of times a day. now over to ed for more on q1 and our outlook for q2 and the rest of the year. ed?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
thank you, tom. as tom mentioned, akamai delivered a solid quarter in q1. q1 revenue is $904 million, up 7% year-over-year, or 9% in constant current currency. revenue was led by continued strong growth in security and compute.
the strength was partially offset by a significant strengthening u.s. dollar and a slight moderation in traffic growth rate in our delivery business during the last month of the quarter. security revenue grew 23% year over year and 26% in constant currency, led by a reacceleration of growth in our application security business and continued very strong performance from guardicore. security represented 42% of total revenue in q1, which is up 5 points from q1 a year ago.
guardicore delivered revenue of $19 million in the quarter, included in our guardicore results was approximately $7 million of term license deals from four customers. as a reminder, while the majority of guardicore deals are software as a service and revenue is recognized monthly under asc 606, some customers specifically financial services and healthcare due from time to time require on-premise deployments. these deployments result in term license accounting treatment, where we are required to recognize a significant portion of the revenue upfront when the product is delivered for spreading the revenue over the contract term. it's worth noting the impact of these deals resulted in a pull forward from q2 to q4 into q1 of approximately one percentage point of revenue growth.
compute revenue in q1 was $78 million and grew 32% year over year and 35% in constant currency. as tom mentioned, we were very pleased with the initial performance of our linode acquisition, which closed in late march and contributed revenue of approximately $3.5 million in q1. delivery revenue was $444 million in q1 and decline 6% year over year and 4% in constant currency. as discussed last quarter, several of our top customers are expected to renew in the first half of 2022.
our first quarter revenue was impacted by the renewals of half of these customers, we expect the remaining customers to renew by july 1. so far, the pricing for the renewals has been in line with our expectations. additionally, we started to notice the growth rate of traffic on our network moderate a bit in march, specifically in gaming and ott verticals. as some pandemic related restrictions were lifted in countries throughout the world.
sales in our international markets represented 47% of total revenue in q1. international revenue grew 11% year over year or 16% in constant currency. the negative impact of foreign exchange on our q1 results increased by approximately $2 million from our february earnings call as a u.s. dollar continued to strengthened significantly in march.
foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $4 million on a sequential basis and negative $18 million on a year-over-year basis. finally, revenue from our u.s. market was $481 million and grew 4% year over year. now moving on to costs.
cash gross margin was 76% in line with our expectations. gaap gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation was 63%. non-gaap cash operating expenses were $295 million. now moving on to profitability.
adjusted ebitda was $391 million. our adjusted ebitda margin was 43% in line with our guidance. non-gaap operating income was $270 million and non-gaap operating margin was 30%. capital expenditures in q1, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $116 million.
this was slightly better than our guidance range as we continued to see greater efficiency on our network. gaap net income for the first quarter was $119 million or $0.73 of earning per diluted share. non-gaap net income was $225 million or $1.39 of earnings per diluted share, up 1% year over year and up 4% in constant currency. non-gaap earnings per share was negatively impacted by approximately $0.03 in q1 due to a higher than expected non-gaap effective tax rate.
taxes included in our non-gaap earnings were $43 million based on a q1 effective tax rate of approximately 16%. this was approximately 1.5 points higher than we had expected in due primarily to three reasons. first, a higher than expected mix of u.s. revenue with foreign exchange rate fluctuations, a significant contributing factor along with the addition of linode revenue.
second, an unfavorable change to foreign tax credits in q1 based on the most recent treasury guidance. and third, a refinement of our previous assumptions related to r&d tax launching changes from the 2017 u.s. tax reform that became effective in q1 2022.moving now to cash in our use of capital. as of march our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $1.3 billion.
during the first quarter, we spent approximately $103 million repurchase shares, buying back approximately 900,000 shares. in addition to share repurchases in march, we spent approximately $900 million to complete our acquisition of linode. we ended q1 with approximately $1.7 billion remaining on our current repurchase authorization. our intention is to continue to buy back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time, and to be opportunistic in both m&a and share repurchases.
before i provide our q2 and 2022 guidance, i want to highlight several factors. first, our guidance now includes linode. we expect linode to contribute revenue of approximately $100 million and add approximately $0.05 to $0.06 to non-gaap eps in 2022. this is unchanged from the assumptions we shared on our last call.
second, the dollar has continued to strengthen meaningfully since we reported in mid-february. as a result, we currently expect a much greater foreign exchange headwind for the remainder of 2022. at current spot rates, our guidance assumes that foreign exchange will have a negative $100 million impact on revenue on a year-over-year basis. this compares to our prior guidance of a negative $45 million impact to revenue.
this change in fx from our prior guide will also negatively impact non-gaap eps by approximately $0.16 for the a full year 2022. it's worth emphasizing that currency markets have been extremely unsettled and about as volatile as i have ever seen, as a result, it is impossible to predict whether and how the impact could change going forward. third, we now expect our non-gaap effective tax rate for 2022 to be approximately 16%, which is a approximately 1.5 points higher than our prior assumption. based on the items i mentioned before, the change in tax rate will also negatively impact the full year 2022 non-gaap eps by approximately $0.11.
fourth, as tom discussed, regarding our business in russia and ukraine is reasonable to assume that most of that revenue goes away. finally, as mentioned earlier, our traffic growth rate moderated a bit in march, and we've seen that trend continue in april. while traffic continues to grow at a strong rate and as at record levels, the growth rate is lower than we originally expected. therefore, we are taking a more conservative approach to forecasting our traffic and corresponding revenue for the remainder of the year.
that said, we do not believe this trend is a permanent consumer shift or due to us losing share, but rather is likely driven by some of the significant external factors we are seeing in the marketplace and geopolitically. said another way, we believe that traffic growth and online activity return to more historical norms at some point. so with all those factors in mind, turning to our q2 guidance. we are now projecting revenue in the range of $890 million to $905 million or up 4% to 6% as reported or 8% to 10% in constant currency over q2 2021.
foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $14 million impact on q2 revenue compared to q1 levels and a negative $30 million impact year over year. at these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 75%. q2 non-gaap operating expenses are projected to be $282 million to $289 million. we anticipate q2 ebitda margins of approximately 43%.
we expect non-gaap depreciation expense to be between $129 million to $130 million. and we expect non-gaap operating margin to decline to approximately 29% for q2 to largely to the change in fx and some node integration costs. moving now to capex, we expect to spend approximately $150 million to $155 million, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest in the second quarter. this represents approximately 17% of projected total revenue.
a significant portion of the increase in the spend this quarter is related to linode, an anticipation of significant demand. with the overall revenue and spend configuration i just outlined, we expect q2 non-gaap eps from the range of $1.28 to $1.33. this eps guidance assumes taxes, the $40 million to $41 million based on an estimated quarterly non-gaap tax rate of approximately 16%. it also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 162 million shares.
looking ahead to the full year, we now expect revenue of $3.62 billion to $3.67 billion, which is up 5% to 6% year over year as reported, we're up 7% to 9% in constant currency. we expect security revenue to grow at least 20% or greater for full year 2022 in constant currency. we now estimate non-gaap operating margin to be approximately 29% based primarily on the impact of fx and some of the internet traffic dynamics i previously discussed. we now estimate non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $5.32 to $5.44.
this non-gaap earnings guidance is based on a non-gaap effective tax rate of approximately 16%, a fully diluted share count of approximately 161 million shares. finally, full-year capex is anticipated to be approximately 14% of revenue. it is worth noting, our capex assumption now includes linode that we talked about on our last quarter, partially offset by lower network capex, given the slower traffic growth rate that we now project. in closing, while the macroeconomic environment has become more challenging since our last earnings call and the u.s.
dollar continues to be a major headwind for us. we remain very optimistic about the opportunities in front of us, especially in security and compute. as tom mentioned, i look forward to seeing you at our analyst day in new york city on may 18. thank you.
tom and i would be happy to take your questions. operator?
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from keith weiss with morgan stanley. your line is open.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
excellent. thank you guys for taking the call and a lot of great kind of information in there for us to kind of better understand kind of what's going on with a lot of moving pieces in the environment. of course, i'm going to ask you about more on that. so in particular, when you see like the slowing network traffic and some of these increasing pressures, is there any kind of geographic specificity to it? is it more in europe than the u.s.
or is it more evenly spread number one. and number two, on the security side of the equation, is there any counterforce if you will, meaning, it sounds like, it's a pretty bad threat environment out there. you guys have a great solution portfolio for those types of threats. are you seeing any sort of increasing demand on that side of the equation that can offset some of those potential headwinds on the delivering compute side of the equation? thank you.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yes. this is tom. great questions. the traffic, i would say, growth moderation seems to be pretty much global and that coincides with a pretty much global reduction in things like mask mandates and quarantines and so forth, except for china.
and we don't do domestic to domestic delivery in china, so we wouldn't be able to see that. so there's no particular geographic dependence there and you're on a great point about counterbalance through security. obviously, we're negatively impacted in terms of traffic and a few customers, because of the war and ukraine. on the other hand, attacks have gone way up, the volume of attacks.
and that's an area where we can really help our customers. and so there could have some counterbalance in terms of the security business. and obviously, as i mentioned, customers are really worried about ransomware attacks and malware, and we've got a great solution for that with guardicore. and as we talk about the macroeconomic challenges, the fears of a recession, the inflation -- customers probably increasingly concerned about saving cost going forward and that could provide some counterbalance as well, with our linode solution, we're in a really good position to help major enterprises decrease their cloud spend.
we find that many of them have seen that spend increase dramatically. and now they can use linode for applications, especially, enterprises that are already set up in a multi-cloud environment. they've got their applications and containers or vms, and they could easily move those to linode and save money. so there could be some counterbalance here as we go forward.
that's a very good observation.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. and if i could sneak one in for ed on the other side of the equation. you talked to us about how sort of capex is coming down a little bit versus kind of what we were talking about immediately after linode based on lower network traffic. are there any adjustments that you guys are making to your opex side of the equation? so the level of investment that you guys are going to be making throughout the year given a more kind of difficult environment.
or is it -- it's kind of steady investment as you goes, if you will.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
we're not able to hear, ed. so i guess, we're having a trouble with the operator with ed maybe -- ok. could you ask the question again, please?
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
sure. thanks. so i was just on the call, ed, you had talked about capex coming down a little bit because of sort of lower network traffic. i was just wondering if you guys are making any adjustment to the opex for fy2022 given the more volatile macro.
any limitation in any kind of your investments throughout the year, or do the investments stay relatively stable?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
no. that's a great question. and yes, capex is much more efficient. of course, we're investing heavily to grow the linode footprint.
in terms of opex, we're always working to be more efficient with our opex to deliver traffic. and we're seeing the benefits of that even now. you look at the impact that fx for example is having on our operating margin and then, having less traffic and yet still we were at 29% to 30% with op margin for this year. and now we'll be, i think really closer to the low end of that range.
but it's because that we've been able to be much more efficient on opex that we can hold it there and not be lower than that. and of course, we are -- also it's important that we are going to continue to invest certainly in security and compute. we don't want to be a very temporary solution with fx to induce us to do something that would hurt us long-term with our growth and security and compute. and if you look at our business today and i think it's pretty important to note that the majority of our revenue is now security and compute, and that is growing currently at over 25% as reported.
and so the last thing we want to do is somehow scale back investment there when it's just a fabulous a couple of businesses just because there's stuff going on with fx and the macroeconomic environment. and ed is trying to get back on, but we can keep going and i'll do my best ed invitation in the meantime.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, tom, i'm back, could you guys hear me now?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
we can. very good.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
ok. great. i'm sorry about that. i don't know what happened little technical difficulties there, keith.
but i'm not sure if tom got to your question about some of the things we're doing on the cost. ok, if there's anything else i'm happy to take an additional question.
keith weiss -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes. no. tom did a great job. you might have to worry about job security now.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from james breen with william blair. your line is open.
james breen -- william blair -- analyst
thanks. just a couple. one, when you look at the old guidance that you gave on the fourth-quarter call relative today down kind of $5 million at the -- $50 million below and in the high end. given some of the puts and takes you gave, it seems like the rush impact sort of mid $30 million, and then the incremental fx of sort of in the mid 50s sort of kind of offsets basically the upside from linode and close that deal.
i'm just trying to think about to quantify it. so is that sort of incremental kind of $15 million difference, really what you're seeing from the lower traffic on the delivery side. and can you just remind us of the delivery revenue this quarter the $444 million? how we want to think about it annually? how much of that is more volume driven versus subscription based? thanks.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes. jim, it's ed. yes. i think you've got the pieces right there in terms of the different components, fx being about $55 million, russia, you could say is about 1%, so call at about $30 million give or take.
but the rest of it is the delivery. i think one of the things we tried to make clear in our prepared remarks was the compute business is going great. we don't have any -- we've only owned the business for a little while, so there's no change there in terms of our outlook. but certainly good early returns and then security is going great, did better than we expected this quarter.
so it is limited to a delivery issue and is, i would say primarily, almost all volume driven that we're seeing. so what we did basically is just adjust the growth rate that we expected for the remainder of the year. and then obviously, things can change over time. but based on what we've seen so far in the last couple weeks of march and the beginning of april, we just thought it was prudent to adjust that.
so you're thinking about it right in terms of the different pieces.
james breen -- william blair -- analyst
great. and then just maybe one for tom, just the strategy. linode, you've owned it now for a little over a month. they were folks a lot on sort of the small midsize business space in terms of the computing storage.
have you seen any traction with that product that some of your larger customers now that it's starting to get integrated?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yes. obviously, very early days, but we're really excited about the potential for that traction. i give you just, one anecdote, i was in europe meeting customers last month and met with one of our major media workflow partners. and i was going to go to talk to them about linode because they have a big cloud spend and we feel that could be really relevant for moving to linode.
they're very happy akamai partners and customers. and i was going to tell them about the acquisition, but i get there, we shake hands. first thing he says is, wow, great acquisition. and he's is the ceo, but turns out he has a pass as a developer knew about linode, loves them and he's into multi-cloud and he said, look, what we did is we already have our workflow apps and containers.
and so we thought, what the heck let's try it. and so they moved him over to linode and he said, it worked great. and he said, we're going to save money to boot. and it's really easy to use.
and we didn't even know because linode really is easy to use that we didn't know this was even taking place. so i do think we're in an excellent position to not only increase the existing linode customer base, but provide linode capabilities to major enterprises. and of course, linode really appeals the developers and increasingly developers are making the decisions or heavily influencing the decisions that have major enterprises as was an example in this case.

thank you. our next question comes from rishi jaluria with rbc. your line is open.
rishi jaluria -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
wonderful, guys. thanks for taking my questions and appreciate all the details around the moving pieces. first, i wanted to start with maybe better understanding some of the macro factors. i think look, the fx well understood, russia as well, the moderating traffic with reopenings.
but tom, at the beginning you had mentioned kind of the inflation side, as well as fears of recession being in western europe or globally. can you talk a little bit more about how those macro factors are impacting your business? is this resulting in longer sales cycles, smaller initial deals, just more hesitation around new deals? any color there that you can give would be helpful and then have a follow-up.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes. this is ed. i'll take that, and, tom, if you want to add some color if i missed something here. so in terms of the inflation and the impact on our business today, we're not seeing a significant impact from inflation, whether that's with labor costs or with our costs of our network and that sort of thing.
we're seeing a little bit of higher energy prices in europe and that sort of thing. but our team does a pretty good job of trying to bake that into their deals when they sign colo deals and that sort of thing. that could obviously change, obviously the labor markets are pretty tight and that sort of thing. but i think the biggest macro impact from our business in terms of our change in outlook is really around the change in behavior where we're seeing mask mandates lifted and people going out more shopping, more in-stores and that sort of stuff.
and the impact on the traffic growth rate is probably the biggest impact. obviously if we get a major recession that could potentially have a greater impact, but we're not seeing that certainly in the security business, we're not seeing customers pulling back. we're not seeing deals size, the deals getting elongated or anything along those lines. it's really more that, that impact on the traffic business.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yes. and to ed's point, it's not direct on us, but there is some concern among our media customers in terms of subscriptions and how their business is doing. and so we just keeping an eye on that in terms of the end users reacting in cutting cost and consuming less online. so i don't think that's a major factor yet, but it's something we're keeping an eye on.
rishi jaluria -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. that that's really helpful. thanks. and then just going back to linode, i guess number one, if we do the math back of the envelope, it's about a $4 million contribution in q1 is that directionally a correct, number one.
and i think number two, when you made the acquisition; you talked about incremental investment opportunities to accelerate the growth rate. can you maybe remind us about where you find those opportunities, especially where there's low hanging fruit? and what would be an ideal growth rate for the linode asset? thanks.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes. so i'll start off with the question first, just the housekeeping item. we had about $3.5 million of revenue we see in the quarter from linode. and then as far as the growth rate's concerned, we'll get into a lot more details when we see you in new york in a couple of weeks, but, obviously this is a very, very fast growing business, and linode's growth rate before we acquire them was at 15%.
we think we can accelerate that pretty significantly as we introduce more features, more locations, more capabilities, and we start to tap into our enterprise customer base. so we think that growth rate can accelerate pretty significantly.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yes. just to add to that in terms of investment and opportunities, obviously scale is something we're really good at and distribution, which we're putting a lot of effort into, and our customer base, which linode really hadn't tapped into and being a smaller company, probably a little harder for them to go after major enterprises in terms of the credibility and so forth. but that's really easy for us to do. and just as i talked about with examples before you take linode ease of use, and our customer base and those customers that are multi-cloud, and have their apps and containers, they can move them over and save money when they do it.
and bring it closer to their delivery and security, which has been occupy where the market leaders at. so i think there's a really great opportunity to jump-start a significant growth among major enterprises for linode.
rishi jaluria -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. that's really helpful. thank you so much, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from tim horan with oppenheimer. your line is open.
tim horan -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
thank you. tom, on that point with apps and containers is it, have we seen many apps kind of poured over to other clouds at this point, and if they are tying into other value-added products and other software products that the cloud guys have, does it make it harder to do? or can they still do it relatively easily?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yes. that's another great point. the hyperscalers have a lot of managed services and added functionality on their platform, which linode doesn't. now, if you're the kind of company that likes to do those things yourself well, that's easy to do on linode.
if you're the kind of company that wants that done by your cloud provider, well, linode doesn't do that today. now over time, we will be adding more and more capabilities there. so it really, so today i wouldn't say that that every customer would be in a position to move everything over to linode. that is certainly not the case.
but i think there is a pretty significant segment where it can be done and does make sense to do. and over time we want to grow the kinds of the number, in the types of applications that will make sense to move on to linode. and it is helpful that, certainly our customer base is already using us for market leading delivery, market leading app acceleration or market leading security. so there's a lot of synergy there.
and i think the combination of that synergy ease of use and cost savings, it's a pretty exciting combination.
tim horan -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
and just on the traffic volumes, could you give us a sense, the last two years in covid were we like 25% above trend, 50% above trend, and do you think it kind of reverses however much it was above trend? i'm not looking for exact numbers, but just some color.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yes. it was way above, certainly the first year and very strong the second year. and i would say comparison a small decreasing growth rates, still growing very strong, but less than i think have been expected. and we're seeing that the same for the internet as a whole.
now, and we're also seeing our growth be stronger than the internet as a whole, which is good. that's what we want to keep seeing, because it means we're -- taking more of the internet traffic when that happens. so i would say the step down, we've seen so far is less than the step ups that we've seen. and i think that's because a lot of the increased use of the internet for everything, for video, for gaming, for commerce, remote work, i think a lot of that is here to stay.
but right now with all the restrictions coming off except for china, i think that's a big part of why we're seeing a little bit of a decrease in traffic growth rates right now.
tim horan -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from james fish with piper sandler. your line is open.
james fish -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for the questions. wanted to first start on the delivery side where frankly, we're not surprised to see slowing traffic given our tracking of what's going on in space, but it seems like it was a little bit worse for you guys. can you just help break down where the main weakness was between web delivery versus media delivery this quarter? it sounds like media was a bit more of a surprise for you guys as it was a former growth driver.
it slowing and you guys had a bunch of renewals there while we didn't have the recovery and web despite travel and hospitality traffic coming back. can you just help us kind of triangulate where we are between some of the underlying verticals?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
hey, jim. this is ed. i'll take that one. so yes, the bigger impact was definitely on the media side.
so i called out that we had renewals and when you have renewals, big renewals concentrated in a short period of time and you have a slowdown in your traffic rate; it does accentuate the impact to revenue. typically we see in a normal year, you'd start to get back to flat line after several quarters and that sort of thing. we just think it might take a little bit longer based on the type of traffic growth rates we're seeing. in terms of the hospitality and retail, two things to think about there.
we are seeing a bit of traffic increase specifically in travel, small vertical for us about 4% give or take, but remember both travel and the media -- sorry, the commerce vertical tend to buy our zero overage. so it's a little bit traffic. it doesn't have as much of an impact on revenue, but in terms of the biggest impact, that's really on the media side in terms of the change in traffic. and also in terms of a percentage of overall traffic media represents us a significant portion greater than 90% of our total traffic.
james fish -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. and switching over to security side, how are you guys thinking about the current balance of terms subscription versus saas for guardicore now that you've had it for about one and a half quarters? how do you think this settles down given certain verticals like financial services, want those term subscriptions. and lastly, any sense to what other large deals for guardicore could be in the pipeline over the next few quarters that can swing? i think it was 50 million to 55 million for expectations for guardicore this year.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes. good question. so i called out on the call that there was about four customers that had term licenses and what i'll do going forward to the extent that there's anything material we'll call it out. i'd say the majority of customers have the more traditional subscription based model, but there are our customers, especially financial services that do like to have the management controller on premise.
and that's what really drives the term license aspect of it and what requires us to take the revenue up front. but again, i think the majority will be in that category. now, keep in mind with the term license, you do have to renew that subscription when the term goes up. the typical term one to three years, tom mentioned that we did sign a fairly large three-year term deal.
so there'll be some of that maintenance and whatnot that could spread out, but you are required to take a fair chunk of that upfront. but in general, i would say that the majority would be the saas type deals. and as far as the pipeline goes, it's always hard to call when a deal's going to hit in any particular quarter. i don't see anything significant here in q2, i'm expecting more of a normal quarter, but to the extent there's anything we'll certainly let you know.
james fish -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks, ed.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from amit daryanani with evercore isi. your line is open.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. i guess i have two as well. maybe just to ask a little bit more on the core delivery business, the cdm business. i guess, do you think this business just sort of declines 4% or 5% a year for the rest of calendar 2022? or do you think to see sort of a bottom and the decline rate should improve as you go through the year?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes. so i think for the rest of the year, you'll see the business in decline because of the renewals that we have, we had half of them hit so far in the first quarter, the other half will hit in the second quarter. so you'll probably see a little bit of a step down in q3 and then in q4 tends to be your seasonally strong quarter. but you do have a tough compare.
so i would expect it to be negative for the rest of this year. and obviously it'll fluctuate depending on the specific traffic levels. but q4, we do typically see a strong season both with commerce and media, commerce has a less muted impact these days with a lot of customers, i think it's about 65% or greater have a zero overage contract. so commerce doesn't have as big of an impact, but media we've typically seen a pretty strong traffic in q4.
we expect to see a pickup in traffic probably a little less. so this year that's what we've modeled in.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. and then, hopefully, i have all these numbers correctly if not, please correct them. but as i think about the revisions to the calendar 2022 guide that you folks provided, it looks like sales versus the streets was with all the adjustments is coming down by about 100 million give or take, 2.5%, 3% of initial expectations. but the eps numbers, i think are coming down much more severely closer to 8%, 9% versus what the prior expectations were.
maybe just walk me through, there's a much more outside eps adjustment to the full year numbers versus revenue. is that just a tax rate or one of the moving pieces that are magnifying the correction on the bottom line on the eps line versus the top line?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes. sure. so let me try to walk you through that, rishi. so first of all, the tax impact is about $0.11.
and that obviously has no -- that's outside of any sort of change in the revenue. then you get the fx impact is about $0.16. and then the russia impact is call it another $0.09-ish give or take. so you've got about 60% of it is related to sort of those external factors and the remainder of it is related to just the revisions that we see in delivery.
amit daryanani -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from frank louthan with raymond james. your line is open.
frank louthan -- raymond james -- analyst
all right. great. great. thank you.
so on the traffic thing, just to be clear, this is an end user slowing down with the pie shrinking. it's just more of the pie is growing more slowly and or is some of this traffic going elsewhere? and if that's the case, who are you losing share to?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
no. you're right. it's the -- it's just the pie is not growing as fast. the pie is not shrinking; the pie is just not growing as fast.
and we believe based on talking to our customers and our carrier partners and what we see that our share of the pie is stable or growing and that we are not on balance losing share of the pie.
frank louthan -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. great. thank you. and then what sales investments do you need to make for the rest of the year to sell more with through, sell through with linode and to sell more guardicore, etc., where are you on that?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yes. so the nice thing with the linode acquisition is we're not required to make any additional investments in sales, per se. we're going to be obviously bringing this to our channel partners and our sales reps can sell it as a matter of fact, a lot of our customers, if you look at their cdn spend to cloud spend, it's orders of magnitude, larger on the cloud side. so we're talking to the same people that are spending money there.
our teams are will be trained up and ready to go for being able to sell linode. on the security side, you do tend to hire more specialists. and if i look at sort of where pj is investing in sales, we are invest a lot in guardicore not only just with sales reps, but also with technical specialists that help the sales team and professional services folks as well. so you're seeing the investment more leaning in toward the sales side, and you're getting a lot of leverage from the linode standpoint.
frank louthan -- raymond james -- analyst
all right. great. thank you.
operator
thank you. we have a question from rudy kessinger with d.a. davidson. your line is open.
rudy kessinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great, guys. thanks for taking my questions. on the ott or media, just how are your ott customers attributing that slower traffic growth maybe between end users, eliminating or reducing the number of ott services, they subscribe to a shortage of new content or just people getting out more with covid mandates lifted?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
well, as best we're hearing as sort of the first and third there's fewer subscriptions, in some cases, some cases subscriptions reversing. some cases when the subscriptions are ok, there's traffic growth, but slower traffic growth, and they had anticipated and that they had seen before. and so i think, part of that is that people are just out more right now. also on the commerce side, and there's been public reports about this, that more brick and mortar sales than there have been, and a little bit less on the online side, which is understandable i think.
given that people are apparently out and about more with less restrictions. so i think there's sort of a variety of factors and it's early days here and probably we'll learn a lot more over the next couple of months.
rudy kessinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. and then just on delivery, you said the pricing on those large customers that renewed this quarter was about as expected. but just as you look more broadly in delivery, how is pricing pressure faring versus years past. i guess, just as i piece it together, understanding traffic growth growing more slowly, but still growing and your guys, position that you're still gaining share of that growing pie, but delivery revenue being down several points.
just how is pricing pressure faring in the broader market?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yes. good question. so i would say a couple things to respond to that. so the renewals like i said are coming in largely as expected.
the big change is the rate of growth. so that also impacts your conversations going forward. so we've talked for years about how the pricing and the market is fairly efficient in terms, especially with the high volume media environment and it's really driven by volume. so to the extent that customers have less volume, the discounts rates will start to come down going forward.
so i would expect to see over time if customers aren't growing at the same type of rate, they're not going to get the same kind of discount. so we may see that take hold over the next several quarters as we go through more renewals and that sort of thing.
rudy kessinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. we have a question from fatima boolani with citi. your line is open.
fatima boolani -- citi -- analyst
hey. good afternoon. thank you for squeezing me in. just a really quick one for you in the security business, i think we -- you spent a lot of time sort of flushing out the guardicore performance in the corridor, which was pretty substantial.
i think you also kicked your hat on the recovery or reacceleration on the application security side of the security portfolio. but i'm curious if you have any comments or observations around what the network security side of the funds within that business segment is doing. just any color there with respect to sort of competitive dynamics, sales dynamics that would be really helpful? thank you.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yes. this is tom. on the network side that would be per lexmark, which is our ddos mitigation service doing very well. and that we've seen a lot of attacks over the last year, especially around ransom or extortion ddos attacks.
and we've been in a great position to; i had a lot of customers, major enterprises that were going to be potential victims of those attacks. also we have dns capabilities, which are widely used as part of the network security product lines, and i would say doing, doing very well.
fatima boolani -- citi -- analyst
one other thing i would add, tom, just that if i look at the product portfolio, bot manager continues to do extremely well and growing at a very, very healthy clip, and we introduced our account protector this quarter and saw very, very high uptake with that in early returns on that look great. obviously it's a newer product, so it'll take time for that to become a material contributed to revenue, but so far the early returns on that have been very good?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yes. and those are all part of our app and api protection group, which is where we're seeing the reacceleration ed talked about.
fatima boolani -- citi -- analyst
got it. and just a quick one for you in terms of the housekeeping around free cash flow. so appreciate some of the puts and takes on the margin side of things. mostly stable but curious about how we should think about free cash flow kind of given the near-term step up in capex, which is expected to moderate based on your guidance over the course of the year.
but anything you can help us from the free cash flow margin side given the fx movements as well, and that's it for me?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
sure. yes. sure. so on the free cash flow side, you'll notice that q1 tends to be a little bit lighter on the free cash flow side.
and a lot of it has to do with when the timing of when bonuses get paid and you can look, if you look kind of year over year, it's sort of in line, q1-to-q1 it will expand as we go out throughout the year, but i think one big key takeaway. if you go to the capex section, which obviously impacts free cash flow quite a bit. we had originally talked about the sort of call it, akamai excluding linode being 13% to 14% from a capex perspective. and that linode would add about two points.
one of the things that we're able to do is take advantage of the slow down and growth rate of traffic to be able to pull in some of the capex associated with linode and build out a little bit faster. but in addition to that, we've taken down our total capex. so i gave guidance for about 14% of total revenue for the year, which is about 2% better than what we had expected. so think of it as sort of folding in the linode capex under the original umbrella.
so that'll obviously help our free cash flow.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from michael elias with cowen and company. your line is open.
michael elias -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions. two, if i may. so you're expecting to hold an analyst day later this month.
any color on what we should expect to hear and as part of that, should we expect similar long-term guidance to what you gave. your last analyst day just including the new compute segment? it's my first question. and the second is, you highlighted at the beginning of the call the inflation and you said that you aren't seeing the impacts of that. i'm just wondering as you think of the business and to the extent that did become a bigger issue.
what are the levers that you could pull vis-a-vis pricing in order to combat inflation to be something that manifested itself? thank you.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yes. on the first question i think analyst day structurally it look a lot like it did last year. so we will look at long-term, cagr is what we're trying to achieve. we'll talk lot about the compute business and our overall strategy.
so high level similar to what you saw last year in terms of the structure. obviously we've got a cool new things to talk about with our new products, the acquisitions, guardicore, linode and the compute product line where we're pretty excited about.
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes. on the inflation front, a couple of things there, obviously you could, i guess you could argue that inflation is causing rates to go higher, which is impacting the u.s. dollar. so there's the fx impact of that, so that's one thing to keep in mind, i guess.
but one of the advantages of sort of the hybrid work environment is it enables you to look at acquiring talent from all over the place, instead of just on the couch [ph], you can look in the middle of the country and look at other lower cost areas. so that's one tool in our toolkit. the team's done a great job on the network side with our supply chain in terms of you negotiating and leverage power. a lot of our traffic on our network today is free in terms of bandwidth, so we're somewhat insulated from that.
obviously we'll keep a close eye on the labor markets, but as tom mentioned there could be some impact to some of our customers and the decisions that they make in terms of their spending. already we're spending on subscriptions or video or buying the next title for gaming or the gaming console and that sort of things. so that could have an impact on traffic. so what we're doing there is obviously pulling back a little bit on our capex for the core network.
we're actually able to redeploy some of those resources that we have that know how to build out and scale the network and just go faster in linode, which is great. so we're sort of taking advantage of some of the opportunities that this gives us and trying to insulate ourselves from any significant impact that inflation may have on the business.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yes. and that's one of the really nice things about our business now as we really are diversified. the majority of our revenue is now security and compute, not delivery, which is a pretty big milestone for a company that not too long ago was known as a cdn or a delivery company. and so when you do have these external factors that can hurt one side of the business, they might help other sides of the business, they might help other sides of the business.
for example, security being tied to the war in ukraine, or inflation driving a need to cut costs and now we have a really good answer for our customers with linode. so it puts our business in a much stronger position, and we're much more diversified than we've ever been.
michael elias -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. we have a question from jeff van rhee with craig-hallum. your line is open.
jeff van rhee -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
great. thanks. just a couple of cleanups for me. on guardicore in terms of the term licenses, were there any terms in q4?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
nothing material. there may have been about $1 million or so but nothing really material there.
jeff van rhee -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. and then as it relates to linode, how should we think about sales cycles there? as obviously we're going to try to blow out the sales effort and take that into the enterprise base. just how do we think about two things there. one, the sales cycles? and then two, to date, for linode, what was a large customer? i mean if you take a look at kind of the -- maybe their top 10 customers, what would it take for somebody to crack that large customer criteria sort of into the top 10, obviously, thinking to being able to measure your success in bringing that product to your enterprise base?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes. good question. so the sales cycles will vary. as tom mentioned, there are certain workloads that are built in a container that's easy to move, so those can move relatively quickly.
we've started our training, rolled out our compensation plan, so our sales team is starting to build the funnel. we're having good conversations with customers. we're starting to build out additional functionality. we put out a press release about our managed database capabilities the other day.
we're be building out more locations. you'll hear a lot more from adam when we get to the analyst day about specifically what we're doing and where we're heading. i would say you start -- in terms of how i'm looking at success, which we should start to see some of that materialize toward the back half of the year and really looking at what is our exit run rate going into next year and then what does that funnel look like. but we should start to see a lot of this materialize toward the back half of the year.
it's probably a normal sales cycle. you got some early wins. you've got developers from customers that can start playing around adding new applications and that sort of stuff. but i think in terms of the more meaningful, impactful deal sizes, those should happen toward the back half of the year and into next year.
jeff van rhee -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. last one for me. i think on the traffic side, you mentioned ott as well as gaming and in particular, in general, being most visible in the most recent quarter.
i mean, anything notable difference in the trends of those two traffic types? or is it just generally, behavior you or expect from people getting outside and unlocking? any differences there?
ed mcgowan -- chief financial officer
yes. good question. i'd say sort of the latter, what you just said there that is probably more of that people getting out. you see that more on the video side in terms of less hours streamed, if you're watching 10 hours a day, you're maybe doing eight or six or whatever.
but gaming is more of a seasonal issue. i'd say we saw more of an impact on gaming, not as many releases that had probably a bit weaker than we would have expected. i think in terms of the trends, it depends on what the cycle looks like going into the back half of the year in terms of major gaming releases. but the video side, i think, is a lot more behavioral.
jeff van rhee -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
yes. ok. all right. thank you.
tom barth -- head of investor relations
operator -- time for one more question.
operator
thank you. our last question comes from will power with baird. your line is open.
will power -- baird -- analyst
ok. great. thanks for sneaking me in. maybe, tom, i'd love to get a little more color on the strength within compute.
anything else you could provide with respect to key drivers in the quarter would be great.
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yes. we've been working on edge computing, doing edge computing services for close to 20 years. we have the edge worker solution that has function as a service and thousands of pops around the world, edgekv database capability and more and more applications having -- our customers having an interest in having them work at the edge. you get tremendous scalability, instant scalability, you can spin up your edge worker app a few milliseconds and be really close to the end user.
and i think we get more business there as you go forward, more and more of our customers are using it as they move to an api model and as you get 5g and as you get iot and you have more demand for lower latency and scalability at the edge. and of course, linode is really exciting because now you get the core cloud compute capability. so you can just take your container, your app and the container and move it over to akamai, and have the whole thing end to end from the core of the cloud to the edge. you can build your app on akamai.
you can run it on akamai. you could deliver it on akamai. you can do the compute you need at the real edge in thousands of places. and of course, we'll wrap it all in security for you.
so i think compute is strong on its own from what we had. now you get more strength with linode and then you wrap it all together in the akamai platform, which is really unique in terms of having 4,000 pops. there is nothing like it in terms of having a true edge network, the scalability you get and the performance you get from that.
will power -- baird -- analyst
ok. great. thanks. and then maybe just a quick question on thoughts around potential m&a from here given valuation compressions in the market.
how does that change the landscape for you? how you look at things and maybe appetite here, particularly coming on the heels of the linode deal?
tom leighton -- chief executive officer
yes. we're continuing to look at possible acquisitions. obviously, we've done two large ones in a short period of time. i don't expect that to be the norm.
we're generating a lot of cash, and we're going to use that to reinvest in the business, particularly in security and compute. so it's not impossible over time. you'll see other acquisitions like that. and probably, several smaller acquisitions like we've always done.
tech tuck-ins, adjacent products. so i think what you've seen is what you'll get, but not two big ones right away. that's not the norm. but we saw a real chance to have a game changer in enterprise security with guardicore.
