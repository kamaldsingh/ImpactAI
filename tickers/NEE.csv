thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] the first question is from steve fleishman from wolfe research. please go ahead.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
yeah, couple of questions. just first, just a clean-up on the mvp announcement. could you just talk about maybe a little more color on what you need to get that done and when, and why the write-off?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
sure. thanks, steve, and we appreciate the question. first, obviously, the project has taken longer and costs more than what we anticipated. and so the impairment is really related to reflecting not only that -- value that we have on our books, but really in relation to what we believe is the current fair valuation for the investment given what we do still have to accomplish.
and obviously a lot changed in the fourth quarter, including the nationwide 12 permit stay that i mentioned in the prepared remarks, as well as the various things that have happened in january, and against the backdrop of obvious changes, including the change in the administration, including the change in control of the senate, which happened here in january. so the impairment does reflect our view of what we still need to accomplish and the associated fair values related to the chances of being able to successfully execute on that, but this was an accounting exercise.
it was a lot of due diligence that we needed to evaluate and it -- we think we've made the appropriate changes, but it does not change our commitment to work with our partners to put this project into service. so i -- as i noted in the comments, we do have now a path that we're going to pursue in terms of the outstanding permitting, but we work closely with our partners to pursue that path. but we thought it was appropriate and obviously took the actions that we did with respect to the impairment.
john w. ketchum -- president and chief executive officer, nextera energy resources
hey, steve, this is john.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. and then just on the continued higher growth in renewables, could you maybe just touch a little bit on funding plans for that over the period, just higher level?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
sure. it's super high level. as you know, we've prided ourselves in a variety of approaches to the capital markets to support our business, retaining all of those options as circumstances change is one of the things that i think has been particularly successful for us over a long period of time. one aspect of that at this point i wouldn't expect to change, particularly as it relates to financing the projects of energy resources is that we will continue to execute significant amount of tax equity given our current position and tax capacity. but i think it's all of the tools in the toolbox that you would expect us to utilize to finance the business. but our commitment to our strong balance sheet remains unchanged and we will grow both profitably and maintaining a strong balance sheet.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. and then last maybe kind of a strategic question, i guess for jim, just the -- as we see the continued just dramatic ramp-up in renewables growth and the revaluation of the company probably tied to that, what does it mean for some of the statements you've made in the past on utility m&a? does it make it more likely because you need to balance the mix or less likely because there's just so much opportunity on this other side of the business?
james l. robo -- chairman and chief executive officer
so, steve, i -- it's obviously, the relative valuation of the two big businesses has changed over the last several years, right, and that's just accelerated over -- in particular over the last -- over the last 24 months. i think what that means is it's changed a bit of our analytic framework of how we think about utility m&a. on the one hand, i continue to believe that there is enormous value creation that we can bring to the table and you only need to look at what we've been able to do with gulf in the last 24.5 months to see how much value creation bringing our playbook in our operating platform the bear [phonetic] can create, right.
so that is -- that i think remains clear, and if anything is clear to me, on the other, i think it's also clear that probably a sweet spot for us in terms of m&a is things in the less than $20 billion range that we can pay cash and finance through the normal course. and at that point, if we do that, you're not shifting the mix one way or another all that tremendously, and in our set of analytics, we're working really more at how much value creation we bring to the table when we do this.
and so for example, i think santee cooper is a great example of that, that's -- it's a roughly $8 billion or $9 billion transaction and something that we can finance in the normal course and in a place where we think we can create enormous value very quickly. and so that's the kind of things that we're focused on. and, but most importantly, we're focused on running the business and executing, staying financially disciplined as we always have been and executing against the terrific growth prospects we have in energy resources and then executing at fpl as we always have for the benefit of our customers and continuing and for the benefit of the state. so that i think is just a little bit of an overview, how our current status of our thinking on.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
great, ok, thanks so much.

the next question is from julien dumoulin-smith from bank of america. please go ahead.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good morning, team, thanks for the time. i'll make it brief. if i can, just coming back to these renewable [phonetic] expectations and the redefined upsides expectations of the longer-term here, can you talk about a few factors here? first c&i, you guys haven't been as involved, it seems like that could be accelerating here. can you talk about how that's filtered into your expectations? secondly, the new expectations explicitly do not include any future build-own-transfer. how do you see that as incremental and any heuristics you might offer as to how to think about value creation there? and the third one on that if i can just throw it in there is the attach rates on storage. it seems like the bulk of the storage that you're talking about in the future is probably tied to your solar assets. how do you think about stand-alone as being incremental to what you've talked about already? i'll leave it there.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
okay, julien, thanks for the questions and you may need to prompt me if i forgot one or more aspects of the multi-part question. let me start with the c&i. as i highlighted in the prepared remarks, john and his team across energy resources have really cultivated a nice suite of opportunities with c&i customers. and if we look at our core base of other major investor-owned utilities or munis and co-ops in our c&i business, in other investor-owned utilities and munis and co-ops are still larger overall, but the opportunity set with c&i customers is definitely growing not just in your standard ppa, but more in the suite of types of opportunities that i mentioned as one of the pilot projects, but john and his team are pursuing kind of more holistic energy solution provider to the c&i customers.
and i think what's really changed over the last year plus, maybe it's even two years is the inbound request to c&i has really expanded as they've really started to look at their own carbon footprint, their own esg messaging, how do they source energy to do their business and how do they source that from a cleaner energy solutions has become higher topic of interest and higher priority for them and therefore terrific opportunity set for us. so i think that, that's a growing opportunity for us that we continue to be really excited about. in terms of build-own-transfers, we will continue to present our expectations, both our expectations and our signed contracts consistent the way that we've shown in the past, that there will be some build-own-transfer that energy resources pursues.
if it is a strict, just sell the project to somebody else. we think there is a lot of value creation there, but we won't necessarily incorporate in our backlog for purposes of reporting unless there is a long-term operation and maintenance or other stream of revenue to us that we benefit from. so we'll consistently report that. i think the opportunity set is there for both traditional build-own-transfers, as well as build-own-transfers where we provide some incremental long-term value to our customers.
and then finally, storage, the opportunity set is [phonetic] terrific. obviously, we've had tremendous success in attaching storage to new solar facilities, existing solar facilities and even some stand-alone storage projects. if there is a stand-alone storage incentive that congress pursues, obviously that would support near-term growth of stand-alone storage opportunities even beyond what we've seen, but the growth is terrific. and as we outlined back in 2019, we were surprised how fast the market evolved and i think we continue to be really supportive of that overall market.
and one last thing i'll highlight, julien, is really the innovative nature of the fpl team and working with the solartogether program to work with our commercial and industrial customers in florida is to support their needs, to build the most cost-effective solar. and that's what the solartogether program offered them is the ability to really source clean energy solutions in the most profitable way for them and in a way that we structured it that benefits both those participating customers and non-participating customers to meet their needs. so let me stop there, julien. did i miss any aspect of it?
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
just the stand-alone piece, i mean, how incremental is that and what your view is here [phonetic]?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
the stand-alone storage as an investment opportunity?
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah, absolutely.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yeah, over time, julien, it could be very significant. in the short-term, is it imperative for renewables growth, in certain pockets, yes, broadly speaking, no, but as you start to see what we referenced today, trillions of dollars of renewables deployment over time, increasing storage deployment, both in the forms of batteries, as well as other forms of long-duration storage, which we believe includes hydrogen will become not only increasingly important, but a very large capital investment opportunity.
james l. robo -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, and just to add, julien, on to what rebecca said, i mean, desert peak, which we announced today, 400 megawatts, largest stand-alone project in the world. so we are actively seeking out stand-alone opportunities, and having the largest solar fleet in north america positions us for storage add-ons. so a tremendous amount of leverage off the existing operating fleet, and with new origination, i think of attach rates being roughly 60% on all the new stuff that we do.
and then one more comment on c&i, we are positioning the business to be the preferred strategic partner with c&i customers. and we are looking at the business in a holistic way, where we can provide clean energy solutions across the board, it's wind, it's solar, it's storage, it's hydrogen, it's mobility, the first student transaction that we just announced today, it's an energy management services capability, it's analytics. all the things we've done for decades, we can now offer to c&i customers and we've got a huge head start.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great, guys. thank you. pass it on.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
thanks, julien.

the next question is from shahriar pourreza from guggenheim partners. please go ahead.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
good morning, shahriar.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
just a couple of quick questions. on the rate case in particular, obviously, we have a march filing that's ahead of us and one of the sort of the big moving pieces is the rate base, it's 11% year-over-year growth for fpl, 24% for gulf. as we sort of think about like the cap structure improvement especially for gulf, the roe adder, the capital plan request, how do we sort of think about sort of the filings? is it kind of relates to your current growth guide, as it's effected well within your current trajectory, is like -- is the filing consistent with the top end and extensive runway, is it better? and more importantly, as we sort of think about you rolling forward the plan into '24, is that kind of a post-grc decision?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
so thanks, shahriar, i appreciate it. and obviously, we're at the early stages of the rate case proceeding having only filed the test year letter. so there is a lot of additional information that we will provide to the commission and stakeholders and obviously go through a robust process as we should, and as we look forward to do to go through the rate case process. from a nextera energy perspective, as you would expect and when we provide expectations, we do a variety of scenario planning analyses to feel comfortable with the expectations that we've laid out. so there is not one answer to what do you have in your assumptions that you've laid out for expectations. there is a range and we feel comfortable today as we've obviously reiterated those expectations for the 2021, 2022 and 2023 timeframes.
so we look forward to presenting our case to the commission and stakeholders. we feel very confident in the decisions that we've made in terms of where we've been investing, where we plan to invest, and obviously, the results into some measure obviously speak for themselves in terms of low bills, high reliability, terrific customer service and a clean energy profile that is substantial. and we're obviously looking forward to not only telling that story, but also the the gulf changes over the last couple of years that jim highlighted. so we'll have more as the process unfolds. and obviously when we have -- we finally have clarity on the rate case outcome or a potential settlement if we're so fortunate is to reach a constructive agreement with interveners, we'll provide some updates once we have that information.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
got it. and then just as we think about rolling the consolidated outlook into '21, is that a post-grc decision or settlement?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
so 2021 obviously assumes the current rate agreements, since both for fpl and gulf, they go through the '21 timeframe, and then '22 and '23, again, i'll put it in context a variety of scenarios that we assume for both fpl and energy resources to support the expectations that we've laid out.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
got it. and then just maybe a quick strategy question for jim. and, jim, obviously, with santee cooper in particular, the sales discussions have been steadily growing an interest in the legislator. what do you sort of think will be different in '21 either from the legislator side or the nee side, i.e., would you sort of anticipate making a substantially similar bid if the process comes up for sale? and then just on ferc transmission, obviously, you highlighted the gridliance acquisition last year, how do you sort of see that opportunity set on the ferc transmission side? how large do you want nextera transmission to be as part of the business mix? do you see any -- is there more to come there?
james l. robo -- chairman and chief executive officer
so, first of all, on santee cooper, well, there is an offer on the table and that offer remains on the table and as does our $25 million deposit, which the state still has. so it's, the offer is there, and we are ready to negotiate whenever the state is ready to get going. and so we stand ready and are hopeful that the legislature will move forward on that process, and we'll know more obviously over the next 90 days or so.
on nextera energy transmission, i think, rebecca, in her prepared remarks, had just a terrific year last year, their best year ever as a company. remember, we started that business from scratch, little over 10 years ago, and it's a business that made over $100 million of net income last year, and we think has the ability to grow mid-teens, double-digit over the next several years just organically with what they have in front of them without doing any other acquisitions.
and we are pursuing other acquisitions there because we think we had an enormous amount of value through our operating model, number one. and then number two, probably, the biggest inhibitor to renewables in this country is not consumer demand or it is not -- it is not interest on the part of the federal government or state governments to get renewables built, it's not that customers don't want it, it is fundamentally broken processes with the isos in terms of how they manage their queues and transmission and queue -- and just broadly, transmission planning in this country.
and i think with the biden administration and the new ferc, there is a new opportunity to fix that. and our transmission business i think is a great example of what ferc order 1000 can do when you get competition going in the transmission world. and it is also i think every bit of transmission, we've built in that business is incremental and helpful to the renewable business that we have and that it makes the delivery of lower cost renewables even more fast to come on to the grid than they otherwise would. so i'm very excited about transmission business. we're going to continue to push it, and i think it's got a lot of run rate to grow.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
terrific. thanks for that and congrats on the results.
operator
the next question is from michael lapides from goldman sachs. please go ahead.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you for taking my question. i actually have two. one is, you posted a great 2020 with eps growth north of 10%. just curious, do you think you could potentially come in above the high end of your range? so is kind of the 6% to 8% target a very modest target growth when you think about the next couple of years given the run rate you hit this past year?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
so, michael, i appreciate and i appreciate the optimism and the support that your question might -- that might suggest. we're really proud of the results for 2020. a couple of things to remind you, one, that does include some incremental contributions from gulf, and obviously, we expected gulf and the overall florida acquisitions and we expect some incremental benefit from that for 2021 as we highlighted in the -- when we laid out expectations initially.
and then as you also recall, we did raise our 2021 expectations late last year and then rebased our 6% to 8% off of that higher base. we're really excited about both the positioning of the regulated utilities, as well as energy resources going into 2021. we know what we need to accomplish and the teams are set out to go after and achieve those objectives. and, of course, we'll update you over time as we go through the year. but for today, we have reiterated those expectations of the $2.40 to $2.54 for 2021.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. and then a follow-up one and it's more of a policy one and i think it's more of a state policy one. there is still lots of coal generation in rate base in a lot of states, not all of which probably is economic, but the owners of that and clearly your florida utilities don't have exposure to this. the owners of that benefit from having it in rate base, how do you -- from an earnings perspective, how do you think that dichotomy, jim, gets resolved over time? and are there lessons that other states can learn from florida that might be able to test case [phonetic] in the pace of fleet transformation?
james l. robo -- chairman and chief executive officer
so, michael, i think you're being kind honestly to the regulated coal fleet in this country. there is not a regulated coal plant in this country that is economic today, full period and to stop when it's dispatched on a -- on any basis, not a single one, ok. and so why haven't it -- i think you've hit on the crux of -- on the crux of some of the issues. obviously, there have been in certain states a reluctance to let our utility customers retire the coal plant and then we'd be able to recover their investment, right.
and so, of course, if you run a utility, you don't want to retire an asset that you're going to then either have to write off or not -- not be able to earn on, right. i think one of the things that has been really constructive and very smart about the florida regulatory environment or the commission's view on modernizing the generation fleet is that they have -- we've spread that capital recovery over a period of five years or 10 years, and that has both i think moderated the impact to customer bills on the one hand and also on the other given us the right incentive to do the right thing by our customers and bring on lower cost generation.
so i think it's about the other piece, i think that's going to change is, there is no question this administration through the epa and other means is going to make the continued operation of coal plants very difficult in this country. so there is going to be i think more pressure, more federal pressure to accelerate that transition away from coal than there has been obviously over the last four years, where there has been in fact the opposite of federal pressure, but the complete lack of federal pressure to do anything about with your coal fleet. so i think the combination of that plus states becoming -- it becoming clearer and clearer the economics as we go along that the operating cost of coal plants are higher than the new-build costs of renewables with storage as that becomes even clearer as costs come down for renewables and costs continue to go up, for operating costs continue to go up for coal.
that's -- i mean, the bottom line in florida, we've shut our coal down and we've saved customers literally billions of dollars of present value over the expected life of the new generation that we put in place. so there is an enormous opportunity. there are several states in the country that are not taking advantage of that opportunity because of some of the regulatory approaches. and honestly, i think with the new administration, some of the policies there that's going to accelerate the replacement of coal in this country, and it should be because there is no -- it's costing customers money, leave aside the environmental benefits, just on pure economics, it's costing customers money every day and that's bad for the country and let alone that it's terrible for the climate, it's -- it is -- and for the environment, it is bad for customers because economics are -- the coal economics are so -- are so out of whack.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thank you, jim, much appreciated. and maybe one last one for rebecca. rebecca, you all raised your renewable growth targets materially, that implies higher capex, but obviously you get the benefit of the tax every year, so you all utilize convertible financing or equity units. should we assume that is part of your eps growth guidance that there is continued use of kind of new convertible units in the financing plan, and may be that level grows in scale with the change in the capex forecast?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
michael, i appreciate it. and i'll talk into a couple of comments that we've made in the past that i know you know. first, we keep all the tools and the toolkit, and we believe that at various times, various tools are more economic than others. but at the end of the day, our commitment to our balance sheet remains very strong and that we will finance it in a way that retains our strong balance sheet. one additional thing i'll remind you of that over time, it's certainly been very valuable to us not only in maintaining the balance in our business, which we've talked about frequently, but it's the recycling of capital as a source of proceeds to finance that new growth.
and as nep grows and our recycling of capital grows to nep, obviously, that's also a source of financing for the new investments that energy resources is making. if there's one thing that i know at the beginning of the year, we have a financing plan by the end of the year, it ends up being different than what we -- what we originally thought. but again that the most important thing to us is no matter what, we remain committed to that balance sheet and we will finance it in a way that makes sense and is ultimately profitable for our shareholders as well.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thank you, rebecca, and thank you, jim.

james l. robo -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, jessica, and good morning, everyone. 2020 was a terrific year for both nextera energy and nextera energy partners. nextera energy's performance was strong both financially and operationally. we had an -- we had outstanding execution on our initiatives to continue to drive future growth across the company. across all of our businesses, we successfully executed on the largest capital program in our history, deploying more than $14 billion in 2020 as we lead america's clean energy transformation. by successfully executing on our plans, nextera energy extended its long track record of delivering value for shareholders with adjusted earnings per share of $2.31, up 10.5% from 2019.
the key element of our value proposition at nextera energy is a culture focused on delivering outstanding results for our shareholders. over the past 10 years, we've delivered compound annual growth and adjusted eps of 8%, which is the highest among all top 10 power companies, who have achieved on average, compound annual growth of less than 3% over the same period. amid this significant growth, the company has maintained one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry. in 2020, we delivered a total shareholder return of approximately 30%, significantly outperforming both the s&p 500 and the s&p 500 utilities index and continuing to outperform both indices in terms of total shareholder return on a one-year, three-year, five-year, seven-year and 10-year basis.
over the past 15 years, we've outperformed all of the other companies in the s&p 500 utilities index and 86% of the companies in the s&p 500, while more than tripling the average total shareholder return of both indices. while we are proud of our long-term track record of creating shareholder value, we remain laser-focused on the future and on delivering our commitments. nextera energy remains well positioned to capitalize on the disruptive forces reshaping our industry, which have expanded and accelerated over the past two years even beyond what we had anticipated. the combination of low-cost renewables with low-cost storage in the form of batteries today and hydrogen in the longer-term has substantially increased the total addressable market for nextera energy. we now believe that a substantial and economic decarbonization of the electricity, transportation, and industrial sectors is possible, which represents the potential investment opportunity of trillions of dollars in the coming decades.
in the electricity sector, we expect that older and more inefficient generation will continue to be retired and replaced with cleaner and more affordable alternatives. in the transportation sector, we believe it will be increasingly economic to replace fossil fuel vehicles with vehicles powered by fuel cells and batteries charged with renewable energy. and in the industrial sector, grey hydrogen and other high-carbon feedstocks can be replaced with green hydrogen. we believe these trends have already been put into motion driven by economics. in addition, we believe it is possible that the biden administration supported by a significant shift in public support toward taking action to address climate change may act to further accelerate these shifts through the extension of existing incentives, as well as initiating other forms of policy support. importantly, we believe that no company is better equipped to take advantage of these substantial and long-term trends than nextera energy.
in fact, nextera energy is already a proof that you can be clean, low cost and financially successful all at the same time. we are at the vanguard of building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable, and we are driving hard to continue to be at the forefront of the disruption that is occurring within the energy sector and broader parts of the u.s. economy. we expect that the execution of our strategy will drive meaningful co2 emissions reductions across the country and will help advance nextera energy toward its goal of reducing its co2 emissions rate by 67% by 2025 from a 2005 baseline, while simultaneously lowering generation costs for customers and maintaining best-in-class reliability.
we expect the disruptive nature of renewables to be terrific for customers, terrific for the environment and terrific for shareholders by helping to drive tremendous growth for this company over the next decade and beyond. fpl is already capitalizing on the disruption in our sector with continued focus on its grid and fleet modernization efforts. during 2020, fpl successfully executed on its strategic initiatives, including placing more than 1,100 megawatts of cost-effective solar in service on time and on budget and support of its ongoing capital plan. this solar expansion is part of fpl's solartogether community solar program and its groundbreaking ""30-by-30"" plan, which is one of the world's largest solar expansions and was -- and would result in roughly 10,000 megawatts of total solar capacity on fpl's system by 2030.
additionally, the 409-megawatt manatee energy storage center, which will be the world's largest integrated solar-powered battery system is on track and on budget to be placed in service later this year as part of the approximately $1 billion that nextera energy is investing in battery storage projects in 2021. smart capital investments such as these help fpl improve its already best-in-class customer value proposition, while also maintaining an emissions profile that is among the cleanest in the nation. fpl also had continued success with its cost-saving initiatives making even further reductions to its already best-in-class dollar per retail-megawatt-hour non-fuel o&m costs from 2019 to 2020. through our unrelenting focus on cost savings and on making disciplined long-term investments for the benefit of our customers, fpl has been able to maintain typical customer bills that are the lowest in the nation when compared to the 20 largest investor-owned utilities in the country.
in addition to low bills, fpl has continued to provide reliability that is by far the best in the state of florida, achieving its best-ever reliability rate in 2020. fpl's investments to build a stronger, smarter energy grid have resulted in best-in-state reliability for the last 14 years in a row, as well as earning numerous national awards. in 2020, fpl was recognized for the fifth time in six years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation.
let me now turn to gulf power. in the two years that has been part of the nextera energy family, gulf power has realized an approximately 30% reduction in o&m costs, a 50% improvement in service reliability, a 93% improvement in safety, and a nearly 20% reduction in co2 emissions. gulf power has grown regulatory capital employed at a 17% compound annual growth rate since 2018, and we are well on our way to achieving the objectives we laid out at our investor conference in 2019. in addition to the excellent operational execution that we delivered in 2020, we continue to progress our smart capital investment program that is expected to generate further customer benefits over the coming years. in the fourth quarter, we completed the plant crist coal-to-natural gas conversion. as a result, consistent with our commitment to remain a clean energy leader, we were able to complete the accelerated shutdown of the coal units at plant crist, which has now been renamed the gulf clean energy center.
with the retirement of fpl's indiantown cogeneration facility also occurring late last year, 2021 is the first time in nearly 70 years that there are no coal-fired power plants in florida for either fpl or gulf power. earlier this month, fpl filed a test year letter with the florida public service commission to initiate a rate proceeding for new rates beginning in january 2022. the four-year plan that we intend to propose are designed to provide continued longer-term cost certainty for customers, while allowing fpl to continue investing in clean energy storm-hardened infrastructure and other innovative technologies that are the foundation of our communities. the stability of multi-year rate plans allows fpl to focus on efficiency in the business, which is critical to keeping customer bills low, while at the same time enabling fpl to maintain strong credit ratings and balance sheet, which allows for consistent access to the capital markets. we look forward to the opportunity to showcase our long-term track record of providing low bills, high reliability, and clean energy for floridians and plans -- in our plans to build an even more resilient and sustainable energy future for florida in the coming years.
turning to energy resources, in 2020, we continue to advance our position as the leading developer and operator of wind, solar, and battery storage projects commissioning approximately 5,750 megawatts of new projects, more than doubling the amount of total renewables commission versus the previous year. this was also a record year for renewables origination in energy resources, with the team adding a net nearly 7,000 megawatts to our backlog during the year.
as a result of the team's origination success and alongside the backdrop of the terrific market outlook i just outlined at the beginning of my remarks, we now expect to construct approximately 23 gigawatts to 30 gigawatts of new renewables in the 2021 to 2024 timeframe, which if we are successful at the midpoint would mean adding a portfolio of generation projects that is approximately one and a half times the size of energy resources' entire operating renewables portfolio as of year-end 2019. energy resources' execution success is reflective of our ability to leverage our significant competitive advantages, including our best-in-class development skills, large pipeline of sites and interconnection queue positions, strong customer relationships, purchasing power, best-in-class construction expertise, resource assessment capabilities, cost of capital advantages, and world-class operations capability to capitalize on the ongoing energy transition that is occurring in the nation's generation fleet.
we believe that we are in a terrific position to be able to capture a significant share of the market opportunities going forward, and what we continue to believe is the best renewables development environment we have ever seen. along with the broader public shift toward calls for action to fight climate change, over the past few years, there has been an increased focus on environmental, social and governance or esg on the part of many of our stakeholders. while we expect this trend to amplify demand among our traditional customers in our -- and in our core renewables business, we also believe that is opening up significant new markets and business opportunities for energy resources. we anticiplate -- we anticipate our development program to be further enhanced by an ability to attract new non-traditional customers, particularly in the commercial and industrial sector, as improving renewable economics are increasingly aligned with corporate objectives to procure energy from clean generation sources.
in summary, i continue to remain as enthusiastic as ever about nextera energy's long-term growth prospects. in 2020, we extended our long track record of executing for the benefit of customers and shareholders and further developed our best-in-class organic growth prospects. based on the strength and resiliency of our underlying businesses, i will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 2021, 2022, and 2023, while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings. we remain intensely focused on execution and continuing to drive shareholder value over the coming years.
let me now turn to nextera energy partners, which delivered a total unit return -- unitholder return of approximately 32% in 2020, further advancing its history of value creation since the ipo. nextera energy partners is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the disruptive factors reshaping the energy industry and benefit from the enormous market opportunity in the coming decades for renewables. nextera energy partners also had a terrific year of execution in 2020 and continue to deliver on its commitments. that history of execution is supported by nextera energy partners' outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets, which was further diversified in 2020. during the year, nextera energy partners acquired [phonetic] interests in approximately 1,100 megawatts of high-quality renewable energy assets, including the partnership's first battery storage project from energy resources.
additionally, during the year, nextera energy partners successfully completed its first three organic growth prospects, including the repowering of 275 megawatts of wind projects. for 2020, nextera energy partners grew its lp distributions by 15% year-over-year and delivered 40% year-over-year cash available for distribution growth, highlighting the strength of its operating portfolio. with this strong year-over-year growth in cash available for distribution, nextera energy partners achieved its distribution growth objectives, while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the high 60% range as of year-end 2020.
in the fourth quarter, we published our first nextera energy partners' esg report, highlighting its high-quality clean energy portfolio, visible opportunities for renewables growth, and ability to leverage the operational expertise of nextera energy resources. the continued origination success at energy resources is expected to benefit nextera energy partners in meeting its future growth objectives. i continue to believe that the combination of nextera energy partners' clean energy portfolio, growth visibility and flexibility to finance that growth offers lp unitholders a uniquely attractive investor value proposition. as with nextera energy, we remain intensely focused on continuing to execute and deliver that unitholder value over the coming years.
finally, i would like to take a moment to thank all of nextera energy's employees for their continued dedication, hard work and focus during the extraordinary circumstances of the past year. despite the significant disruption caused by the pandemic and in the midst of the most active hurricane season in the atlantic basin on record, our employees' unwavering focus on our customers is -- is what enabled yet another year of flawless execution in the business, while also delivering our best-ever safety results across the company. it is because of their commitment to excellence that we were able to deliver above and beyond our commitments in 2020 and why i remain as confident as ever in our ability to deliver on all our expectations moving forward.
with that, i'll now turn the call over to rebecca, who will review the 2020 results in more detail.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
thank you, jim, and good morning, everyone. let's now turn to the detailed results beginning with fpl. for the fourth quarter of 2020, fpl reported net income of $502 million or $0.25 per share, up $0.05 per share year-over-year. for the full-year 2020, fpl reported net income of $2.65 billion or $1.35 per share, an increase of $0.15 per share versus 2019. regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11% for 2020 and was the principal driver of fpl's net income growth of more than 13% for the year. fpl's capital expenditures were approximately $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full-year capital investments to a total of roughly $6.7 billion. fpl's reported roe for regulatory purposes was 11.6% for the 12 months ended december 31st 2020, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement.
during the fourth quarter, we utilized approximately $100 million of reserve amortization, leaving fpl with a year-end 2020 balance of $894 million. approximately, $206 million of reserve amortization was used to offset the restoration costs associated with hurricanes, isaias and tropical storm eta, which fpl elected not to recover from customers through a surcharge. fpl's reserve amortization mechanism under its current settlement agreement combined with our aggressive cost-cutting measures and the benefits of tax reform has provided significant customer benefits, including avoided surcharges for approximately $1.7 billion in storm restoration costs since 2017.
our overall capital program at fpl is progressing well. we continue to advance one of the nation's largest ever solar expansions. during the year, the florida public service commission approved fpl's solartogether program, which is the nation's largest community solar program that is expected to generate $249 million in total net cost savings for participating and non-participating customers over the program's life. after commissioning over 1,100 megawatts or more than three and a half times the amount of solar capacity in 2020 versus the prior year, fpl expects to commission roughly 670 megawatts of additional solartogether capacity in 2021, and the customer demand for this innovative program across all customer classes remain strong.
beyond solar, construction at the highly efficient roughly 1,200-megawatt dania beach clean energy center remains on schedule and on budget, as it continues to advance toward its projected commercial operations date in 2022. it should be noted that all of these significant accomplishments, including the deployment of nearly $7 billion in capital, we're in the midst of not only a global pandemic, but also during the most active hurricane season in the atlantic basin on record. we've delivered our best-ever reliability results when our customers needed us the most. and we remain committed to supporting customers experiencing economic hardship as a result of the challenges caused by the pandemic. to-date, fpl has provided customers with approximately $75 million in relief through various programs and initiatives. as florida recovers, we will continue to help our customers navigate this difficult time, while maintaining our best-in-class customer value proposition.
let me now turn to gulf power, which as a reminder was legally merged into fpl on january 1st 2021, but will continue to be reported as a separate regulated segment during 2021. gulf power reported fourth quarter 2020 gaap earnings of $53 million or $0.03 per share, up $0.02 per share year-over-year. for the full-year, gulf power reported net income of $238 million or $0.12 per share, an increase of $0.02 per share year-over-year on an adjusted basis. base o&m reductions were the primary driver of gulf power's 19% year-over-year growth in adjusted earnings.
gulf power's reported roe for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 11.1% for the 12 months ending december 2020, which is near the upper end of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25% under its current rate agreement. for the full -- for the full-year 2021, we expect that regulatory roe to be in the upper half of this allowed band assuming normal weather and operating conditions. all of our major capital initiatives at gulf power are progressing well. gulf power's first solar development project, the roughly 75-megawatt blue indigo solar energy center went into service in 2020 and is expected to generate significant customer savings over its lifetime.
gulf power anticipates bringing another 150 megawatts of cost-effective zero emission solar capacity online later this year. the north florida resiliency connection, which among other things will allow customers to benefit from greater diversity in solar output across two different time zones, is expected to be in service in mid-2022. continued smart capital investments such as these renewables and core infrastructure are expected to drive customer benefits for many years to come. the florida economy continues to recover from the ongoing impacts of the covid-19 pandemic. a number of current economic indicators, including retail taxable sales, new building permits and consumer confidence have meaningfully improved since the start of the pandemic in early 2020.
additionally, florida's most recent seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 6.4% is below the national average. while it is unclear at this point how the economy will be impacted by the current wave of covid-19 cases, we continue to believe that florida offers a unique proposition in terms of housing affordability, great weather, low taxes and a pro-business economy, all of which should support ongoing fpl customer growth and economic rebound once the worst of the pandemic is behind us. we remain deeply engaged in helping florida return from this stronger than ever, and we will continue to do our part to support that outcome, including pursuing our smart capital investment program and economic development efforts, which help create jobs, provide investment in local communities and further enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition.
during the quarter, fpl's average customer growth was strong, increasing by nearly 76,000 from the comparable prior year quarter. fpl's fourth quarter retail sales were up 0.9% versus the prior year period, largely driven by a 2.3% year-over-year growth and underlying usage per customer. for 2020, fpl's retail sales increased 1.5% versus the prior year, driven primarily by ongoing strong growth in customers and a favorable weather comparison. on a weather-normalized basis, fpl's retail sales increased by 0.7% for the full-year 2020. the overall impacts of the pandemic on last year's retail sales were relatively muted and fpl's underlying usage per customer was flat year-over-year.
for gulf power, the average number of customers increased approximately 0.9% versus the comparable prior year quarter. for 2020, gulf power's retail sales declined 3.3%, primarily as a result of a more favorable weather in the prior year, as well as lower usage per customer, which we attribute in part to the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on our commercial and industrial customers. as jim mentioned, fpl is preparing to file a base rate adjustment proposal that would cover the next four years, 2022 through 2025 and provide customers longer-term visibility to the future cost of electricity. while the details are still being finalized, we expect the proposal to include base rate adjustments of approximately $1.1 billion, starting in january of 2022, and $615 million, starting in january of 2023.
we also expect the proposal to request support for continued deployment of cost-effective solar with the continuation of our solar base rate adjustment or sobra mechanism to recover the revenue requirements associated with up to 900 megawatts of cost-effective solar projects in each of 2024 and 2025, which we currently estimate to be approximately $140 million each year. for the period 2019 through the end of 2022, fpl is planning to have invested approximately $29 billion with additional significant investments expected in 2023 and beyond to meet the growing needs of florida's economy and to continue delivering outstanding value for florida customers by keeping reliability high and fuel and other costs low. while the benefits of building a stronger, smarter and cleaner grid, more efficient generation fleet are passed along regularly to customers through higher service reliability and lower bills. we must periodically seek recovery for these long-term investments supported by base rates. as we've previously indicated, we plan to request the commission authorized unified rates and capital structure for both fpl and gulf power customers. we believe the combination of the two businesses will result in approximately $2.8 billion of savings for customers through both operational savings and overall system benefits. fpl expects to request an 11.5% roe inclusive of a 50 basis point incentive for superior performance. compared with peer utilities in the southeastern u.s., fpl has the most efficient -- most cost-efficient operations, the highest reliability, the lowest customer bills, all while remaining one of the cleanest utilities in the country and is widely regarded as the top overall performer in the industry, bringing exceptional value to customers.
we believe that the performance adder would reflect fpl's current superior value proposition and encourage strong -- a continued strong performance. in addition, we continue to believe that a strong balance sheet, including strong credit ratings remains critical to ensure fpl maintains uninterrupted access to the capital markets, even in times of significant market disruption in the aftermath of hurricanes, as well as to attract capital to support the investments fpl is making to further improve the value we offer customers. the total of these base rate increase requests over the four-year period from 2022 to 2025 would result in an estimated average increase in total revenues of about 3.7% per year. today, fpl's typical residential bill is about 30% lower than the national average.
if the full amount of the requests were granted under our proposal and assuming other utilities experienced bill increases only at their historical rate of increase, fpl's typical customer bills would remain significantly lower than the national average through 2025. to put this proposal in context, the proposal would result in a typical customer bill in january 2022, that is nearly 22% less than it was in real terms 15 years ago, even with our proposed base rate increases. even in nominal terms, fpl bills would be only about 3.5% higher in 2022 than in 2006, a fraction of the nominal increases of 25% to 75% in the cost of groceries, medical care, health insurance, and housing over the past 15 years.
moreover, through the consolidation of fpl and gulf power, the typical 1,000-kilowatt hour residential customer bill in northwest florida is projected to be lower in 2025 than it was in 2019. we look forward to the opportunity to present the details of our case and expect to make our formal filing with testimony and required detailed data in march. the timing for the proceeding will ultimately be determined by the commission, but we currently expect that we will have hearings in the third quarter and a final commission decision in the fourth quarter in time for new rates to go into effect in january of 2022.
as always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement. during the course of the past 22 years, fpl has entered into six multi-year settlement agreements that have provided customers with a high degree of rate stability and certainty and helped fpl execute to deliver its best-in-class customer value proposition. our core focus will be to pursue a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers, and we will continue to provide updates throughout the process.
energy resources reported fourth quarter 2020 gaap loss of $644 million or $0.33 per share. adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $342 million or $0.17 per share. energy resources' contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter is flat versus the prior year comparable period, as favorable results from the continued growth and performance in our renewables portfolio were roughly offset by a number of items, none of which are particularly noteworthy. for the full-year, energy resources reported gaap earnings of $531 million or $0.27 per share, and adjusted earnings of $1.95 billion or $0.99 per share. energy resources' full-year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.12 or approximately 14% versus 2019. for the full-year, growth was driven by continued new additions to our renewables portfolio, as contributions from new investments increased by $0.07 per share. contributions from existing generation assets increased $0.03 versus 2019 due primarily to increased production tax credit volume from our repowered wind projects and an improvement in wind resource, which were partially offset by the planned nuclear outages and retirement of our duane arnold nuclear facility.
also contributing favorably was nextera energy transmission, which increased results by $0.02 year-over-year, primarily as a result of full-year contributions from trans bay cable acquisition closed -- that closed in the middle of 2019. contributions from all other impacts were flat year-over-year. amid the disruption of the pandemic, energy resources had one of its best years ever, including successfully executing on the largest construction program in our history, as well as delivering our best year ever for origination, adding a net nearly 7,000 megawatts of new renewables projects to our backlog. in 2020, we commissioned approximately 5,750 megawatts of wind, solar and storage projects on schedule and on budget.
in addition, since the last call, we have added approximately 2,000 megawatts of renewables projects to our backlog, including approximately 1,030 megawatts of new wind and wind repowerings, 670 megawatts of solar and 300 megawatts of battery storage, including 75 additional megawatts of capacity on desert peak storage, which is now expected to total 400 megawatts and remains the world's largest stand-alone storage project. following the terrific origination year in 2020, our renewables backlog now stands at approximately 13,500 megawatts.
despite a record year of megawatts placed in service, energy resources grew its year-end backlog by approximately 1,500 megawatts year-over-year, providing terrific visibility to the strong growth that lies ahead. since 2017, our backlog additions have grown at a roughly 25% compound annual growth rate. as a result of our tremendous progress in 2020 and our strong continued origination success, we are raising our 2021 to 2022 renewables development expectations to a range of 10,525 megawatts to 12,700 megawatts, which at the midpoint is approximately 3,500 megawatts above our previous expectations.
our expectations for 2021 and 2022 are now up more than 50% at the midpoint relative to the expectations that we laid out at the 2019 investor conference, reflecting the significant acceleration of renewables activity over the past year and a half. we're also introducing our 2023 to 2024 renewables development expectations of 12,150 megawatts to 17,300 megawatts. this is by far the largest expected two-year development program in our history and reflects our high level of confidence in energy resources' ongoing leadership position in renewable energy development. the accompanying slide provides some additional details. as we've previously discussed, we are optimistic about the expanded investment opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the u.s. economy presents for energy resources, and we are pursuing a number of pilot projects to rapidly develop our capabilities across this potential investment opportunity set.
today, we are announcing a new innovative green hydrogen project at energy resources, that includes a 12-megawatt solar array, onsite hydrogen production and storage and a hydrogen fuel cell. this emissions-free project will utilize solar energy to create green hydrogen to power the fuel cell, which will be able to provide electricity to the local grid during periods of peak demand. subject to final terms and regulatory approvals, this approximately $20 million innovative green hydrogen project is expected to begin construction in 2022 with commercial operations in mid-2023.
energy resources is also in advanced discussions with a number of potential customers across the industrial landscape, including food processing, specialty chemicals and refineries to continue to develop clean energy solutions for a more efficient green production processes. one potential project includes a solar tracker combined with an electrolyzer at a large industrial plant. the project would deliver green hydrogen as an industrial feedstock for the facility and we're not producing hydrogen, the solar power would offset a portion of the plant's energy consumption further decarbonizing the facility's operations.
in addition, today, energy resources announced a planned partnership to preserve -- pursue large school bus fleet conversions to electric and hydrogen with the nation's largest school bus owner and operator and transportation services provider. with its partner. energy resources anticipates investing in bus electrification upgrades and charging stations, as well as providing energy management services. this transaction is consistent with our toe in the water approach, as we explore potential opportunities in the electrification of the transportation sector. we're excited about all of these opportunities, as well as the previously announced hydrogen pilot project, we plan to propose that fpl's okeechobee clean energy center, which highlight the significant opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the u.s. economy presents. consistent with our long-term track record, nextera energy will remain disciplined as we take steps to be at the forefront of these developing markets while taking a leadership role in the clean energy transition. beyond renewables and storage, since the last earnings call, mountain valley pipeline made progress with its outstanding permitting issues, including receiving the bureau of land management right-of-way grants, which authorizes mvp to cross the jefferson national forest once the stream and wetland permitting is complete. while the fourth circuit denied the stay request on mvp's new biological opinion, the court did grant a stay on the nationwide 12 permit, and the project is now pursuing an alternate path forward to permit and complete stream and wetland crossings.
due these -- due to these continued legal and regulatory issues, as well as the substantial delays in commercial operation and increased -- increased costs associated with those delays, the carrying value for our investment in mvp now exceeds its fair market value, and as a result, we have reflected a 1 to [phonetic] -- $1.2 billion after-tax impairment in our gaap financial statements, which we have excluded from adjusted earnings. while we are disappointed with the extended development and construction timeline due to the legal challenges that the project has faced, we intend to continue pursuing completing the project with our partners.
finally, during 2020, nextera energy transmission furthered its efforts to grow america's leading competitive transmission company and had its best year ever. during the year, the business delivered record earnings contribution and realized constructive rate case outcomes at trans bay cable and lone star transmission, as well as entered into an agreement to acquire gridliance, which owns three ferc-regulated transmission utilities spanning six states. we continue to expect to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and close on the gridliance acquisition in the first half of this year.
turning now to the consolidated results for nextera energy. for the fourth quarter of 2020, gaap net losses attributable to nextera energy were $5 million or $0.00 per share. nextera energy's 2020 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted eps were $785 million or $0.40 per share respectively. for the full-year 2020, gaap net income attributable to nextera energy was $2.92 billion or $1.48 per share. adjusted earnings were $4.55 billion or $2.31 per share. as a reminder, all of our financial results have been adjusted to account four-for-one stock split which became effective in the fourth quarter.
for the corporate and other segment, adjusted earnings for the full-year decreased $0.07 per share compared to the 2019 prior comparable period, primarily as a result of higher interest in refinancing costs associated with certain liability management initiatives completed during the fourth quarter to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. in total for nextera energy, our refinancing activities reduced nominal adjusted net income by roughly $103 million during the fourth quarter, inclusive of approximately $39 million associated with energy resources' share of refinancing cost at nextera energy partners. we expect these initiatives to translate into favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders.
long-term financial expectations, which we increased and extended late last year through 2023 remain unchanged. for 2021, nextera energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.54. for 2022 and 2023, nextera energy expects to grow 6% to 8% of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share, and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges. from 2018 to 2023, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate range. we also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at a roughly 10% per year rate through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. as always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions.
let me now turn to nextera energy partners, which also had a strong year of operational and financial performance in 2020. fourth quarter adjusted ebitda was $308 million, and cash available for distribution was $106 million, an increase of 10% and 8% from the prior year period respectively. ebitda growth was driven primarily by favorable resource across the portfolio and the full contributions from new projects acquired in late 2019, and it was slightly offset by a planned outage at our genesis project late in the fourth quarter.
for the full-year 2020, adjusted ebitda was $1.263 billion, up 14% year-over-year. cash available for distribution was $570 million, an increase of 40% from the prior year. similar to the quarterly results, full-year growth in adjusted ebitda was primarily driven by full-year contributions from acquisitions in the prior year and favorable wind resource. for the full-year, wind resource was 100% of the long-term average versus 97% in 2019. the benefit to cash available for distribution from lower project-level debt service was partially offset by higher corporate level interest expense.
as a reminder, these results include the impact of idr fees, which we treat as an operating expense. additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. yesterday, the nextera energy partners board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.615 per common unit or $2.46 per unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2020. during 2020, nextera energy partners executed several financing to support its ongoing growth investments and optimized its capital structure for the benefit of lp unitholders. as jim mentioned, during the quarter, we closed on an acquisition from energy resources of interest in an approximately 1,100-megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted renewables projects. as part of this transaction, nextera energy partners raised a 10-year, approximately $1.1 billion convertible equity portfolio financing, that includes the acquired assets, plus four existing nextera energy partners' wind and solar projects.
combining this acquisition with the recapitalization of four existing nextera energy partners' assets through the longest dated and lowest cost convertible equity portfolio financing in the partnership's history is expected to provide significant benefits for unitholders. by leveraging the strong demand for high-quality clean energy assets, nextera energy partners was able to secure financing for both the current transaction and future growth, while enhancing returns for lp unitholders and limiting downside risk. nextera energy partners expects to further strengthen its balance sheet and have access to approximately 24 -- $2.4 billion in available financing capacity, including capacity under its corporate revolving credit facility and commitments from investors to potential future convertible equity portfolio financings, which further supports the partnership's long-term growth.
during the second half of the year, nextera energy partners completed the successful conversion of approximately $300 million of convertible debt, and the remaining balance of the convertible preferred securities that were issued in 2017 into approximately 5.7 million units and 4.7 million units, common units respectively. these conversions help nextera energy partners achieve its goal of using low-cost financing products to efficiently issue equity over time. finally, nextera energy partners raised approximately $600 million in new 0% coupon convertible notes during the quarter and used the net proceeds from this offering to redeem a portion of its outstanding 4.25% senior notes due in 2024.
coincident with the issuance of the convertible notes, nextera energy partners entered into a capped call structure, that will result in nextera energy partners retaining up to 90% of the upside in its unit price associated with the convertible notes over the next five years. nextera energy partners' run rate expectations for adjusted ebitda and cafd at december 31st 2021 remain unchanged. year-end 2021 run rate adjusted ebitda expectations are $1.44 billion to $1.62 billion, and cafd in the range of $600 million to $680 million. as a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated idr fees, as we treat these as an operating expense. from an updated base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in lp distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in february of 2022 to be in a range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit.
in summary, we continue to believe that both nextera energy and nextera energy partners have excellent prospects for growth both in the near and longer-term. fpl, energy resources and nextera energy partners each have outstanding set of opportunities across the board. the progress we made in 2020 reinforces our longer-term growth prospects. and while we have a lot to execute on in 2021, we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year. that concludes our prepared remarks.
and with that, we'll open up the line for your questions.

thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] today's first question comes from shar pourreza with guggenheim partners. please go ahead.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
good morning.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
so just a couple of questions here. first, just on transmission opportunities and you obviously closed gridliance this quarter and there has been some proposals across the us, including california for transmission expansions, can we maybe get a little bit of a refreshed view on your transmission growth strategy and kind of geographies where you may seek to expand? do you guys see more opportunities for acquisitions perhaps from other pt [phonetic] type owners?
and just as a follow-up here. any thoughts on sort of the new ferc administration, recent language could hinder i think future transmission investment with potentially lower roe's -- removal of some of the roe adders, so just some thoughts there.

perfect. thanks, shar. and i appreciate all answers to the question, but i think it's multiple questions in there. so i'll start and obviously, john can -- just john or jim can jump in if they want to add something. we are very excited about opportunities in transmission and it is founded on a couple of points that i highlighted in the script. first is, we couldn't be more excited as you well know about the renewables opportunities across the us in the coming decades. a key part of all of those opportunities or at least a lot of those opportunities in the latter part of this decade going into the 2030s and beyond is some level of build-out of transmission in the us beyond what's been accomplished. so both to enable long-term renewables development but also to capitalize on those opportunities leaves us very interested in transmission.
the energy resources team has done a terrific job growing that business both through organic opportunities, so long-term development efforts of identifying opportunities, participating in processes, and ultimately securing opportunities to invest and build and bring successfully into line -- into operation some of those lines, as well as through acquisitions. obviously with gridliance being the most recent and trans bay cable not being too much far behind it. i expect that we'll grow the business through both going forward as well, continued efforts on the development side as well as participating in opportunities to acquire investments as they come to market.
on the ferc transmission side, we do think there are lots of opportunities to improve how transmission is cited and built across the us, and we're optimistic that this administration in this ferc will start to focus on those and i think it's both through ferc as well as a potential focus on transmission in this infrastructure package. so a lot of opportunities to invest in the future.
john w. ketchum -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. the only thing that i would add to what rebecca said there is, we love gridliance. think of our transmission presence as a donut. we had a hole in the middle. this gets us in the spp and miso, we're now a member as a to [phonetic], important for cow-iso [phonetic] as well. it's strategic, it's going to help enable a lot of new renewables development for us, so it lines up really well with where we see renewable growth opportunities going forward.
and even with the news coming out of ferc on the roe and we'll see what they ultimately do. don't forget that we've been able to enter in the long-term settlements at trans bay and on lonestar as well, and so our business is really unimpacted.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
got it. perfect. thank you. and then just on the rate case and, obviously, it's starting to pick up steam, intervene is turning together, are you seeing any early indications for what's sort of the topics that may be debated? i mean obviously, affordability is the obvious one, cross-subsidization between the two merged utilities that could be another roes. so just maybe -- just thinking about the bid-ask there. and at this juncture, do you sort of feel there is a settlement path or does this case kind of need to be more litigated just given the complexities of merging two utilities?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
thanks, shar. i think it's really early to comment on the rate case. we've just filed -- i think, you've heard us comment a couple of times that these are u-haul trucks worth of filing requirements that we produce and supply to staff in the interveners and the commission itself to start the process. so we're very early. and no doubt, they -- all of the key stakeholders are trying to review that information and then we'll see the process unfold really over quite a number of months, accomodating with the hearings in august.
we are very proud, as i highlighted in the comments, both here and in other venues. we're really proud of the case that the fpl team has put together, not just the case itself, but it's built on a foundation of execution, not just over the last five years during which we've operated under the settlement agreement, but of course, years and years before that. so we look forward to the opportunity to articulating that through this process.
as it relates to settlements, as you know, here in florida there is a great history of settlement agreements, not just with florida power & light company, but other utilities in the state. we do think that opportunities to have a negotiated outcome that meets the needs of all stakeholders, and historically, that has produced consistent rates for many years in the future that provides tremendous value for customers. there is a great history of that. we of course will be open to it, but it's very early in this process, and again, we look forward to being able to put forward our case.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
perfect. and then just lastly from me on santee cooper. i mean, obviously, the -- now the discussions are picking up steam at the legislator. anything we should be kind of watching for in the near term on the legislature side and your bids out there? so do you see any kind of changes with your offer or are you just kind of just standing firm at this point?
james l. robo -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. it's jim. obviously, you saw that the standard asked for folks to reexpress an interest. i send a letter last week reexpressing our interest. we've been pretty clear that we remain interested. we have a very strong bid out there. obviously, things have changed in the last year with santee cooper, rate base is different, their volumes are different, etc, etc. so -- but fundamentally our bid stands and we're ready to get going and negotiating with the state on the sale and ultimately, the most important thing is, it remains very clear to me that the best route for the state and its customers and the economy of the state is to demunicipalize santee cooper and get it in the hands of an entity like ourselves that will run it in the best-in-class way. and there is enormous value i think to bring to the state through our ability to bring to decarbonize, our ability to have low bills over a long period of time, and our ability to really operate efficiently -- operate efficiently and bring great reliability to bear one of the -- i think you've seen the progress we've made at gulf, and i think that's a great example of the kind of progress that we'd be able to make at santee cooper as well.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
terrific. thank you guys for everything and good execution.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer

and our next question today comes from steve fleishman with wolfe research. please go ahead.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, good morning.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
good morning, steve.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
rebecca, can you hear me ok?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
we can hear you just fine.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. so just curious, first on the nep acquisition, as you mentioned, for the most part historically you haven't been able to make returns work on third-party acquisitions, so could you maybe talk about the returns you expect on this transaction? and is this a suggestion that you're more optimistic that there'll be more third-party acquisitions that meet your return hurdles?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
yeah. steve, we're really excited about the acquisition. and as we highlighted, both in terms of the financial characteristics of it. one of the things that was particularly attractive about this portfolio when we looked at it is our team's ability to add value on the operation and maintenance cost side, really think about it as we bring assets into the portfolio. it really gets leveraged on the platform that we already operate. and so the team is really excited about how we can add incremental value through the energy resources management of these assets at nextera energy partners.
we've been very excited about nextera energy partners' growth outlook for quite some time. as we've always indicated, it's well-founded -- our excitement is well-founded, just simply looking at the backlog of both operating and signed contracts, and then the potential for new contracts in energy resources. but i have always alluded to the fact that really our market opportunity is this broader market set and we'll continue to engage and look for opportunities. i do think there are more opportunities out there, third-party acquisitions on the renewable side. it's an area of focus for us to continue to participate in, but we've got the three ways to grow and to the extent that we can put opportunities to gather great and we'll take advantage of them over time, but we also continue to have terrific organic opportunities in nep, particularly as the portfolio grows, and then of course, the continued success of energy resources in the broader market is very positive.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. and just any sense on the returns you expect on this acquisition?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
sure. we've already highlighted the -- in terms of the cafd produced for the assets is $60 million-plus relative to the acquisition price that we highlighted, obviously, that's subject to closing adjustments. so that's at the project level and then we'll optimize the financing over time, particularly as we think about the rest of the growth expectations for 2021 and to 2022.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. and then just maybe a little bit more color on the biden infrastructure and tax plan. just, i guess, maybe obviously, you made it clear that the infrastructure side would be beneficial to your business, i think. how about -- how are you thinking on the tax side? and are there any risk to you from that either just the higher rate or the minimum book-tax issue? thanks.
james l. robo -- chairman and chief executive officer
steve, it's jim. obviously, there was a lot -- there was a lot to unpack in the plan. it's very early in the process. i think this is a process that's going to play out over months, not weeks. there is obviously a lot in the plan. it's very positive from a renewable standpoint. and as rebecca said in the prepared remarks, we are excited to work with the administration on the plan that i think is really going to accelerate the decarbonization of the us economy over the next several years. in a way that is we've always said for a long time, it's going to be essentially free to customers, i,e. not more expensive for customers, right? i mean, the thing about the green economy is that, it's cleaner, it's greener, but it's also cheaper and that is why it's so powerful.
so, a lot of details, obviously, still to be worked out. we are working them. as you can imagine, it's very early, and probably too early for me to comment on any of the specific details that we feel like need some work versus the ones that we like a lot. on the tax front, i think, obviously, that's -- there are a lot of puts and takes with taxes, particularly in a company that has both utility assets as well as renewable assets and we're working through it. think about the tax rate being -- tax rate going up something in the $0.04 to $0.07 of headwind. i'm not particularly worried about that in the context of all the other things that would be positive for our company if the infrastructure bill gets passed. and so we continue to work obviously that as well and lots of details still to be laid out on the minimum tax issue and that also matters as to what the final corporate rate ends up being.
and i guess the last thing i would say is, none of this is going to be easy to get done. it's very narrow margins in both the senate and the house, and folks tend to focus on the senate in extraordinarily narrow margin given kind of vacancies in the house right now as well. and there is the history on mid-term elections suggests that it's always an uphill battle for the current administration in mid-term for whatever parties in power in the mid-term elections of presidency. so that on the one hand, i think put some urgency, i think, around the administration's push to get something done this year, but the flip side is, it also there is a lot of risk from moderate democrats to take a vote on some of these issues.
so it's going to be very -- any change will be very hard. and i think we were very much a part of -- we've always been very active in terms of what happens around clean energy policy in washington. and you can imagine that we're remaining very active on that front and working it very hard. but i would just say in closing that we are very much encouraged by the focus of the administration on decarbonizing the economy. we feel like it's absolutely the right thing to do, right thing for the planet, and the right thing for customers, and the right thing for the country, and we stand ready to support an infrastructure plan that accelerates that decarbonization. and i think any acceleration of what's already going on, just because of the amazing economics that renewables have relative to the other alternatives plus what's going on with hydrogen and you saw there was a ptc -- hydrogen ptc as part of the -- suggested as part of the infrastructure plan. so there's a lot of very positive things in there that we're going to be working on to build on over the next several months.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. thank you very much.

our next question today comes from stephen byrd at morgan stanley. please go ahead.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking my questions.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
good morning, stephen.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
i wanted to explore green hydrogen a little bit further. you all have expressed a lot of enthusiasm about the potential for growth here and the potential for joint venture activity. and i was just curious, your latest thinking there and i guess it -- i guess, broadly i've been thinking that sort of the combining best-in-class renewables that you have with significant capabilities and actually sort of marketing, distributing, selling, etc, hydrogen would be critical to success in terms of supply and end-use customers with green hydrogen. and i'm just curious your general outlook enthusiasm for the prospects for more jv announcements.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
perfect. thanks, stephen. let me start with the longer-term view first and then come back to the shorter-term view, which would really tie into, i think, the latter part of your question and comment. the first part, which is the latter term view is, when we look at substantial deployment of renewables and battery storage, and think about how do you further decarbonize the us electricity sector. when we previously ran that analysis, just trying to add more renewables and add more battery storage, it became very burdensome for customers because you aren't getting a significant amount of value to the more and more renewables and storage you add, absent other actions.
so when we incorporated hydrogen into that thought, which is effectively a form of long duration storage that is taking advantage of the cheap electricity production coming from renewables, in some cases, excess renewable production at certain times of the day, that substantially change the value equation for customers to fully decarbonize in the electricity sector. so that gives us great excitement about the potential for substantial renewables and battery storage deployment knowing that as you continue to deploy more and you find economic forms of long duration storage that continues to be very value accretive to customers both in cost and in the performance of clean energy.
so that's kind of the starting point, but then coming back to a little bit more nearer term, if you think about how do you decarbonize transportation in industrial sectors, the most exciting ways to do that, that we see today is through electrification, whether that's in the form of electric vehicles fueled by batteries or other type of fuel cells or through hydrogen. and hydrogen probably is more applicable on the industrial sector, particularly for applications that already exist today.
so -- and with -- as jim highlighted, the potential for hydrogen production tax credit being considered by the administration and by congress as part of the infrastructure package. in the nearer term, we could see a closing of the gap perhaps fairly quickly to creating this as an economic alternative to other fuel sources today that are fossil fuel-based.
so yes, we couldn't be more excited about it for both the opportunities for renewables, for electricity sector, industrial and transportation. but also, as you suggested, potentially to participate in the hydrogen infrastructure itself whether it's the electrolyzer or other forms of creating and distributing the molecules. how much, and where we participate in that is really one of the things that we're focused on in all of these different pilots that both john and the energy resources team as well as eric within florida power & light are thinking through today. how do we do that economically? how do we leverage some of the scale benefits and opportunities that our business can bring to bear in these opportunities?
you'll see us continue to place small bets to get experience, to build relationships, to gain knowledge, and over the --- in the short term, that won't add up to a heck of a lot of capital investment opportunity, but it will add up to a tremendous amount of learning and continuing to focus our strategies on where we can add significant amount of value to the infrastructure and the market and ultimately to our shareholders as well.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's really helpful. and then just separately thinking about the mix of growth at resources, obviously, there's a lot of solar activity, a lot of solar megawatts that you'll be deploying. i just wanted to get your latest thinking on the outlook for returns between solar and wind. i guess i generally hear continued views that solar returns are certainly lower than wind, there is more competition there, but just curious, your latest thoughts on solar versus wind return outlook.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
sure, stephen. from a return standpoint, we do see a differential we have for quite some time, overall returns between wind and solar from a risk-adjusted basis. we're happy with returns that we've seen in both sets of technologies. in the short term, in terms of backlog that john and the energy resources team, it certainly has been influenced by what i think is the conventional wisdom for a long time that the step-downs for the production tax credit on wind and the step down for the investment tax credit on solar were in fact likely to happen. i think our customers now are thinking about that a little bit differently as discussions in washington has started to heat up.
but as we look what our likely outcomes as jim was talking through, including the potential for extensions of those incentives, i think the key takeaway is, they remain -- both technologies are very likely to remain economic for our customers to deploy on behalf of their customers and ultimately leading to significant cost savings for electricity buyers at the end of the day. so, they remain attractive from our perspective and we continue to focus our development efforts on wherever we can add value for our customers.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
very good. thank you very much.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer

and our next question today comes from michael weinstein with credit suisse. please go ahead.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, good morning.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
good morning, michael.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
could you -- on the subject of third-party acquisitions for nep, could you comment on any opportunities you're seeing in texas following winter storm uri? i think we've heard some previous comments that there are lots of parties looking at distressed assets in the state and wondering if there might be an opportunity for nep as well.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
yeah, michael. i think it's probably still a little bit too soon. i think most participants in the market are still working through a lot of the implications and learnings from texas. so i'm not sure there is a lot to be commented on in the near term. it's obviously something will stay engaged in the market and participate where it makes sense, but at this point, i think it's too soon.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
as -- can you comment a little bit about how much it costs to weatherize in the state? and what actions you guys have been taking since the storm?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
yeah. so we've done a lot of deep dives across our portfolio to think about where weatherizing makes sense. as i've talked about in the past and you well know, we have a lot of interest across texas, not only wind investments, solar, battery storage, gas infrastructure investments, and of course, a small retail business. so we've been carefully thinking through all of what are the opportunities to learn and perhaps invest going forward. specifically to weatherizing, i don't know if you were talking exclusively around the renewables fleet or if you're talking about the gas infrastructure side.
but on the renewable side, keep in mind that weatherization really focuses on ambient temperature effects and ambient temperature, at least for our fleet, i can't speak for everybody's, was not the real issue for any sort of production shortfall versus a p-50 forecast. it was really related to the fact that this in this extraordinary event that happened for multiple days, it was preceded by an icing event, so ice was accumulating on our blades and when ice accumulates on the blades, it's difficult for them to spin. and because the temperatures remained low for several days in a row, there was an opportunity for that ice to shed.
typically weatherization packages don't really address ice accumulation on the blades. this is something that the industry is focused on. there are some of what at this point are very expensive solutions to try to address ice accumulation on the blades and given that they don't happen every year and certainly don't happen frequently across specific sites every year and ends up being very cost-prohibitive for something that happens very sporadically.
so i'm not optimistic that there is a substantial amount to do at least today with respect to weatherization on the wind side to change the events. i do think there's opportunities across the gas supply side to improve the ability for gas to flow, which obviously was really at the crux of the issues along with not only natural gas supply shortages but plant issues and issues in the coal fleet and issues in the nuclear fleet. so there's opportunities across the market to invest.
john w. ketchum -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and if i could just add to that what rebecca said, this is john. when you look at ercot's overall operating fleet, what they really do have to address at the end of the day is weatherization of gas, because you think about 87, 88 gigawatts that were supposed to be available, i mean renewables on an ncf adjusted basis were only about 3 gigawatts of that and very much a rounding error in the problem that occurred in texas. and so texas really needs to think through what are the right solutions for gas because when you have icing conditions, it doesn't matter if it's blades on a turbine, it's a combustion gas turbine, it's a nuclear power plant, it's a coal plant. when you have severe icing conditions, they're all going to fail. and that's what we saw in texas.
and so, the question is, what is going to be the right market construct going forward to provide the appropriate incentives for weatherization and for backup fuel on-site to make sure that these facilities are capable of running and i think those are the kinds of issues that the texas legislature is currently evaluating.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
got you. hey, one last question from me. these third-party acquisitions at nep put any kind of pressure on idr payments and on the idr scheme going forward?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
i'm not sure what you mean by pressure, but ultimately the calculation for idr's is one that's known and relates to the overall growth in cash flow within nep. so it's not specific to what the acquisition source was for the asset.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. just wondering if you see a big uptick in third-party acquisitions that have dropped down cash going up to nextera, is there any kind of pressure one way or another to change the idr structure?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
no, there is not a difference in terms of the structure. and at this point in time, nextera energy partners and nextera energy remain happy with the idr structure that's currently in place.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thank you.

good day, and welcome to the nextera energy and nextera energy partners first quarter 2021 conference call. [operator instructions] after today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [operator instructions].
i would now like to turn the conference over to jessica aldridge, director of investor relations. please go ahead ma'am.
jessica aldridge -- director of investor relations
thank you, rocco. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2021 combined earnings conference call for nextera energy and nextera energy partners. with me this morning are jim robo, chairman and chief executive officer of nextera energy; rebecca kujawa, executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy; john ketchum, president and chief executive officer of nextera energy resources; and mark hickson, executive vice president of nextera energy. all of whom are also officers of nextera energy partners. as well as eric silagy, president and chief executive officer of florida power and light company. rebecca will provide an overview of our results and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.
we will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the securities and exchange commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
today's presentation also includes references to non-gaap financial measures. you should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-gaap measures to the closest gaap financial measure. as a reminder, gulf power legally merged into florida power & light company effective on january 1, 2021. gulf power will continue as a separate reporting segment within florida power & light and nextera energy through 2021, serving its existing customers under separate retail rates. throughout today's presentation when we refer to fpl, we are referring to florida power & light excluding gulf power, unless otherwise noted, or when using the term combined.
with that, i will turn the call over to rebecca.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
thank you, jessica. and good morning, everyone. nextera energy is off to a terrific start in 2021, and has made excellent progress in the core focus areas that we discussed on the last call. adjusted earnings per share increased nearly 14% year-over-year, reflecting successful performance across all of the businesses. fpl increased net income by approximately $78 million from the prior-year comparable period, which was driven by continued investment in the business for the benefit of our customers.
during the quarter, fpl successfully placed in service approximately 300 megawatts of additional cost-effective solar projects built under its solartogether program, which remains the largest community solar program in the nation. fpl now owns and operates approximately 2,640 megawatts of solar on its combined system, which is more than any other utility in the country. fpl's other major capital investments, including the 409-megawatt manatee energy storage center and highly efficient 1,200 megawatt dania beach clean energy center are also on schedule and on budget.
by executing on smart capital investments such as these, fpl is able to maintain its best-in-class customer value proposition of clean energy, low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service. fpl's typical residential bill remains well below the national average and the lowest in the nation among the 20 largest us investor-owned utilities. while our service reliability has never been higher.
gulf power also had a strong quarter of execution. the focus on the operational cost-effectiveness at gulf power continues to progress well with a 43% increase in net income year-over-year, primarily driven by year-to-date o&m costs declining by approximately 21% versus the prior-year comparable period, and by more than 34% relative to 2018. gulf power also delivered further improvements in service reliability and employee safety with no osha recordables year-to-date through the end of march. we remain committed to delivering on the objectives that we have previously outlined at gulf power and continue to expect to generate significant customer and shareholder value over the coming years.
at energy resources, adjusted earnings increased 13% year-over-year and it was another strong quarter of renewables origination with our backlog increasing by approximately 1,750 megawatts since the last call. we continue to see increased stakeholder focus on environmental, social and governance or esg factors, helping to drive accelerated demand for diversified clean energy solutions among new non-traditional customers, particularly in the commercial and industrial sector as an attractive source of incremental growth for energy resources in the coming years.
we have been encouraged by the biden administration's focus on clean energy and the emphasis they have placed on it in their budget and in the upcoming infrastructure package. we continue to work with the administration on their important efforts around extensions of existing renewable credits, new credits for transmission and storage, including hydrogen, as well as a new clean energy standard for the electric sector. we support a clean energy standard that accelerates the decarbonization of the electric grid and enables the decarbonization of the transportation and industrial sectors as well.
we believe that no energy company in the world has been more committed, consistent and proactive in promoting smart investments in clean energy technology as we have been for over two decades. as the push for action to address climate change and acceleration of progress toward decarbonization creates new and enhanced renewable incentives across our industry, we continue to believe that no company is better positioned than nextera energy to continue to drive change and capitalize on these trends. at this early point in the year, we are very pleased with our progress at fpl, gulf power and energy resources.
now, let's turn to the detailed results, beginning first with fpl. for the first quarter of 2021, fpl reported net income of $720 million or $0.37 per share. earnings per share increased $0.04 year-over-year. regulatory capital employed growth of 10.8% was a significant driver of fpl's eps growth versus the prior-year comparable quarter. fpl's capital expenditures were approximately $1.4 billion for the quarter and we expect our full-year capital investments to be between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion. fpl's reported roe for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ending march 2021.
during the quarter, we utilized $316 million of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory roe leaving fpl with a balance of $578 million. as we've previously discussed, fpl historically utilizes more reserve amortization in the first half of the year given the pattern of its underlying revenues and expenses, and we expect it to continue this trend this year.
let me now turn to gulf power, which reported first quarter 2021 net income of $57 million or $0.03 per share. gulf power's capital expenditures were $170 million for the quarter as it continues to execute on smart capital investments for the benefit of customers, and we expect its full capital investments for the year to be between $800 million and $900 million. all of gulf power's major capital investments, including the north florida resiliency connection that is expected to be in service in mid-2022, continue to progress well. as a result of these ongoing investments, regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 16% year-over-year. gulf power's reported roe for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 10.4% for the 12 months ending march 2021.
turning to our development and planning efforts, we recently filed an updated ten year site plan for fpl and gulf power, which we expect will begin to operate as an integrated electric system in 2022. the ten year site plan projects that zero-emission sources will provide nearly 40% of all energy produced across the combined fpl system in 2030, largely as a result of fpl's continued rapid expansion of solar energy through the execution of its 30-by-30 plan and success in its coal phase-out strategy.
fpl expects to add 3,800 megawatts of additional cost-effective solar over the next four years. and we now control all the land needed to meet our projected solar deployment of 11.7 gigawatts by 2030 for the combined fpl system. the site plan also reflects an expected total deployment of more than 1,200 megawatts of storage capacity by 2030. this plan is consistent with our belief that renewable generation and particularly solar paired with battery storage in florida is an increasingly cost-effective form of generation in most parts of the us.
as we execute on these opportunities, we project that fpl's combined emissions rate will be 62% lower in 2030 than the industry average was in 2005, and 20% lower than the us department of energy's projected industry average in 2030. moreover, we continue to plan and invest in sustainable solutions to broaden how we serve customers and prepare for an even cleaner future. during the quarter, fpl placed in service nearly 70 new electric vehicle charging ports and is now operating nearly 400 electric vehicle charging ports in the state as part of our goal to install more than 1,000 charging ports in more than 100 locations across the combined fpl service area from 2019 through 2022.
as we've previously discussed, we are also developing hydrogen electrolysis pilot project at fpl's okeechobee combined cycle unit as part of our efforts to introduce further fuel diversity and resiliency into fpl's generation system. there are approximately 25-megawatt solar connected electrolyzer that will be used to generate clean hydrogen as part of the okeechobee pilot will be the largest of its kind in the us to date. all these projects are just a few examples of our advanced deployment efforts at fpl. we are excited about the immense opportunities that lie ahead as our industry moves toward cleaner more sustainable future.
the florida economy continues to recover from the early effects of the pandemic and is among the strongest in the nation. the current unemployment rate of 4.7% is well below the national average. the real estate sector continues to grow with average building permits and the case-shiller index for south florida, up approximately 6% and 10% respectively versus the prior year. florida's retail sales index continued its quarter-over-quarter improvement, which is a further indication of the ongoing health in our economy and bolsters our confidence in our smart investment strategy required to serve anticipated demand growth.
during the quarter fpl's average number of customers increased by approximately 71,400 or 1.4% versus the comparable prior-year quarter, driven by continued solid underlying population growth. fpl's first quarter retail sales decreased 1.7% from the prior-year comparable period, which is primarily due to mild weather in the first quarter of this year versus 2020. we estimate that approximately 3% of the decline can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. on a weather-normalized basis, first quarter retail sales increased 1.3% with continued strong underlying usage contributing favorably.
for gulf power, the average number of customers grew 1.1% versus the comparable prior-year quarter, driven by continued economic growth in northwest florida. gulf power's first quarter retail sales increased 2.9% year-over-year, primarily due to favorable weather.
on march 12, we submitted testimony and detailed supporting information for florida power & light's 2021 base rate proceeding. the overall proposal for our 2022 through 2025 base rate plan is substantially consistent with the test year letter filed in january. we are requesting a base rate adjustment of approximately $1.1 billion starting in january '22; $607 million starting in january of 2023; and solar base rate adjustments or sobra mechanism in 2024 and 2025 for up to 1,788 megawatts of cost effective solar.
we are proud to offer our customers service that ranks among the cleanest and the most reliable in the country with typical residential bills of approximately 13% below state average and importantly, nearly 10% lower than in 2006. the four-year base plan has been designed to support continued investments in the long-term infrastructure and advanced technology, which continues to improve our already best-in-class reliability and helps keep customer bills low. with the proposed base rate adjustments and current projections for fuel and other costs, we believe that fpl's typical residential bill will grow at an average annual rate of about 3.4% from january 2021 through the end of 2025, which is expected to result in fpl's typical residential bill being approximately 20% below the projected national average, and more than 20% lower than our typical bills 15 years ago when adjusted for inflation.
typical gulf power residential bills are projected to decrease approximately 1% over the four-year rate plan. the florida public service commission has established a schedule for this proceeding, beginning with the quality of service hearings in june and technical hearings in late august. the proceedings would conclude in the fourth quarter with the staff recommendation and commission rulings on revenue requirements and rates. we look forward to the opportunity to present our case to the commission this summer and our focus will be to pursue a balanced outcome that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers. as always we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement.
energy resources reported first quarter 2021 gaap earnings of $491 million or $0.25 per share. adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $598 million or $0.30 per share, up 13% versus the prior-year comparable period. new investments added $0.04 per share, primarily reflecting growth in the renewables and storage business, including more than 2,700 megawatts of new contracted wind projects that were commissioned during 2020. the extreme market conditions in texas in february were the primary driver of the underperformance in our existing generation portfolio and customer supply and trading business, as well as the favorable performance in the gas infrastructure business.
as a reminder, when weather events like this occur, we operate our businesses in texas as a portfolio, and while there were pluses and minuses during these events, we believe the end result is a testament to the strength of our large and well-diversified business. all other impacts increased results by $0.03 versus 2020.
as i mentioned earlier, energy resources' development team had another strong quarter of origination. we added 503 megawatts of new solar projects to our backlog, including 190 megawatts of solar that will be paired with approximately 100 megawatts or four hour battery storage capacity. in 2020, our market share of signed contracts in co-located solar plus storage assets in us was more than 35% and we are excited about the continued trend in demand for co-located storage solutions as we anticipate even further cost synergies by pairing low-cost renewables with storage solutions in the coming decades as being an important part of decarbonization in our sector.
we also added 916 megawatts of new wind projects to our backlog for 2022. in addition, our backlog increased by energy resources share of nextera energy partners planned acquisition of 391 megawatts of operating wind projects announced earlier this week. with the approximately 1,750 megawatts added this quarter, our backlog of signed contracts at energy resources now totals approximately 15,250 megawatts, supporting our industry leading long term growth expectations.
we remain enthusiastic about the expanded investment opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the us economy presents for energy resources, and we continue to evaluate pilot projects for industrial, transportation and electric sector applications. in addition to the pilots and partnerships we've discussed on prior calls, we recently committed to make a minority investment in a clean energy technology company that has developed a proprietary process to essentially decarbonize the industrial production of hydrogen at economic prices. this investment and the hydrogen pilots we've announced to date show the promise of electrification across our economy, and we are excited for the opportunity to participate in these new markets and build renewables to support future growth and demand for electricity. consistent with our long-term track record, we will remain disciplined as we take steps to be at the forefront of this developing market while taking a leadership role in the clean energy transition.
beyond renewables and storage, nextera energy transmission furthered its efforts to build america's leading competitive transmission company with the closing of its acquisition of gridliance occurring at the end of last month. gridliance, which owns three ferc-regulated transmission utilities spanning six states is an excellent complement to our existing operations and further expands nextera energy's regulated business through the addition of attractive rate-regulated assets. nextera energy transmission now owns regulated assets in 10 states and six regional transmission organizations.
growth in renewables means that there is also a growing imperative to build additional transmission across the us to support this transmission to a low-cost, low carbon economy fueled by renewable energy. our incorporation of gridliance into our portfolio furthers our strategy to be north america's leading competitive transmission provider, both to deploy capital profitably, as well as to enable further renewables deployment.
turning now to the consolidated results for nextera energy. for the first quarter of 2021, gaap net income attributable to nextera energy was $1.67 billion or $0.84 per share. nextera energy's 2021 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted eps were $1.33 billion and $0.67 per share, respectively. adjusted earnings from corporate and other segment were roughly flat year-over-year.
long-term financial expectations, which we increased and extended to late last year through 2023 remain unchanged. for 2021, nextera energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.54. for 2022 and 2023, nextera energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges in 2021, 2022 and 2023, while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings.
from 2018 to 2023, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate range. we also continue to expect to grow dividends per share roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. as always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions.
let me now turn to nextera energy partners, which delivered very strong first quarter results with year-over-year growth in adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution of approximately 20% and 36%, respectively. yesterday, the nextera energy partners' board declared a quarterly distribution of $63.75 per common unit or $2.55 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. inclusive of this increase, nextera energy partners has grown its distribution per unit by 240% since the ipo.
further building on that strength, nextera energy partners recently announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire an approximately 400 megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted wind assets. this transaction will be nextera energy partners' first third-party acquisition of renewable energy assets and represents another step toward growing lp unit distributions in a manner consistent with our previously stated expectations of 12% to 15% per year through at least 2024. i'll provide additional details on the transaction in just a few minutes.
turning to the detailed quarterly results. nextera energy partners' first quarter adjusted ebitda was $354 million and cash available for distribution was $184 million. new projects, which primarily reflect the asset acquisitions that closed at the end of 2020, contributed $27 million of adjusted ebitda and $13 million of cash available for distribution. existing projects added $39 million of adjusted ebitda and $23 million of cash available for distribution. this strong year-over-year increase in adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution includes favorable results from nextera energy partners' wind and natural gas pipeline investments in texas during the february winter storm, partially offset by the impacts of an accelerated outage at our genesis project during the quarter.
cash available for distribution also benefited from a reduction in corporate level interest payments, primarily as a result of certain refinancing activities completed in the fourth quarter of last year. additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.
as i previously mentioned, we continue to execute on our plan to expand nextera energy partners portfolio and recently entered into an agreement to acquire an approximately 400-megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted operating wind projects. the portfolio has a cash available distribution, weighted average contract life of approximately 13 years with high credit quality customers, and further enhances the diversity of nextera energy partners' existing portfolio. the transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of this year subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and generate an attractive cafd yield and be immediately accretive to lp distributions. this transaction demonstrates the nextera energy partners' continued ability to execute on its long-term growth plan and it's enhanced buyer ability to take advantage of energy resources' best-in-class operating platform to reduce operating expenses at the assets. energy resources continues to leverage our culture of continuous improvement to realize lower costs across the renewable assets that it operates.
since 2017, energy resources has reduced fleetwide dollar per megawatt hour o&m costs in wind -- in its wind fleet by more than 30% and we believe both energy resources' wind and solar operating expenses are significantly better than its industry peers. with energy resources operating in the nextera energy partners' renewable assets, these cost advantages directly benefit lp unitholders. over the coming years, we look forward to leveraging the benefits of energy resources' operating portfolio platform for both nextera energy partners' existing portfolio as well as to add incremental value to future third-party acquisitions.
in addition to providing attractive base returns, these projects are well situated in attractive markets that we anticipate will have significant long-term renewables demand, supporting asset recontracting or potential repowering opportunities after the initial contract terms. we continue to believe that the existing nextera energy partners portfolio has meaningful organic growth opportunities over the coming years, and expect the portfolio we are acquiring provides additional long-term investment opportunities as well.
nextera energy partners expects to acquire the portfolio for a base purchase price of approximately $733 million subject to closing adjustments. the portfolio of assets is expected to contribute adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution of approximately $63 million to $70 million each on a five-year average annual run rate basis beginning in december 31, 2021. we believe this transaction is an attractive investment in which to deploy the $345 million of undrawn funds from the 2020 convertible equity portfolio financing, which we used to fund the acquisition along with the existing nextera energy partners' debt capacity.
following the recently announced transaction, we now expect to be in the upper end of our previously disclosed year-end 2021 run rate adjusted ebitda and cafd expectation ranges of $1.44 billion to $1.62 billion and $600 million to $680 million, respectively. as a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and includes the impact of anticipated idr fees as we treat these as an operating expense.
from the base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in lp distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in february of 2022 to be in a range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit.
in summary, after a strong start to the year, we remain as enthusiastic as ever about the long-term growth prospects for both nextera energy and nextera energy partners. at fpl, we continue to focus on delivering our best-in-class customer value proposition through operational cost-effectiveness, productivity and making smart long-term investments. energy resources maintains significant competitive advantages and continues to capitalize on the best renewables development period in our history. combined with the strength of our balance sheet and credit ratings, nextera energy is uniquely positioned to drive long-term shareholder value, and we remain intensely focused on executing on these opportunities.
nextera energy partners is well-positioned to deliver on its already best-in-class runway for lp distribution growth. finally, last month, we were honored that nextera energy was ranked number one in its sector for fortune magazine's most admired -- world's most admired companies list for the 14th time in 15 years. moreover, we are recognized for the 14th time as one of the world's most ethical companies by ethisphere institute, which is a testament to our team of nearly 15,000 employees who are committed to our core values who are helping to build a sustainable energy era that is affordable and clean.
in the coming weeks, we expect to publish nextera energy's 2021 esg report, which we believe establishes our full alignment with the task force for climate-related financial disclosures or tcfd recommendations. we are also excited to announce our commitment to participation in the carbon disclosure project survey later this year. these enhanced disclosures highlight the alignment of our corporate strategy with the key tenets of esg which our company has been focused on for more than 25 years and remains key to execution of our strategy moving forward.
that concludes our prepared remarks. and with that, i will open up the line for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question today comes from shar pourreza from guggenheim partners. please go ahead with your question.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys.
john w. ketchum -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
just a question, with sort of the infrastructure discussions going on at the federal level and obviously, rebecca, you highlighted opportunities on the wind and solar side, does nextera transmission sort of see an upside from policy changes? and obviously, with the prior acquisitions closed, do you feel like you have a big enough platform to grow organically? or is there an interest to roll up more stand-alone projects, development entities?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
yes. thanks, shar. appreciate the question. from our perspective, and we're looking out decades and looking at the enormous renewables build opportunity across the u.s., it is clear that over time, new transmission needs to be built to support some of that build-out. and it's not necessarily imperative today for that transmission to be built, but it certainly is important to start today to build the type of infrastructure that's needed over time. so we're really excited about the opportunities that the nextera energy transmission team has. and i would expect over time that we will grow both organically and continue to look for acquisition opportunities like we have over the last couple of years to supplement and build out that portfolio.
we're thrilled with the trans bay cable acquisition that we closed a couple of years ago. very excited to bring the gridliance team on board, and we'll continue to focus on opportunities, both organically and through acquisition over time.
from a broader policy standpoint, we thought it important for ferc and the regional isos to continue to focus on how do you support that transmission build-out. and we certainly are happy to see that to start to be a focus at ferc this year, in particular, in contemplating how do they support it going forward. and i think there's a receptive audience in the biden administration, making sure that they support laying a foundation that's supportive of renewables, not just in the next couple of years, but in the next couple of decades.
so transmission moves slowly. you know that. so stay tuned, but we're optimistic about our direct prospects in the near term as well as longer term.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
got it. and then the backlog additions look obviously more solid this quarter. just thinking about maybe the market dynamics, there was some slowdown in early '21 with input costs and commodity inflation, right? have you seen that? or are the headwinds largely stabilized? and just as a follow-up, is energy storage still kind of a large component of the backlog and contracted additions or has there been some pricing pressure there?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
our energy resources development team clearly is evidenced by not only the signings this quarter, but looking back at quarters now, going back quite a number of them, have just had terrific origination success. and i'd encourage everybody to not just focus on an individual quarter and look at a slightly broader trend. and we're really pleased not only with what we've seen looking back and what the team has been able to execute on, but also looking forward. and that's what gave us the confidence just early this year, to not only increase but expand the horizon for our development expectations such that our four-year period starting '21 through '24 is 23 to 30 gigawatts, which is just an exceptional number and one that we're really excited and proud of the team for taking on, and we're thrilled to be at 75% already at the low end today.
in terms of our customer demand, remains very strong across the board, and we're certainly excited about bringing that into more signed contracts going forward. in terms of costs, as you know, we'll continue to incorporate our latest expectations in the industry's latest expectations for costs, and we feel very comfortable with the returns that we see and excited about the opportunities going forward.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
got it. and then just lastly, rebecca, on just the rate case. i mean, obviously, you're having conversations with interveners and you're building a case record there. and obviously, you highlighted you always prefer a settlement. is there any moving pieces that you feel aren't focused? where do you sort of think you have some flexibility for a constructive kind of outcome versus a fully litigated case?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
shar, as we've talked about with you all from an investor standpoint, we are very focused over years now leading up to the case as a matter of our strategy making sure that the best customer value proposition possible. and you can see that in our execution on o&m, on reliability, on customer service and of course, the continued focus on clean energy generation, because that's in our control. what's also in our control is putting forward the best case possible to ensure that we're articulating that strategy, not only what the team has accomplished, but what we plan to do in the coming four years to support continued execution.
so the team is very focused on continuing to go through the process and accommodating with the hearings in short order and a commission decision later this year if we go that far. but we're also always very interested in having a win-win solution with stakeholders. we certainly appreciate the history of that in florida, not just with us but with other utilities and broader stakeholder base. and we will continue to remain very engaged in any sort of constructive outcome that we could bring forward with stakeholders. you think that's positive for our customers and broader stakeholders if we can accomplish it. but we're focused on the task at hand, and we'll continue through the process and see where we are at the end of the year.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
terrific. congrats, guys, on the results. thank you very much.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
thanks, shar.
operator
our next question comes from julien dumoulin-smith from bofa. please go ahead with your question.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bofa -- analyst
excellent. good morning, team. thanks for the time. maybe picking up where shahr left it off. can you speak a little bit more about some of this inflation dynamic and especially some of the elevated freight and logistics? i mean, it seems like your '21/'22 outlook here is relatively intact. can you speak to some of the dynamics there and just the confidence? it seems like you guys are certainly staying on-track of execution as you have historically. but also in the same vein of inflation, can you speak to what that does to your ppa offtake prices, right? i mean how are you thinking about this being effectively passed through to your customers, if you will, whether that's as a proxy for higher gas and power prices or simply just passing through your higher cost of goods here?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
thanks, julien. and i'll start with some kind of near-term thoughts and then think about the broader term second. near term, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we feel very comfortable with where we are with our backlog and what we plan to build in the 2021 and 2022 time frame. and our comments reflected that in the prepared remarks. and it's a real credit to the way that we approach this business and our engineering construction and integrated supply chain teams really working through a variety of different circumstances over the last 1.5 years. and we've secured the equipment that we need to build out those projects and of course, have some contractual agreements in place that help us feel comfortable about that position.
from a longer-term standpoint, i think it still remains to be seen in some respects. you can see that in a broad set of discussion across the financial and the broader u.s. economy. -- dialogue of whether or not this is temporary related to near-term snap back and demand and hurdles in the supply chain that may not persist over time or if it is systemic and persisting. so i think that remains a little bit to be seen.
one thing that's very fortunate for renewables, as you all well know, is that renewable energy projects are very much the least cost form of generation in many parts, if not most, of parts of the u.s. so even if there is a change in pricing, if these cost increases are persistent and systemic over a long period of time, the value proposition is still very clear for renewables relative to alternatives. and then beyond that, we also need to think about what implications, if any, there will be from policy changes. so i think the net takeaway is somewhat premised in your question is that we feel comfortable with where we are. we're prepared for a variety of set of circumstances, and we're thrilled with the position of renewables and the growth opportunities and honestly, the decades ahead.
john w. ketchum -- president and chief executive officer
one small add i would make, julien, to what rebecca just said. this is john. it's actually creating opportunities for us. our supply chain capability and our ability to manage that supply chain, the buying power that we have, spending $11 billion in capex a year, it's creating opportunities for us in the renewable space because we can execute and deliver where others can't.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bofa -- analyst
i mean to that point, can you speak to how much procurement you all have done against the full kind of four-year outlook that you guys talk about here? i mean how hedged up for the lack of a better way to describe this, are you against these eventualities? i know you all do meaningful forward planning here.
john w. ketchum -- president and chief executive officer
yes, pretty well hedged up, julien. i mean, we've basically locked in obviously, '21, we've locked in '22, making really good headway against '23 as well. and so that's put us in a great position when you look at where we stand against the rest of the market. and where others can't deliver, particularly around commitments in '22 or '23 or '24 because they don't have the same supply chain leverage that we do, it's really creating opportunities in those out years. and you've got to remember, the customer is a little bit concerned. so if they're dealing with smaller players, that don't have the same supply chain leverage that are having to constantly go back to them for price ups for cod extensions, it really lowers the credibility of those types of players in the market and it creates more opportunities that fall our way. and so that's why i say it's a real opportunity for us.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bofa -- analyst
got it. and just to clarify that even further. are you suggesting that not only could you get awarded future contracts, are you suggesting that you might be able to take over existing or perhaps the fun ppas that have already been awarded?
john w. ketchum -- president and chief executive officer
not take over, but if those opportunities fall away because the offtake or the customer can't arrange or work out with that developer, sometimes those get bid back out to rfp or sometimes it creates a bilateral opportunity for us.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bofa -- analyst
got you. excellent. well, best of luck and thank you for the time.
john w. ketchum -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, julien.

our next question comes from steve fleishman from wolfe research. please go ahead with your question.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, good morning.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
good morning, steve.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
can you hear me, rebecca?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
i can hear you fine.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. so first, a question on the announced backlog growth this quarter, a lot of solar adds, but just a little bit of storage. are you seeing -- if i recall, you've been getting kind of 50% roughly adoption of storage with solar. is that changing? just happened to be more just solar stand-alone weighted this quarter?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
yes. steve, i wouldn't read into it. just kind of consistent with the overall backlog additions, i think you need to look a little bit broader than just a three-month period to get an indication of trends. what we see is not a slowdown in storage at all. there's a lot of interest in new storage opportunities, not just with our customers, but even from a regulatory standpoint in certain jurisdictions where storage could be particularly helpful given certain dynamics in various markets, so we're very excited about the storage opportunity and don't see a change in the overall dynamics of opportunities.
john w. ketchum -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and one thing i would add to that, steve, is with all the hot weather that you're seeing out in the west, that's only going to drive more storage opportunity. and i think we have a real competitive advantage as you've seen in the past in those markets.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. great. and maybe just switching over to nep. so this is the second drop, i think, in the last six months or so where the cafd yields have been around 8%. is that kind of the new range we should be expecting for nep on drops of long-term contracted assets?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
steve, you can appreciate, we, and of course, the net board and energy resources perspective is all constantly looking at what valuations are and where third-party transactions have transacted and we think about the valuations in those lights. and i think with where cost of capital are and demands for renewable projects, i think this transaction appropriately balances and reflects those dynamics.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. and i guess last question, just on any thoughts on some of the discussion in ercot, texas on renewables, on market structure changes and how they're discussing kind of treatment of renewables there. i mean, is there a risk that renewables need to end up paying for ancillaries?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
i would characterize it, steve, as a work in progress. obviously, the events that happened in february were pretty significant, and it takes time to work through and properly account for where there were sources of pressure and what the appropriate responses are from a -- obviously, from a political, but of course, mostly from a regulatory and a policy standpoint. and i think they're still sorting through it. obviously, governor abbott has asked for certain actions to be taken from the puct and ercot and there's a framework that the puct has started to lay out. but i think there's still time to work through what those details look like.
from our perspective, well, we've been very active in a variety of aspects in ercot. we know that market well and we certainly have a strong perspective on what needs to be addressed, in particular, to focus on what really went wrong in february, including a massive amount of disruption across the gas supply, not only from supply, but transmission and ultimately, consumption by end users. and we hope that a lot of the actions will be focused on that as opposed to things that that won't necessarily help and solve the fundamental problems in hand. but i think the most important part is work in progress.
john w. ketchum -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and i think what i would add to that is trying to frame the problem, right? you have an 82 gigawatt system. i mean, renewables, let's face it, we're a very small part of that. on an ncf adjusted basis, during year, you're talking about 3 gigawatts. and really the way to address the problem, if you're really going to go after the problem, you really have to focus on gas-fired units, you have to focus on coal, you have to focus on nuclear and you can't lose sight of the fact that the reason that ercot has low power prices is because of renewables. and renewables are what are really driving the efficiencies and the economics of that market. so there's a much bigger story to be told. that's what we're working through at the workshop level. as rebecca said, this is going to take some time to play out.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. thank you.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer

our next question comes from stephen byrd from morgan stanley. please go ahead with your question.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. good morning.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
good morning, stephen.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
i wanted to talk about the outlook for renewable and energy storage costs, but take it from a different perspective. i know there's been a lot of attention on commodity cost dynamics. but on the more positive side, i was interested in your views on sort of innovations that could result in cost reduction breakthroughs. and there's interesting article this week in the wall street journal in storage, and we're trying to make sure we're thinking through potential areas of innovation. i was just curious at a high level, are there areas of innovation, whether it be in storage or in solar, green hedging, just things that excite you in terms of the potential to have very significant impacts on cost or performance?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
you know all of us, stephen: we love technology, we love innovation, and we certainly are excited about a lot of changes that are happening across the energy sector. i think the biggest driver dynamic in our sector today is really the cost of renewables overall, even today; and that that alone is stimulating a significant amount of change and that adoption over time will create the need for more storage like applications, whether it's lithium ion or i think the technology you're referencing the wall street journal, of course, hydrogen in the longer term, which we're also very excited about. those are all very interesting, particularly for the latter part of the 2020s and into 2030 and beyond, which could help support the substantial build-out that we're expecting.
in the short term, i think the biggest dynamic is what we see at hand, which is the economic value proposition of renewables. what we think could change that probably nearer term than even some of the innovations you're talking about is policy. you all, i know, are following just like we are and participating in a variety of discussions in washington. but if the incentives are addressed in legislation, that could be a big driver of change in the industry as well in terms of timing.

that's very helpful. and then i wanted to go back to the drop down that you announced. i was just curious, what was the amount of gain in nextera from the drop-down of assets down to nav?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
i'm not sure i understand the question, stephen. are you talking about the proceeds?
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
well, the proceeds relative to the cost of developing. i was just curious sort of what degree of premium nextera was able to achieve relative to the cost of developing those assets?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
we haven't disclosed that yet, stephen. as we go through the process, of course, we'll update the financial statements, assuming that the transaction closes. but we are very pleased from an energy resources perspective with these projects, consistent overall returns with the types of returns that we see across wind and solar and distributed generation projects.
on the dg side, we continue to be very excited about the business in energy resources. the team has done a terrific job building it. and as i commented in the prepared remarks, we're expecting to triple the investment that we've made in the business and those tend to be a very attractive returns.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood. thanks. i was asking in part, i was just looking at the multiple of ebitda. i mean, as steve fleishman mentioned, the cafd yield, that's not surprising, but the multiple of ebitda looked relatively low, but there may be some elements there that i'm just missing.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
i don't think -- i wouldn't think that was characterized in anything unusual, stephen. we're happy with the overall returns of the project. and i do think that the cafd yields are reflective of market transactions that we see in the marketplace and really reflective of substantial demand for renewables. and we continue to be very excited about the prospects for nep.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
understood. that's all i have. thank you so much.
operator
our next question comes from maheep mandloi from credit suisse. please go ahead with your question.
maheep mandloi -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey. thanks for taking the questions. just following on the nep side. despite the drop downs, the adjusted ebitda and cafd guidance remains unchanged. is that because of timing or something else on that side?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
i'm sorry. was the guidance change? what was the -- i missed that part.
maheep mandloi -- credit suisse -- analyst
the adjusted ebitda and cafd guidance is the same as the last quarter. so just wondering if the new drop-downs are accretive on 2022 levels --
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
i understand now. sorry about that. from our expectations, if you look at our guidance expectations, even at the end of last year, which is when we started talking about what the expectations for run rate at the end of this year, they were for an increase. this transaction was something that we are anticipating as part of our growth expectations. we do expect to be at the high end of the ranges, as we've articulated, for both adjusted ebitda and cafd for year-end.
maheep mandloi -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. got it. and in terms of additional drop-downs would this be comfortable for 2022 needs? and is it a fair statement that you might need more drop downs for 2023 distribution growth?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
we will continue to be opportunistic. there's a lot of flexibility within the nep portfolio. we continue to have a pretty low out ratio. if you recall, about 1.5 years ago, we took some actions to disperse, delever, but also supplement the portfolio during the uncertainty of the pg&e bankruptcy and continue to have a relatively low payout ratio. one of the advantages of that is nextera energy partners can be opportunistic in terms of meeting its distribution per unit growth targets of 12% to 15%, which is really the metric against really managing and measuring the business to ensure that we can meet those expectations. we provide the expectations for run rate adjusted ebitda and cafd to give a sense of how we're expecting to achieve them, but there is flexibility in how we get there.
maheep mandloi -- credit suisse -- analyst
got you. thanks, rebecca. and just maybe a last one from me. the -- in terms of the -- on the new development, and just given the recent cost pressures on the input side, does having that safe harbor help meet any near-term needs? or are you using some of that $2.2 billion of safe harbor equipment upfront to avoid any higher costs in the near term?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
there's a lot of flexibility inherent to that safe harbor portfolio, but we see it mostly as an option to create the opportunity to realize the tax incentives. just as we've seen over the last couple of years, there have been extensions in terms of time frames and even extensions in terms of the available percentage of the tax credit in a given period.
so maintaining flexibility and optionality is our first priority. we continue to feel very comfortable with the 2021 and 2022 build of being able to meet the equipment needs and ultimately bring them into service and time frames that are very attractive from an energy resources perspective.
john w. ketchum -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i would think of the safe harbor extension as being certainly an incremental opportunity for us. one of the advantages that we have is we're always careful on how we manage our safe harbor vintaging, and we're fortunate because we were in good shape on our 2017 vintage portfolio. and so the safe harbor extension creates 1 to 1.5 gigawatts of opportunity for us on the wind side.
and if i could come back just for one second on stephen byrd's question on the ebitda multiples. the ebitda multiples on this drop-down were consistent with what we've done in the past. you got to remember, it always gets a little bit tricky with tax credits. you also have to remember that even after the sale of the nep, we own a good portion of nep. we get cash distributions. we get idrs. when you take all that into account on an ebitda multiple basis, we end up with what we believe is a very competitive marker against where renewable assets trade today.
maheep mandloi -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks for the clarification.
operator
our next question comes from michael lapides from goldman sachs. please go ahead with your question.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my question. actually, i have a couple. first of all, just broad big picture renewables. do you think you're taking share, meaning do you think your market share of renewable capacity in the u.s. is actually growing from here? or are you mostly benefiting from the dramatic tailwinds that's happening to the overall space? that's question one.
question two is, there are lots of new entrants. every day, someone -- a new entrant gets announced and well-funded, whether it's by pension funds, whether it's european big oil, whether it's by some of the large super well-capitalized and well-known alternative asset managers. we saw an announcement out of one of them yesterday or the day before about funding a solar and storage start-up. what's that doing in returns? are you seeing that kind of flow in the cash flow returns yet of new projects you're developing today versus what you may have done a year or 18 months ago?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
so michael, i'll start with the middle of it and maybe expand to the right and the left. the middle of it is this market is absolutely growing significantly, and we expect it to continue to grow significantly for years to come. so from our perspective, the pie absolutely is getting bigger.
over a long period of time, our market share has remained very strong in the 20-ish percent range for wind and probably in the mid-teens, occasionally a little bit higher and occasionally probably in the mid-teens on solar. and storage has actually been higher than both of those as this market has grown significantly over the last couple of years.
when we look out, we focus on both maintaining market share and also maintaining attractive returns. and we think our competitive advantages have enabled us to do that over time. and we think both is important and that among them is very important. john and his team are focused on getting the best of the projects that we see out in the marketplace and ultimately being very happy with the projects that we put into the portfolio.
we get asked the question about new entrants a lot. you know this industry well. if you look back and you stack power purchase agreement awards over many years, you'll see that very big bar to the left when we put the chart together and a couple of bars that are smaller, of course, but still decent size and then a whole bunch of small players to get 100 -- a couple of hundred megawatts a given year and that dynamic continues to be consistent. that's for greenfield and kind of in the more development-oriented projects.
there has been more capital coming in, but that's mostly post-cod. and when we think about capturing the value of developing renewables it really is on that twinkle in the eye of a developer, the cod is the enormous opportunity to create value, and we continue to be very good at it and enhance those competitive advantages to maintain that position over time.
so we're really excited about what we've been able to accomplish, really excited about our position and really excited about the energy transformation overall and the opportunities that presents.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. and then one quick follow-up, just on nep. you still have the idr structure at nep. and as nep grows. at what point do you think that becomes -- and you've made a revision to it, but it's been a while. but at what point do you reevaluate the necessity of the idr at the nee level and especially given the fact that kind of idr structures have significantly gone away from some of the other industries that used to use them?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
michael, we -- obviously, we've gotten that question before in the past. and of course, from nee's perspective, we continue to be happy with the relationship as it exists today between nee and nep. and there's a lot of synergy between the two companies and value created from each of their perspective from the structure that's in place. and that alignment of incentives remains important, we believe, to ensuring value creation from both nextera energy's and nextera energy partners perspective.
we are excited about the opportunities for both businesses, and we'll see what the future brings. but it continues to work, and we're very pleased with the alignment of interest today.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thank you. much appreciated.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
thank you, michael.

good morning, everyone, and welcome to the nextera energy and nextera energy partners q2 2021 earnings call. [operator instructions] please also note today's event is being recorded. and at this time, i'd like to turn the conference call over to jessica aldridge, director of investor relations. ma'am, please go ahead.
jessica aldridge -- director of investor relations
thank you, jamie. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2021 combined earnings conference call for nextera energy and nextera energy partners. with me this morning are jim robo, chairman and chief executive officer of nextera energy; rebecca kujawa, executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy; john ketchum, president and chief executive officer of nextera energy resources; and mark hickson, executive vice president of nextera energy, all of whom are also officers of nextera energy partners; as well as eric silagy, president and chief executive officer of florida power & light company. rebecca will provide an overview of our results, and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.
we will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the securities and exchange commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
today's presentation also includes references to non-gaap financial measures. you should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-gaap measures to the closest gaap financial measure. as a reminder, gulf power legally merged into florida power & light company effective on january 1, 2021. gulf power will continue as a separate reporting segment within florida power & light and nextera energy through 2021, serving its existing customers under separate retail rates. throughout today's presentation, when we refer to fpl, we are referring to florida power & light, excluding gulf power, unless otherwise noted or when using the term combined.
with that, i will turn the call over to rebecca.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president finance and chief financial officer
thank you, jessica, and good morning, everyone. nextera energy delivered strong second quarter results and is well positioned to meet its overall objectives for the year. adjusted earnings per share increased more than 9% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong financial and operational performance across all of the businesses. fpl increased earnings per share by $0.04 year-over-year, driven by continued investments in the business. fpl's major capital initiatives remain on track and fpl's focus continues to be on identifying smart capital investments to lower costs, improve reliability and provide clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers.
in june, fpl demolished its last coal-fired plant in florida, with plans to replace it with more clean emissions-free solar energy facilities. during the quarter, fpl also successfully commissioned approximately 373 megawatts of new solar, including the fpl discovery solar energy center at kennedy space center. with these new additions, fpl surpassed 40% completion of its groundbreaking 30x30 plan to install 30 million solar panels by 2030.
fpl expects to have installed more than 15 million panels by early 2022, which would put the company more than 50% on the way toward completing a 30x30 plan and just over three years since the initial announcement. to support its solar build-out, fpo recently began installing the first components of the world's largest integrated solar-powered battery system, the 409-megawatt fpl manatee energy storage center, which is expected to begin serving customers later this year.
gulf power also continued to execute on its growth initiatives during the quarter with its strong financial performance driven primarily by continued investment in the business and further improvements in operational cost effectiveness. excluding the covid-19-related expenses, which were subsequently reversed and booked into a regulatory asset in the third quarter of 2020, gulf power's year-to-date o&m costs declined by approximately 9% versus the prior year comparable period and have now declined by approximately 31% relative to 2018.
gulf power's operational performance metrics also continued to improve, with the reliability of the generation fleet that we operate and service reliability, improving by 71% and 63%, respectively, year-to-date versus the first half of 2018. we continue to expect that the cost reduction initiatives and smart capital investments that we've previously outlined will generate significant customer and shareholder value in the coming years.
at energy resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by more than 7% year-over-year. the energy resources team continues to capitalize on the terrific market opportunity for low-cost renewables and storage, adding approximately 1,840 megawatts to its backlog since the last earnings call. this continued origination success is a testament to energy resources' significant competitive advantages, including our large pipeline of sites and interconnection queue positions, strong customer relationships, purchasing power and supply chain execution, best-in-class construction expertise, resource assessment capabilities, cost of capital advantages and world-class operations capability. moreover, energy resources, advanced data analytics and machine learning capabilities allow us to utilize the nearly 40 billion operating data points, our fleet provides every single day for predictive modeling, further extending our best-in-class o&m and development capabilities.
we continue to believe that no company is better positioned than energy resources to capitalize on the best renewables development period in our history. we are pleased with the progress we've made at nextera energy so far in 2021 and headed into the second half of the year, we are well positioned to achieve the full year financial expectations that we've previously discussed, subject to our usual caveats.
now let's look at the detailed results beginning with fpl. for the second quarter of 2021, fpl reported net income of $819 million or $0.42 per share, which is an increase of $70 million and $0.04 per share, respectively, year-over-year. regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 10.7% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of fpl's net income growth of more than 9%.
fpl's capital expenditures were approximately $1.6 billion in the second quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to total between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion. our reported roe for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ended june 2021. during the quarter, we utilized $100 million of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory roe, leaving fpl with a balance of $473 million.
as a reminder, rather than seek recovery from customers of the approximately $240 million in hurricane dorian storm restoration costs, in 2019, fpl utilized its available reserve amortization to offset nearly all of the expense associated with the write-off of the regulatory asset related to dorian cost recovery.
earlier in the year, fpl and office of public counsel entered into a settlement regarding the prudence of fpl's hurricane dorian storm restoration costs and activities, which was approved by the florida public service commission in may. we are pleased by the commission's determination that all of fpl's hurricane dorian restoration costs were prudently incurred and we believe the settlement agreement fairly and reasonably balances the interest of fpl and its customers.
earlier this month, fpl responded to tropical storm elsa with a restoration workforce of approximately 7,000 fpl employees and contractors. fpl safely and quickly restored power to nearly 100,000 customers who were impacted by elsa as the hardening and automation investments that fpl has made since 2006 to build a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient energy grid continued to benefit customers. elsa was the earliest that a fifth named storm has formed in the atlantic basin, and we remain prepared in advance of what is forecasted to be another active hurricane season in 2021.
let me now turn to gulf power, which reported second quarter 2021 net income of $63 million or $0.03 per share. during the quarter, gulf power's capital expenditures were approximately $150 million and we expect its full year capital investments to be between $800 million and $900 million. all of the major capital -- the gulf power capital projects, including the north florida resiliency connection that is expected to be in service in mid-2022, continue to progress well. and gulf power's regulatory capital employed grew by approximately 17% year-over-year as a result of these smart capital investments for the benefit of customers.
gulf power's reported roe for regulatory purposes will be approximately 10.3% for the 12 months ended june 2021. for the full year 2021, we continue to target a regulatory roe in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%. earlier this month, florida public service commission also approved a settlement agreement between gulf power and the office of public counsel for cost recovery of the approximately $13 million in covid-19-related expenses, primarily reflected in incremental bad debt and safety expenses as a result of the pandemic.
we are pleased with this outcome and believe it demonstrates the continued constructive regulatory environment in the state of florida as we work to improve gulf power's value proposition of low cost, high reliability, excellent customer service and clean energy for our customers.
as we anticipated, florida's economic activity has rebounded since the onset of the covid-19 pandemic last year as reflected by a wide range of positive economic indicators. florida's current unemployment rate is 5%, which remains well below the national average. rolling three-month average of new building permits are up approximately 46% year-over-year, which is the highest growth rate in nearly eight years and are the second highest new building permits in the nation.
as another indicator of health in florida's economy, florida's retail sales index was up over 40% versus the prior year. the case-shiller seasonally adjusted index for south florida home prices is up over 14% on an annual basis. recent population growth estimates indicate that florida remains one of the top destinations for relocating americans, with florida adding nearly 330,000 new residents between april of 2020 and april of 2021. we expect this trend to continue with florida's population projected to grow at an average annual rate of 1% through 2023; and fpl, including gulf power, forecasts adding almost 500,000 new customer accounts from 2018 through 2025.
during the quarter, fpl's average number of customers increased by approximately 70,400 from the comparable prior year quarter driven by continued solid underlying population growth. fpl's second quarter retail sales increased 0.1% from the prior year comparable period. partially offsetting customer growth was a decline in weather-related usage per customer of approximately 2.8%. on a weather-normalized basis, second quarter sales increased 2.9%, with continued strong underlying usage contributing favorably.
for gulf power, the average number of customers grew roughly 1.5% versus the comparable prior year quarter. and gulf power's second quarter retail sales decreased 1% year-over-year as strong customer growth was more than offset by an unfavorable weather comparison relative to 2020.
as we previously stated, on march 12, we initiated florida power & light's 2021 base rate proceeding. the four-year base rate plan we have proposed has been designed to support continued investments in clean energy generation, long-term infrastructure and advanced technology, which improves reliability and keeps -- helps to keep customer bills low.
today, fpl's typical residential bills remain well below the national average and the lowest among the top-20 investor-owned utilities in the nation. with the proposed base rate adjustments and current projections for fuel and other costs, fpl's typical residential bill is expected to be approximately 20% below the projected national average and typical gulf power residential bills are projected to decrease approximately 1% over the four-year rate plan. as always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through our care settlement agreement and our core focus remains on pursuing a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers.
energy resources reported second quarter 2021 gaap losses of $315 million or $0.16 per share. adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $574 million or $0.29 per share. energy resources adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter increased more than 7% versus the prior year comparable period. the effect of mark-to-market on nonqualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings, was the primary driver of the difference between energy resources second quarter gaap and adjusted earnings results.
contributions from new investments added $0.04 per share versus the prior year and primarily reflects growth in our contracted renewables and battery storage program. adjusted earnings per share contributions from existing generation and storage assets increased $0.01 year-over-year, which includes the impact of unfavorable wind resource during the second quarter. and nextera energy transmissions adjusted earnings per share contribution also increased $0.01 year-over-year.
our customer supply and trading business contribution was $0.03 lower year-over-year, primarily due to unfavorable market conditions. all other impacts decreased results by $0.01 per share versus 2020.
the energy resources development team continues to capitalize on what we believe is the best renewables development environment in our history during the second quarter, with the team adding approximately 1,840 megawatts of renewables and storage projects to our backlog. since our last earnings call, we've added approximately 285 megawatts of new wind and wind repowering, 1,450 megawatts of solar and 105 megawatts of battery storage to our backlog of signed contracts.
with nearly 3.5 years remaining before the end of 2024, we have already signed more than 75% of the megawatts needed to realize the low end of our 2021 to 2024 development expectations range.
since the last call, we have also executed a 310-megawatt build-owned transfer agreement, which is not included in our backlog additions. our customer intends to use the solar plus storage project to replace existing coal generation and we are excited to be able to continue supporting the industry's transition away from old and efficient forms of generation into clean, reliable and low-cost renewables and storage.
our engineering and construction team continues to perform exceptionally well, commissioning approximately 330 megawatts during the quarter and keeping the backlog of wind, solar and storage projects that we expect to build in 2021 and 2022 on-track. we are well positioned to complete our more than $20 billion capital investment program at energy resources for 2021 and 2022.
last month, the irs extended safe harbor eligibility on production tax credits and investment tax credits, providing projects that began construction between 2016 and 2019 with six years to complete construction and projects that started construction in 2020 with five years to achieve their in-service dates and qualify for federal tax credits. we believe the extension reflects the strong support of the biden administration for new renewables and may enable an incremental 1 to 1.5 gigawatts of new wind and wind repowering opportunities.
we now have more than $2.2 billion of safe harbor wind and solar equipment, which could support as much as $45 billion of wind, solar and battery storage investments across all of our businesses from 2021 to 2024.
turning now to the consolidated results for nextera energy. for the second quarter of 2021, gaap net income attributable to nextera energy was $256 million or $0.13 per share. nextera energy's 2021 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted eps were $1.4 billion and $0.71 per share, respectively. adjusted earnings from corporate and other segment were roughly flat year-over-year.
over the past few months, nextera energy issued nearly $3.3 billion in new financings under its innovative new nextera green bond structure. funds raised with nextera energy -- nextera green bonds are designated for specific renewable energy and store projects under development across our businesses. and if funds are not used to bring the renewable projects online within two years, there is a step-up in the interest rate on the debt.
our inaugural nextera green issuance was 4.5 times oversubscribed, priced at a premium to the market and was well received by investors. we believe that nextera green will set a new standard for green issuances moving forward.
nextera energy has raised more than $9 billion in new capital year-to-date on very favorable terms as we continue to execute on our financing plan for the year. finally, in june, s&p affirmed all of its ratings for nextera energy and lowered its downgrade threshold for its funds from operation or ffo to debt metric from the previous level of 21% to the new level of 20%. we believe this favorable adjustment reflects the strength of our business as well as recognition of nextera energy's leading position in the utility and renewable energy sectors on environmental, social and governance, or esg factors. i believe that this is the first time that s&p has formally recognized the benefits to business risk profile related to esg factors by allowing more constructive financial metrics since it began its practice of identifying the specific esg metrics that drive a company's overall credit position.
notably, s&p also revised nextera energy's management and governance assessment from ""satisfactory"" to ""strong"", to reflect its views on our comprehensive enterprisewide risk management standards and successful track record of consistently implementing our strategic planning efforts.
our long-term financial expectations through 2023 remain unchanged. for 2021, nextera energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.54. for 2022 and 2023, nextera energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share. and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges in 2021, 2022 and 2023, while at the same time, maintaining our strong credit ratings.
from 2018 to 2023, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate range. we also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. as always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions.
let me now turn to nextera energy partners. nextera energy partners portfolio performed well and delivered financial results generally in line with our expectations after accounting for the below-average renewable resource. on a year-to-date basis, adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution have increased by roughly 9% and 11%, respectively, versus 2020. this strong operational and financial performance highlights that nextera energy partners remains well positioned to continue to deliver on its outstanding growth objectives.
yesterday, the nextera energy partners board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.6625 per common unit or $2.65 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. inclusive of this increase, nextera energy partners has now grown its distribution per unit by more than 250% since the ipo.
further building on that strength, today, we are announcing that nextera energy partners has entered into an agreement to acquire approximately 590 net megawatts of geographically diverse wind and solar projects from nextera energy resources. i will provide additional details on the transaction in a few minutes.
nextera energy partners also completed multiple financings during the second quarter to secure funding for its recently announced 2021 acquisitions and further enhance its financing flexibility. in june, nextera energy partners raised approximately $500 million in new 0% coupon convertible notes and concurrently entered into a capped call structure. it is expected to result in nextera energy partners retaining the upside from up to 50% appreciation in its unit price over the three years associated with the convertible notes. nextera energy partners also drew the remaining funds from its 2020 convertible equity portfolio financing, which was upsized by approximately $150 million during the quarter, evidencing continued investor demand for exposure to the high-quality, long-term contracted renewables projects and the underlying portfolio of assets that was established last year.
finally, nextera energy partners has successfully completed the sale of approximately 700,000 nep common units year-to-date through its recently expired at the market or atm program, raising roughly $50 million in proceeds. going forward, we will continue to seek opportunities to use the atm program depending on market conditions and other considerations. and in the near term, nextera energy partners intends to renew the program for up to $300 million in issuances and over the next three years to permit additional financing flexibility.
as a result of these financings and the strong cash flow generation of its existing portfolio, nextera energy partners ended the quarter with more than $2.2 billion in liquidity, which includes funds raised in the second quarter financing activities and existing partnership debt capacity to support its ongoing growth initiatives, including the acquisition of the approximately 590 net megawatts of renewables from energy resources as well as previously announced acquisition of approximately 400 megawatts of operating wind projects, both of which are expected to close later this year.
let me now review the detailed results for nextera energy partners. second quarter adjusted ebitda of $350 million was roughly flat versus the prior year comparable quarter, driven by favorable contributions from the approximately 500 megawatts of new wind and solar projects acquired in 2020. weaker wind and solar resource in the second quarter, which reduced this quarter's adjusted ebitda contribution from existing projects by roughly $22 million was partially offset by positive contributions to adjusted ebitda from last year's repowerings and the texas pipelines.
wind resource for the quarter was 93% of the long-term average versus 100% in the second quarter of 2020. cash available for distribution of $151 million for the second quarter was also reduced for existing projects due to the distributions for the convertible equity portfolio financing entered into late last year. as a reminder, this convertible equity portfolio financing recapitalize nextera energy partners existing genesis solar project and other assets and the proceeds were used to fund last year's acquisition from energy resources.
additional details of our second quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide.
we remain on-track for the strong full year growth consistent with our long-term growth objectives of 12% to 15% distribution per unit growth through at least 2024. as i previously mentioned, we continue to execute on our plan to expand nextera energy partners portfolio with an agreement to acquire assets in a diverse portfolio of long-term contracted wind and solar projects from energy resources. the portfolio consists of approximately 830 megawatts of renewables, of which nextera energy partners will be acquiring an approximately 590-megawatt net interest. nextera energy partners interest in the portfolio will consist of approximately 510 megawatts of the universal scale wind and solar projects and approximately 80 megawatts of distributed solar projects, which is nextera energy partners first acquisition of distributed generation assets.
the portfolio to be acquired by nextera energy partners has a cash available for distribution, weighted average contract life of approximately 17 years and a counterparty credit rating of baa1 at moody's and bbb+ at s&p. additional details on the portfolio of assets to be acquired by nextera energy partners can be found in the appendix of today's presentation.
energy resources currently owns the country's largest portfolio of distributed generation assets with commercial and industrial customers and expects to triple its capital investment in distributed generation from 2020 through 2024. nextera energy partners expects to benefit from this expansion over the coming years through future acquisitions from energy resources. nextera energy partners expects to acquire the portfolio for a total consideration of $563 million, subject to working capital and other adjustments.
nextera energy partners share of the portfolio's debt and tax equity financing is estimated to be approximately $270 million at the time of closing. the acquisition is expected to contribute adjusted ebitda of approximately $90 million to $100 million and cash available for distribution of approximately $41 million to $49 million, each on a five-year average annual run rate basis beginning on december 31, 2021. the purchase price for the transaction is expected to be funded with existing liquidity and the transaction is expected to close prior to year-end and be immediately accretive to lp distributions.
nextera energy partners continues to expect to be in the upper end of our previously disclosed year-end 2021 run rate adjusted ebitda and cafd expectation ranges of $1.44 billion to $1.62 billion, and $600 million to $680 million, respectively. as a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated idr fees as we treat these as an operating expense.
from the base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in lp distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in february of 2022 to be in the range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit.
in summary, we remain as enthusiastic as ever about the long-term growth prospects both nextera energy and nextera energy partners. at nextera energy, we were honored to be named on time magazine's first-ever list of top-100 most influential companies, which highlights businesses making an extraordinary impact around the world. we are proud to be leading the clean energy transformation in our sector and remain focused on executing upon the opportunities presented by the significant growth in wind, solar and various forms of energy storage in the u.s. over the coming decades.
at fpl, including gulf power, that means continuing to deliver on our best-in-class customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability and clean energy solutions. at energy resources, our competitive advantages position us well to capture a meaningful share of the significant and expanding market for renewables.
and at nextera energy partners with its continued access to low-cost capital and accretive acquisition opportunities is well positioned as ever to take advantage of the clean energy transformation reshaping the energy industry.
that concludes our prepared remarks. and with that, we will open up the line for questions.

[operator instructions] and our first question comes from julien dumoulin-smith from bank of america. please go ahead with your question.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america -- analyst
hey, good morning, team. thank you for the time. i appreciate it. impressive continued results here. just if i can ask you at the outset here, can you perhaps describe how you see the backdrop here given the litany of different policy efforts underway around the availability of panel imports, and just how that positions your ability to execute right now. i certainly hear it echoing through your comments, but i just want to speak to that a little bit more specifically, if we can. and then subsequently, on the origination side, obviously, well down again. how do you think about the -- just the elevated energy price backdrop that we're seeing today? how quickly is that fomenting sort of a reinvigorated demand backdrop? and when could that materialize as you think about the backdrop in the '23, '24 backdrop or beyond?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
thank you, julien. i appreciate the questions, and good morning. as you even prefaced in your set of questions, we're pretty excited about the opportunities for both of the major businesses, both florida power & light and energy resources. and specifically on the renewable side and energy resources, the team just had an awesome origination quarter, and that's kind of on the heels of other awesome origination quarters going back now for quite some time, setting us up for tremendous growth in the coming years. so in terms of demand backdrop, to kind of answer the second question first, it's terrific, and we're really excited about the value proposition of renewables looking forward, both in terms of being low cost and the ability to decarbonize both the electricity sector and other sectors as we've talked about. it's been an exciting 18 months for our integrated supply chain and engineering construction teams. lots of opportunities to navigate uncertainties, likes of which we and the industry probably haven't seen in quite some time. and it's also in the midst of enormous growth for us, a record year of renewables deployment last year and another terrific capital deployment year this year, so both growth and opportunities to show what we can do. it's good to be us. i mean, we've highlighted that in the past in the sense of being large in this industry, having significant capital dollars to put to work, enables us to have strong relationships and extensive relationships with those in the supply chain to help navigate these uncertainties. we feel good about our ability to navigate them. the plan does get iterated from time to time as the circumstances change, but we feel good about the long-term view for renewables and our ability to deliver on our expectations.
james l. robo -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, julien. just --
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america -- analyst
go ahead, jim.
james l. robo -- chairman and chief executive officer
the only thing i'd add is i think people don't really appreciate the 10-year strip is up $1 since january. it's hugely positive for the renewable business, enormously positive, right? so --

our next question comes from steve fleishman from wolfe research. please go ahead with your question.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks and good morning. just could you maybe just give the name of the -- who the counterparty is for the green hydrogen project?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yes, prefer not to, steve. we're obviously really excited about the opportunity to supply them and provide this energy, and we think it is a great start to the hydrogen economy. but we'll leave that discussion for a later date.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. and then just on the -- a different way to ask the supply chain question. just within your -- obviously, you had a lot to your backlog. if you look at the existing backlog, did anything move around meaningfully between years --
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
not meaningfully.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
in the backlog?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
i appreciate the question. no, nothing that i would consider to be meaningful at all. there's a couple of projects that moved out and a couple of projects that moved in, in terms of time frames, but very much consistent with our expectations. and as i highlighted at a very high level in response to julien's question, we feel good about our plans of bringing in the projects we expect to bring into service in 2021 and have good line of sight for executing on the development plans thereafter.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. and then last question, just obviously, i have to ask about the dc and the proposed clean energy credits and the reconciliation, etc., maybe just latest thoughts on what's most important to you and the likelihood and path to passage, how you're feeling about it?
james l. robo -- chairman and chief executive officer
so steve, it's jim. i would say that we remain cautiously optimistic that something happens on that front. i think i said earlier, if there is a reconciliation bill, i would be shocked if there isn't a long-term extension of the credits embedded in that. and i think that's reasonably high odds if the democrats can come to terms among themselves around what would be in the reconciliation bill. and that's not an easy -- as we've seen play out over the last several weeks, that's not an easy -- that's not easy and there's, obviously, within that, that caught us [phonetic] a lot of varying views across the board. but i think -- so i remain cautiously optimistic that something happens there. and then if something happens there, we feel good about the fact that there will be a long-term extension of the credits and that there will be support for other types of clean energy such as hydrogen, a stand-alone storage itc, etc. so, yes, it would be very constructive for us. we think it's an important part of the decarbonization of the us economy to accelerate that. and i mean, we've increasingly -- as we think about our own strategy going forward, we're increasingly thinking about ourselves as the company that's going to lead not only the clean energy transformation of the electric grid, but really the clean energy transformation of the us economy and the decarbonization of the us economy because the electric grid is going to be the key to decarbonizing the transport sector, it's going to be the key to decarbonizing the industrial sector. and so we're really positioning ourselves to be the leader there and i feel very good about both the policy tailwinds that we have as well as how our business is executing along those goals.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
and i'm sorry, just one follow-up. the -- this wind project for green hydrogen, is it -- does it depend on the hydrogen ptc passing? or does it happen either way?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
no, it's a contract with the customer irrespective of any sort of subsequent policy changes.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
thank you, steve.

our next question comes from shar pourreza from guggenheim partners. please go ahead with your question.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
hey, good morning guys.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
good morning, shar.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
look, i just wanted to maybe just drill down a little bit more on the backlog there. can you just maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the higher input costs for projects? i mean, we've seen some headwinds from developers and manufacturers recently on the labor, steel, transportation, etc. what do you -- and we're hearing some commercial and utility scale projects are being pushed out. what are you seeing -- are you seeing any impact to the project economics, especially for the ones that are marginal? is anyone kind of with signed contracts maybe bulking, especially if the ppa terms are somewhat flexible as we think about when a shovel needs to be put in the ground? so you're not seeing it right now, but is there any inkling on potential projects potentially being shifted out as buyers wait for some input cost relief?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
shar, i'm not sure i'm following completely the question. are you asking whether or not there are other projects -- not our projects, but other projects that might be experiencing those? or are you asking for us? because i wasn't sure who the buyers were in that -- in your question.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
sorry, specifically for your projects.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
we are not having any -- anything notable from a buyer perspective. and from our customers' perspective, we have a contract, and we are expecting to execute against what's laid out in those contracts. and from a supply chain standpoint, i think, we're very well positioned to navigate these uncertainties. and as i highlighted, line of sight of bringing out the projects that we intend to bring in in '21 into service and have great plans for executing against our '22 development program. and obviously, beyond that, one, there's a lot still to be seen as to what those conditions will ultimately be because now we're talking two-plus years out. but a great team and a great position in the industry to be able to navigate those. from a customer standpoint, we're continuing to see strong demand for new renewables. i think that's obvious from the contract signings that we were able to announce today, and john and his team have terrific backlog beyond that of opportunities that we have yet to sign and the team is really excited about being out in the field and talking with our customers. it is just a terrific time for renewables in our industry.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
got it. thank you for that. thanks for the elaboration. maybe just quickly shifting to the regulated utility, just wondering also how much more headroom from incremental o&m efficiencies do you still anticipate from the legacy gulf asset? and how is that sort of headroom impacted from the recent run-up in commodity costs, mainly natural gas, right? so a bit of an efficiency and bill headroom question embedded there.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
sure, shar. and obviously, we continue to work diligently at now what's going to be fpl going forward, particularly assuming the settlement agreement is approved next week by the commission, gulf will be fully incorporated into the broader fpl enterprise. it largely is today, but obviously, from a regulatory standpoint, operates separately at least through the end of this year. we think there are continued opportunities to focus on optimization across the businesses. that's part of what we do as a company, is look for those opportunities to take opportunities to bring efficiencies to the business, and of course, invest capital to take cost out and lower fuel costs over time. one of the great ways that fpl, and that includes gulf as part of it, will be to continue to deploy solar over the long term, because as you all well know, not only does it have the clean energy benefits, but it has low operating costs and no fuel costs, which will be a great offset in diversification in the state of florida from our existing generation set. so i think there's continued opportunities. there's still a lot of work to be done. we focus hard on that every day and we think the team is all the cards in the hand to be able to continue executing.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
got it. so i guess, just not to paraphrase, but the recent jump in gas, and obviously, jim highlighted the move in the forwards, that shouldn't really impact sort of the bill headroom just given the other leverage you have at the business?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yes. so shar, i would think if you look back at where we have taken the opportunity to invest capital historically, it really is on bringing long-term value to our customers. so being able to deliver lower cost over time, higher reliability, greater resilience, greater diversification and those clean energy benefits, and it would be short-sighted to stop investing in opportunities that are really clearly good for customers. we're very mindful of customer bills. you hear that from us from every day -- in all of our communications and it's what we focus on day to day, is making sure we have a terrific value proposition for our customers, and we will do everything we can to moderate those impacts over time.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
terrific. thank you very much. appreciate it.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
thank you.

our next question comes from michael lapides from goldman sachs. please go ahead with your question.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, guys. thank you for taking my question. i have one or two here. first of all, the water and wastewater utility system acquisitions in texas, can you talk about just the size and scale of the capital you're employing there for that? and then more long-term, kind of more strategic, how do you think about the opportunity for growth in that business? is it more organic? is it more kind of continuing to roll up neighboring systems? or are you thinking about a national strategy here?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
hey, michael, and good morning, and thanks for the question. we did include in the prepared remarks, the comment about the $45 million, and that $45 million includes both the acquisition of the regulated utility assets as well as that innovative water reuse and reclamation project that we talked about it also on energy resources. so in terms of our capital program, investing $15 billion a year and more over time, it's pretty small. but we referenced it for a good reason, and that's because we're excited about the opportunities. i think it's a lot like transmission in the sense that it will be built slowly over time and create opportunities for us to continue to have that regulated and long-term contracted base of value creation for shareholders. on the other part, the kind of innovative use and reclamation project that we talked about on the energy resources side, those also bring clean energy renewable opportunities as we're able to bring this broad suite of clean energy and esg focused investment opportunities for our commercial and industrial customers. that gives us the opportunity to have a deep relationship with them, not just bring one solution, but bring a portfolio of options to them. so we think it's a terrific opportunity for energy resources team to develop those meaningful relationships with our customers. so it's both an investment and a strategic opportunity from our perspective.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. and then one question on seabrook, and i know in the grand scheme of its [phonetic] earnings power, seabrook, while it's a large plant, is nowhere near the biggest contributor of that. but just curious, how should we think about how much you financially hedge seabrook? i'm just thinking about given the move in forward power prices, and jim referenced the move in natural gas dollar increase in the strip, how we should think about whether seabrook actually benefits from that materially or had you already significantly hedged it out prior?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yes. so we have an ongoing hedging program that we execute ratably over time, executing a percentage of seabrook's forward generation. so i would characterize it as pretty well hedged in the next couple of years. and then as you get out into the latter part of the 2020s and into the 2030s and beyond, less so. so it obviously would benefit that -- if you mark-to-market that forward position, clearly, there's been some upside with the increase in natural gas prices and some of the congestion you've seen in the northeast in terms of electricity prices. whether that lasts in the long term, i think, remains to be seen, but certainly an opportunity for seabrook. we continue to believe seabrook is very well placed. it is in a particularly advantageous load zone. it's obviously in a region that values clean energy deeply. and you think about broad decarbonization in any part of the us, including the northeast, well-positioned nuclear assets will be a key part of making that happen. so we very much appreciate the -- our nuclear team and think they do a terrific job every day and seabrook is a key part of that.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thank you. much appreciated.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
thank you, michael.

our next question comes from maheep mandloi from credit suisse. please go ahead with your question.
maheep mandloi -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking the question. two on nep actually. one on the multiple for the acquisition comes out around 11 times ebitda versus the 9 times we saw for the prior two acquisitions, so job done. i just want to understand, has that been new normal you're seeing for asset acquisitions or anything specific to these projects? and just the second one on the 2022 cafd walk, just want to confirm if it includes any repayment for the first blackrock cepf closed in 2018. thanks.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
so i'll come back to the second question. in terms of the transaction, as we highlighted, it was a third-party transaction, so it reflects a negotiated outcome. and we continue to believe that the renewable sector remains of high interest for a lot of folks and expect it to be competitive over time. but i think you can see with this transaction and with a prior third-party transaction that we announced and closed earlier this year, there are some specific advantages that nextera energy partners has, both in its ability to find attractive financing, but also the relationship it has with nextera energy resources of being able to add value on the operating side and bring to bear all of the scale benefits that we have. so in terms of the second part of the question, i think you were asking about the 2018 cepf, and ultimately, the conversion that will happen in the very latter part of this year. and we're still -- obviously, some significant part of that gets converted up to 70% of it in nep units and the balance is paid in cash. and we are still working through what the full impacts are and how we will finance that over time. but as we've laid out in terms of our run rate expectations, we will expect that year-end '22 to be in the ranges that we outlined today.
maheep mandloi -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it now. thanks for taking the questions.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer

our next question comes from durgesh chopra from evercore isi. please go ahead with your question.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, good morning, team. thank you for taking my question. i just wanted to go back to the water utility acquisition strategy a bit. obviously, this is in texas, but there's obviously a ton of small municipal systems across the country, which are sort of owned by small mom-and-pop type facilities. just are you going to sort of be more aggressive throughout the country? or is there something specific about taxes as we think about you sort of competing for these small water utility systems?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yes, i think it's a great question. as we've highlighted -- i highlighted, obviously, in the prepared remarks, and jim has highlighted elsewhere in recent months, we're really excited about building a significant presence in the water business. and we think there's a lot of skills and capabilities, and of course, the broad platform we have that we could bring real value in these acquisitions. but as you highlighted, they tend to be very small, and whether they're privately owned or owned by municipalities, almost irregardless of the ownership structure, they tend to be small. even the one i talked about today is incorporated with something else, and it totals up $45 million in context of our $15 billion capital program. so i expect us to be active. there's probably some regions of the us, where the team in the near term, will be more active than others for a variety of reasons, but it's probably not exclusively texas and it will build over time. and we'll let you know if the team continues to have success.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. thank you for the time.

our next question comes from jeremy tonet from jpmorgan. please go ahead with your question.
jeremy tonet -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, good morning.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
good morning.
jeremy tonet -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thanks. just want to pivot back to hydrogen for a minute, if we could here. and just want to see on what timeline do you see green hydrogen being competitive? and how much money is nee currently spending on hydrogen -- hydrogen projects, and where could that ramp to over time?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
i think it's a great question. i think in the electricity sector, when it's going to be particularly relevant is the latter part of the 2020s into 2030s and beyond. and for the key reason for that being that you really need to have the need for long-duration storage, and it is particularly attractive when you have very, very low cost energy input, and particularly, low cost renewables, which will inevitably have when you have substantial renewable deployment, again, probably in the latter part of the 2020s and beyond. what may be different is in the transportation and industrial sector, where there's already built-in use of gray hydrogen and other fossil fuels that could be supplanted with green hydrogen when it's competitive. the big question mark would be whether or not there's a hydrogen production tax credit ultimately in the final reconciliation bill. clearly, there's one anticipated today, and at $3 a kilogram production tax credit, that really closes the gap between gray hydrogen and green hydrogen alternatives. and so that's a terrific opportunity to see growth in the near term, and what that would represent is using green hydrogen alternatives to supplant gray hydrogen. from our perspective, that opportunity is clearly to build a lot of renewables and you saw the first step in that direction in our announcement today about a power purchase agreement that we've entered into. but there would be more -- a lot more like that in not just the renewable side, but also an opportunity for us to invest in the actual hydrogen production equipment such as the electrolyzer. so we'll see. we'll know a lot more in january once we've seen the final package, if there is one, as jim highlighted and it will develop over time in terms of opportunities. we think it's exceptionally likely. it's really just a matter of timing.
jeremy tonet -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. that's very helpful. and then maybe just pivoting over real quick toward transmission, obviously, to optimize and maximize renewables deployment for the country, transmission build-out is a key ingredient there. yet it's -- as you well know, it's difficult and timely to complete. just wondering, i guess, your latest thoughts on what expectations you might have for transmission build-out and what role nee could play there?
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
yes. we're really excited about transmission opportunities. our nextera energy transmission team has built a terrific business over the last decade with a number of organic wins as well as some acquisitions, as we've talked about in the past of, not only trans bay cable, but gridliance more recently, and we see a ton of opportunities going forward for us to be successful in winning some of those big opportunities to invest, realizing great returns, but also the strategic side of it of ensuring that it happens so that we can continue to realize the substantial renewables build-out that we already are seeing, and we expect to only continue to grow in this opportunity size over time. it may not be imperative today to have new transmission, but it's really, really important to start today because it will be imperative in the next decade and some of the policy considerations that ferc is undertaking today could be helpful to bringing that to reality over time.
jeremy tonet -- jpmorgan -- analyst
great. thank you so much for the color.

operator
good morning, everyone, and welcome to the nextera energy and nextera energy partners q3 2021 earnings call. all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [operator instructions] please also note, today's event is being recorded.
at this time, i'd like to turn the conference call over to jessica aldridge, director of investor relations. ma'am, please go ahead.
jessica aldridge -- director of investor relations
thank you, jamie. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2021 combined earnings conference call for nextera energy and nextera energy partners.
with me this morning are jim robo, chairman and chief executive officer of nextera energy; rebecca kujawa, executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy; john ketchum, president and chief executive officer of nextera energy resources; and mark hickson, executive vice president of nextera energy, all of whom are also officers of nextera energy partners; as well as eric silagy, president and chief executive officer of florida power & light company. rebecca will provide an overview of our results, and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.
we will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the securities and exchange commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
today's presentation also includes references to non-gaap financial measures. you should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-gaap measures to the closest gaap financial measure.
as a reminder, gulf power legally merged into florida power & light company effective on january 1, 2021. gulf power will continue as a separate reportable segment within florida power & light and nextera energy through 2021, serving its existing customers under separate retail rates. throughout today's presentation, when we refer to fpl, we are referring to florida power & light, excluding gulf power, unless otherwise noted or when using the term combined.
with that, i will turn the call over to rebecca.
rebecca j. kujawa -- executive vice president, finance and chief financial officer
thank you, jessica, and good morning, everyone. nextera energy delivered strong third quarter results with adjusted earnings per share increasing by approximately 12% year-over-year. both the principal businesses executed well on major initiatives and we continue to advance our opportunity set for new renewables and storage. building upon the solid progress made in the first half of the year, nextera energy is well positioned to meet its overall objectives for 2021 and beyond.
earlier this month, we were honored to be named on fortune's 2021 change the world list, the only electric utility in the world to be recognized. this recognition is a testament to nextera energy's best-in-class position in the renewable energy sector and our continued commitment to the customers and communities that we serve.
at fpl, net income increased approximately 10% versus the prior-year comparable period, reflecting contributions from continued investment in the business. most notably, during the quarter, we reached what we believe is a fair and constructive long-term settlement agreement with a number of intervenors in our rate case, continuing a long history of negotiated outcomes that benefit both customers and shareholders.
we believe the agreement, if approved, should enable us to continue to focus on operating the business efficiently while investing in the future to ensure resilience, reliability, affordability and clean energy for generations to come in florida. we expect the florida public service commission to vote on our agreement at its agenda conference on october 26, and i'll provide more details on the proposed agreement in a few minutes.
fpl's major capital initiatives continue to progress well, including what will be the world's largest integrated solar power battery system, the 409-megawatt fpl manatee energy storage center that is now 75% complete and on track to begin serving customers later this year.
gulf power also had a great quarter of execution, and its strong year-to-date financial performance is attributable to continued successful implementation of the cost reduction initiatives and smart capital investments that we previously outlined. gulf power's year-to-date net income contribution increased approximately 14% versus the prior-year comparable period. and we remain focused on improving gulf power value proposition by providing lower costs, higher reliability, outstanding customer service and clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers.
at energy resources, adjusted earnings for the quarter increased by approximately 12% year-over-year. our development team had another terrific quarter of new renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 2,160 megawatt to our backlog since the last earnings call, marking the best quarter of overall origination and the best quarter of new wind additions in energy resources' history. these backlog additions include approximately 225 megawatts of combined solar and storage projects and a 500 megawatt wind project that is intended to power an adjacent new green hydrogen facility, which i'll provide some additional details on in just a few minutes. we continue to expect that our competitive advantages will drive meaningful growth in renewables and various forms of energy storage at energy resources in the coming years, as the trend toward broad decarbonization across many facets of the us economy takes hold.
overall, with three strong quarters complete in 2021, we are pleased with the progress we are making at nextera energy, and we are well positioned to achieve the full-year financial expectations that we have previously discussed subject to our usual caveats.
now, let's look at the detailed results, beginning with fpl. for the third quarter of 2021, fpl reported net income of $836 million or $0.42 per share, which is an increase of $79 million and $0.04 per share, respectively year-over-year. regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 10.5% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of fpl's year-over-year net income growth of approximately 10%.
fpl's capital expenditures were approximately $1.5 billion in the third quarter and we expect its full-year capital investments to total between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion. our reported roe for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ended september 2021. during the quarter, we restored $124 million of reserve amortization, leaving fpl with a balance of $597 million.
as you know, much of the east coast of the us was recently impacted by hurricane ida, which made landfall on the gulf coast as a category 4 hurricane and also caused catastrophic flooding across the northeastern us. our deepest sympathies are with those that have been impacted by ida's widespread destruction. we value deeply the industry's commitment to mutual assistance and we were fortunate to be in a position to assist other utilities this year. as part of our assistance efforts, we sent more than 1,250 of our employees and contractors as well as transmission equipment and other supplies to help rebuild the grid to support the restoration efforts of the impacted utilities.
let me now turn to gulf power, which reported third quarter 2021 net income of $91 million or $0.05 per share. gulf power's third quarter eps contribution was flat versus the prior-year comparable quarter. as a reminder, the third quarter of 2020 benefited from the reversal of covid-19 related expenses that had occurred earlier in that year.
during the quarter, gulf power's regulatory capital employed grew by approximately 13% year-over-year. gulf power's capital expenditures were approximately $200 million during the third quarter and we expect its full-year capital investments to be roughly $800 million. for the full year 2021, we continue to expect gulf power's regulatory roe to be in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%.
all of our major capital initiatives at gulf power are progressing well. gulf power anticipates bringing approximately 150 megawatts of cost effective zero emission solar capacity online within the next six months. the north florida resiliency connection, which among other things, will allow customers to benefit from greater diversity in solar output across the two different time zones, is expected to be in service in mid-2022. these continued smart capital investments in renewables and core infrastructure are expected to drive customer benefits for many years to come.
during the quarter, gulf power was impacted by tropical storm fred, which experienced an unexpected change in path before striking the service territory. through a restoration workforce of roughly 1,700 personnel, gulf power was able to restore its service to essentially all of the approximately 20,000 customers impacted by fred in northwest florida in less than 24 hours. moreover, the average customer outage was restored in less than 2 hours. our culture of preparation, including our annual storm drills and the team's focused execution helped ensure an efficient, timely and safe response to the tropical storm.
the economy in florida continues to grow at a healthy pace and remains among the strongest in the nation. florida's labor force participation rate has recovered to its highest level in nearly 18 months reflecting the ongoing recovery, following the onset of the covid-19 pandemic last year. the real estate sector in florida also continues to grow with a three-month average new housing starts up over 40% year-over-year. in august alone, there are -- there were twice as many new housing starts in florida than in the average over the last 10 years.
florida building permits, a leading indicator of residential new service accounts, are up 47% year-over-year and have outpaced the nation's quarterly growth by 32%. as another indicator of florida's economic health, florida's retail sales index is up nearly 60% versus the prior year.
during the quarter, fpl's average number of customers increased by approximately 77,500 or 1.5% from the comparable year prior quarter driven by continued solid underlying population growth. fpl's third quarter retail sales decreased 1.4% from the prior-year comparable period. a decline in weather related usage per customer of approximately 2.7% offset the benefits of customer growth. on a weather-normalized basis, third quarter sales increased 1.3% with continued strong underlying usage contributing favorably.
for gulf power, the average number of customers grew 1.6% versus the comparable prior-year quarter. and gulf power's third quarter retail sales increased 0.6% year-over-year with strong usage from increased customer growth contributing favorably.
as a reminder, on march 12th, we initiated florida power & light's 2021 base rate proceeding for rate relief beginning in january of 2022. after months of negotiation, we reached a proposed settlement agreement in early august with a number of intervenors in the proceeding. the office of public counsel, the florida retail federation, the florida industrial power users group, the southern alliance for clean energy, vote solar, the cleo institute and the federal executive agencies all joined the agreement, reflecting a broad set of constituents across our customer base.
the four-year proposed agreement, which begins on january 2022 provides for retail base revenue adjustments as shown on the accompanying slide and allowed regulatory return on equity of 10.6% with a range of 9.7% to 11.7%, and no change to fpl's equity ratio from investor sources for the combined system. should the average 30-year us treasury yields be 2.49% or greater over any consecutive six-month period during the term of the agreement, florida power & light's allowed regulatory roe would increase to 10.8% with a range of 9.8% to 11.8%. additionally, if federal or state permanent corporate income tax changes become effective during the term of the proposed agreement, florida power & light would be able to prospectively adjust base rates after review of the impacts on base revenue requirements.
the proposed agreement also includes flexibility over the four-year term to amortize up to $1.45 billion of depreciation reserve surplus. consistent with the rate plan filed in march, the proposed settlement agreement would unify the rates and tariffs of fpl and gulf power by implementing a five-year transition rider and credit mechanism to address the initial differences in cost of serving the existing fpl and gulf power customers.
additionally, the proposed settlement agreement also provides for solar base rate adjustments or sobra, upon reaching commercial operations of up to 894 megawatts annually of new solar generation in each of 2024 and 2025, subject to a cost cap of $1,250 per kilowatt and showing an overall cost effectiveness for fpl's customers. fpl would also be authorized to expand its solartogether voluntary community solar program by constructing an additional 1,788 megawatts of solar generation through 2025, which would more than double the size of our current solartogether program and is expected to save our customers millions of dollars over the lifetime of the assets.
in addition to solar energy, the settlement agreement would support fpl's green hydrogen pilot project in okeechobee county. this innovative technology could one day unlock 100% carbon-free electricity that's available 24 hours a day. the proposed settlement agreement also introduces several electric vehicle programs and pilots designed to accelerate the growth of electric vehicle adoption and charging infrastructure investment across florida with a total capital investment of more than $200 million.
under the proposed agreement, fpl would continue to recover prudently incurred storm costs consistent with the framework in the current settlement agreement. future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition, but capped at an amount that could produce a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt hour of usage on residential bills in the first 12 months of cost recovery. any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. if storm restoration costs were to exceed $800 million in any given calendar year, fpl could request an increase to the $4 surcharge.
we believe the proposed settlement is fair, balanced and constructive and supports our continued ability to provide highly reliable, low cost service for our customers through the end of the decade. fpl's typical resident bill is lower today than it was 15 years ago and is well below the national average. the proposed agreement would keep typical residential bills well below the national average and among the lowest in florida through 2025.
let me now turn to energy resources, which reported third quarter 2021 gaap losses of $428 million or $0.22 per share. adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $619 million or $0.31 per share, which is an increase of $68 million and $0.03 per share, respectively year-over-year. the effect of mark-to-market on non-qualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings, was the primary driver of the difference between energy resources' third quarter gaap and adjusted earnings results.
contributions from new investments added $0.03 per share relative to the prior year comparable quarter, primarily reflecting continued growth in our contracted renewables and battery storage program. the contribution from existing generation assets increased $0.01 per share year-over-year.
our customer supply and trading business contribution was $0.02 higher year-over-year due to favorable market conditions in our retail supply and power marketing businesses. all other impacts decreased results by $0.03 per share versus 2020, driven primarily by miscellaneous tax items.
as i mentioned earlier, energy resources' development team had a record quarter of origination success, adding approximately 2,160 megawatts to our backlog. since our last earnings call, we have added approximately 1,240 megawatts of new wind projects, 515 megawatts of new solar projects and 345 megawatts of new storage assets to our renewables and storage backlog. in addition, our backlog increased by energy resources' share of nextera energy partners' planned acquisition of an approximately 100 megawatt operating wind project that the partnership is announcing today.
through the three -- first three quarters of 2021, we have added more than 5,700 megawatts to our renewables and storage backlog. energy resources' backlog of signed contracts now stands at approximately 18,100 megawatts. at this early stage, we have made terrific progress toward our long-term development expectations with more than 7,600 megawatts of projects already in our post 2022 backlog.
our backlog additions for the third quarter include a 500 megawatt wind project, the majority of which is contracted with a hydrogen fuel cell company. the project's customer intends to construct a nearby hydrogen electrolyzer facility that will use the wind energy production to supply up to 100% of the facility's load requirements. the hydrogen manufactured by the facility would enable commercial and industrial end users to replace their current gray hydrogen and fossil fuel purchases with emissions-free green hydrogen, further accelerating the decarbonization of the industrial and transportation sectors.
energy resources also add nearly 300 megawatts of battery storage projects in california, and we continue to experience significant demand from california based utilities and commercial and industrial customers for reliable energy storage solutions. we are currently developing nearly 2,400 megawatts of additional co-located and stand-alone battery storage projects in california with the potential to be deployed in 2023 and 2024, to enhance reliability and help meet the state's energy storage capacity requirements and ambitious clean energy goals. more than 30 years, we have been investing in clean energy in california and are proud to help the state lead the country to a carbon-free sustainable future.
consistent with our focus on growing our rate regulated and long-term contracted business operations, during the third quarter, energy resources entered into an agreement to acquire a portfolio of rate regulated water and wastewater utility assets in eight counties near houston, texas. the proposed acquisition expands our regulated utility business in an attractive market with significant expected customer growth and furthers our strategy to build a world class water utility in the coming years. subject to regulatory approvals, the acquisition is expected to close in 2022.
energy resources is also currently in construction on an innovative water reuse and reclamation project that would help our customer achieve significant savings on its water supply needs and make its operations more efficient and sustainable while at the same time, delivering attractive returns to energy resources. while the roughly $45 million total equity investment for these transactions is small in context of our overall capital program, we are optimistic about the strong growth anticipated in this new market and the potential for clean water solutions to generate additional contracted renewables opportunities going forward.
turning now to the consolidated results for nextera energy. for the third quarter of 2021, gaap net income attributable to nextera energy was $447 million or $0.23 per share. nextera energy's 2021 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted eps were $1.48 billion and $0.75 per share, respectively. adjusted results from corporate and other segment increased by $0.01 year-over-year.
our long-term financial expectations through 2023 remain unchanged. for 2021, nextera energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.54 and we would be disappointed not to be at or near the high-end of this range. while we are pleased with our year-to-date results, which have exceeded the top end of our growth rate expectations so far for the year, we expect the fourth quarter results to include impacts from certain liability management activities that we are currently reviewing to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. these initiatives could generate negative adjusted eps impacts of as much as $0.08 to $0.10 in the fourth quarter before translating to favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders.
looking further ahead, for 2022 and 2023, nextera energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share, and we would be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top-end of these ranges in 2022 and 2023. our earnings expectations are supported by what we believe is the most attractive organic investment opportunity set in our industry. from 2018 to 2023, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate range. we also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. as always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions.
let me now turn to nextera energy partners, which performed well and delivered third quarter results generally in line with our expectations. yesterday, the nextera energy partners board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.685 per common unit or $2.74 per common unit on an annualized basis, continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top-end of our 12% to 15% per year growth range. inclusive of this increase, nextera energy partners has now grown its distribution per unit by more than 265% since the ipo.
nextera energy partners continues to execute against its growth initiatives during the quarter. since the last earnings call, nextera energy partners closed on its previously announced acquisitions of approximately 400 megawatts of operating wind projects from a third party and approximately 590 net megawatts of geographically diverse wind and solar projects from energy resources. in addition, today, we are announcing an agreement to acquire an approximately 100 megawatt operating wind asset in california from a third party to further expand nextera energy partners portfolio and enhance its long-term growth visibility. the project is located in a strategic market with strong expected growth in renewables demand, and it also offers significant optionality to nextera energy partners in terms of operational savings and long-term value creation.
nextera energy partners intends to purchase the asset for a total consideration of approximately $280 million, subject to closing adjustments, which includes the assumption of approximately $150 million in existing project finance debt estimated at the time of closing. nextera energy partners expects to recapitalize this project finance debt in 2022 as it executes on its overall financing plan for the year. we expect to fund the approximately $130 million balance of the purchase price using existing debt capacity. subject to regulatory approvals, the acquisition is expected to close later this year or in 2022. following the project debt paydown next year, the asset is expected to contribute adjusted ebitda and unlevered cash available for distribution of approximately $22 million to $27 million, each on a five-year average run rate -- annual run rate basis beginning december 31, 2022.
nextera energy partners continues to leverage its competitive advantages to be successful in third-party m&a and extend its long runway of growth. consistent with our long-term growth prospects, today, we are also introducing year-end 2022 run rate expectations, which are built upon its strong existing portfolio cash generation and continued ability to access low cost capital to acquire accretive renewable energy projects. overall, we are pleased with the year-to-date execution at nextera energy partners and we believe we are well positioned to continue delivering lp unitholder value going forward.
now, let's look at the detailed results. third quarter adjusted ebitda was $334 million, up approximately 7% from the prior year comparable quarter due to growth in the underlying portfolio. new projects, which primarily reflect the asset acquisitions that closed at the end of 2020 and the recently closed acquisition of 391 megawatts of operating wind assets from a third party, contributed $23 million. existing assets contributed $7 million, primarily driven by the wind repowerings that occurred in the fourth quarter of last year and an improvement in wind resource. wind resource for the third quarter was 101% of the long-term average versus 96% in the third quarter of 2020. these favorable impacts were partially offset by lower solar resource in the third quarter of this year.
cash available for distribution of $158 million for the third quarter declined by $4 million versus the prior year, primarily as a result of lower year-over-year paygo payments after a weaker wind resource period in the second quarter of this year. as a reminder, nextera energy partners recapitalized its genesis solar project and other existing assets at the end of last year and the impact of this new project level financing cost versus the prior year was offset by an associated reduction in corporate level interest expense as reflected in our other category. additional details of our third quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide. on a year-to-date basis versus 2020, adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution have increased by roughly 9% and 6%, respectively. and nextera energy partners remains well positioned to continue to deliver on its outstanding growth objectives.
we continue to expect nextera energy partners portfolio to support an annualized rate of fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in february of 2022 to be in the range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit. from a base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in lp distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024.
nextera energy partners continues to expect to be in the upper end of our previously disclosed year-end 2021 run rate adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution expectation ranges of $1.44 billion to $1.62 billion and $600 million to $680 million, respectively. we expect to achieve our 2022 distribution growth of 12% to 15% while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the low 80% range. by year-end 2022, we expect the run rate for adjusted ebitda to be in the range of $1.775 billion to $1.975 billion and run rate for cash available for distribution to be in the range of $675 million to $765 million. at the midpoint, these revised expectations ranges reflect estimated growth in adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution of roughly 23% and 13%, respectively, from the comparable year-end 2021 run rate expectations. these growth rates are supported by our strong execution against our long-term growth objectives in 2021, including opportunistic third-party transactions that were not previously in our plan. as a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated idr fees as we treat these as an operating expense.
finally, during the quarter, s&p updated its ratings methodology for nextera energy partners. and in particular, it will now evaluate nextera energy partners debt metrics on a funds from operations or ffo to debt basis with a downgrade threshold of 14% instead of a debt-to-ebitda basis. we believe that the combination of s&p's updated methodology, its assessment of nextera energy partners improving diversity and its use of less conservative assumptions in the portfolios and renewable generation cash flows will allow for several hundred million dollars more of financing flexibility relative to our previous assumptions, providing the partnership with even greater flexibility going forward to finance accretive acquisition for the benefit of our unitholders.
in summary, we continue to believe that both nextera energy and nextera energy partners have some of the best opportunity sets and execution track records in the industry and we remain as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects.
that concludes our prepared remarks. and with that, we will open up the line for questions.

[operator instructions] the first question comes from julien dumoulin-smith with bank of america. please go ahead.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good morning, team. and thank you for the time and congratulations to everyone here. so many folks so well deserved. indeed, jim, we'll miss you, but we'll see you soon enough here, i'm sure.
jim robo -- chairman and chief executive officer of nextera energy
thank you.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
absolutely. if i can pivot here just to some of the core questions. first off, just impressive guidance. can you talk about how you're thinking about bbb? i mean, maybe the way to ask this is a little bit in reverse.
how do you think about bbb is that it actually happened here? what assumptions are you making out in '25 on extensions or which frankly appear more likely than not eventually anyway? and perhaps more directly, how are you thinking about investments beyond wind and solar in those 2025 figures, for instance, storage or hydrogen, for instance?
jim robo -- chairman and chief executive officer of nextera energy
so julien, let me take that. so we don't need bbb to deliver on the expectations that we've just laid out, right? i think about bbb as an accelerator, not as that is something that we would need in order to deliver on what we just laid out in terms of the earnings or the backlog growth that we've projected through '24. in terms of how am i feeling about bbb, i would say two things. i am optimistic about something happening some point this year.
and i would say that might -- when i say optimistic, i would say more likely than not. i think i was -- i think i felt more optimistic in the fourth quarter than i do now. i think that's just reality. but i do think it's more likely than not that the clean energy piece of bbb gets acted on this year.
i do think it's going to take a while. and everything we have heard says there is particularly in the senate, i think a desire for some process and process takes time, given the senate rules. and my sense is that it's not going to be first quarter event, it's going to be post that either a second quarter event or honestly, probably more likely sometime in the fourth quarter after the election.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah, i got you there. feel free to open any more on the '25 guidance. i know that it's probably pre-empting a little bit the june analyst day, regardless. and then maybe if i could pivot in brief, any thoughts or comments you'd like to share around some of the headlines pertaining to fpl here? i know there's been a lot of back and forth and perhaps there's a lot of context to provide there.
jim robo -- chairman and chief executive officer of nextera energy
sure, julien. i think on some of the florida political headlines, i think what i'd like to say on that is pretty simple. when we got -- when we received the report and those allegations that have been in the press. we conducted a very extensive and thorough investigation that included looking at company financial records.
it includes looking at everyone who was named in its company emails also looking at their -- they've all provided access to their personal emails and text to us as part of that investigation. and the bottom line is we found no evidence of any issues at all, any illegality or any wrongdoing on the part of fpl or any of its employees. and so that's kind of the bottom line. and i feel very good about the investigation that we did and i feel very good that there is no basis to any of these allegations.
so i think that's probably all that we're going to say on that today. and i think rebecca is going to talk about the 2025, your question on 2025.
rebecca kujawa -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy
julien, as you might appreciate and i'm sure everyone does on the call. when we think about our ranges of expectations, particularly when we're talking about several years out, like you asked about specifically 2025, there are quite a number of variables that we consider in order to set those ranges. and in particular, for the comment that we provided that we'd be disappointed not to be at the high end of each of those ranges, including 2025. i would say the key parts that we think about, first on florida power and light company, we've got the outcome from the four-year settlement agreement that is now the -- how we expect to operate for the next couple of years and that creates the opportunity to continue investing in the business.
and executing on the strategy that's been so successful for customers over quite a number of years looking back, so we can continue that for the next couple of years. and we believe that, that will enable us to grow rate base in the range of 8% to 9% on a compound annual growth rate basis, assuming all of the investments that were anticipated in the settlement agreement, ultimately, we're able to successfully bring into service. on the energy resources side, the biggest drivers are the ones that we've talked about and are laid out in the slide materials on page 16. looking at our development ranges for all of wind, solar, energy storage and wind repowering over this four-year period from '21 through 2024, which, obviously, would have the largest impact on what our earnings look like in 2025.
as jim highlighted, if there's change in regulatory or incentive structures, we would obviously factor that in the future. but that's not anticipated in these estimates and we feel really good about how we're positioned to execute between now and then. we do have to execute a lot. we have to execute the energy resources, which i'm excited to take on that challenge.
we have a lot to do to continue delivering like we have at florida power and light, but i think we're in a great position to do so.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
excellent, team. best of luck. speak soon.
rebecca kujawa -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy
thank you, julien.

the next question comes from steve fleishman with wolfe research. please go ahead.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
yeah, thanks. good moring. congrats, jim and john and everyone else. so maybe jim, could you just give us a little more color on what you are going to focus your time on as executive chair? and how long you intend to likely be in that role?
jim robo -- chairman and chief executive officer of nextera energy
sure, steve. so i think my focus is going to be to help john with the transition and in particular, help john with the transition as it relates to the board. you should think about my transition time in terms of months, not years. and that's probably all we're ready to say about it today.
but my real focus is going to be on making john as successful as i know he will be.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok, that's helpful. second question, just on the renewable development. maybe you could just talk a little bit to the trends that you're seeing there. it did seem like fourth quarter slowed versus the prior quarters in terms of backlog growth? and is there maybe some kind of waiting to see what happens with folks on bbb in the market right now or anything else that you might want to highlight.
john ketchum -- president and chief executive officer of nextera energy
yes. steve, i'll take this. this is john. first of all, we're coming off a record year with 7.3 gigawatts, had a strong fourth quarter, posting about 1,500 megawatts.
what we are seeing in the market is continued strong demand and that's coming from a number of different sources. it's not only coming from investor-owned utilities and munis and co-ops, but also c&i. as there's been a lot of rotation of capital into esg funds. it's certainly getting investor attention and putting an impetus on companies to become sustainable.
and so one of the things that we've spent a lot of time on over the last couple of years is our customer base and how do we market to a different customer base, not that the investor-owned utility and muni and co-op won't always be our core. it will be. but we're doing some things differently, too, around c&i., for example. some of you might have seen the optos release where j.p.
morgan is partnering with us on a new software product, where we go in and we basically are able to calculate exactly what their energy footprint looks like today. how we can make it better, how we can take money out of the bill, how we can make it greener. that's just one example of some of the things that we're doing differently in terms of the ways that we approach the customer. and when i look at the pipeline that we have in place, the land positions, the interconnects, it's second to none.
it's an area of certainly focus that we are continuing to build out. we'll talk a lot more about that at the analyst day. but we have the best sites, the best team, the best talent the best analytics and the normal competitive advantages of being able to manage the supply chain operate cheaper, finance cheaper, all those things come together, give us a lot of optimism about the future.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok, great. and then one last question, just on the guidance improvement. if i had to kind of simplify kind of what's driving the higher guidance, '22 and beyond in terms of factors? any just kind of key reasons you would say for the higher guidance?
john ketchum -- president and chief executive officer of nextera energy
yeah, i will take that as well, steve. i think rebecca covered certainly the fpl piece. and then you think about energy resources. we've doubled the backlog in the last few years, continue to see a lot of promise there with or without build back better.
jim said, more likely than not that we're able to get something passed there by the end of the year. but we plan our business as if it doesn't happen. and our financial forecast is based on it not happening. and that's why we were very resolute in our ability to take our expectations up not only for 2022, but to extend the guidance out through 2025.
and that's just based on what we see in our renewable backlog. and when you think about the expectations that we laid out for investors for '21 and '22, i think we've done a terrific job of meeting those and then laying out '23 and '24. we've made tremendous headway against those expectations.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. thank you.
jessica aldridge -- director of investor relations
thanks, steve.

the next question comes from shar pourreza with guggenheim partners. please go ahead.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys.
rebecca kujawa -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy
good morning.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
congrats, jim, john, rebecca and team on the moves, well deserved. just most of my questions actually just got answered. but just a quick question on near ventures. obviously, you guys are starting to expand the playbook into ccs.
water, wastewater treatment. and obviously, in the prepared remarks, you just highlighted the hydrogen value chain opportunities there. is the future growth of any of these type of investments more specifically predicated on any outcomes of federal policy like a hydrogen ptc and seeing sort of the lack of progress on that front. do you anticipate any pullback from these sort of opportunities? not the base business, not the base newer opportunities but more specifically on the venture side.
rebecca kujawa -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy
thanks, shar and appreciate the question. we do think there's a lot of opportunities as i talked about in the prepared remarks, not only of purely executing our renewables for the electricity sector, but helping use clean energy to decarbonize these other industries. and we're thinking about some of these investment opportunities as a way to explore how those business models and investment opportunities are ultimately going to shape up over time. but to answer your direct question around the incentives, the investments we've made to date do not assume that there's a change of incentives or even the specific question around hydrogen that there's a hydrogen ptc.
but as john and his team, the energy resources team has evaluated a number of hydrogen pilot opportunities or future business opportunities. they certainly would be furthered and helped. some of them would be by hydrogen ptc. and that's one of the things that i know we, as a whole team remain optimistic about that if something happens, whether it's the full bbb or just a climate title that happens through reconciliation, we're optimistic that a hydrogen incentive would be included in that package.
i think there's a lot of opportunities to further the decarbonization of the u.s. economy through the use of hydrogen. so short answer, investments don't assume it, but i think there's even more opportunity if there are some incentives like the hydrogen ptc in the future.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
and then let me ask you just obviously the opportunity is sort of that, especially as you're thinking about on the hydrogen side. as sort of the growth starts to transpire, how are you sort of thinking about credit metrics? any potential pressures there as that business grows? and how we should be thinking about equity funding on those?
rebecca kujawa -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy
yeah, one of the strategic imperatives, the way that we think about managing the business over the long term and i highlighted a couple of times in remarks and we highlighted on a consistent basis because it's a high priority for us is maintaining that strong balance sheet. as you've seen, quality of credit degrade elsewhere in the industry, we've remained as committed as ever to maintaining that strong balance sheet. we think it's a huge differentiator for us and being able to execute our business to deploy the capital that we deploy and to provide the stability that our customers assume and expect from us, we think a strong balance sheet is imperative. so as we think about all of these investment opportunities, the growth in our business, that will remain a priority and we will assume that as part of the way that we're thinking about the business as a private facia part of the strategy.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
terrific. thanks, again. i'll pass it to someone else. again, big congrats john and no surprises here.
thanks.
rebecca kujawa -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy
thanks, shar.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from stephen boyd with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
unknown speaker
hey, good morning. i just want to echo congratulations to jim and to john and rebecca and kirk and eric. the performance you all have achieved is really quite remarkable. so congrats are absolutely in order.
so just so happy for you all. i wanted to spend a little time on the technology side. i guess it strikes me that within nextera for years, you've all been developing a variety of interesting technologies, sometimes not always as visible to us. but it just strikes me that some of those developments are becoming both more visible and potentially more commercial, more of interest in terms of ways you can monetize that to a fairly broad customer base.
and then just curious, i know this is a high-level question, but just interested in your take on how important technology such as some of the software development that you all mentioned could be to driving earnings power to driving growth of nextera in the long term.
rebecca kujawa -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy
yes, stephen, thank you for the question. and i think you're absolutely right. it's probably something that we have not talked about very much and probably will talk about more going forward. the reason why we had not talked about it a lot in the past is we really have thought about it as a strategic advantage to us, which we continue to believe a strategic advantage to us.
and we've largely used as a way to further both the profitability and the win rates on developing renewables. as we thought about how does the business grow and change and we capitalize all of these opportunities that you and we and the industry see, one of the shifts is thinking about our commercial and industrial customers, whether they're in traditional c&i customers that have been interested in the products that we sell or new ones or ones that are more industrial in nature or agricultural in nature. they often need some additional services to help them understand how to manage their generation and load needs, think about their carbon intensity, deliver on their own environmental, social and governance goals and some of the things that we've developed internally through all of our expertise are very appropriate and enormously valuable to these customers. so we've seen the opportunity to continue these investments, think about how we package and sell them to customers and you'll see a lot more of that from us going forward.
and we think there's a huge opportunity to sell not only those services, but also use them as a way to deepen our relationships with our customers and ultimately deploy renewables over time.
unknown speaker
that's really helpful, rebecca. and would that be essentially upside to the plan, in other words, sort of beyond the typical kind of numbers we see around renewables deployment, etc.? is this an area of upside or have you factored some of this into thinking about your growth?
rebecca kujawa -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy
i think for base assumptions, we're including some assumptions around what we think we can do with these types of businesses. but as always, there's pluses and minuses. fortunately, for us, they've largely been pluses in recent history and we've been able to deliver adjusted eps growth in excess of even what we, they have anticipated or laid out for investors prior to delivering. so hopefully, we'll be in a position to do that again over time.
but for now, i think you should safely assume that our expectations are the ones we just laid out in the last couple of minutes. and we'll use all of these levers to deliver against those and again, hopefully achieve as we expect the high end of each of these ranges, which we would feel very proud of and see as enormously value accretive to shareholders.
unknown speaker
agree. maybe just one last one for me. we're often asked about impediments to growth in clean energy and pretty clearly, nextera is not experiencing that. just curious if you could talk a little bit more about just sort of some of those impediments sort of perception versus reality, things like supply chain, labor availability, permitting, anything else? just sort of -- i think there, frankly, is sometimes a misconception about those limits to growth.
and it looks like clean energy growth remains very strong, especially for nextera. but just curious if you could just comment on those perceptions of limits on growth.
john ketchum -- president and chief executive officer of nextera energy
yeah, let me take that one. i think you identified some of the obvious ones that we have that we are addressing, certainly, supply chain and those types of issues and i think we've answered those. i think when i look at the market today, stephen, the issue for companies to be successful or not successful. the biggest differentiator is going to be many of the questions that you just asked.
and are you positioning your company for what is going to be a more complex energy offering that is going to be demanded by the customer? rebecca gave the example of a c&i customer. it's not as simple as being able to approach a c&i customer and say, hey, i'm going to sell you 100 megawatts of wind or 100 megawatts of solar or what do you think about a 50-megawatt battery? these are people that are selling candy bars and bottles of water and things of that nature. they're not in our business. they need the expertise as to how they think about that addition within their existing energy needs.
and so it takes a comprehensive skill set in order to come forward with a clean energy solution that makes sense for that business. and so when you think about a lot of the small developers that we have to compete against in solar and wind, they don't have that expertise. they don't have the ability to offer firm and shape products and things that it's going to take to really win the business. that's the first piece.
the second piece is the question you asked around technology. we have been very aggressive in our investment around technology. we've talked about the nextera energy analytics team that we bought back in '05. we have really built that team out.
it's a group of phd, mathematicians, software developers, software engineers, that not only use those tools to help manage our existing fleet and help leverage and drive operating efficiencies around what we do every day in managing our existing footprint, but they're now able to take all that data, all that information, all that know-how to develop comprehensive software solutions for customers. and that is a huge leg up that we have over the rest of the industry and one of the things that we're looking at. and the third thing is renewable enablers. we are really looking at what it means to lead the energy transition.
what are you going to have to be good at? and what capabilities are you going to have to have as an organization to really do that. and we have been spending the last three or four years, very focused on it. we don't talk a lot about some of the things that we're up to. you'll get more details at the analyst day.
but needless to say and be self-assured, we're ready.
unknown speaker
that's great overview. thank you so much.
rebecca kujawa -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy
thank you, stephen.
operator
the next question comes from michael lapides with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, guys. thank you and congrats to everyone on all the leadership changes. i actually have two questions on the regulated business in florida. first of all, can you just remind us and i know you'll give us more detail six months from now.
but just can you remind us what the capital spend levels for the next couple of years are, combined fp&l and gold or if you want to break it out and separate those two?
rebecca kujawa -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy
yeah, it's probably about $7 billion to $8 billion per year. it's included, michael, in the regulatory capital employed growth of roughly 8% to 9% per year.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. $7 billion, $8 billion per year. and kind of flat or do you see that escalating over time? and how should we think about what percent of that capital is either recovered as part of the rate case revenue requirement increase or via the tracker? and what part may -- would build up as rate base and you get it back in a future case?
rebecca kujawa -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy
there's a mix of course michael as you might expect. and we certainly have our best laid plans that will include as part of the updated capex tables in the 10-k when we publish it in a couple of weeks. one comment on that, i would make -- and obviously, there's a difference between, as you recall, from the capex table for fpl versus energy resources. but in both cases, as you get closer to that operating year, the teams tend to find good investment opportunities that are value accretive from a customer standpoint and may add and subtract to those over time.
but those will be our best estimates based on what we've seen so far and also under the parameters of the settlement agreement inclusive of the solartogether investments that were approved as part of the settlement agreement. and also anticipate the current views around the investments on both storm hardening and undergrounding that, as you know, are included in a clause mechanism and recovered separately and approved separately over time. those change over time depending on what we see and where we see the value coming for our customers, but we feel very good about the overall views. and of course, we'll give more details as we go into the investor conference in june.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. and rebecca, i just want to come back to some of the comments you made in your prepared remarks about fp&l and earnings targets for next year and beyond. is it getting harder operationally, just given the size and the amount of capital you're deploying at fp&l, to hit the highest end or the top end of the earnings band? you're laying -- historically, if you kind of go back and skim the transcript, always kind of talk about hitting that high end and it almost seems -- and i may be misinterpreting, but the language today was kind of toward the high end, but maybe not exactly added. and i was just curious if there's a change there in terms of being able to hit the 11.7% level.
rebecca kujawa -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy
sure. let me answer the -- i don't know if you're asking full on the nextera energy side where we typically have the language would be disappointed not to be at or near the high end. that language is exactly the same. and if anything changes solely a stumble on my part in terms of speaking, but the language is exactly the same.
if you're asking specifically around florida power and light company, the approved range, as you know, for the settlement agreement is the range of 9.7% to 11.7%. and my comment was specifically around our expectations for 2022, which, of course, is the first year of the new settlement agreement. and that also includes the 1-year limitation that was included in the settlement agreement around the use of surplus amortization just in this year, which is a maximum amount of $200 million. when we think about everything, what our investment plans are, our opportunities for continuing to focus on cost improvements, other improvements for customers, the investments that we plan to make and the use of the surplus amortization, including the shape over time.
we believe that at the end of the year, we'll be able to report a regulatory roe at the high end of the range. where exactly that is, of course, we'll refine it over the -- as the year progresses. and then of course, we'll be targeting the high end of the roe range in future years as well.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thank you, rebecca. appreciate you taking the time and congrats again.
rebecca kujawa -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy

the next question comes from jeremy tonet with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
jeremy tonet -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, good morning.
rebecca kujawa -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy
good morning, jeremy.
jeremy tonet -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
you covered a lot of ground today. just one question for me and it's kind of been touched on a few different times. but just diving in with the transition, in general. just wondering if you could comment a little bit more about why now is the right time versus any point in the past or in the future to make the transition? and then should we expect anything new in messaging from nextera with the transition here? could we expect something kind of new along these lines at the analyst day?
jim robo -- chairman and chief executive officer of nextera energy
so jeremy, this is jim, on the transition. i think you heard in the prepared remarks, this is something that the board and i have been working on really in earnest since -- well, honestly, in earnest, since my first succession planning discussion as ceo back in 2012. but i let the board know that my target for retiring as ceo was after -- i let them know this in 2016, honestly, that my target was after the 2020 rate case. and i actually extended kind of my time line a bit to get through this rate case.
and so that's been -- it's been my plan for a very long time. obviously, we didn't make any decisions about it until we announced it here. but it's been something that the board and i have been discussing for a very long time. and we've been very deliberate about the succession planning that we've done and i'm really pleased with the team that's going to be leading the company into the future.
rebecca kujawa -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy
and i think, jeremy, you had a second question going into the investor conference. can you remind me what that was?
jeremy tonet -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yes. just jim, that's very helpful details there. and just as we look at the analyst day here, should we expect kind of with the transition, any kind of change that might materialize in messaging at that point at the analyst day or that's not really the expectation at this point?
john ketchum -- president and chief executive officer of nextera energy
yes. for the analyst day, first of all, we have never been in a better position. we're coming off of what i would characterize as our best year as a company. and it's been really a testament to the entire lead team, not only obviously the job jim's done, but the job eric's done, the job rebecca's done and the leadership team that we have in place at energy resources.
we have an extremely deep bench with a ton of experience. i've been here almost two decades. eric's been here almost two decades. rebecca has been here 15 years.
and we have just a wealth of experience in the team that will bring full bear on the opportunity set that we have that we have going forward. and the way i think about it is we will continue to double down on the core. that means execution. unlike what we've seen in the past around fpl and the capital plan that they have for customers and for shareholders.
the renewable opportunity that we have in this country. don't forget renewables are cheap. they're the cheapest form of generation in this country with or without incentive. so we have a tremendous opportunity there as well.
and then the third piece i would characterize as the renewable enablers. what are the other things that we can do as a company that we've been working on behind the scenes that will help position us to be the leader of the energy transition in this country and we're going to deal with the best team in the industry. so that's really what you're going to hear about at the analyst day.

good morning and welcome to the nextera energy and nextera energy partners fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to jessica aldridge, director of investor relations. please go ahead.
jessica aldridge -- director of investor relations
thank you, andrew. good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2021 combined earnings conference call for nextera energy and nextera energy partners. with me this morning are jim robo, chairman and chief executive officer of nextera energy; rebecca kujawa, executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy; john ketchum, president and chief executive officer of nextera energy resources; and mark hickson, executive vice president of nextera energy. all of whom are also officers of nextera energy partners, as well as eric silagy, president and chief executive officer of florida power and light company.
jim will provide some opening remarks and we'll then turn the call over to rebecca for a review of our fourth quarter and full year results. our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. we will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the risk factors of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the securities and exchange commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com.
we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. today's presentation also includes references to non-gaap financial measures. you should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-gaap measures to the closest gaap financial measure. as a reminder, gulf power legally merged into florida power and light company effective on january 1, 2021.
gulf power continued as a separate reportable segment within florida power and light and nextera energy through 2021, serving its existing customers under separate retail rates. throughout today's presentation, when we refer to fpl, we are referring to florida power and light, excluding gulf power, unless otherwise noted or when using the term combined. with that, i will turn the call over to jim. 
jim robo -- chairman and chief executive officer of nextera energy
thanks, jessica and good morning, everyone. both nextera energy and nextera energy partners had an outstanding year in 2021 and are well positioned to capitalize on the substantial opportunities that lie ahead. nextera energy's performance was strong both financially and operationally and we executed the largest capital program in our history. investing approximately $16 billion in american energy infrastructure in 2021, which we expect will again place nextera energy among the top capital investors in the u.s.
across all industries. continuing our long track record of delivering value for shareholders, nextera energy achieved full year adjusted earnings per share of $2.55, up more than 10% from 2020. over the past 10 years, we've delivered compound annual growth and adjusted eps of approximately 9%, which is the highest among all top 10 u.s. power companies who have achieved, on average, compound annual growth of roughly 3% over the same period.
amid this significant growth, the company has maintained one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry. in 2021, we delivered a total shareholder return of more than 23%, significantly outperforming the s&p 500 utilities index and continuing to outperform both the s&p 500 and the s&p 500 utilities index in terms of total shareholder return on a three, five, 10 and 15-year basis. over the past 15 years, we've outperformed nearly all of the other companies in the s&p 500 utilities index and quadrupled the average total shareholder return of the index. over the same period, we've outperformed 80% of the companies in the s&p 500 while nearly tripling the average total shareholder return of the index.
we are proud of our long-term track record of providing growth and value creation opportunities for our shareholders and we remain intensely focused on execution and continuing to drive shareholder value over the coming years. at fpl, net income increased nearly 11% year over year while continuing to deliver on its commitment to making smart, long-term investments in innovative technology, clean energy and strengthening our electric grid for the benefit of our customers. we were pleased the florida public service commission unanimously approved the settlement agreement in october, an agreement, which we believe is a fair and balanced outcome in our base rate case. the 2021 settlement agreement supports continued smart capital investments, including the largest solar build-out by a utility in the u.s.
while keeping fpl's typical residential bills well below the national average and among the lowest in florida through the end of 2025. for customers in northwest florida, typical customer bills are projected to decline over the next four years. among the long-term infrastructure investments anticipated in the new agreement, new solar generation is expected to grow through the expanded solartogether community solar program which is expected to more than double over the next four years as well as through new base rate solar generation, including the nearly 1,800 megawatts to be recovered under solar base rate adjustment or sobra upon reaching commercial operations in 2024 and 2025. in total, our current solar build-out expectations are for approximately 4,800 megawatts of new solar over the term of the settlement agreement.
in early 2019, fpl announced its groundbreaking role to install 30 million solar panels in florida by 2030. with the anticipated solar additions approved under the settlement agreement, i am pleased to announce that we now expect to reach this milestone by 2025, five years earlier than previously anticipated. including the solar additions anticipated through 2025, this ambitious 30 by 30 initiative is expected to have generated approximately $2.5 billion in fuel cost savings for customers and created more than 20,000 construction jobs while supporting the florida economy with more than $700 million in property taxes over the life of the assets. during 2021, fpl successfully executed on its strategic initiatives, including placing another 671 megawatts of cost-effective solar and service, completing the first roughly 1,500 megawatt phase of our solartogether community solar program.
additionally, last month, we commissioned the world's largest integrated solar-powered battery system, the 409-megawatt manatee energy storage center, which will allow our customers to benefit from low-cost solar energy even during times when the sun is not shining. fpl has also continued to provide exceptional service reliability, achieving its best-ever reliability rate in 2021. and fpl was recognized for the sixth time in seven years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation. moreover, fpl was ranked no.
1 in both residential and business customer satisfaction in the southern u.s. among large electric providers by j.d. power in 2021 and we are completely committed to continuing to provide clean, affordable and reliable service to our customers for many years to come. energy resources also had a terrific year in 2021, delivering adjusted earnings growth of 13% versus the prior year.
the team also had an outstanding record year of renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 7,200 megawatts to our backlog during the year as we continue to capitalize on the ongoing clean energy transition that is occurring in our nation's generation fleet. our backlog additions have grown more than 20% compound annual growth rate since 2017 and we are well on our way to meeting our current development expectations for new signed contracts. with the significant additions to our backlog of signed contracts over the last year, we've now signed nearly 80% of the megawatts needed to realize in the midpoint of our 2021 to 2024 development expectations range, with significant time remaining to sign additional power purchase agreements. our supply chain and engineering and construction teams also continued to execute in 2021, commissioning approximately 3,800 megawatts of new wind and wind repowering, solar and storage projects.
over the past two years, energy resources has constructed more than 9,500 megawatts of renewables and storage projects, demonstrating the strength and resiliency of its execution expertise, even in the midst of a global pandemic and industrywide supply chain disruptions. finally, during 2021, nextera energy transmission its efforts to grow america's leading competitive transmission company and had its best year ever. during the year, the business delivered a record earnings contribution by increasing net income by nearly 20% over its previous earnings contribution record in 2020. growth in renewables means that there is also a growing imperative to build additional transmission across the u.s.
to support this transition to a low-cost, low-carbon economy fueled by renewable energy. we anticipate that nextera energy transmission will continue to capitalize on the growing opportunity set to both deploy capital profitably as well as to enable further renewables deployment. the tremendous execution in both the major businesses in recent years, including '21, gives us great visibility to the longer-term outlook of nextera energy. let me start with our opportunity set, which i would not trade with anyone in our industry.
at florida power and light, the settlement agreement allows us to focus on operating the business efficiently, reliably and affordably for the benefit of our customers. under the new agreement, we expect our average annual growth in regulatory capital employed to be between 8% and 9% over the four-year term through 2025. when you put it all together, low bills, best-in-class reliability, award-winning customer service and a clean emissions profile are what helped fpl provide what we believe is one of the best customer value propositions in the nation. at energy resources, our outlook for new renewables and storage development remains as strong as ever and we are excited to be able to continue supporting the industry's transition away from old inefficient forms of generation and into clean, reliable, low-cost renewables and storage.
we believe that the rapidly accelerating trend toward electrification and decarbonization of a broad range of sectors across the u.s. economy has significantly increased the total addressable market for new renewables and storage, even beyond our expectations just a few years ago and is now measured in trillions of dollars of capital investment opportunity in the coming decades. we believe that energy resources is uniquely positioned to advance its market leadership position in this environment. we have been in the renewables business for more than 30 years and have the experience, resources, balance sheet, talent and advanced data capabilities necessary to execute complex renewable energy generation and storage integration projects at scale.
we believe we have an excellent opportunity set for continued growth ahead of us at energy resources and we will further discuss our long-term plans for deploying renewables at both energy resources and florida power and light and the associated impact to our overall emissions profile and future goals at our upcoming investor conference, which we plan to hold on june 14 in new york city. with the anticipated continued strength of the investment opportunities at both florida power and light and nextera energy resources, i am pleased to announce that we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share expectations for 2022 and 2023 and introducing our expectations for 2024 and 2025. for 2022, we are now expecting our adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.75 to $2.85, up from our prior range of $2.55 to $2.75. for years 23 through 25, we expect to grow our adjusted earnings per share by roughly 6% to 8% per year off the expected 2022 adjusted earnings per share.
for 2023, this translates to a new range of $2.93 to $3.08, up from our prior range of $2.77 to $297 million. our new adjusted earnings per share expectations for 2024 are $3.13 to $3.33. and for 2025 are $3.35 to $3.60. as always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions.
in summary, we continue to remain as enthusiastic as ever about nextera energy's long-term growth prospects. based on the strength and resiliency of our underlying businesses, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in each of 2022, '23, '24 and 2025, while at the same time, maintaining our strong credit ratings. let me now turn to nextera energy partners, which delivered a total unitholder return of approximately 30% in 2021, bringing its two-year total unitholder return up to more than 72% and further advancing its history of value creation since the ipo in 2014. for 2021, the nextera energy partners grew its lp distributions per unit by 15% year over year and has now grown its distributions per unit by nearly 280% since the ipo.
nextera energy partners achieved its distribution growth objectives while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio of approximately 80% as of year-end 2021. nextera energy partners had a terrific year of execution in '21 and we are increasing our year-end 2021 financial expectations to reflect this better-than-expected growth execution. nextera energy partners delivered year-end run rate adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution in excess of our prior expectations, including delivering more than 13% year-over-year growth in run rate cash available for distribution at the midpoints. this execution is supported by nextera energy partners' outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets, which was further diversified in 2021.
during the year, nextera energy partners acquired interests in approximately 1,900 net megawatts of long-term contracted renewables and storage assets from energy resources. in addition, during the year, nextera energy partners successfully completed two acquisitions of renewable energy assets from third parties, adding nearly 500 megawatts of operating wind projects to its portfolio. these transactions demonstrate nextera energy's ability to leverage the operational expertise of nextera energy resources, low-cost sources of capital and our strong industry relationships to be successful in third-party acquisitions. the combination of a growing portfolio at energy resources and a growing set of opportunities to acquire renewables from third parties as well as significant organic growth opportunities, further supports the partnership's long-term growth visibility.
nextera energy partners also continued to demonstrate its ability to access attractive sources of capital to finance its growth investments, including executing on the lowest-cost convertible equity portfolio financing in its history. the roughly $820 million convertible equity portfolio financing carries a low implied cash coupon to the investor and partially funded nextera energy partners acquisition of a 50% interest in a renewables portfolio, consisting of approximately 2,520 megawatts of newly constructed or in construction renewables projects and approximately 115 megawatts of integrated battery storage. nextera energy partners was able to demonstrate the benefits to lp unitholders of the convertible equity portfolio financing structure during the fourth quarter when the partnership exercised its right to purchase 100% of the outstanding minority equity interests in the portfolio of wind and solar assets, supporting its 2018 convertible equity portfolio financing. relative to issuing the same amount of common equity in 2018 to fund our growth needs.
this financing allowed us to reduce unit issuance by more than 50% and save more than $140 million or roughly 75% in nominal cash costs while retaining the more than 80% increase in the net unit price over the last three years. nextera energy partners public float has increased approximately 50% since 2019. we believe our strategy of using low-cost convertible equity products to efficiently layer in common equity over time has created significant value for existing lp unitholders. i continue to believe that the combination of nextera energy's partners clean energy portfolio, growth visibility and financing flexibility offers lp unitholders a uniquely attractive investor value proposition.
as with nextera energy, we remain intensely focused on continuing to execute and deliver that unitholder value over the coming years. finally, i'd like to comment on some important organizational changes that we announced this morning. these changes are part of a long-term succession process undertaken by the board and me over the better part of the last six years. effective march 1, john ketchum will price me as president and ceo of nextera energy.
rebecca will succeed john as president and ceo of nextera energy resources. kirk crews, currently vice president, business management for nextera energy resources will succeed rebecca as executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy. john, rebecca and kirk will also be appointed to the respective roles at nextera energy partners. in addition, eric silagy, president and chief executive officer of florida power and light company has been named chairman and chief executive officer of florida power and light.
it has been an honor and a privilege to serve as ceo for nearly 10 years. i'm as excited as i've ever been about the future prospects of nextera energy and nextera energy partners. a big part of a ceo's legacy is the new leader in the next-generation leadership team that follows. and i couldn't be more thrilled about turning over the ceo role of this great company to john.
i know he will be as focused on creating value for you, our owners, as i have been over the last two decades. john has been an incredible partner to me and a senior leader in this company for more than 19 years and i can think of no better person to succeed me as ceo. john's breadth of experience across all aspects of our company, including commercial, operational, financial and legal as well as the significant leadership capabilities and vision position him exceptionally well to lead nextera energy to even greater heights in the coming years. i also want to congratulate rebecca, eric and kirk on their new roles.
one of the defining characteristics of this company over the last 30 years has been the quality and strength of its leadership team and i'm very proud of and excited for the team that will leave this company into the future. most importantly, i want to thank my team and all our employees for all that they have done. our team, the best in the business, has built this amazing company and i can't thank them enough. as the announcement mentioned, i'm going to remain as executive chairman for a transition period to support john in his new role.
i will now turn the call over to john, who would like to make some remarks.
john ketchum -- president and chief executive officer of nextera energy
thank you, jim and good morning, everyone. i have been privileged to have worked with and learned from jim during an incredible period of growth for our company and i am honored to have the opportunity to lead this company in the years ahead. as ceo, i intend to remain intensely focused on delivering value for our shareholders and building upon our long track record of success. i believe there is no company better positioned to lead our country's energy transformation than nextera energy.
and i am humbled by the opportunity to lead this team through such an exciting period for our company. i am fortunate to have a broad leadership team with the experience and capability that i too believe is the best in the industry. i am very excited to have eric, rebecca and kirk take on these expanded and new roles in the company. they, along with our broader leadership team and all of our approximately 15,000 employees worked tirelessly every day to serve our customers in florida and across north america.
finally, i wanted to take a moment to thank jim for his exceptional leadership and friendship. jim has been an unbelievable steward of this company over his nearly 10 years as ceo, growing the leading, most profitable electric utility and renewable energy company in north america. our total shareholder return during jim's tenure has been more than 500% and it is great evidence of jim's exceptional vision, leadership and commitment to excellence. i know i speak for all of our employees that we are deeply grateful for everything jim has done for our company.
let me now turn it over to rebecca for a more detailed review of our results.
rebecca kujawa -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy
thank you, john and good morning, everyone. let's now turn to the detailed results, beginning with fpl. for the fourth quarter of 2021, fpl reported net income of $560 million or $0.28 per share, up $0.03 per share year over year. for the full year 2021, fpl reported net income of $2.94 billion or $1.49 per share, an increase of $0.14 per share versus 2020.
regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11% for 2021 and was the principal driver of fpl's net income growth of nearly 11% for the full year. during the fourth quarter, net income was impacted by a number of factors, including an approximately $32 million pre-tax contribution to our charitable foundation that will allow it to continue to support the communities that we serve. fpl's capital expenditures were approximately $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly $6.8 billion. fpl's reported roe for regulatory purposes is expected to be 11.6% for the 12 months ended december 31, 2021.
during the fourth quarter, we utilized approximately $137 million of reserve amortization, leaving fpl with a year-end 2021 balance of $460 million. as a reminder, our new four-year settlement agreement became effective this month and includes the flexibility over the four-year term to amortize up to $1.45 billion of depreciation reserve surplus, which is inclusive of $346 million in reserve amount that we previously anticipated to be remaining at year-end 2021 under fpl's now expired 2016 rate agreement. consistent with the terms of the 2021 settlement agreement, half of the $114 million in excess reserve balance at year-end 2021 will be used to reduce our outstanding capital recovery asset balance and the other half will increase fpl's storm reserve to offset future restoration costs. as a reminder, the new agreement limits reserve amortization to $200 million in 2022, which we will treat as a limitation in any given quarter during the year.
given the historical shape of our customer usage, we typically use more reserve amortization in the first half of the year and reverse reserve amortization in the hotter summer months. we currently expect fpl to initially earn below our target regulatory roe in the early part of 2022. although for the full year, we are targeting the upper end of the allowed range of 9.7% to 11.7%. as a result, we also expect fpl's earnings growth to be lower in the first half of the year and higher in the second half.
as always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions. our overall capital program at florida power and light is progressing well. we continue to advance one of the nation's largest solar expansions and met our solar deployment objectives at both fpl and gulf power in 2021, including commissioning more than 800 megawatts of new solar across the combined system. beyond solar, construction on the highly efficient roughly 1,200 megawatt dania beach clean energy center remains on schedule and on budget, as it continues to advance toward its projected commercial operations date later this year.
the north florida resiliency connection remains on track to be in service by mid-2022. let me now turn to gulf power, which, as a reminder, was legally merged into fpl on january 1, 2021, but continue to be reported as a separate regulated segment during 2021. gulf power reported fourth quarter 2021 gaap earnings of $60 million or $0.03 per share. for the full year, gulf power reported net income of $271 million or $0.14 per share an increase of $0.02 per share year over year.
base o&m reductions and investments in the business were the primary drivers of gulf power's approximately 14% year-over-year growth in net income. gulf power's capital expenditures for the full year were roughly $800 million and its reported roe for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 11.25% for the 12 months ending december 2021. given that this is the last time we will be talking about gulf power's financial results, let me take a moment to summarize the team's execution over the past three years. gulf power has delivered significant improvements in all key financial and operational metrics, while meaningfully improving its customer value proposition.
the execution of the nextera energy playbook at gulf power, which is focusing on reducing costs and making smart capital investments for the benefit of customers, has been a remarkable success. gulf power has realized a nearly 40% reduction in o&m costs since the acquisition. since 2018, gulf power improved service reliability by nearly 60% and it was awarded national recognition for its outstanding reliability performance in the southeast suburban and rural service area for the second year in a row in 2021. over the same period, gulf power realized an approximately 60% improvement in safety among our employees who have worked tirelessly to help us execute on our plans.
regulatory capital employed has grown by approximately 16% compound annual growth rate since 2018. we have invested approximately $2.5 billion in long-term improvements to gulf power's existing system and generation fleet. as a result of our clean power modernization investments at gulf power, we have already delivered an approximately 25% reduction in co2 emissions over the last three years and we look forward to further expanding the opportunity for our customers to access clean, low-cost solar and storage in the years to come. this high level of performance across the board could not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of all of the gulf power employees.
and i would like to thank all of our florida power and light employees, old and new, for their relentless focus on reducing costs while improving reliability and safety over the past three years. execution of the plans that we laid out at gulf power has generated great outcomes for our shareholders as well. gulf power's net income has grown by a compound annual growth rate of approximately 19% since 2018, an outcome that was even better than our expectations when we announced the acquisition. our performance with gulf power is a clear validation of our strategy and our conviction that you can be clean, reliable, affordable and profitable at the same time.
the florida economy remains strong. over the last 10 years, florida's gdp has grown at a roughly 5% compound annual growth rate. the gdp of florida is roughly $1.2 trillion, which is up approximately 8% from pre-pandemic levels and would make florida the 15th largest economy in the world. at the same time, florida's population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the nation.
according to recent census bureau data, more people moved to florida from other parts of the country than to any other state in 2021. we believe this is a reflection of florida's unique proposition in terms of great weather, low taxes and a pro-business economy, all of which should support ongoing customer growth at florida power and light. over the past year, florida has created more than 485,000 new private sector jobs and florida's labor force participation rate has improved significantly. three months average florida building permits, a leading indicator of residential new service accounts are up 15% year over year and have outpaced the nation's quarterly growth in new building permits by roughly 13%.
other measures of confidence in the florida economy have meaningfully improved versus the prior year, including a 34% improvement in florida's retail sales index and a 2.6% decline in mortgage delinquencies while mortgage delinquencies across the u.s. have remained roughly flat. during the quarter, fpl's average customer growth was strong, increasing by nearly 82,000 customers from the comparable prior-year quarter. fpl's fourth quarter retail sales were down 1.5% versus the prior-year period, driven by an unfavorable weather comparison.
for 2021, fpl's retail sales increased 1.7% from the prior year on a weather-normalized basis, driven primarily by ongoing strong customer growth and a 1.5% year-over-year increase in underlying usage per customer. additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. energy resources reported fourth quarter 2021 gaap net income of $851 million or $0.43 per share. adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $414 million or $0.21 per share.
energy resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter is up $0.04 versus the prior-year comparable period. for the full year, energy resources reported gaap earnings of $599 million or $0.30 per share and adjusted earnings of approximately $2.21 billion or $1.12 per share. energy resources full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.13 or approximately 13% versus 2020. for the full year, growth was driven by continued new additions to our renewables and energy storage portfolio as contributions from new investments increased by $0.12 per share.
contributions from existing generation and storage assets decreased $0.04 versus the prior year due primarily to underperformance in our existing wind fleet as a result of extreme market conditions in texas in february of last year. nextera energy transmission and gas infrastructure contributed favorably, increasing results by $0.01 and $0.02, respectively, year over year, while the contribution from our customer supply and trading businesses decreased $0.02 versus 2020. all other impacts increased results by $0.04 year over year. as jim mentioned, energy resources had an outstanding year, delivering our best year ever for origination, adding approximately 7,200 net megawatts of new renewables and battery storage projects to our backlog.
in 2021, we commissioned approximately 3,800 megawatts of wind, solar and storage projects, including a 110-megawatt build-own-transfer project that was not included in our backlog. in addition, since the last call, we have added approximately 1,500 megawatts of renewable projects to our backlog, including approximately 70 megawatts of new wind and wind repowerings, 300 megawatts of solar and 500 megawatts of battery storage. our origination performance in 2021 reflects continued high demand among all customer classes for clean energy solutions that not only help achieve their renewable energy goals but perhaps more importantly, allow our customers to save energy -- save money on energy costs, while switching to lower cost forms of generation like wind, solar and solar plus storage. our renewables backlog now stands at more than 16,600 megawatts, which is roughly the size of our entire renewables generation portfolio at the end of 2017 and nearly 25% larger than our backlog at year-end 2020 and this provides terrific visibility into the strong growth that lies ahead for energy resources over the next few years.
the accompanying slide provides additional details on where our development program in energy resources now stands. we remain optimistic about the expanded investment opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the u.s. economy presents for energy resources. we believe that there are many new market opportunities where our industry-leading development platform will provide a competitive advantage to further grow our core long-term contracted renewables and storage business.
as we have previously discussed, green hydrogen presents a particularly compelling new market for energy resources. during the fourth quarter, a clean energy technology company in which we are a minority equity investor and that has developed a proprietary process to decarbonize the industrial production of hydrogen at economic prices. one, a conditional approval for an approximately $1 billion doe, department of energy loan to expand its clean hydrogen and carbon black production facilities in nebraska. our agreement with this company provides energy resources the opportunity to be its preferred renewable energy supplier for the facility and we are encouraged by the acceleration of the facility build-out that is expected to occur as a result of this new loan.
similarly, early in the year, we completed the strategic investment in a liquid fuels company with a proprietary process to produce 0 emissions synthetic fuels by combining green hydrogen with concentrated carbon dioxide streams captured from industrial processes. our strategic partnership with this company includes the opportunity for energy resources to provide up to 3,000 megawatts under a preferential energy supply agreement. finally, as part of our efforts to help our commercial and industrial customers achieve their substantial goals for both energy savings and decarbonization, we recently announced an agreement with j.p. morgan chase that allows for use of our proprietary state-of-the-art smart energy software to optimize its energy use and reduce its carbon footprint.
energy resources advanced software platform uses artificial intelligence and blockchain technology and leverages data from the industry-leading renewables and storage fleet owned and operated by energy resources. two, among other things, match energy demand with clean energy resources available on the market in real time. we recently signed a similar agreement that allows a large university to use our advanced software platform to manage and optimize more than 100-megawatt solar plus storage asset in california. through these initiatives, energy resources is leveraging its best-in-class renewable energy expertise to provide significant value to its customers in a market with meaningful growth potential.
we are at the vanguard of building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable and we are driving hard to continue to be at the forefront of the disruption that is occurring within the energy sector and broader parts of the u.s. economy. consistent with our long-term track record, we will remain disciplined as we take steps to be at the forefront of these developing markets while taking a leadership role in clean energy transition expected to drive tremendous growth for energy resources over the next decade and beyond. turning now to the consolidated results for nextera energy.
for the fourth quarter of 2021, gaap net income attributable to nextera energy was $1.2 billion or $0.61 per share. nextera energy's 2021 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted eps were $814 million or $0.41 per share, respectively. for the full year 2021, gaap net income attributable to nextera energy was $3.57 billion or $1.81 per share. adjusted earnings were $5.02 billion or $2.55 per share.
for the corporate and other segment, adjusted earnings for the full year decreased $0.05 per share compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of higher interest and refinancing costs associated with certain liability management initiatives completed during the fourth quarter to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. our fourth quarter refinancing activities reduced nominal adjusted net income by roughly $140 million. we expect these initiatives to translate into favorable net income contribution in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders. specifically, during the fourth quarter, nextera energy successfully refinanced approximately $5.2 billion in existing debt and hybrid securities and proactively issued roughly $4.9 billion in replacement funding.
this combination of redemptions and new issuance extended its maturity profile by over six years and is expected to generate an approximately $30 million after-tax reduction in annual interest expense in the near term. capital recycling remains an important part of our financing plan as we continue to execute on the tremendous growth opportunities in front of us. during the fourth quarter, energy resources closed on its previously announced agreements to sell a portfolio of newly constructed and under construction renewable assets to nextera energy partners and to a third-party infrastructure investor. through the sale of this 2.5 gigawatt renewables portfolio, energy resources was able to recycle nearly $3.5 billion of capital, including the tax equity proceeds, an accretive matter -- manner and take advantage of the strong market for wind, solar and storage assets.
we believe that our renewables development platform at energy resources is second to none and our ability to continue to harness market demand for renewables and recognize the value of that platform is a key competitive advantage for nextera energy as it continues to grow its portfolio of long-term contracted operating renewables and storage assets at energy resources. turning now to our financial expectations for nextera energy. as jim discussed, today, we are increasing the ranges of our adjusted eps expectations for 2022 and 2023 and introducing our expectations for 2024 and 2025. for 2022, nextera energy now expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.75 to $2.85.
for 2023 through 2025, nextera energy expects to grow roughly 6% to 8% off of the expected 2022 adjusted earnings per share range. and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges for each year. details of our new financial expectations are included on the accompanying slide. from 2021 to 2025, we expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate range.
we also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. as always, our expectations assume our usual caveats. let me now turn to the detailed financial results for nextera energy partners. fourth quarter adjusted ebitda was $322 million and cash available for distribution was $91 million.
adjusted ebitda growth versus the prior-year comparable quarter was primarily due to the growth in the underlying portfolio. for the full year 2021, adjusted ebitda was $1.36 billion, up 8% year over year and was primarily driven by the full contribution from new projects acquired late in 2020. our existing projects portfolio, favorable performance from nextera energy partners natural gas pipeline investments and contributions from the wind repowerings that we added at the end of 2020 were partially offset by weaker wind resource and lower generation at our genesis solar project as a result of outages for major maintenance in the first and fourth quarters of 2021. for the full year, wind resource was 98% of the long-term average versus 100% in 2020.
cash available for distribution was $584 million for the full year. the benefit to cash available for distribution from lower corporate level interest expense was partially offset by a comparably higher project level financing costs on our genesis solar project and other existing assets that were recapitalized to fund the acquisition of approximately 500 net megawatts from energy resources at the end of 2020. over the past three years, nextera energy partners cash available for distribution has grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 20%. as a reminder, these results include the impact of idr fees, which we treat as an operating expense.
additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. yesterday, the nextera energy partners board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.775 per common unit or $2.83 per unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2021. during the quarter, nextera energy partners closed on the initial funding of its approximately $820 million convertible equity portfolio financing with apollo global management and use those proceeds along with existing nextera energy partners debt capacity to fund its acquisition of approximately 1,300 net megawatts of renewables and storage from energy resources. under the terms of the agreement, nextera energy partners is expected to benefit from a low implied initial cash coupon over the first 10 years, despite only providing approximately 4% of the upfront capital needed to purchase the assets.
while we expect to allow nextera energy partners to achieve a full return of its capital invested into this acquisition in less than two years. additionally, the financing will provide nextera energy partners the flexibility to periodically buy out the investors' equity interest between the five and 10-year anniversaries of the agreement at a fixed pre-tax return of approximately 5.6% inclusive of all prior distributions, making this nextera energy partners lowest cost convertible equity portfolio financing to date. nextera energy partners will have the right to pay up to 100% of the buyout price in nep common units issued at no discount to the then current market price. nextera energy partners also issued approximately 7.25 million new nep common units during the fourth quarter to acquire the remaining equity interest in a portfolio of 1,388 megawatts of wind and solar assets associated with the convertible equity portfolio financing that nep entered into in 2018.
nextera energy partners funded the remaining roughly $265 million of the approximately $885 million of total consideration for the acquisition of equity in the portfolio, with project level debt issued on a subset of the underlying assets. the nearly $650 million project financing supported by these assets, which was also the lowest cost project level debt financing in the partnership's history is reflective of the strong performance of the underlying assets in the portfolio and also supportive financing of other growth opportunities executed in 2021. from an updated base of our fourth quarter 2021 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.83, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in lp distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2022 distribution that is payable in february of 2023 to be in a range of $3.17 to $3.25 per common unit.
we continue to expect to achieve our 2022 distribution growth of 12% to 15%, while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the low 80% range. given the successful execution of the recent acquisition from energy resources as well as the approximately 100-megawatt operating wind facility from a third party, year-end december 31, 2021 run rate adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution exceeded our previous expectations ranges. as a result, today, we are introducing new year-end 2021 run rate expectation ranges for adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution of $1.635 billion to $1.795 billion and $640 million to $720 million, respectively. with a combination of strong cash flow generation from existing nextera energy partners portfolio, including the approximately 2,400 net megawatts of new renewables and storage added during 2021 and its relatively low payout ratio, nextera energy partners has significant flexibility in terms of acquisitions in the coming year.
although acquisitions could occur at any time during 2022, for modeling purposes, it may be practical to assume that any new unannounced asset additions occur late in 2022 and therefore, have limited contributions to the calendar year 2022 expectations implied by the year-end 2021 run rate for adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution for the portfolio that we just discussed. nextera energy partners run rate expectations for adjusted ebitda and cafd at december 31, 2022, remain unchanged. year-end 2022 run rate adjusted ebitda expectations are $1.775 billion to $1.975 billion and cafd in the range of $675 million to $765 million, respectively, reflecting calendar year 2023 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2022. as a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated idr fees as we anticipate -- as we treat those as an operating expense.
in summary, we continue to believe that both nextera energy and nextera energy partners have excellent prospects for growth, both in the near and longer term. florida power and light, energy resources and nextera energy partners each have outstanding set of opportunities across the board. the progress we made in 2021 reinforces our longer-term growth prospects. and while we have a lot to execute on in 2022, we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year.
that concludes our prepared remarks. and with that, we will open up the line for questions.
",2021-Q4,NEE
0.9197,1.0,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question will come from steve fleishman with wolfe research. you may now go ahead. 
steven fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
yeah. hi. good morning. thank you.
john, kirk, congrats on your new roles.
john ketchum -- chairman and chief executive officer, nextera energy partners
thank you, steve.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
you bet. kirk, just the ad cvd is obviously an important issue, and you made some really interesting comments here. so my questions are going to focus on that. the comment about the tariffs not being known if they decided to go that route until 2025, that would seem to be incredibly disruptive to the sector.
so just could you just talk about like how that process works and why to actually set the tariffs to better understand why it would be that long?
john ketchum -- chairman and chief executive officer, nextera energy partners
yes, steve. let me go ahead and take that. this is john speaking. that's one of the things that we're pointing out to the commerce department is that when they established tariffs, say they come up with a final determination of january of 2023, their practice has always been to impose the tariffs and calculate the actual amounts and release those two years later.
so those tariffs would not be known until the first quarter of 2025. and so what the industry would be forced to do perversely is actually go back and buy panels from china because the tariffs in china are known. and china is the only country in the world that would have panels available to sell because as we said in our remarks, the u.s. panel manufacturing industry, which is incredibly small, again, even at full capacity, it only has the ability to satisfy 10% to 20% of the entire u.s.
demand. the u.s. industry is sold out until 2025. and if you don't know what the tariff rates are in southeast asia, it forces you back to china where the tariffs are known and have been known for the last 10 years, which is an absolutely perverse outcome, an outrageous outcome, quite frankly, and one we intend to make sure that the commerce department clearly understands because that's an unintended consequence that i don't think anybody wants.
and the other point that goes along with it is, if we're trying to be tough on trade, we're not. china is not the one that pays the price. who pays the price here are american companies, american workers, the american consumer that pays higher electricity costs than they ever have before in a rapidly increasing natural gas price environment, oil prices, coal prices. solar is actually deflationary.
and you actually reward the chinese who then get the cell panels at the inflated rate. so that makes absolutely no sense at all. when you look at our company and our business, we are in, i think, a different position than the rest of the industry is. while all those things are not good for the industry, i think our company is in a position to be able to manage these risks fortunately.
we have strong contracts in place. we do have a global supply chain and sourcing capability that gives us options that others don't. but back to the strength of our contracts, i think that gives us the ability that others might not have to continue sourcing from our existing supply base even in south korea without -- or i mean in southeast asia without those tariff amounts being fully known. but the problem that this creates with that two-year delay into 2025, build back better doesn't get passed or some form of reconciliation, you're also on the itc clock that is expiring over that same period of time.
so you have to have an ability to go source those panels, find them someplace else to get your projects built. again, we're confident in our ability to be able to do that just given the strength of our contracts. that's why -- and we're also optimistic that the outcome here is so outrageous and so ludicrous that the commerce department won't possibly, based on their four prior rulings over the last decade, 2012, 2014, 2020, and in 2021, where this exact question has been asked and answered by three separate administrations, including this one, how can you possibly pull the rug out from under the industry. makes absolutely no sense to force business back to china, which is what you were trying to prevent in the first place.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
that's super helpful. just a couple quick follow-ups on the same issue, which is, first, given everything you said, why did they initiate this in the first place? did they not understand the implications? second, are you seeing any better movement as a result of what's already happened to build back better? and then the last one is just in that worst-case event that we have to wait till 2025 to work this out, and you reiterated back a month ago that even with this review confidence in the high end of the target, does that include that scenario?
john ketchum -- chairman and chief executive officer, nextera energy partners
yes. let me take those in order. so first of all, why did they take the investigation. you saw what happened in october.
they had a similar filing that was made around circumvention. the same department of commerce decided not to take that up in the same year that the rule that making cells and panels outside of china was ok. here in '22, i think they looked at it and said, ""ok. well, this is the second one in a row.
let's take on the investigation. we don't think the investigation itself, if we just do a little bit more fact-finding will actually have an impact on the industry."" they are wrong. it does. we told them it would.
and you can see it in our own portfolio at 2.1 to 2.8 gigawatts potentially being moved into 2023. luckily, we have enough cushion and enough other things that we can do or doesn't impact our financial expectations, that movement. other companies in the industry are not that fortunate. and so our hope is that they look at the information.
we don't think the information has changed. and they rely on the prior four decisions from 2012, 2014, 2020, and 2021 to follow a consistent trade practice rather than retroactively changing the rules for an industry that has been playing by the rules for the last decade. that would make absolutely no sense in an environment where you have inflation, increasing commodity prices and the only deflationary product and source of generation that also achieves clean energy goals and creates a ton of american jobs, you're stymying rather than helping. so that's the rationale.
the second question i think you had was on where are we on bbb. so look, if you're really looking at -- if you look at bba -- bbb in the current environment, now is the time to move forward on it like no other. given the inflationary pressures on energy prices, now is the time to double down on renewables. now is the time to create real manufacturing incentives if you want to redomesticate the supply chain to the u.s., which is really, really small right now.
and if you want to create those manufacturing incentives, do it with a carrot rather than a stick so we can achieve our clean energy goals over time. so that gives us some optimism, number one, going in. second, i think there's motivation going into the midterms to get our energy policy right, particularly our clean energy policy right. and i think the democrats do need to win going into these midterms.
the structure is much the same. so there wouldn't -- we're not contemplating a large change in structure. both sides are talking. i think for the first time in a while, we have a supreme court nomination behind us.
time is something we got to work with. the reconciliation for this year expires at the end of september. so we've really got to try to get something moving forward before the august resource -- recess. but i remain optimistic that we will be able to get that moving forward.
and if it does, a much skinnier down package that i would expect to look like a focus really just on climate and clean energy and prescription drugs. and that would be, i think, a smaller package that might be able to move forward. but i think at the same time, there's going to have to be some open-mindedness from the progressives, which i think we are seeing. senator manchin has made no secret that we need pipeline infrastructure in this country, projects like mvp, for example, and more of an all-of-the-above approach to tackling this issue.
and i think there is a rational outcome there that would make sense for all parties involved. and then i think your last question was if we have to wait until 2025, what's the impact on our long-term expectations. again, we have strong contracts. we have a global supply chain capability.
we would not, based on what we know today, expect any changes to our long-term financial expectations.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you very much.

our next question will come from julien dumoulin-smith with bank of america. you may now go ahead.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey. good morning. thanks for the time and congrats again on the promotions to you, guys. so i just want to come back to the earnings impact on you guys.
certainly appreciate the macro that you guys have described here, but can you speak more specifically to the earnings offsets, not just in '22, but especially '23 and '24 given that the timing of these renewable and services tends to impact the subsequent year more so? and then if i'm hearing you right, again, i know you keep talking about chinese imports, but is that the answer here in lieu of having clarity effectively and this is a matter of timing and pivoting into a chinese supply solution in some form or another or at least creating your own domestic supply rapidly? just clearly, we're not going to sit here till '25. just want to get some understanding as to what the earnings mitigation is in the near term and what that answer is in '23, '24.
john ketchum -- chairman and chief executive officer, nextera energy partners
julien, thank you for the question. in terms of the way we're thinking about being able to manage this and continue to still have the confidence to reaffirm our adjusted earnings expectations and reiterate that we would be disappointed if we were not able to deliver financial results at or near the high end of the range, look, we are a very large company with a diverse set of growth drivers. fpl is performing really well. we have great visibility into the next four years with the settlement agreement.
we run the business with a lot of financial discipline and build a conservative financial plan. we, as we discussed today, continue to find ways to run the business more efficiently and have identified through project velocity over $400 million of run rate savings that we expect to be able to receive over the next few years. when we add all that up and particularly think about how conservatively we are with the way we structure our plan, we feel very comfortable in being able to continue to deliver on our financial expectations.
kirk crews -- executive vice president and chief financial officer, nextera energy
yes. and then i'll -- julien, i'll take the last piece on the -- i think what i understood your question would be on the supply chain. so that's the other reason why we don't think any action is required by the department of commerce today because the supply chain is already changing for the entire industry. polysilicon is now being sourced out of germany.
it's being sourced out of the united states. suppliers are quickly becoming more vertically integrated and moving their ingot and wafer-producing capabilities outside of china where cells and modules are already made. and that will be a sourcing strategy that will be followed by us and much of the industry going forward, including, i think, by the u.s., the so-called u.s. panel manufacturers.
because one thing i want to make sure people understand, as i said before, at full capacity, the u.s. panel manufacturers can satisfy only 10% to 20% of u.s. demand. but when they make panels in the u.s., they're not really making panels in the u.s.
they're importing all of the products that go into a panel from outside the u.s., mainly from the southeast asian countries. and they have these small assembly shops in the u.s. that employ a few hundred people that go ahead and just put it together, and then they stamp the panel made in the u.s.a. when it really isn't.
and that's one of the frustrating things that we're tackling here. but we are, again, as i said, moving the supply chain outside of china. and the u.s. panel manufacturers, i assume, will be looking at some more things for their continued reliance on imports as they think about their strategy going forward as well.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. but just on your earnings impact, it sounds like this is about accelerating velocity, basically accelerating cost savings into the near term to offset some of the impacts as well as maybe some fpl drivers rather than saying we're going to do more win versus what the plan is kind of a near-term sense. and actually, if you can speak to the fpl piece, just on capex changes versus the 10-k. it seems like the range is a little bit lower.
but again, i'll let you respond holistically.
john ketchum -- chairman and chief executive officer, nextera energy partners
yes. so on the first piece of your question, cost savings is one piece of it. we have cushion in our plan. we run the business very conservatively.
we have cushion in the plan. we expect to be ok.,kirk, i'll let you take the fpl question.
kirk crews -- executive vice president and chief financial officer, nextera energy
sure. julien, as we've thought about the capex plan at fpl, as we discussed on the call today, the expectation is -- for this year is roughly $7.9 billion to $8.3 billion of capital that we plan to deploy. we also laid out in the discussion around the 10-year site plan what we're thinking in terms of solar that we're going to add to the system. we feel very good about the capital program that we have at fpl over the next four years in not just generation, but as well as t&d infrastructure, hardening and undergrounding.
so we have a very good plan there at fpl. also, i think it's important to keep in mind with respect to fpl, as we discussed in the prepared remarks as well, we are continuing to see just significant growth at fpl, organic growth, in terms of people coming to florida. at 91,000 additional customers added in roughly four or five years, we're going to add the size of gulf to the system, and that's going to continue to provide us with capex opportunities as well.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you. 
operator
our next question will come from shar pourreza with guggenheim partners. you may now go ahead.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. good morning, kirk. john.
just on the near -- the '23-'24 signed contracts. i mean, obviously, they're up 11 gigs, so you're getting close to the target range for those years, which could allude obviously you guys delivering within your plan. but i just -- i want to get a little bit of a sense here. if the tail risks are longer dated, right, could we see more projects shifts than what you kind of disclosed in the footnote maybe into '24 and beyond? and if so, is there a point in time, john, you start shifting into more wind from solar and storage? i mean, obviously, wind is very competitive.
the returns aren't great, but i would think several players are going to follow in similar footsteps there. so i guess, how to think about the profile of the backlog if this is more longer dated and we don't get visibility?
john ketchum -- chairman and chief executive officer, nextera energy partners
sure. shar, i'll take that. so the first point that i would make is that this is good for the wind business. i think you could see that from the results of our origination activity this quarter.
so even to the extent we might see some shifting solar from '22 to '23 or '23 to '24, wind is coming online even faster. and remember, the development cycle for wind and the origination activity for wind is much shorter. we can originate a wind project and have it built in 10 months. and so to the extent you might see some solar activity drop off -- and really, again, i view this as a '22 and '23 issue.
the beauty of it is, you have wind to step in and gets placed. and that's an area where we have significant competitive advantages. and being able to sell 23 wind at a 80% ptc, we can be extremely competitive in the pricing there and in the offering. and it provides us with, i think, a mitigation measure on top of the strong supplier contracts that we already have on the solar side that others in the industry don't have.
it's great to have a diversified business to be able to fall back on, and that's why we feel good about our financial expectations.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
got it. and then, john, just maybe just shifting to fpl. i mean you guys put out plans for additional winterization resiliency, 3,200 megawatts of new storage through to '31. the solar programs are kind of well defined.
and i know we talked about potential delays on the neer side. but do you see opportunities conversely to maybe accelerate some of that solar capex on the regulated side, especially as gas costs have put a lot of pressure on affordability and certainly help from an lcoe comparability? so could we see faster maybe solar deployment on the regulated side to reduce what you're seeing in the commodity curves?
john ketchum -- chairman and chief executive officer, nextera energy partners
yes. i think, first of all, i want to say the capex is actually up at fpl, just back to -- i think it was julien's earlier question. undergrounding is a piece of that. it's really important we get our undergrounding in service on time and on budget.
we continue to look to ways to shift that to the left. and look, as we are in an increasing natural gas price environment, the right answer for florida customers certainly is to evaluate and look at trying to get more renewables online in florida faster. it's a hedge against rising natural gas prices in the state. and it's a hedge for the country, which is another reason why, as i've said a couple of times already, what's happening is quite silly.
eric silagy -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer of florida power & light
the only -- this is eric silagy. the only thing i would add is the 10-year site plan we just filed, a pretty good road map of the future opportunities. we are going to be adding a lot more solar into the system, pending the ptc's approval. and demand for solar together continues to remain very, very strong.
and so we're going to be continuing to look at the next round for solartogether after the current one we just filed for. so there's going to be additional opportunities. but again, this is about smartly deploying capital and doing the right thing for customers for the long term.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
got it. and eric, that those opportunities could be incremental, right, to the current plan?
eric silagy -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer of florida power & light
absolutely.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
got it. and then just really lastly, and it's unrelated to what we're talking about. but john, just on the ja case, again, the federal case against a couple of executives. i know nextera and fpl were subpoenaed.
is there any details you can provide there? because we do get some questions on that from time to time.
john ketchum -- chairman and chief executive officer, nextera energy partners
yes. let me just give a little bit of background there. we were asked a while back to provide some documentation in connection with that matter, which we did. we cooperated in full.
we were told and have been told we are not a target of the investigation. and i think the article you're referring to, the reporter just got it flat out wrong. we have not been subpoenaed as a witness in that matter.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
ok. great. that's what i wanted to clarify. congrats, john and kirk, on the promotions.
thank you.
john ketchum -- chairman and chief executive officer, nextera energy partners

our next question will come from durgesh chopra with evercore isi. you may now go ahead.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
good morning. thank you for squeezing me in and taking my question here this morning. just maybe -- can i just a little bit more granular on the -- as you get toward the sort of the preliminary ruling here in late august on the solar panel investigation? what are the key steps that we should be watching for? and what is your and other industry sort of players' involvement going to be in that process?
kirk crews -- executive vice president and chief financial officer, nextera energy
so the way to think about the process is right now, the doc has provided questionnaires to different groups. those questionnaires are being completed. i believe they're due this week for some. i believe others had requested some excisions and maybe have been granted.
once they have all that information, then the groups that are -- that have standing are also allowed to weigh in on the matter. we do have standing in the case. so we will be weighing in on this as well. and then the doc has all that information and reviews -- essentially reviews the data and then reaches their preliminary determination, which is expected to happen by late august.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
all right. thank you. and then maybe just one quick one and see if you'll give this information. if not, that's ok because it's small.
but can you maybe talk about the gas transaction -- the gas pipeline sale? and what kind of multiple and ebitda contribution? i know it's small. so i don't know if you can share that information. i'll just follow up with ir.
kirk crews -- executive vice president and chief financial officer, nextera energy
yes. we're not going to share that information at this time. i understand the reason for the question. i would just say, as we included in the press release and in the script, it was a very attractive and accretive ebitda multiple.
we're very happy with it.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
perfect. thank you so much, guys. appreciate the time. thank you.

our next question will come from stephen byrd with morgan stanley. you may now go ahead.
dave arcaro -- morgan stanley -- analyst
oh, hi. it's dave. it's dave arcaro on for stephen. thanks for taking my question.
i was wondering if you could just talk a little bit to ppa pricing that you're seeing for new contracts, i guess, across wind, solar and storage. is there an approximate level that you would expect ppa prices to have to rise to absorb some of the inflationary pressures that we've seen? and at the end of the day, do you expect that to happen? do you think they'll rise enough that you can protect your returns on incrementally new signed renewables contracts?
rebecca kujawa -- president and chief executive officer, nextera energy resources
sure. this is rebecca, and i'll take that question. it's a matter of practice, what we do with our customers and as we're approaching the market is factor in whatever the current latest pricing is, which is certainly what we're doing now in terms of where we think the market is in terms of our cost as well as what the alternatives are for our customers. so keep in mind that, as we've talked about, some pricing pressure, whether it's consistent with the comments that kirk and john have talked about on the solar side or on the wind side that it's against the backdrop of costs that have gone up, other alternative costs that have also gone up, whether it's oil or natural gas, overall power prices in the marketplace.
and so there is still a significant incentive for our customers to procure renewable energy. and of course, as you've seen from our signed contracts for this quarter, the demand for wind has been really strong, both in terms of signed contracts and i'll also tell you in terms of our ongoing conversations with customers. and customers are also still very interested in pursuing solar projects. a lot of folks were caught off guard by this decision, surprised for all the reasons that john and kirk highlighted that the department of commerce would have taken this step.
and all of us would like to see the uncertainty resolved as quickly as possible and as favorably as possible. so that our customers can move forward with deploying solar. we'll talk more about where we see the market in terms of pricing and specifically pricing versus the alternatives at the investor conference. but again, the key takeaway from my perspective is they remain very attractive for customers.
dave arcaro -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. that's helpful color. and i was just wondering, just on the pace of new signings, has that slowed down significantly since this investigation started? and would the preliminary determination potentially be a bit of a relief valve? or could it take longer than that to start to maybe kick-start the project signings again?
rebecca kujawa -- president and chief executive officer, nextera energy resources
yes. i'm always cautious to say anything about a given quarter's signings because i think sometimes there's too much weight put on them, sometimes too little. but as kind of an obvious point, contract signings were terrific this quarter. and i'm really proud of the execution of the team, and it very much reflects a lot of interest from customers that has not waned at all.
so we're very excited about the opportunities. nothing has changed in terms of long-term view about excitement for renewables. they remain very attractive. and as john highlighted, they should be deflationary.
absent this uncertainty and relative to the alternatives, this is a great option for customers, and we couldn't be more excited about the future.
dave arcaro -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. appreciate that. thanks so much.

good morning and welcome to the nextera energy and nextera energy partners first quarter earnings call. [operator instructions] please note this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to jessica jeffrey, director of investor relations. please go ahead.
jessica aldridge -- director of investor relations
thank you, anthony. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2022 combined earnings conference call for nextera energy and nextera energy partners. with me this morning are john ketchum, president and chief executive officer of nextera energy; kirk crews, executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy; rebecca kujawa, president and chief executive officer of nextera energy resources; and mark hickson, executive vice president of nextera energy, all of whom are also officers of nextera energy partners; as well as eric silagy, chairman, president, and chief executive officer of florida power & light company. kirk will provide an overview of our results.
and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. we will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the securities and exchange commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
today's presentation also includes references to non-gaap financial measures. you should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-gaap measures to the closest gaap financial measure. as a reminder, florida power & light completed the regulatory integration of gulf power under its 2021 base rate settlement agreement and began serving customers under unified rates on january 1, 2022. as a result, gulf power will no longer continue as a separate reporting segment within florida power & light and nextera energy.
for 2022 and beyond, fpl has one reporting segment, and therefore, 2021 financial results and other operational metrics have been restated for comparative purposes. with that, i will turn the call over to kirk. 
kirk crews -- executive vice president and chief financial officer, nextera energy
thank you, jessica, and good morning, everyone. nextera energy delivered strong first quarter results and is off to a solid start to meet its overall objectives for the year. adjusted earnings per share increased by 10.4% year over year, reflecting successful performance across all of our underlying businesses. during the quarter, we were honored that nextera energy was again ranked no.
1 in its sector of fortune magazine's world's most admired companies list for the 15th time in 16 years. our culture of commitment to excellence in everything we do and our core values are what allow our team of approximately 15,000 employees to continue delivering best-in-class value to our customers and shareholders while helping build a sustainable energy era that is affordable and clean. fpl increased net income by approximately $98 million from the prior-year comparable period, which was driven by continued investment in the business for the benefit of our customers. during the quarter, fpl successfully placed in service approximately 450 megawatts of additional cost-effective solar projects that are recovered through base rates as part of its new four-year settlement agreement, which, as a reminder, became effective on january 1 of this year.
as a result, fpl has now completed on time and within budget all of its planned solar build with 2022 in-service dates. fpl now owns and operates more than 3,600 megawatts of solar, which is the largest solar portfolio of any utility in the country. fpl's modernization investments since 2001 have saved customers more than $12 billion in fuel costs, and its customers have benefited from a 45% improvement in reliability over the last decade. fpl's other major capital investments are progressing well, including the north florida resiliency connection and the highly efficient approximately 1,200-megawatt dania beach clean energy center, both of which are scheduled for completion later this year.
by executing on smart capital investments such as these and running the business efficiently, fpl continues to deliver its best-in-class customer value proposition of clean energy, low bills, high reliability, and outstanding customer service. at energy resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by nearly 7% year over year, primarily driven by favorable performance in our existing wind portfolio. in terms of new origination, energy resources had another strong quarter of renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 1,770 net megawatts to our backlog since the last call, bringing our backlog total to approximately 17,700 megawatts. included in the additions this quarter is approximately 1,200 net megawatts of wind projects, which is the second largest quarter of wind origination in our history.
in the midst of inflationary pressures and uncertainty in solar supply chain, which i will discuss further in a few moments, our continued origination success in this environment is a testament to the strength of energy resources' competitive advantages and the ongoing demand from our customers for low cost renewals and storage. at this early point in the year, we are very pleased with our team's execution and progress at both fpl and energy resources. now let's look at the detailed results, beginning with fpl. for the first quarter of 2022, fpl reported net income of $875 million or $0.44 per share, an increase of $0.05 year over year.
regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 11.3% was a significant driver of fpl's eps growth versus the prior year comparable quarter. fpl's capital expenditures were approximately $2.2 billion for the quarter. we expect our full year 2022 capital investments at fpl to be between $7.9 billion and $8.3 billion. fpl's reported roe for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ending march 2022.
under our rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory roe for each trailing 12-month period. in this case, the 11.6% that i previously mentioned. while we initially expected to earn below our targeted roe in the early part of 2022, a combination of warm weather, operational efficiencies and and outstanding execution by the team resulted in us achieving our targeted 11.6% roe while using $124 million of reserve amortization available under our current settlement agreement during the first quarter. turning to our development and planning efforts.
fpl recently filed its annual 10-year site plan that presents our recommended generation resource plan through 2031. the recommended 10-year site plan includes roughly 9,500 megawatts of new solar capacity across our service territory over the next 10 years, which would result in nearly 20% of fpl's forecasted energy delivery in 2031 coming from solar generation. this planned solar build-out includes nearly 1,200 megawatts of base rate solar projects, inclusive of the approximately 450 megawatts placed in service during the first quarter that we plan to build over the next two years. in addition, it includes approximately 1,800 megawatts under the sobra mechanism of our settlement agreement; approximately 1,800 megawatts of solartogether community solar projects that we expect to construct over the next four years; as well as roughly 4,700 megawatts of additional solar after 2025 that is subject to approval by the florida public service commission.
fpl continues to deliver what is one of the largest-ever solar expansions in the u.s. compared to current levels, the recommended plan projects an approximately 65% increase in zero-carbon emission electricity produced by the fpl system over the next decade, largely as a result of fpl's continued rapid expansion of solar energy through the execution of its 30-by-30 plan, which we now expect to complete by 2025 and the solar additions that i previously mentioned. this projected increase in zero-carbon emissions generation is significant for a utility system of our size, especially when considering that our total amount of energy delivered in 2031 is expected to be nearly 10 percentage points higher through customer growth and increased adoption of electric vehicles. our green hydrogen pilot program plans are also reiterated in the site plan.
as we've previously discussed, we intend to build an approximately 25-megawatt electrolysis system at our okeechobee clean energy center that will be powered entirely by solar energy from a nearby site. the pilot is designed to test in practice the concept of replacing natural gas with green hydrogen as fuel for combined cycle unit use. the pilot project is expected to guide the way for future use of hydrogen as a fuel source across fpl's fleet of highly efficient combined cycle units, thus lowering or eliminating carbon emissions from fpl's fleet in the future. this pilot project is projected to go into service in late 2023.
notably, our as-filed 10-year site plan recommends a total expected deployment of approximately 3,200 megawatts of new battery storage capacity by 2031. included in this total is approximately 1,400 megawatts of incremental battery storage to enhance readiness and reliability for our customers during potential extreme weather events. we also plan to make other smart capital investments for winterization efforts designed to support potential increased customer load during extreme winter temperature conditions while also providing additional day-to-day reliability benefits for customers. a hallmark of our culture is taking every opportunity to learn from events that happen in our industry, not just those that directly affect fpl, to ensure we continue to deliver the best possible value to our customers.
our planned targeted investments for winterization were identified as a result of our detailed assessment of our fleet following winter storm uri last year that affected texas and much of the south. we will provide additional detail on these programs and other capital initiatives at our june investor conference. the florida economy remains healthy, and florida's population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the u.s. florida's job market continues to show healthy results with more than 700,000 new private sector jobs added over the last year, and florida's labor force participation rate is up nearly 2% year over year.
other positive economic data across the state include the continued strength of florida's real estate market with a three-month moving average for new housing permits up nearly 20% year over year. fpl's average number of customers increased by more than 91,000 or 1.6% versus the comparable prior year quarter driven by continued solid underlying population growth. fpl's first quarter retail sales increased 2.6% from the prior year comparable period, and we estimate that approximately 0.7% of this increase can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. on a weather-normalized basis, first quarter retail sales increased 1.9% with strong continued customer growth contributing favorably.
energy resources reported a first quarter 2022 gaap loss of approximately $1.5 billion or $0.76 per share. adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $628 million or $0.32 per share, up $0.02 versus the prior year comparable period. the effect of the mark to market on non-qualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings, was the primary driver of the difference between energy resources first quarter gaap and adjusted earnings results. as a reminder, this quarter's gaap results were also impacted by a write-off of our remaining investment in mountain valley pipeline, which we have excluded from adjusted earnings.
contributions from new investments were roughly flat year over year, while our existing generation and storage assets added $0.05 per share due to favorable wind resource and the absence of winter storm uri impacts. the contribution from our customer supply and trading business decreased by $0.02 per share, and nextera energy transmission increased results by $0.01 per share year over year. the comparative contribution from our gas infrastructure business decreased results by $0.02 per share following favorable performance in the first quarter of last year during winter storm uri. all other impacts were roughly flat versus 2021.
as i mentioned earlier, energy resources had another strong quarter of origination, which is reflective of our ability to continue leveraging our competitive advantages to deliver clean energy solutions to meet the ongoing market demand for renewables. since the last call, we added approximately 1,200 net megawatts of wind projects for 2022, 2023 and 2024 commercial operation dates to our backlog. our backlog additions also include approximately 440 megawatts of solar projects and approximately 130 megawatts of battery storage projects. with more than 2.5 years remaining before the end of 2024, we have now signed more than 85% of the megawatts needed to realize the midpoint of our 2021 to 2024 development expectation range.
earlier this month, the u.s. department of commerce initiated a review of antidumping and countervailing duty circumvention claim on solar cells and panels supplied from four southeast asian countries, which in recent years sourced over 80% of all solar panel imports into the united states. as we recently highlighted, we are disappointed by the commerce department's decision to conduct this investigation. we believe the commerce department already settled this issue when it concluded in 2012 that the process of converting solar wafers into electricity-producing solar cells is technologically sophisticated and the most capital-intensive part of the solar panel manufacturing process.
and when that occurs outside of china, the sales are not subject to the 2012 antidumping and countervailing duties applicable to chinese solar cell imports. the commerce department's later rulings in 2014, 2020 and 2021 are consistent with this and have been relied upon by the solar industry as it continued to invest billions of dollars in new solar-generating facilities in the united states over this period. in light of these four prior rulings, the reliance on them by the industry and the substantial technologically sophisticated processing that occurs in the southeast asian countries, we believe it will be difficult for the commerce department to conclude under its circumvention standards that circumvention of the 2012 tariffs is actually occurring. if the commerce department were to find circumvention in the current investigation, we believe it would be unwinding a decade of consistent trade practice across the past three administrations, including the current administration just last year.
we believe such a decision would create significant price uncertainty as additional tariffs on panels from the four southeast asian countries would likely remain unknown until close to 2025 as final tariff amounts are not determined for about two years after the year of importation. this price uncertainty would likely result in the unintended consequence of u.s. solar panel supply once again being sourced significantly from china because the tariffs applicable to imports from china are more certain based on 10 years of assessed duty history. u.s.
solar panel assemblers are, for the most part, sold out of solar panels through 2024 and even at full capacity are only capable of serving 10% to 20% of the u.s. solar panel demand in the first half. it should also be noted that nearly all of the large domestic solar panel assemblers in the u.s. do not support the efforts behind the circumvention claim or the commerce department's decision to investigate as they also primarily rely on imported sales from southeast asia to produce their panels in the united states.
and all of the uncertainty from the investigation is occurring at a time when natural gas, coal and oil prices have increased dramatically, leaving solar and storage as one of the few ways to alleviate inflationary pressures on electricity prices. for these reasons, among others, we are optimistic that the investigation will ultimately be resolved favorably and the commerce department will conclude not to impose additional anti-dumping and countervailing duties on sales and panels sourced from these southeast asian countries. we believe that nextera energy is as well positioned as any company in the industry to manage these issues. however, given that a number of suppliers are not expected to ship panels to the u.s.
until the commerce department makes a preliminary determination as late as august, we continue to expect some of our solar and storage projects may be adversely impacted by this delay. we are working closely with our suppliers and customers to assess the potential impacts of this investigation and are optimistic about our ability to arrive at acceptable mitigation measures. based on what we know today, we believe that approximately 2.1 to 2.8 gigawatts of our expected 2022 solar and storage build may shift from 2022 to 2023. despite the delay, given our competitive advantages, including the strength of our supplier relationships and contracts, we remain comfortable with our current development expectations for wind, solar and storage, which are to build roughly 23 to 30 gigawatts over the four-year period from 2021 through the end of 2024.
we run a diversified business at energy resources that includes multiple renewable energy technologies and provides a natural hedge against temporary disruptions like the one our industry is currently experiencing. in fact, in light of the uncertainty in the solar supply chain, we believe renewable demand will likely temporarily shift in part from solar to wind, and we believe energy resources has terrific competitive advantages in wind development. the accompanying slide provides additional details. finally, during the quarter, nextera energy transmission, along with its partners, completed the construction of the east-west tie transmission line project.
the 450-kilometer, 230-kilovolt transmission line runs from waha to thunder bay, ontario and is expected to address long-standing regional transmission constraints, thereby increasing much-needed access to energy to support new economic growth in the region for years to come. turning now to the consolidated results for nextera energy. for the first quarter of 2022, gaap net loss attributable to nextera energy were $450 million or $0.23 per share. nextera energy's 2022 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted eps were approximately $1.46 billion and $0.74 per share, respectively.
adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment were roughly flat year over year. our long-term financial expectations, which we increased and extended earlier this year through 2025, remain unchanged. for 2022, nextera energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.75 to $2.85. for 2023 through 2025, nextera energy expects to grow roughly 6% to 8% off the expected 2022 adjusted earnings per share range.
nextera energy is in a strong position to meet its financial expectations through 2025, and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings expectations ranges in each of 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025, while at the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. a big part of nextera energy's culture is a focus on continuous improvement and productivity. to that end, we are currently wrapping up our companywide productivity initiative to reimagine everything that we do, which we call project velocity. project velocity built upon the success of project momentum and project accelerate, which were launched in 2013 and 2017, respectively.
the employee-generated ideas implemented through project momentum and project accelerate are projected to deliver more than $1.8 billion in average annual run rate savings first, our cost projections just 10 years ago. in fact, the ideas generated this year in project velocity alone are expected to reach roughly $400 million in additional run rate efficiencies in the next few years, representing the largest identified o&m cost savings in the history of these programs. this result is another example of the strength of our culture and team and highlights our continued focus on productivity and our team's willingness to embrace innovation and leverage technology. from 2021 to 2025, we also continue to expect that our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate range.
we also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base. as always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. let me now turn to nextera energy partners, which delivered solid first quarter results with year-over-year growth in adjusted ebitda of more than 16%, driven primarily by contributions from the approximately 2,400 net megawatts of renewables and storage added during 2021. yesterday, the nep board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.7325 per common unit or $2.93 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier.
inclusive of this increase, nextera energy partners has grown its lp distributions per unit by more than 290% since the ipo. further building upon that strength, nextera energy partners today is announcing that it has entered into an agreement with energy resources to acquire an approximately 67% interest in an approximately 230-megawatt, four-hour battery storage facility in california that is fully contracted with an investment-grade counterparty for 15 years. the acquisition will further diversify nextera energy partners' existing portfolio with the addition of another battery storage project and is an excellent complement to nextera energy partners' existing operations. nextera energy partners expects to acquire the project interest for approximately $191 million, subject to closing adjustments, which is expected to be funded with existing debt capacity.
nextera energy partners' share of the asset's tax equity financing is estimated to be approximately $80 million at the time of closing. the acquisition is expected to contribute adjusted ebitda of approximately $30 million to $35 million and cash available for distribution of approximately $13 million to $18 million, each on a five-year average annual run rate basis beginning december 31, 2022. the transaction is expected to close later this year upon the project reaching its commercial operation date and supports nextera energy's partners projected adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution growth in 2022.,finally, nextera energy partners recently closed on a transaction to sell an approximately 156-mile gas pipeline from its existing portfolio for a total consideration of approximately $203 million to a third party. the sale price of the pipeline represents an attractive and accretive ebitda multiple and further enhances the renewable energy profile of nextera energy partners.
we are pleased with this transaction and look forward to redeploying the proceeds into accretive renewable energy assets, like the battery storage acquisition from energy resources that i just mentioned, to support nextera energy partners' long-term distribution growth expectations. turning to the detailed results. nextera energy partners' first quarter adjusted ebitda was $412 million and cash available for distribution was $169 million. new projects, which primarily reflect the asset acquisitions that closed in the second half of 2021, contributed approximately $75 million of adjusted ebitda and $25 million of cash available for distribution.
the adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution-contribution of existing projects declined $9 million and $29 million, respectively, versus the prior year comparable quarter. favorable performance at existing projects drove an increase in adjusted ebitda contributions of approximately $46 million year over year, which was more than offset by the absence of approximately $55 million in benefits realized during the last february's winter storm uri. excluding the positive impact of winter storm uri from last year's first quarter results, this quarter's adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution were up nearly 38% and 31%, respectively, year over year. cash available for distribution was also impacted by the timing of paygo payments.
wind resource for the first quarter of 2022 was 108% of the long-term average versus 98% in the first quarter of 2021. additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. nextera energy partners continues to expect run rate contributions for adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution from its forecasted portfolio at december 31, 2022, to be in the ranges of $1.775 billion to $1.975 billion and $675 million to $765 million, respectively. as a reminder, year-end 2022 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2023 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2022 and include the impact of idr fees, which we treat as an operating expense.
as always, our expectations are subject to our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions. from a base of our fourth quarter 2021 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.83, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in lp distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. we do not expect the recent solar supply chain disruption to impact our ability to deliver on these expectations. we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2022 distribution that is payable in february of 2023 to be in a range of $3.17 to $3.25 per common unit.
we also continue to expect to achieve our 2022 distribution growth of 12% to 15% while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the low 80% range. in summary, both nextera energy and nextera energy partners are benefiting from our history of strong execution that has positioned us well to capitalize on the terrific growth opportunities available to us across our businesses. we look forward to sharing more detail with you on our growth plans for both nextera energy and nextera energy partners at our investor conference in new york on june 14. before taking your questions, i'd like to turn the call over to john ketchum.
john ketchum -- chairman and chief executive officer, nextera energy partners
thank you, kirk, and good morning, everyone. i am excited for the opportunity to talk to you in my new role. since we announced our planned leadership succession in january, we have heard from many of our shareholders and industry analysts. several of you have asked whether you should expect any changes in strategy under a new ceo.
the short answer is that i expect our strategy to be consistent with how we have grown the company over the past several decades. but that we will continue to adapt and evolve our strategy to meet increasing customer expectations, to leverage new technologies, and to lead the decarbonization of the u.s. economy. now is the time for our company, our industry and our country to embrace low-cost renewable energy like never before.
we need to create more jobs, not less, and combat the impacts of higher inflation, higher oil and natural gas prices and rising electricity demand by supporting, not stymying, solar, and storage development. our strategy going forward is to build down on our core businesses. at fpl, we expect one of the highest population growth rates of any state in the nation to continue. in fact, at our current rate of organic customer growth, fpl would add a customer base the size of gulf power roughly every five years.
fpl's undergrounding program is just getting started, and we have visibility to billions of dollars in capital investment for the next several decades to continue hardening and strengthening the grid as we deliver industry-leading reliability to our customers. and we are also just getting started at decarbonizing the generation fleet at fpl as only about 5% of our generation in fpl is currently produced by renewable energy. i believe that fpl already is the best utility in the nation. and yet we see significant cost reduction and incremental capital investment opportunities at fpl over the next several decades that can further improve our industry-leading customer value proposition by delivering clean, low-cost energy solutions for florida customers.
our strategy also entails doubling down on our core at energy resources. we intend to build more wind, more solar and more battery stores than anybody else in this country year in and year out regardless of the headwinds or tailwinds in any given year. we believe that we have the competitive advantages to win under any market conditions. and with recent technological advancements in green hydrogen and other forms of long-term storage, we see a total addressable market in this country for renewables, storage, and transmission of around $8 trillion through 2050.
we have said this before, and we believe it is never more true than it is today. the opportunity set for renewable energy in this country continues to expand rapidly. and we believe energy resources is in a terrific position for continued industry leadership and for long-term growth for shareholders. both fpl and energy resources have multiple ways to grow, and each business continues to push the other to be even better.
as fpl grows, both businesses learn what drives customer value in florida. as energy resources grows, both businesses learn what drives customer value in other markets across the country. operational excellence is a competitive advantage for us across both businesses, so as development and construction expertise, so as supply chain management, so as financial discipline. both businesses are constantly implementing new technologies.
both businesses are constantly finding ways to do things more efficiently and to improve our cost position. as kirk mentioned, this year, our employees generated about 900 individual ideas translating into roughly $400 million in additional run rate o&m savings across the enterprise through project velocity, our best performance ever after 10 years of pursuing o&m improvement in this employee-driven annual exercise. our strategy at nextera energy is to continue to do what we have done well, only better and bigger as new market opportunities present themselves. our strategy at nextera energy partners is much the same.
the partnership will double down on what we have done well since our ipo in 2014. we expect to continue delivering lp distribution growth that is already best in class. we plan to continue to pursue growth in three ways: by acquiring assets from energy resources, by acquiring assets from third parties, and by additional organic capital investments in the assets we own as the portfolio grows over time. yet as at nextera energy, it is the future of the partnership and its long-term growth visibility that is most exciting to us.
simply put, we believe that what is good for nextera energy tends to be good for nextera energy partners, and what is good for decarbonization of the u.s. economy is going to be terrific for shareholders of nextera energy as well as for unitholders of nextera energy partners. we will have more to share about our long-term growth prospects at both companies at our investor conference in june. i'd like to close by once again thanking our team.
in addition to the 900 project velocity ideas i mentioned earlier, last week, we held our annual team competition for the highest quality and innovation award at our company, followed by our employee expo in which 56 teams were featured. i can tell you that, as impressive as our track record has been over the last 30-plus years, our future is even brighter. our team continues to impress with their creativity, analytical abilities, innovation, customer focus, and the will to win. i truly believe that we have the best team in the industry.
i believe this team can extend our long-term track record of outperformance, and i believe this is the team that can and will lead the decarbonization of the entire u.s. economy. thank you for your continued support of our company, and i now look forward to taking your questions.

[operator instructions] and our first question today comes from steve fleishman from wolfe research. please go ahead with your question.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. thanks. i guess a couple of questions. just a technical one on the new backlog additions.
could you give us some sense kind of what periods the 2 gigawatts were? is it mainly '22, '23 or '24, '25?
kirk crews -- executive vice president and chief financial officer, nextera energy
sure. good morning, steve. thank you for the question. so in terms of the new additions that we announced this morning, the wind is sort of split evenly between 2023 and then the 2024 and 2025 time period.
for solar, the majority of that is in the 2024 and 2025 time period.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. second question, i know that your plans do not include any bbb or any extension in tax credits at all, but would be curious of just your thoughts on chances for that to happen in tax extenders or kind of separately what the biden administration might do on renewables with respect to just the executive actions and/or through the epa?
john ketchum -- president and chief executive officer
sure, steve. this is john. i'll go ahead and take that. like you said, it's not included in our development or financial expectations.
so if it happens, great. but our expectations through 2025, as kirk said in the prepared remarks, assume current tax law. our view is that renewables are going to continue to get cheaper and cheaper over time. gas generation, which is what we primarily compete against for new renewables, on the other hand, continues to get more expensive.
and we laid that case out, i think, in detail at the june investor conference. and when i think about gas prices today, we think they're going to remain elevated over a long period of time. i just think there's a lot of headwinds that gas prices are facing today. one of them is obviously the lack of pipeline.
infrastructure, we see significant demand for lng export in western europe. there really is no gas-to-coal switching anymore, which used to put a cap on gas prices and would limit gas demand during scarcity events. so i think for all those reasons, we're going to continue to see upward pressure on gas prices. and that -- when i look at our success this quarter at over 2 gigawatts for customers, they're looking at that.
they're looking at that, and they know that they have significant affordability issues that they are trying to address, and they're really trying to identify anything they can to hedge natural gas prices and natural gas price volatility in the bill. and so that is creating a ton of demand for renewables. and like i said, i don't see that really changing over time. i think we're going to be in a long-term period of heightened natural gas prices, which is really just terrific for renewables, creates a ton of demand.
on your questions on the views around what the options are for tax reform, first of all, i think reconciliation is somewhat unlikely, obviously, given the positions that have been taken over the last week or so. so our focus really is on extenders and more importantly, on executive actions. so let me take those in order. the first, on extenders.
extenders could happen. but there are things on both sides of the aisle that they will want at the end of the year. i mean you think about the things that are important to republicans, and i think senator grassley put a statement out a couple of days ago saying that all '25 or '26 extenders hinge on the full r&d expense deduction. that is going to be something that's going to be front and center, i think, on the republican wish list, is getting that done because i think as most folks know, that r&d full expensing was eliminated at the end of '21, and it gets amortized now over five years.
so they want to see that extended. we have the interest-deductibility limitation, which converts from ebitda to ebit. at the end of '22, bonus depreciation starts to scale down. those are all things that could really drive economic growth and, i think, will be high on the list and things that we may be able to trade for an extension on renewable credits.
so while we're not counting on it, we will continue to do everything we can around extenders to try to support extension of tax credits for renewables. i think executive action, particularly given the statements that were made by the president at the end of last week, there are definitely some things that we can do there. we will continue to work it. we have a number of ideas on our list that we are pursuing at different levels.
and i'd like to just leave it at that on the executive branch activity, but feel somewhat optimistic about our ability to get some exciting things done there.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok, great. i'll let other ask questions. thank you.
john ketchum -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, steve.

our next question comes from julien dumoulin-smith from bank of america. please go ahead with your question.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey. good morning, team. thanks, for the time.  maybe just a follow-up from steve's last question. focus here on origination, new record in the second quarter here.
how are you thinking about the back half of the year? clearly, to a certain extent, you would think that there would be some hesitancy from customers given the uncertainty on bbb. considering that maybe those expectations have withered at this point, does that actually mean customers are now sort of in gear to make moves? and could we actually see a further acceleration of origination in the back half of the year, if you follow what i'm saying?
rebecca kujawa -- president and chief executive officer, nextera energy resources
julien, it's rebecca. i'll take that question. the team is doing a terrific job with ongoing conversations with customers. but as we've highlighted really since -- for a very long period of time and consistently even since the start of the year when we've been talking a lot more about disruption across the industry, interest from customers remains really robust.
and that was throughout even the uncertainty around circumvention, at the height of it, even around solar. and it really goes back to the heart of what kirk said in the prepared remarks and what john just commented on a minute or two ago in response to one of steve's questions. our customers are acutely aware of the value of renewables in their portfolio from an economic standpoint, both in the pure sense of being low cost, but also in the sense of being a terrific offset to inflationary concerns about other forms of generation in their portfolio. and then on top of that, they have various commitments that they've talked to, to their own stakeholders about deploying renewables and reducing carbon in their portfolio.
so i think there's this underlying current of demand that has been far less affected than you might think by the headlines in our conversations about what's going on in the industry. so i would say the fundamentals are terrific. and as you can see from our origination, i always caution you all not to look at a single quarter in isolation, to keep looking at multiple quarters over time. and you can see really strong demand for both wind and solar and battery storage throughout the portfolio.
so i'm thrilled with our conversations with our customers. i'm thrilled with the execution of the team and remain as excited as i've ever been about the prospects for us continuing to execute and delivering new renewables.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes, it sounds more consistent, as you say. and then just -- this might seem more of a check the box, but just to clarify this, i mean, we've seen some concerns out there on court side of late and just uflpa, etc. i mean i know there's some concerns, and perhaps this is more of a review process as a few things are held up here. but i just want to turn back to your prepared comments, etc.
it sounds like this is not substantively a concern for you guys, at least per your own contracting activities.
rebecca kujawa -- president and chief executive officer, nextera energy resources
julien, we continue to work through supply chain. of course, you know all the headlines as well as anybody on circumvention. for wro and the uyghur forced labor protection act, obviously, we have for wro some history already under our belt for us and for the industry. and for the uflpa implementing regulations, we now have some time in place for those, and our conversations with our suppliers remain really constructive.
so we're going to constantly be vigilant as our suppliers, but we continue to see a constructive path forward on being able to put projects in service over time.
john ketchum -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, and the only thing that i would add to what rebecca just said, julien, is none of our suppliers are on the import panelist. none of our panels have been detained. i think as rebecca said, the process that will be followed will be much like the wro, which our suppliers are well versed in dealing with. and there will be a little bit of due diligence on, hey, where did these panels come from? what's the traceability? just like we've seen with wro, but we believe it's all very manageable.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. excellent. i'll leave it there.

and our next question comes from shar pourreza from guggenheim partners. please go ahead with your question.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. 
kirk crews -- executive vice president and chief financial officer, nextera energy
good morning, shar.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
just what's the threshold for removing the language around the 2 gigawatts of projects that you noted in the footnotes that could still be at risk? i mean, can you maybe just elaborate on how the discussions are going with customers? and just given that you've been in discussions for some time, where are you sort of trending as we're thinking about the 1 to 2 gigawatt cancellation range that you sort of highlighted at the analyst day? i mean, could we end up with no cancellations? i guess when can we get an update there?
rebecca kujawa -- president and chief executive officer, nextera energy resources
hey, shar. so it's rebecca. i'll take that question as well. our conversations, i would say, are across the board very constructive.
and i think throughout this process, we've been very transparent, obviously, with you all and our conversations that we highlighted at the investor conference, but at least as importantly and perhaps more so from my perspective, very transparent and honest with our customers. and it continues to be a process, particularly for the things we just talked about, both for getting back on track from the disruption related to the circumvention investigation and also understanding the implications of wro and uflpa as well as understanding our customers' requirements for what is most important to them in terms of timing and getting their projects in service. i would say i'm very pleased with the progress on those conversations. i'm optimistic.
i think i even said this at the investor conference, there's still a path where there is little to no cancellations across the board. we're not there yet. there's still some ongoing dialogue that we need to have. but irrespective of that, i feel very comfortable with the development expectations that we've laid out that even if there's some disruption with a couple of those contracts, i feel very confident in being able to enter into other contracts and continue the development of other projects such that those ranges that we've provided to you and, of course, gave you again today remain very much in reach.
and our origination for this quarter speaks for itself of being able to continue meaningful progress toward lining those up and creating terrific visibility to where we just need to execute.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
got it. got it. so just -- sorry, if i could just -- it sounds like the way the discussions are going, there could be a situation where you see no cancellations.
rebecca kujawa -- president and chief executive officer, nextera energy resources
that's certainly possible. but again, most importantly, even if there's some disruption, i also feel really good about being able to have alternatives in place. so i think it's both yes and.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
got it. got it. and just wanted to follow up on the transaction value of renewable projects, especially as you're kind of looking at the rising interest rate environment. do sort of the rising rates present a challenge to monetize projects both through net or third parties? and how do you see the interest rates impacting sort of the economics on the project, the development margins, the irrs? so is there sort of pricing flexibility to pass those costs without seeing sort of that elasticity in demand?
kirk crews -- executive vice president and chief financial officer, nextera energy
so shar, let me start with, as we've often talked about, we have a number of competitive advantages when it comes to financing the projects. but i think you also need to consider the environment in which we are contracting renewable projects right now and, as john talked about, what the alternative is for the customer. so given the high gas price environment, it certainly provides room for us to have a higher ppa price. and that gives us the ability to offset higher interest rate costs and still maintain our margins.
with respect to nextera energy partners, as we've shared before, again, a lot of financing options available at nextera energy partners. we've demonstrated over the years ways to finance the growth in a very cost-efficient way. and we continue to believe that we can utilize all the different financing options that we have to continue to support the growth at nextera energy partners.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
terrific. thanks, guys. i'll pass it to someone else. congrats, john and team.
appreciate it.

our next question comes from durgesh chopra from evercore. please go ahead with your question.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey. good morning, team. thank you for taking my question. all my other questions have been answered.
i wanted to go to sort of your water and wastewater strategy, and i appreciate it's a small part of your business. but maybe just a two-part question there. one, can you talk about your outlook there? obviously, the texas deal is now closed, and you made a pa announcement or you talked about the pa wastewater system on the call today. so can you discuss your outlook there? do you see a lot of opportunity to grow there? that's part one.
and then part two, how should we think about competition? here, i'm referring to the local water utilities, as you approach these deals. and what's your competitive advantage? thank you.
rebecca kujawa -- president and chief executive officer, nextera energy resources
yeah, thanks for the question. i'll take that. it's, obviously, rebecca. we're very excited about it.
as we've talked now a number of quarters, we see a lot of synergies from the competitive strengths that we bring to the table, our size, our approach to being able to focus on cost and on innovation and all of the -- both supply chain and execution that we can bring to the water business. and of course, we find regulated earnings and cash flows very attractive. so there's lots of both structural and strategic reasons why we're interested, and we're thrilled with the progress that we've had so far, getting some initial work done in both texas and pennsylvania. and i feel really energized by what the team is looking at in terms of opportunities for growth going forward and building more of a platform opportunity.
and i think it's key to think about some of the value this brings. there are local utilities out in these communities, and we can help them solve some of the challenges that they see, both the municipals and the entities that run those businesses. so i think it's terrific. i do want to caveat that relative to the size of our overall business and the capital investments that we're making, it's relatively small.
but in all of our broader conversations and investments in renewables and talking to these municipal entities around renewables, there's often opportunities to also bring value to them on the water side and other parts of infrastructure that is meaningful to them. so terrific synergies. i'm really excited about the outlook. we continue to be much more of a renewables company than necessarily a straight water company, but i'm really happy with the progress we've made so far.

just wanted to pick up maybe with m&a a little bit here. how does the recently instated real zero goal impact your prospects around m&a going forward? and when you're looking at assets, is there more of an interest on water, as you've talked about here, or how does the appetite vary between water, electric, gas?
kirk crews -- executive vice president and chief financial officer, nextera energy
sure. so look, i think we've -- as we've discussed before on m&a, we are really excited about the organic growth opportunities we have at both fpl and energy resources. at fpl, it is a growing population here in the state. at energy resources, it's a fantastic renewable environment.
so as we think about m&a, we will always look, we're always interested, but we're really focused on the organic growth opportunities. and i think rebecca shared with you sort of the thinking we have around water and whether or not there are opportunities there in water that we can help local municipalities. but in the context of the overall business and the organic growth that we have at both fpl and energy resources, it's still a small opportunity set.
jeremy tonet -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. thanks for that. and then maybe just coming back to supply chain, a little bit more high-level question. what do you think about the prospects regarding domestic manufacturing? what are your expectations for u.s.
market share multiple years down the road? what percentage of panels do you think could be domestically sourced today versus five years in the future?
john ketchum -- president and chief executive officer
this is john. i'll go ahead and take that. i mean what you're going to continue to see is, i think, really more of an intense focus on what's possible in the u.s. i mean i think you've certainly seen our company take a leadership position early on with what we were able to do up in jacksonville around a panel manufacturing facility.
we will continue to look for more opportunities going forward. but i think it's going to be important that we have a diverse approach that looks hard at domestic production opportunities and supporting domestic production opportunities going forward. it's hard to really give you a percentage, but i think you're going to see this industry really focused on ways that we can help create more domestic jobs here on the home front. that's one of the great things about renewables.
i mean renewables are energy independent. from a national security standpoint, they're all within the boundaries of the u.s. and we will continue to focus on developing projects that are fuel independent as well, which will, as i said before, really help, i think, in taking a bite out of the bill in a high natural gas price environment.
jeremy tonet -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. thank you for taking my question. 
operator
our next question comes from stephen byrd from morgan stanley. please go ahead with your question.
dave arcaro -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. it's dave arcaro on for stephen. thanks so much for taking my question. so i was wondering, just looking at the energy resources development outlook, there is a big ramp in solar from the '22, '23 period into the '24, '25 period.
i was wondering, is there an opportunity or any effort to kind of pull forward projects from '24, '25 into 2023? kind of curious how generally 2023 is shaping up in terms of industry growth that year.
rebecca kujawa -- president and chief executive officer, nextera energy resources
hey, dave. it's rebecca. i'll take that. one, as we just think about it from our company's perspective, obviously, we have financial expectations built around the ranges that we've already provided, which anticipates both at '22, '23 timeframe and '24, '25 timeframe of in-service.
but certainly, as we look out to 2025 and think about that being a substantial solar build year for us and for the industry for obvious reasons, assuming that there's no change to current tax policy, of course, we're going to think long and hard about how do you optimize that growth. we're already in conversations with our epc contracts, our labor contracts as well as the physical supply chain needed in order to support that build to ensure that we're on top of it and tracking it accordingly. this is kind of what we do, right? in our industry, as you all know, there's a history of peaks as you go into a year in which the industry expects to have a change in incentives after that year. so we will prepare for it.
i feel very comfortable with where we are today that we've got the right systems, thoughts and execution in place to be successful. but of course, as you highlighted, we'll look at every possible way to optimize that.
dave arcaro -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok, got it. thanks. that's helpful. and then on florida, i was wondering if you could talk about bill inflation and just approaches that you're pursuing to manage the pressure that we're seeing on customer builds this year.
anything kind of new in the works or creative ways to help spread that cost out or that bill inflation out?
eric silagy -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer of florida power & light
hi, dave. this is eric silagy. i'll take that. so look, first off, we continue to be focused on being as efficient as possible.
one of the advantages that we have is we have the most fuel-efficient fleet in florida as well as among the country. but also our solar focus and our big solar build helps as well because, frankly, we just burn left gas. so when you look at how much electricity, megawatt hours we actually produce every day and look at the amount of fuel we burn, the efficiency is the best way for us to save customers. as kirk said in his opening remarks, you look at how many billions of dollars that we've actually saved customers over the years by simply not charging them for fuel that we simply didn't have to buy.
so that remains a key focus for us along with our productivity and our o&m. i'm proud of the continued focus across the entire organization. we have the lowest o&m per kilowatt hour of any utility in america, and we're not satisfied with that. so we're going to continue to do that.
so we're tightening our belts to do everything we can to make sure our customer bills remain the lowest among all the ious in florida and among the lowest in the country.
dave arcaro -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. thanks so much.

and our next question comes from james thalacker from bmo capital markets. please go ahead with your question.
james thalacker -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
good morning, everybody. thanks for taking my call. 
kirk crews -- executive vice president and chief financial officer, nextera energy
good morning.
james thalacker -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
just real quick question. obviously, existing generation of storage and customer supply had a good quarter, quarter over quarter. i know obviously some of that was related to the above average wind resource, which rebounded quite a bit. but just wondering, post uri, a lot of the generators had sort of restructured some of their contracts.
did you guys see any benefits in 2q from any sort of maybe changing in your hedging strategy? and could that be something we could see kind of flowing through to the rest of the year?
kirk crews -- executive vice president and chief financial officer, nextera energy
yeah, sure. so we did not really have any change to the way that we operated our book. obviously, winter storm uri was an event where i think everyone who operated in texas learned some information in terms of the way to position their books. and we certainly have positioned our book to help better manage extreme conditions, both in the winter and the summer, but we did not have any significant changes to the way that we run the business in texas as a result.
james thalacker -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok, great. thanks so much.

good morning, everyone, and welcome to the nextera energy and nextera energy partners q2 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note that today's event is being recorded. at this time, i'd like to turn the conference call over to jessica geoffroy, director of investor relations. ma'am, please go ahead.
jessica geoffroy -- head of investor relations
thank you, jamie. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2022 combined earnings conference call for nextera energy and nextera energy partners. with me this morning are john ketchum, president and chief executive officer of nextera energy; kirk crews, executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy; rebecca kujawa, president and chief executive officer of nextera energy resources; and mark hickson, executive vice president of nextera energy. all of whom are also officers of nextera energy partners, as well as eric silagy, chairman, president and chief executive officer of florida power and light company.
kirk will provide an overview of our results, and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. we will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the securities and exchange commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
today's presentation also includes references to non-gaap financial measures. you should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-gaap measures to the closest gaap financial measure. as a reminder, florida power and light completed the regulatory integration of gulf power under its 2021 base rate settlement agreement and began serving customers under unified rates on january 1, 2022. as a result, gulf power will no longer continue as a separate reporting segment within florida power and light and nextera energy.
for 2022 and beyond, fpl has one reporting segment, and therefore, 2021 financial results and other operational metrics have been restated for comparative purposes. with that, i will turn the call over to kirk. 
kirk crews -- executive vice president and chief financial officer, nextera energy
thank you, jessica, and good morning, everyone. nextera energy delivered strong second quarter results and is well positioned to meet its overall objectives for the year. adjusted earnings per share increased approximately 14% year over year, reflecting continued strong financial and operational performance at both fpl and energy resources. fpl increased earnings per share by $0.05 year over year.
average regulatory capital employed increased by more than 11% versus the same quarter last year. with residential bills well below the national average and the lowest among all of the florida investor-owned utilities, fpl's focus continues to be on identifying smart capital investments such as our planned solar expansion and t&d hardening and undergrounding projects to lower costs, improve reliability and provide clean energy for the benefit of our customers. having saved customers more than $12 billion in fuel costs since 2001 and with the largest owned and operated solar portfolio of any utility in the country, fpl is well positioned to execute on its goal of achieving real zero carbon emissions by no later than 2045, which we announced last month at our investor conference, while continuing to deliver its best-in-class customer value proposition. at energy resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.06 year over year.
we continue to capitalize on a strong environment for renewables development, adding approximately 2,035 net megawatts to energy resources backlog since the last call. included in these backlog additions is approximately 1,200 net megawatts of solar projects, which is the second largest quarter of solar origination in our history. as we highlighted at our investor conference last month, we believe that a number of powerful tailwinds support continued strong renewables demand, particularly in the context of high power prices and high gas prices that are helping to make renewables the most economic form of generation. we expect these economic value drivers for new renewables, coupled with energy resources' significant competitive advantages, to translate into a tremendous opportunity set as we deliver clean energy solutions to our customers seeking to both lower their energy bills and reduce their carbon emissions.
we are pleased with the progress we have made at nextera energy so far in 2022 and heading into the second half of the year, we are well positioned to achieve the full year financial expectations that we have previously discussed, subject to our usual caveats. now, let's look at the detailed results, beginning with fpl. for the second quarter of 2022, fpl reported net income of $989 million or $0.50 per share, which is an increase of $107 million and $0.05 per share, respectively, year over year. regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11.4% over the same quarter last year and was a principal driver of fpl's net income growth of approximately 12%.
fpl's capital expenditures were approximately $1.9 billion in the second quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to total roughly $8.5 billion. fpl's reported roe for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ended june 2022. largely as a result of warm weather during the second quarter, we reversed roughly $44 million of reserve amortization recorded earlier in the year, leaving fpl with a balance of approximately $1.37 billion to use over the term of the current settlement agreement. during the quarter, fpl successfully commissioned the highly efficient, roughly 1,200 megawatt dania beach clean energy center.
the approximately $900 million project, which was completed on time and on budget, is expected to generate nearly $350 million in net cost savings for fpl customers while reducing carbon emissions by roughly 70% compared to the previous lauderdale plant. longer term, we expect to convert approximately 16 gigawatts of our highly efficient gas fleet to run on green hydrogen, which will play an important role in the decarbonization of fpl's generation fleet as part of our goal to achieve real zero carbon emissions by no later than 2045. last week, fpl also placed in service the north florida resiliency connection transmission line, which physically connects the fpl grid and the legacy gulf power grid. the new transmission line is expected to generate operational efficiencies and allow customers to benefit from both enhanced reliability and additional low-cost solar generation.
fpl also filed its updated storm protection plan, which is filed every three years. the plan provides details on the billions of dollars of capital investment anticipated over the next 10 years to continue hardening fpl's energy grid for the benefit of customers. these hardening programs, several of which have been in progress since 2007, collectively provide increased resiliency and faster restoration times for fpl's approximately 5.8 million customer accounts when severe weather, including hurricanes, inevitably affects our service territory. the florida economy remains strong.
florida's unemployment rate of approximately 3% remains below the national average and its labor force participation rate remains strong. the three-month moving average for new housing permits is up nearly 9% year over year, outpacing the national rate by roughly 7%. fpl's new service accounts increased more than 15% year over year, demonstrating continued strong growth in florida's economy. fpl's average number of customers increased by more than 87,000 or 1.5% versus the comparable prior-year quarter driven by continued strong underlying population growth as florida's population continues to increase at one of the fastest rates in the nation.
fpl's second quarter retail sales increased 3.2% from the prior-year comparable period driven primarily by a favorable weather comparison. on a weather-normalized basis, second quarter retail sales increased 1.3% with strong continued customer growth contributing favorably. energy resources reported second quarter 2022 gaap earnings of $133 million or $0.07 per share. adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $683 million or $0.35 per share.
the difference between energy resources second quarter gaap and adjusted earnings results is primarily the effect of the mark-to-market on non-qualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings. contributions from new investments were roughly flat versus the prior-year driven by the timing of new solar and storage project additions. for the full year 2022, we anticipate the majority of our growth in new investments to occur in the fourth quarter. our existing generation and storage assets added $0.03 per share primarily due to favorable wind resource during the second quarter.
the second quarter adjusted earnings contributions from our customer supply and trading business increased by $0.02 year over year driven primarily by the absence of winter storm uri impacts that negatively impacted adjusted earnings in the second quarter of last year. all other impacts increased results by $0.01 versus 2021. as i mentioned earlier, energy resources had another strong quarter of origination, adding approximately 2,035 net megawatts of renewables and storage projects to our backlog, which is the third largest quarter of renewables and storage origination in our history. since our last earnings call, we have added approximately 815 net megawatts of new wind, 1,200 net megawatts of solar and 20 net megawatts of battery storage to our backlog.
with these additions, net of projects placed in service, our renewables and storage backlog now stands at approximately 19,600 megawatts and provides terrific visibility into the strong growth that is expected at energy resources over the next few years. we remain confident in our long-term development expectations at energy resources, which we increased and extended last month. from 2022 through the end of 2025, energy resources expects to build roughly 28 to 37 gigawatts of renewables and storage projects. to put these numbers in context, this expected renewables and storage build at the midpoint is approximately 30% larger than the entire renewables operating portfolio at energy resources today.
we were pleased that the biden administration made the decision last month to direct the department of commerce to waive additional duties for two years on solar panels imported from malaysia, thailand, cambodia and vietnam. the 24-month timeframe is particularly important as by the end of that period, we expect our suppliers to be making ingots and wafers outside of china. as a reminder, the department of commerce staff already publicly stated that panels with wafers made outside of china are not subject to its investigation. the actions by the biden administration have provided much-needed clarity to our suppliers to resume solar module production, recommence shipping of solar panels and for energy resources to restart its solar construction projects that have been halted due to the circumvention investigation.
these new developments since our last call reinforce our confidence in both our near-term and long-term development expectations at energy resources. the accompanying slide provides additional details on where our development program at energy resources now stands. beyond renewables and storage, during the quarter, nextera energy water entered into an agreement to purchase a rate-regulated pennsylvania wastewater system for approximately $115 million. subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, we anticipate this transaction will close in mid-2023.
additionally, last week, nextera energy water closed on its previously announced acquisition of a portfolio of rate-regulated water and wastewater utility assets in texas. these strategic investments should allow us to leverage our world-class operating platform to unlock value for both customers and our shareholders as we explore potential opportunities in the regulated water utility business. at nextera energy transmission, we commissioned the empire state transmission line earlier this month. this project is an excellent complement to our existing operations and further expands nextera energy's regulated business mix through the addition of attractive rate-regulated assets to our portfolio.
it is expected to improve system reliability and deliver much-needed zero carbon emissions generation to new yorkers while supporting the state's goals to decarbonize its grid. so far, in 2022, nextera energy transmission has completed roughly $500 million of greenfield transmission projects. the addition of high-quality transmission projects such as the east-west tie and the empire state transmission line furthers our strategy to be north america's leading competitive transmission provider, both to accretively deploy capital as well as to enable further renewables development. turning now to the consolidated results for nextera energy.
for the second quarter of 2022, gaap net income attributable to nextera energy was $1.3 billion or $0.70 per share. nextera energy's 2022 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted eps were roughly $1.6 billion and $0.81 per share, respectively. adjusted results from the corporate and other segment decreased by $0.01 year over year. at our investor conference, we highlighted roughly $400 million in run rate efficiencies identified through project velocity that we expect to be recognized over the next few years.
this represents the largest identified cost savings in the history of our companywide productivity initiatives. in connection with project velocity, during the second quarter, we recorded transition costs of approximately $52 million pre-tax, of which $40 million was recorded at fpl and offset with the utilization of reserve amortization. the balance was recorded at energy resources and reduced adjusted eps by roughly $0.01 per share. our long-term financial expectations through 2025, which we increased last month at our investor conference, remain unchanged.
for 2022, nextera energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.80 to $2.90. for 2023 and 2024, nextera energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the ranges of $2.98 to $3.13 and $3.23 to $3.43, respectively. for 2025, we expect to grow 6% to 8% off the 2024 adjusted earnings per share range, which translates to a range of $3.45 to $3.70. we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025 while at the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings.
inclusive of the increases in our expectations in both january and june of this year, nextera energy's adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect a roughly 10% compound annual growth rate from 2021 to the high end of our range for 2025. based upon the clear visibility into meaningful organic growth prospects across all of our businesses, we also remain confident in our near-term capital plan to deploy approximately $85 billion to $95 billion into new investments from 2022 through 2025. in addition, from 2021 to 2025, we continue to expect that our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate range. we also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at a roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base.
as always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. as a reminder, energy resources development expectations and nextera energy's financial expectations through 2025 do not assume any change in current tax law. we continue to see strong market demand for renewables, especially in light of the environment of high gas and power prices that we believe will persist going forward. renewables are not just the most economic form of generation.
they are deflationary and countercyclical. renewable support energy independence help stimulate economic growth, including domestic job creation. renewables offer low-cost energy to help customers reduce their bills, and demand is being driven by a number of factors, as we discussed at our june investor conference. we continue to believe that nextera energy is better positioned than any other company in our industry to capitalize on these market conditions and deliver low-cost renewables and storage to our customers at both fpl and energy resources.
let me now turn to nextera energy partners, which delivered outstanding operational and financial performance for the quarter. second quarter adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution were up approximately 43% and 37%, respectively, against the prior-year comparable quarter. yesterday, the nextera energy partners board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.7625 per common unit or $3.05 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. inclusive of this increase, nextera energy partners has now grown its distribution per unit by more than 300% since the ipo.
last month at our investor conference, nextera energy partners announced a modification to incentive distribution rights fees, or idrs, with nextera energy. the announced modification flattens idr payments at $157 million annually based on a minimum annualized distribution rate of $3.05 per common unit. this modified idr structure will be effective beginning in the third quarter of this year. we expect both nextera energy partners' unitholders and nextera energy shareholders to benefit from the idr modification.
nextera energy partners will need fewer asset additions to achieve its growth objectives with reduced equity needs, among other benefits. nextera energy expects to benefit from the potential increased value in its investment in nextera energy partners while retaining an attractive incentive distribution fee stream as well as the ability to continue to recycle significant capital through nextera energy partners. putting it all together, these benefits are expected to provide a longer runway of lp distribution growth and support nextera energy partners' best-in-class distribution per unit growth expectations that we extended last month. nextera energy partners also completed multiple financings during the second quarter to further enhance its financing flexibility.
in may, nextera energy partners increased the size of its revolving credit facility by approximately $1.25 billion for a total of $2.5 billion in capacity, which is consistent with nextera energy partners' growth since the facility was last upsized in 2019. the facility was approximately 1.6x oversubscribed, which we believe demonstrates the strong credit quality of the nextera energy partners portfolio as well as the market confidence in nextera energy partners' growth outlook. additionally, nextera energy partners drew the approximately $410 million of remaining funds from its 2021 convertible equity portfolio financing. the strong demand for both the private investor and lending communities to provide nextera energy partners with liquidity for growth demonstrates the partnership's continued ability to raise capital at attractive terms.
with another strong origination quarter at energy resources, nextera energy partners' growth visibility is as strong as ever, and we remain on track to deliver on our best-in-class 12% to 15% annual distribution per unit growth expectation, which we extended through 2025 last month at our investor conference. finally, last week, s&p favorably revised nextera energy partners' business risk profile upward from satisfactory to strong to reflect its positive outlook on the partnership's continued growth and portfolio diversification while maintaining highly contracted revenue streams with highly rated counterparties. s&p also affirmed all of its ratings for nextera energy partners and lowered its downgrade threshold for its funds from operations, or ffo, to debt metric from the previous level of 14% to the current level of 12%. we believe these favorable adjustments reflect the strength of nextera energy partners' business and the stable cash flow generation profile of its portfolio.
turning to the detailed results. nextera energy partners' second quarter adjusted ebitda was $500 million, and cash available for distribution was $207 million. new projects, which primarily reflect contributions from the approximately 2,400 net megawatts of new long-term contracted renewable projects acquired in 2021, contributed approximately $106 million of adjusted ebitda and $41 million of cash available for distribution. existing projects added roughly $51 million of adjusted ebitda and $26 million of cash available for distribution in the second quarter driven primarily by favorable wind resource.
wind resource for the second quarter of 2022 was approximately 112% of the long-term average versus 93% in the second quarter of 2021. additional details of our second quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide. nextera energy partners run rate adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution expectation for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2022, which we increased last month at our investor conference, remain unchanged. nextera energy partners continues to expect year-end 2022 run rate adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution in the ranges of $1.785 billion to $1.985 billion and $685 million to $775 million, respectively, reflecting calendar year 2023 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2022.
as a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated idr fees as we treat fees as an operating expense. from a base of our fourth quarter 2021 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.83, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in lp distributions per unit as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2025. we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2022 distribution that is payable in february of 2023 to be in the range of $3.17 to $3.25 per common unit. additional details of our long-term distribution per unit expectations are shown on the accompanying slide.
in summary, we remain as enthusiastic as ever about the long-term growth prospects at both nextera energy and nextera energy partners. at fpl, that means continuing to deliver our best-in-class customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service. it also means pursuing our industry-leading real zero carbon emissions goal, which we detailed at our investor conference and in our zero carbon blueprint to decarbonize fpl's operations by no later than 2045. at energy resources, we believe that our best-in-class development and operating platform will allow us to maintain our leadership position as we help both power and nonpower sector customers save on energy costs and decarbonize operations with the adoption of new renewables and various forms of energy storage.
and we expect nextera energy partners to benefit greatly from the significant growth in renewables deployment across the united states, which presents terrific opportunities for acquisitions, both from energy resources and from third parties. that concludes our prepared remarks. and with that, we will open the line for questions.

[operator instructions] and our first question will come from steve fleishman with wolfe research. please go ahead.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
yeah. hi, good morning. thanks. so just first on the -- last quarter, you had mentioned the two gigawatts of potential backlog that could be at risk due to circumvention and the like.
and i don't see any updated footnotes on that. so i don't know if that's resolved or -- could you give us an update on those two gigawatts?
rebecca kujawa -- president and chief executive officer, nextera energy resources
good moring, steve. it's rebecca. and i'd be happy to start with that answer. first, let me start with the most important part, which is everything that we're seeing at this point in terms of origination at energy resources is just terrific.
we're seeing strong demand across all the technologies, strong demand across the different customer groups and strong demand across the country. and i feel terrific about meeting the long-term expectations that we've laid out, including reiterating today of the 27.7 to 36.9 gigawatts of new projects put into service between '22 and '25. and i think the origination for this quarter of the over 2,300 megawatts is a great sign to that, and the momentum remains very strong. as you know and appreciate being involved in the development process, there's always some things that can go wrong as you move forward with developing a project where it could be unforeseen permitting or interconnection issues or something else that gets in the way.
and so occasionally, we do remove projects from backlog like we did today. we didn't include the reference to the two gigawatts mostly because it's going to be harder and harder as time goes by to identify what's related to issues from circumvention and supply chain versus normal development issues. so i think i'd lean more on the side of giving you context for what's going on against our expectations, what's the current momentum. and both of those are just terrific.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok. that's good. and i guess just specific to supply chain, any updated things that you're seeing related to uflpa impacts?
rebecca kujawa -- president and chief executive officer, nextera energy resources
yes, steve. it continues to be an opportunity for our team to work through challenges that we're experiencing along with the rest of the industry. we've continued to work with the various agencies, most importantly, customs and border control, with our suppliers to bring clarity to these implementing regulations. and while we continue to see progress, it also continues to be slower than we would like.
everything that we've laid out today in terms of our expectations reflect our latest views on when panels will be delivered to us, and we'll be able to bring projects into service for our customers. one of the biggest things that our team has been working on over the last year is how do we mitigate the risks related to these broader geopolitical issues, whether you focus specifically on a circumvention issue or uflpa or whatever else it might entail. and our suppliers have made tremendous progress on de-risking that. and we've gotten a lot of increased confidence longer term.
it will be able to mitigate the issues even if we see some disruption in the short term.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok, great. thanks. one last question, just, i guess, on the internal investigation related to the florida political noise. is there any update on timing or -- and/or outcome of that?
john ketchum -- chairman and chief executive officer, nextera energy partners
steve, this is john. i'll go ahead and take that. let me just start from beginning. as you know, media articles have been published that allege, among other things, campaign finance violations by fpl, and we have a core who's been conducting a very thorough review of those allegations with the national law firm, paul, weiss.
late yesterday afternoon, a complaint was filed by a non-profit corporation with the federal election commission that appears to center around some of the same allegations as those that have appeared in a lot of the media articles. so all those allegations that have been made are within the scope of our review. we have a core who's been taking the matter very seriously, and we will continue to do so as we work toward completing our thorough review of these matters as quickly as possible. and that's really the only update i have at this point.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok. all right. thank you.

our next question will come from julien dumoulin-smith with bank of america. please go ahead.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey. good morning, team. thank you for the time. appreciate it.
listen, i just want to jump at the heart of the matter here. how do you think about ira in terms of increasing your eps through the 2025 forecast? or is this about extending the duration of the existing growth and/or both, right? the pivot to the solar ptc from itc for a host of products already in flight should be immediately accretive, you would think. but clearly, there could be some offsets as well. and then related, the added opportunities in the repowering and storage colocation as you guys quantify just now, in theory, should also afford an accelerated opportunity.
but i just want to come back on how you guys want to tackle that from an earnings recognition perspective.
john ketchum -- chairman and chief executive officer, nextera energy partners
yeah. let me go ahead and take that, julien. this is john. as you said, look, ira provides a tremendous opportunity set for us across the board.
obviously, we've had some contracts that were already in place that assumed itc on solar and obviously benefit from the production tax credit. so there's benefits certainly in the existing portfolio. i think we're also going to see some improvement going forward. as i said, i think recently at a conference in our 70-30 in the way things are treated on the unregulated business mix standpoint because, remember, those new ptcs that we get actually helped to buy down the contribution from the unregulated side of the business.
so that's a big benefit for us as well going forward. we have transferability options now built into ira that should help the cash flow from operations as well as we go -- as we think about the future of the business. i mean, obviously, it creates a lot of immediately in the money opportunities for us going forward, both on wind, on solar and on battery storage. nobody has the existing footprint that we have.
and so having not only a 20-gigawatt backlog, but you combine that with 25 gigawatts of operating renewables, and you just think about the potential opportunity of 45 gigawatts around repowerings and with regard to colocated storage because, as we all know, under the old regime, the only way you could really introduce storage into the puzzle was by combining it with solar. nobody has the wind footprint that we do. and so now we have the opportunity to put -- colocate storage in all of our wind sites, not only that we own today, but that we might build going forward. the same goes with solar.
and then obviously, there's an opportunity now to go ahead and build storage stand-alone. and so that is terrific, not only for energy resources, but obviously provides a great opportunity set for nep going forward as well. in terms of timing, which i think was the other part of your question, i think we've been very open that we plan to provide a further update on the next call in january on the q4 call.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. and just to get ahead of that fourth quarter a little bit, you would have a more holistic update on just the extent that the repowering opportunities and colocated opportunities through, call it, the '25 period by fourth quarter. again, i get that it takes some time to actually execute to decide what...
john ketchum -- chairman and chief executive officer, nextera energy partners
yeah, julien, we'll do the best we can. remember, too, that there are some regulations we're working on with the treasury department as well. so some of that update around repower and colocated storage might be tied to finalization of those, but we'll certainly try to give a view.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. all right. thank you. hey, best of luck.
we'll speak then.
john ketchum -- chairman and chief executive officer, nextera energy partners
yeah. thank you.

our next question will come from shar pourreza with guggenheim partners. please go ahead.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning.
john ketchum -- chairman and chief executive officer, nextera energy partners
good morning, shar.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
just a real quick follow-up on julien's question. just -- maybe just fine-tuning it a little bit, as we're kind of looking at just the near-term earnings guidance that you guys have out there, how do we sort of think about the ira impact as we're thinking about the existing ppas, right, which predominantly don't have any reopeners, and then you couple that with sort of some of the counteracting items like higher interest rate environment, do these two sort of items, are they offsetting? are they accretive? i guess how do we think about those two items in the context of what you guys have just reiterated this morning?
john ketchum -- chairman and chief executive officer, nextera energy partners
yeah. i think, shar, you've got to balance all those things together. first of all, it's really project by project. i mean some projects benefit more than others, and that really depends on which projects have been impacted by some of the supply chain issues that we have had.
that's really the first piece. from an interest rate standpoint, though, i think for -- kirk dealt with that. i mean, obviously, the current interest rate move is taken into account in our expectations. and i think we've been very prudent and careful about managing that interest rate exposure.
i mean we have $15 billion of interest rate swap protection in the book. so i'd really think about it more of -- more as a -- an itc to ptc versus supply chain trade-offs. some projects benefit more than others. so you kind of have to go down the list and look at it on a deal-by-deal basis.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
got it. ok. that's helpful. and then just on -- fpl, obviously, you had a 10-year site plan adjusted for inclusion of tax legislation.
i think ira came out even better than prior proposals. so does that prompt an update for a preferred solution at fp&l, maybe going from 10 to 20 gigs? what would be the cadence for an update or to pivot resource strategy there?
john ketchum -- chairman and chief executive officer, nextera energy partners
so we'll be filing -- updating our 10-year site plan as we do every year. we're in the process now of updating that. that gets filed on april 1. obviously, as i talked before, there's opportunities going forward.
we're always looking at ways to make it even more economic to be able to deploy the assets, including the solar that we're currently doing. but we're currently five years ahead of plan on our 10,000 megawatts of solar to be installed, and that's on file with the commission, and then we'll update our 10-year site plan and file that on april 1.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
got it. terrific. and then just one last quick one. just curious on the move in the rng side.
your '25 ebitda guidance for the acquisition is based on existing operating assets or does that include a backlog of rng development that would require additional funding? thanks.
rebecca kujawa -- president and chief executive officer, nextera energy resources
thanks, shar. appreciate the question. we're really excited about the acquisition. it is about just over 30 projects that do landfill, gas, electricity or renewable natural gas today.
and that number in '25 reflects our base case. and in our base case, we are converting a number of those facilities from landfill gas to electricity to renewable natural gas. so it does include the investment that we referenced in the prepared remarks of about $400 million in order to convert them to produce renewable natural gas. one of the reasons why we're really excited about the transaction, though, is there's a lot of optionality in it, and some of which was afforded in the inflation reduction act.
one is these projects now qualify for an investment tax credit, which obviously enhances the economics of the conversions. there's also the opportunity to support the further decarbonization or the improving of carbon intensity for blue hydrogen, which really opens up a whole new market for renewable natural gas that we think is going to be very attractive to blue hydrogen producers to enable the full value of the ptc where they otherwise wouldn't have been entitled to the full value of the ptc. and in doing that, we think that creates a real long-term contracted market because a blue hydrogen producer will be very motivated to lock in the value that the renewable natural gas lending will bring to their economics. there's also the opportunity, if it isn't a blue hydrogen contribution, actually to keep some of these assets producing electricity and utilizing what we expect are new regulations coming out of the epa to enable a pathway for the rins, the predominant renewable fuel credit that renewable natural gas benefits from today, that there'll be a pathway enabled for electric vehicles.
so that might enable us to not invest that $400 million in some or all of those assets to convert them to renewable natural gas. so i think the bottom line is we are very excited about it. we think this is a great platform from which to grow our renewable fuel business, our renewable energy solutions in order to help our customers across the broad set of sectors, both in the power sector and beyond to enable their full decarbonization.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
terrific, guys. thanks very much. see you in a couple of weeks. appreciate it.
rebecca kujawa -- president and chief executive officer, nextera energy resources

our next question will come from david arcaro with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
david arcaro -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks so much for taking my question.
john ketchum -- chairman and chief executive officer, nextera energy partners
good morning, david.
david arcaro -- morgan stanley -- analyst
good moring. maybe continuing on that, just wondering more broadly your thoughts on the m&a landscape, are there priorities or attractive opportunities out there in the market right now that you might be considering?
john ketchum -- chairman and chief executive officer, nextera energy partners
i will go ahead and take that. david, this is john. we have so many terrific organic opportunities, growth opportunities in front of us. m&a is not an area of focus.
david arcaro -- morgan stanley -- analyst
and then, maybe on the renewable side of things, wondering if you could comment on the icc and fema proposal to rate the structural risk ranking of solar and wind? what could that do for your projects, your pipeline and the costs for developing renewables?
john ketchum -- chairman and chief executive officer, nextera energy partners
i will go ahead and take as well. so fema did come forward with some recent proposals. those have not been put to a final vote yet. i think the best example as to why none of those changes are required is what we just saw with hurricane ian.
and so when you -- kirk had some of those remarks in the script, but i think it's worth noting, and obviously, we put this information back in front of fema that none of this is necessary. because if you evaluate what happened in hurricane ian, which was the fifth worst most catastrophic storm to ever hit the continental united states, it passed over 38 to 50 of our solar sites with maximum sustained winds of 150 miles per hour. we had essentially no impact to our solar generating facilities. about 0.3% of the panels were impacted.
and you got to remember, that slight number of impacts that even occurred were on the older sites that have the fixed tracker technology. now if the new tracker technology, we can move it east to west, we can pivot it to the 35 degrees. the wind cuts right through it. we saw essentially no damage at those sites.
the solar held up extremely well. and in some cases, i think probably better than even a gas plant, which are really rated up to only 100 miles an hour. so really happy with the way it all performed. we think the fema changes are completely unnecessary, and we are working through that with them with terrific evidence from how our own fleet just performed a couple of weeks ago as a no better case in point.
eric silagy -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer of florida power and light
so this is eric silagy. i guess i'll just add a little bit. so when john talks about the panels that were -- the 0.3% of panels that were affected, many of those panels weren't even damage at the point we simply put them back on and reuse them. so to put it in perspective, panels that actually had to be replaced out of 12 million panels is 0.03% or 3,000 panels out of 12 million.
and so to john's point, it is immaterial. and we were up and running the next morning with output at our plants.
david arcaro -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. i appreciate that color. thanks so much.
operator
our next question will come from michael lapides with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, guys. thank you for taking my question, and congrats on a good quarter. one for eric. talk about $8.5 billion of capital deployment this year at fp&l.
how should we think about what that level looks like, call it, in 2023 and 2024? and maybe what are the puts and takes that could move it in either direction for those years?
eric silagy -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer of florida power and light
hey, michael. it's eric. so look, we have a robust capital plan that continues. we've talked about it before from a standpoint of our storm hardening that program.
obviously, you could see the impacts with ian and how beautifully it really made a difference. we're going to continue with our storm hardening program, our undergrounding program, our solar build-out. we have great visibility into our capital deployed right through the rate case settlement period and what we have filed through our 10-year site plan.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. so i'm just trying to think about this just, is capital spend above or below 2022 levels for the next couple of years?
eric silagy -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer of florida power and light
it's basically where it is at the '22 levels. it varies a little bit but is exactly what we put forward for the plan here for the last two years that we've had going forward.
john ketchum -- chairman and chief executive officer, nextera energy partners
yeah. michael, i would just add, there's no real deviation from what we shared at the investor conference. so it's in line with the plans that we laid out in terms of roughly $8.2 billion to $8.5 billion a year over the settlement terms.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah, the only reason i ask -- and thank you for that. it's given the fact you've got the full surplus amortization back on board right now, you could actually invest more to improve reliability, and obviously, green the system even more without necessarily having to, a, hurt earnings; and b, increase customer rates for the next couple of years.
eric silagy -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer of florida power and light
yeah. but michael, again, we're right now sticking with our plan. we've got a good visibility. a lot of this, remember, it's a lot of execution.
and so we have a -- we've been managing the supply chain. we've been managing all the issues that have been a challenge for folks across the country and being able to hit that capex plan is right now what we see is the best path forward to be able to maintain what the commission expects and financially, what we expect.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. and then one for rebecca. just curious, what are you seeing in terms of just -- just given what's happening inflation-wise around the world, especially commodity and labor, what the cost to install new wind and solar has -- kind of how much that has changed before we kind of bake in the higher tax credit levels?
rebecca kujawa -- president and chief executive officer, nextera energy resources
yeah, michael. i think we obviously had a number of comments around this at the investor conference. we certainly have seen increases in costs, both in the -- or the -- actually equipment prices as well as balance the system and the labor to build the projects. i don't know that it's materially changed from what we shared with you a couple of months ago.
i think we were at the peak in a lot of commodity prices and even some of the key ones that ultimately affect the inherent costs of our building a project have come down since then. as we think about it long term, we obviously have views on what it's going to look like going forward and that we build those expectations into our power purchase agreement prices with our customers. i think one of the key things to keep in mind, particularly as you think about the overall demand for renewables and other clean energy solutions long term, is that they have such a competitive advantage against the alternatives. so even where we've seen increases in costs, even in some areas, maybe at parity with what we've seen in terms of the strict value that the ira incentives may have brought in terms of the difference versus prior incentives, what we've seen is that the alternatives have increased even more.
and that goes from new build as well as the overall market prices. so from our customer standpoint, which is what -- who we're focused on the most, they are as compelling as they've ever been to incorporate into their solutions, whether that be a power customer to bring down electricity prices for their customers, which is clearly very top of mind for our customers today, but also our non-power sector customers who are finding ways to not only provide a lower carbon intensity product to their customers, but they want to do it at lower cost. and we've got great solutions for them.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thank you, rebecca. thanks, eric and team.
operator
our next question will come from jeremy tonet with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
jeremy tonet -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
thanks for squeezing me in. just wanted to hit on rng real quick and maybe round out the conversation a little bit more, big acquisition here, but how do you think about the total addressable market here? and is the focus really just on landfills in certain locations or other parts of rng could be interesting as well? and then lastly, i guess, further expansion, it seems like you have quite a platform to work off here, but future rng would be just organic or could there be more purchases as well?
rebecca kujawa -- president and chief executive officer, nextera energy resources
hi, jeremy. and thanks for the question. we're very excited about the potential for rng, in particular, as part of the broad set of solutions we want to offer our customers. so i would say this is just a large step forward in something we've already been working on with smaller investments and some other co-investments with other folks.
and we're excited about not only adding these portfolio of projects and the value that this creates for our shareholders, but also using it as a platform for future growth. as part of this acquisition, building a services company along with it. that's part of what the existing portfolio provides, and we're excited about incorporating those capabilities into our team. and we are excited about both landfill gas and alternative forms of renewable natural gas, including very long term.
so we'll do it both through organic as well as through acquisitions. so -- and all of the above. we're excited about the size of the acquisition space. but before i get too excited, we also need to keep in mind that as the $85 billion to $95 billion of capital we want to invest over the period we laid out at the investor conference, this is approximately $1 billion and change.
so a great addition to our portfolio, but still in context, a measured step in the overall portfolio.
jeremy tonet -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
got it. very helpful. and just rounding out the conversation on hydrogen, i think you touched on it a bit, but any other updated thoughts you want to share with us post-ira here?
rebecca kujawa -- president and chief executive officer, nextera energy resources
i'm thrilled with the prospects of hydrogen going forward and not just literally hydrogen itself, but the renewable fuels that, that creates is potential solutions for our customers, whether that's synthetic natural gas as a potential solutions for customers who are looking for 7/24 fully decarbonized power, but also through synthetic jet fuels, synthetic ammonia products, other things that will help bring out of people's supply chain, manufacturing processes, etc, their carbon-intensive fuels that they use today. some of those are not going to be economic literally today, but there's a clear pathway to them being economic in a couple of years, but some of them with the benefit of the ira incentives are economic today. and at the heart of them, what the opportunity is for us is to deploy a substantial amount of renewable energy in the form of wind, solar, battery storage, the core things that we have been very successful doing for years now, if not decades, and we're continuing to invest heavily to maintain those competitive advantages going forward.
jeremy tonet -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
very helpful. i'll leave it there. thank you.
rebecca kujawa -- president and chief executive officer, nextera energy resources

good day, and welcome to the nextera energy and nextera energy partners third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note that this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to jessica geoffroy, director of investor relations. please go ahead.
jessica geoffroy -- head of investor relations
thank you, matt. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2022 combined earnings conference call for nextera energy and nextera energy partners. with me this morning are john ketchum, chairman, president and chief executive officer of nextera energy; kirk crews, executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy; rebecca kujawa, president and chief executive officer of nextera energy resources; and mark hickson, executive vice president of nextera energy, all of whom are also officers of nextera energy partners; as well as eric silagy, chairman, president and chief executive officer of florida power & light company. kirk will provide an overview of our results, and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.
we will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the securities and exchange commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. today's presentation also includes references to non-gaap financial measures.
you should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-gaap measures to the closest gaap financial measure. as a reminder, florida power & light completed the regulatory integration of gulf power under its 2021 base rate settlement agreement and began serving customers under unified rates on january 1, 2022. as a result, gulf power is no longer a separate reporting segment within florida power & light and nextera energy. for 2022 and beyond, fpl has one reporting segment.
and therefore, 2021 financial results and other operational metrics have been restated for comparative purposes. with that, i will turn the call over to kirk. 
kirk crews -- executive vice president and chief financial officer, nextera energy
thank you, jessica, and good morning, everyone. before i begin today's discussion of our third quarter results, i would like to extend our deepest sympathies to all those who have been affected by the widespread destruction caused by hurricanes fiona and ian over the last month. hurricane ian was the fifth strongest hurricane to ever make landfall in the continental u.s. the powerful and destructive storm hit southwest florida as a high-end category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of approximately 150 miles per hour, devastating storm surges and numerous tornadoes, tragically resulting in the loss of lives and causing more than 2.1 million fpl customers to lose power.
in preparation for the hurricane, fpl assembled a restoration workforce of approximately 20,000 workers. this preparation and coordinated response, combined with fpl's valuable hardening and smart grid investments, enabled the company to restore service to roughly two-thirds of affected customers after the first full day of restoration following hurricane ian's landfall. this represents the fastest restoration rate in our history for a major hurricane. our dedicated and resourceful workforce was able to restore essentially all fpl customers who are able to safely accept power within eight days.
i would like to thank all of our employees who made personal sacrifices leaving their own homes to serve our customers, our communities and our state. it was because of their training, their preparation their dedication and their commitment that we were able to restore power to our customers so quickly. i would also like to thank other members of the restoration team, including the contractors, vendors and first responders that supported our efforts, for their dedicated assistance during this critical time. finally, we are deeply grateful for the assistance provided by our industry partners who came from 30 different states to help support our customers.
mutual aid in times of disaster is one of the hallmarks of our industry, and this storm was no exception. for nearly two decades, fpl has invested significantly in building a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient grid. while no energy grid is hurricane-proof, the performance of our system demonstrates that fpl's hardening and undergrounding investments are providing significant benefits to our customers. despite sustained winds of approximately 150 miles per hour, fpl did not lose a single transmission pole or tower during hurricane ian.
additionally, initial performance data show that fpl's undergrounding distribution power lines performed five times better in terms of outage rates than existing overhead distribution power lines in southwest florida. on a related note, we were pleased that the florida public service commission substantially approved our 2023 storm protection plan earlier this month, which we expect will lead to an even stronger and more resilient grid for the benefit of our customers. finally, we are proud to report that our generation fleet, including our solar sites, sustained almost no structural damage. despite 38 of fpl's 50 existing solar sites or approximately 12 million panels being exposed to storm conditions, less than 0.3% of our solar panels were affected, and those impacted were mostly at our older fixed racking sites.
our battery storage sites, including one of the world's largest solar power batteries at our manatee solar energy center, remained available throughout the storm. we believe these investments, together with our preparation and coordinated response, have improved fpl's overall reliability and resiliency, providing significant value to our customers. although fpl has not completed the final accounting, our preliminary estimate of hurricane ian restoration costs that we plan to recover from customers through a surcharge is approximately $1.1 billion, of which approximately $220 million will be utilized to replenish the storm reserve, subject to a review and prudence determination of our final storm cost by the florida public service commission. under its current settlement agreement, fpl is allowed to collect an equivalent of $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt hours of usage on residential bills but can request an increase to the $4 equivalent surcharge given the cost exceeded $800 million.
we anticipate discussing the surcharge amount and timing with the florida public service commission in the coming months. let me briefly comment on the inflation reduction act, or ira, and what it means for our customers, for our company and for our industry. at our investor conference in june, we announced our vision to lead the decarbonization of the u.s. economy, and we announced our industry-leading goal to deliver real zero emissions by no later than 2045.
we discussed our strategy to get there and how every part of our strategy is focused on saving customers' money on their energy bills. we also said in june that achieving our goals would require constructive governmental policies and incentives. the ira gives us those policies and incentives at the federal level. it also gives us visibility into what those policies and incentives will look like for what we believe will be more than two decades.
we believe that the ira will not only help reduce carbon emissions, strengthen energy independent and security, and create jobs in our industry and in our domestic supply chain, but also and most importantly will reduce the cost of energy for everyone. we can already see some of the positive impacts of the ira on customer bills at fpl. last month, we filed with the florida public service commission our estimate that the solar production tax credits in the ira are expected to save customers nearly $400 million over the course of our current rate agreement. those savings start with a onetime $25 million refund through the capacity cost recovery clause in january 2023 to reflect the solar ptcs on our completed 2022 rate-based solar projects, subject to a review by the commission, which we expect later this year.
looking forward for our fpl customers, we believe that the ira makes every solar project, every battery storage project, every renewable gas project and every green hydrogen project more cost-effective. and these solar battery storage, renewable gas and green hydrogen projects are designed to reduce the impact that fuel volatility can have on customer bills. we believe the ira will help make florida an even better place to raise a family or build a business as we work toward our goal of delivering 100% carbon emissions free energy affordable and reliably. we believe the ira will also make clean energy cheaper for our customers at energy resources.
we have never been more excited about our opportunity to partner with customers to decarbonize the power sector as well as broader parts of the u.s. economy. the ira provides decades of visibility to low-cost renewables, and that visibility has already encouraged our power sector customers and customers outside the power sector to think big about how they can realize the value of renewables to reduce cost and emissions. as a world leader in renewables with deep energy market expertise, we were having conversations with customers about large-scale opportunities unlike anything we have seen in the past.
and while some will take time to develop, we cannot be more excited about the future. turning now to our financial performance. nextera energy delivered strong third quarter results, with adjusted earnings per share increasing by approximately 13% year over year. fpl increased earnings per share by $0.07 year over year, growing regulatory capital employed by approximately 11% over the prior-year period.
we have highlighted in the past our smart capital investments in fuel efficiency, combined with our best-in-class o&m performance and productivity initiatives, provide significant benefits to customers and have allowed us to continue to deliver residential bills well below the national average and the lowest among all of the florida investor-owned utilities. at energy resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.06 year over year. we continue to capitalize on a terrific environment for renewables development, originating approximately 2,345 megawatts of new renewables and storage since the last call. with economics as a significant driver, energy resources continues to capitalize on strong renewables demand from both power and non-power sector customers, particularly in light of high power prices and high natural gas prices.
overall, we are well positioned to achieve our long-term financial expectations, subject to our usual caveats. for the third quarter of 2022, fpl reported net income of nearly $1.1 billion or $0.54 per share, which is an increase of $147 million and $0.07 per share, respectively, year over year. regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of fpl's earnings-per-share growth of approximately 15%. fpl's capital expenditures were approximately $2 billion in the third quarter, and we continue to expect our full year capital investments to total roughly $8.5 billion.
fpl's reported roe for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 11.8% for the 12 months ended september 2022. largely as a result of warm weather, we have fully restored our surplus depreciation reserve, leaving fpl with a balance of approximately $1.5 billion to use over the term of the current settlement agreement. as a reminder, our 2021 settlement agreement provided a mechanism whereby a sustained increase in 30-year treasury bond yields would trigger an increase in fpl's authorized roe range. accordingly, the florida public service commission approved an increase in fpl's authorized midpoint roe from 10.6% to 10.8% with an allowed range of 9.8% to 11.8%, which became effective on september 1, 2022.
importantly, fpl will not increase base rates as a result of triggering the increased authorized roe. for the full year 2022, fpl continues to target an 11.6% roe but is allowed to earn at the high end of the revised range, which may occur based on, among other things, warmer-than-expected weather. the florida economy continues to be healthy. florida's unemployment rate of approximately 2.7% remains below the national average and at its lowest level in more than 15 years.
florida's labor force participation rate remains strong. in spite of significant inflationary pressures across many parts of the u.s., customer sentiment and florida ticked up slightly in the third quarter. however, the august reading of the three-month average of new building permits in florida declined year over year, which is not a surprise given the significant growth we have observed since the pandemic and the recent increase in mortgage rates. we continue to believe that florida offers a unique value proposition and will continue to show strong population growth over the coming decades.
fpl's average number of customers increased by nearly 83,000 or 1.5% versus the comparable prior-year quarter driven by continued strong underlying population growth. fpl's third quarter retail sales increased 3.8% from the prior-year comparable period. for the third quarter, we estimate that warmer weather had a positive year-over-year impact on usage per customer of approximately 2.9% and that hurricane ian had a negative impact of approximately 0.4%. after taking these factors into account, third quarter retail sales increased 1.3% on a weather-normalized basis, with a strong continued customer growth contributing favorably.
energy resources reported third quarter 2022 gaap earnings of $655 million or $0.33 per share. adjusted earnings for the third quarter were adjusted earnings per share of more than 19% year over year. contributions from new investments increased $0.02 per share versus the prior year, primarily reflecting continued growth in our renewable portfolio. our existing generation and storage assets decreased results by $0.02 per share, primarily due to unfavorable wind resource during the third quarter, which was the third lowest wind resource quarter on record over the past 30 years.
our customer supply and trading business contributed $0.06 year over year primarily due to higher margins in our customer-facing businesses. all other net impacts were roughly flat year over year. additional details of our third quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide. as i mentioned earlier, energy resources had another terrific quarter of origination, signing approximately 2,345 gigawatts of new renewables and storage projects since our last earnings call.
specifically, we originated approximately 1,215 megawatts of wind, 965 megawatts of solar and 165 megawatts of battery storage projects. included in these solar additions is approximately 270 megawatts of post-2025 delivery. with these new additions, net of approximately 1.3 gigawatts of projects placed in service and roughly 680 megawatts of projects removed from our backlog, our renewables and storage backlog now stands at roughly 20,000 megawatts and provides strong visibility into the significant growth that is expected at energy resources over the next few years. our development expectations through 2025 are unchanged from what we disclosed at our investor conference in june and reflect a planned renewables and storage build that is, at the midpoint, more than 20% larger than the entire renewables operating portfolio at energy resources today.
the accompanying slide provides additional details on where our development program at energy resources now stands. as previously discussed, we believe energy resources is better positioned than anyone in our sector to benefit from the provisions of the ira, particularly after 2025 when incentives were previously expected to expire or step down. with what we believe is over two decades of visibility for wind, solar and storage credits, the long-term growth opportunity set is expansive and exciting. energy resources is uniquely positioned to capitalize on battery storage colocation opportunities with wind and now has repowering opportunities across this existing renewables footprint.
new markets and new investment opportunities are being created for renewables and renewable fuels that require wind and solar as their source. transmission will be needed to support this significant renewables buildout. and all these opportunities support our vision of leading decarbonization of the u.s. economy.
a key component of our vision is helping commercial and industrial customers meet their sustainability goals by providing them with comprehensive clean energy solutions, including providing renewable fuel alternatives such as hydrogen and renewable natural gas. to that end, today, we are excited to announce we reached an agreement to acquire a large portfolio of operating landfill gas to electric facilities, which will become a core part of our renewable fuels and potentially hydrogen strategies. this transaction represents an attractive opportunity for energy resources to expand its portfolio of renewable natural gas assets and grow its in-house capabilities in this rapidly expanding market. energy resources intends to purchase the portfolio for a total consideration of approximately $1.1 billion, subject to closing adjustments, plus the assumption of approximately $37 million in existing project finance debt estimated at the time of closing.
subject to regulatory approvals, the acquisition is expected to close in early 2023. in the coming years, we expect to invest roughly $400 million net of the investment tax credit benefit of additional capital into the portfolio of projects, primarily to enable production of renewable natural gas. in our base case, we expect that the acquired portfolio delivered more than $220 million of adjusted ebitda at energy resources by 2025, which is included in our financial expectations. moreover, the acquisition is expected to deliver double-digit returns.
we are particularly excited about additional upside opportunities the portfolio may enable that are not included in our base case and look forward to potentially deploying additional capital and new ventures that may qualify for new federal incentives. turning now to the consolidated results for nextera energy. for the third quarter of 2022, gaap net income attributable to nextera energy was roughly $1.7 billion or $0.86 per share. nextera energy's 2022 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted eps were approximately $1.683 billion and $0.85 per share, respectively.
adjusted results for the corporate and other segment decreased by $0.03 year over year. a hallmark of our business is our financial discipline and forward planning as we grow the business, including the consideration of a range of scenarios to manage interest rate risk. in recent years, we've proactively engaged in liability management initiatives, which we expect to yield significant interest cost savings through 2025. additionally, we have $15 billion of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure on future debt issuances.
with the swaps in place, we're in good shape to manage 2023 and 2024 maturities and new debt issuances despite the current interest rate environment. finally, the recent increase in interest rates is taken into account in our financial expectations. our long-term financial expectations through 2025 remain unchanged. for 2022, nextera energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.80 to $2.90.
for 2023 and 2024, nextera energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the ranges of $2.98 to $3.13 and $3.23 to $3.43, respectively. for 2025, we expect to grow 6% to 8% off the 2024 adjusted earnings per share range, which translates to a range of $3.45 to $3.70. we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges for 2022 through 2025, while at the same time, maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. inclusive of the increases in our expectations in both january and june of this year, nextera energy's adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect a roughly 10% compound annual growth rate from 2021 to the high end of our range for 2025.
in addition, for 2021 to 2025, we continue to expect our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate range. we also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at a roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base. as always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. now, let's turn to nextera energy partners, which delivered strong financial performance for the quarter.
third quarter adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution were up approximately 13% and 17%, respectively, against the prior-year comparable quarter. last week, the nextera energy partners board declared a quarterly distribution of 78.75 cents per common unit or $3.15 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. inclusive of this increase, nextera energy partners has now grown its distribution per unit by approximately 320% since the ipo. nextera energy partners continued to execute against its growth initiatives during the quarter.
since the last earnings call, nextera energy partners completed its previously announced acquisition of an approximately 67% interest in a 230-megawatt 4-hour battery storage facility in california from energy resources. this acquisition further diversifies nextera energy partners portfolio into battery storage. during the quarter, nextera energy partners issued approximately $145 million in new equity through its at-the-market program and used these proceeds, along with cash on hand, to fund this acquisition. consistent with our long-term growth prospects, today, we are also introducing year-end 2023 run rate expectations, which are built upon nextera energy partners' strong existing portfolio and cash flow generation potential and continued ability to access low-cost capital to acquire accretive renewable energy projects.
at the midpoints, nextera energy partners' new year-end 2023 run rate expectation ranges reflect estimated growth in adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution of roughly 23% and 12%, respectively, from the comparable year-end 2022 run rate expectations. overall, we are pleased with the year-to-date execution at nextera energy partners and believe we are well positioned to continue delivering lp unitholder value going forward. turning to the detailed results. nextera energy partners' third quarter adjusted ebitda was $377 million, and cash available for distribution was $185 million.
new projects, which primarily reflect contributions from approximately 2,400 net megawatts of new long-term contracted renewable projects acquired in 2021, contributed approximately $66 million of adjusted ebitda and $23 million of cash available for distribution. the third quarter adjusted ebitda contribution from existing projects declined by approximately $18 million year over year driven primarily by unfavorable renewable resource. wind resource for the third quarter of 2022 was approximately 95% of the long-term average versus 101% in the third quarter of 2021. third quarter cash available for distribution benefited from higher year-over-year paygo payments from both new and existing projects after a relatively strong wind resource period in the first half of this year.
additional details of our third quarter results are shown on the accompanying slides. from a base of our fourth quarter 2021 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.83, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in lp distributions per unit as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2025. we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2022 distribution that is payable in february of 2023 to be in the range of $3.17 to $3.25 per common unit. additional details of our long-term distribution per unit expectations are shown on the accompanying slide.
nextera energy partners continues to expect year-end 2022 run rate adjusted ebitda and cash available for distribution in the ranges of $1.785 billion to $1.985 billion and $685 million to $775 million, respectively, reflecting calendar year 2023 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2022. at year-end 2023, we expect the run rate for adjusted ebitda to be in the range of $2.22 billion to $2.42 billion and run rate for cash available for distribution to be in the range of $770 million to $860 million. these expectations highlight our continued confidence in nextera energy partners' ability to deliver on its long-term distribution per common unit growth expectations. as a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated idr fees as we treat these as an operating expense.
nextera energy partners is well positioned to manage financing costs in the current interest rate environment. approximately 98% of nextera energy partners long-term debt, including current maturities, is not exposed to fluctuations in interest rate as it is either fixed rate debt or financially hedged. moreover, nextera energy partners has $6 billion of forward starting interest rate swaps, which will help mitigate the impact of higher interest rates on future debt issuances, whether for growth or maturities. nextera energy partners also has no significant debt maturities in '23, and debt maturities over the next five years are manageable in -- with the forward starting swaps.
finally, i'd like to close with a few words about how we expect the ira may benefit nextera energy partners and its lp unitholders. in response to the extension and expansion of clean energy tax credits, we anticipate an acceleration of renewables and storage deployment in the u.s. over the next few decades. in turn, we expect that nextera energy partners will continue to have ample opportunities to acquire assets from both energy resources and from third parties.
additionally, we believe that the long-term organic growth potential for nextera energy partners has increased, with potential new opportunities to repower its roughly 8 gigawatt existing wind and solar assets and to pair battery storage with this nearly 7 gigawatt existing wind portfolio. considering the potential impacts of the ira, our expectation regarding the overall tax position for nextera energy partners remains largely unchanged, including that it is not expected to pay any meaningful taxes for at least the next 15 years. combined with its current yield and the expectation of 12% to 15% annual distributions per unit growth through at least 2025, nextera energy partners has the potential to deliver a total after-tax return of approximately 20% annually through this time frame. with the ongoing strength of the renewables development environment and all of the market tailwinds provided by the ir, we believe that nextera energy partners remains well positioned to continue delivering on its unitholder value proposition.
in summary, we continue to believe that both nextera energy and nextera energy partners have some of the best execution track records in the industry, and we are extremely excited about the long-term growth prospects for both businesses and the value we can continue to create for both customers and shareholders. that concludes our prepared remarks. and with that, we will open the line for question.

operator
thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question comes from steve fleishman from wolfe research. please go ahead.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
yeah. hi, good morning. so, just a couple of questions on the management changes. so, you don't appear to be making any connection between the investigation and eric's retirement.
could you just confirm if that's correct or not? and then, i guess, secondly, just thoughts on, often with these successions, you'd bring somebody kind of internally up. so, maybe thoughts on bringing armando back, who we know well but just as opposed to kind of bringing someone internally up. thanks.
john ketchum -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, steve. first of all, on your first question on connection, we're not making a connection. eric, when i was first chosen to succeed jim, eric and i had a conversation.
eric said, look, i will give you a one-year commitment, stay at the company. and we would talk about it at the end of the year. eric satisfied that commitment to me. 2022, obviously, was a year with a lot of challenges, the distractions eric went through in his prepared remarks.
but when you think about all the challenges that he had to overcome, with the hurricanes and with high natural gas prices and inflation, and the supply chain, and the media allegations and all those things, i think it took a toll on eric that year and gave me his retirement notice. and it's -- the way i look at it is, it's a little earlier than i would have hoped eric would have wanted to do it. and so, we have a very deep bench over at fpl -- i'm going to your second question now -- a very deep bench at fpl. we have a lot of terrific folks that we could move into eric's role.
we have one individual in particular, christopher chapel. he is being promoted to chief operating officer as part of the transition. we're bringing armando back as well. and armando has been just a terrific friend to me.
i have a lot of respect for armando. i had the good fortune to work with armando for roughly 15 years. and i think he will do a great job of bringing christopher along, who i think, in the future, will just make an outstanding ceo of fpl. but he -- christopher has been running customer service.
he needs to get a little bit more experience on the operations side and working with the regulatory team and then on the financial side, getting us ready for the rate case. and i think the combination of armando working together with christopher, that is a very powerful team. and they will do a tremendous job working together to execute on behalf of fpl. and i think christopher has a very, very bright future with our company.
and all of you will have a chance to get to know him and to meet him in the near future. some of you have had that chance in the past, and i think that should be a familiar name to some of our investors. yeah. and steve, i wanted just eric to say a few words as well.
eric silagy -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer of florida power and light
steve, let me jump in here a little bit. look, because i'm sure you can appreciate these kind of decisions are never easy, and there's no ever perfect time. as john said, with the transition of leadership last year, you know, i gave john a commitment that i'd be here for at least a year. i didn't have any real hard timeline set.
but i've been in the chair for 11 years. this will be going into my 12th year. and my predecessor had been on the job for 10 years. jim had been in his job for 10 years.
before that, lewis hay had been in his job for 10 years. and as i look forward to, this is the kind of job that you have to plan ahead, and we're getting ready to go in another rate case cycle. i mean that's a multiyear type of approach. and so, to go forward longer means i'm really committing to 2026.
so, a lot of factors come into play. john touched on all of the challenges in 2022. i'm really, really proud of how the team handled them, but it's a 24-hour day job, and there were a lot of challenges that we successfully managed, but it's a decision that is not easy. but i feel good about moving forward and putting -- doing it when the company is in its strongest financial and operational position it's ever been in with a very strong leadership team, i think that's the right time to do it.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. i appreciate that color. thanks. that's the main question we've been getting from people.
so, just one other thing on the wind -- excuse me, on the backlog. it seems like there's a big increase in wind expectations for the next four years as the main driver of the higher backlog. could you just give more color on what's driving? is that just the extension of the credits or other things leading to more wind expectations through '26?
rebecca kujawa -- president and chief executive officer, nextera energy resources
good morning, steve. it's rebecca, and i'll chime in on that. it is exactly what john and kirk highlighted and what we've been talking about for the last couple of months following ira. with ira provisions, we now have extensions of incentives now through the end of the decade -- well, decade plus.
but just looking at visibility, it's exceptional now through the end of the decade and likely well beyond that. and it is a big change specifically for wind in this time frame, adding the 100% production tax credit now, obviously, through this expectation windows through it fully. and it's also supported by the backdrop of what i also have highlighted to you all and john talked about in his remarks about all of the positive follow-on effects from strong incentives on renewables and through the introduction of a hydrogen production tax credit. we're starting to see substantial demand and positive engagement around renewables to create green hydrogen and hydrogen-related products thereafter.
so, our development team is busy having the types of conversations we've never had before, and we can't be more excited about what's ahead. and that's for wind, solar, storage, and the hydrogen products that we're talking about.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
rebecca kujawa -- president and chief executive officer, nextera energy resources
thanks, steve.

our next question comes from julien dumoulin-smith from bank of america. please go ahead.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good morning, team, and congrats, eric, on your stellar career. armando, welcome back. it feels a little bit like when [inaudible] came back in 2009 here, i must admit. maybe just related to some of the changes here, just to follow up on that super quick.
first off, is armando committing to the full process here as you alluded to, the rate case cycle being a little bit protracted? and then related to that, what is the final timing in terms of this internal process that you guys had underway for the 8-k? and is that impacted at all by this pending fec process that you alluded to taking upwards of the balance of the year here?
john ketchum -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. let me go ahead and take those, julien. this is john. so, first of all, on our -- with armando.
armando is committed. he's coming back as our ceo and president of fpl. armando is committed. so, let me just say that.
and, again, as i said, he's inheriting just a terrific team. i would say easily, in my own belief, the best team in the industry. and it's a team eric built and did an outstanding job building and there's just a lot of strength there. and armando has a good fortune of being able to lead that organization.
and with christopher chapel, as i said, too taking on that chief-operating-officer role, i think that's quite a one-two punch that we're going to have over at fpl, combined with existing strength that we already have on the bench there. and the other thing i'll mention is that, in eric, we have the good fortune of eric staying through the middle of may, which will help ensure a very smooth transition for both armando moving into that role and for christopher, you know, having a chance to step up. and eric will do a great job on that transition and making sure all the right relationships or transition as part of that. that's the first piece.
the second piece, you talked about the internal process and timing. first of all, let me just cover one more time. we are substantially complete. on the florida side, as i said in my comments, we do not believe that fpl would be found liable of federal campaign finance violation based on our investigation.
and second, with regard to the fec process, let me just say a few words about the fec process just so everybody understands exactly what it is. the federal election commission has civil enforcement authority. anybody in the united states can file a claim with the fec. and given the political environment that we're in today, i would certainly expect even an uptick in more claims being filed with the fec.
but any citizen can file a complaint. that's where we are right now. a citizen special interest group filed a complaint. there is no formal legal proceeding or any proceeding with the fec right now.
the fec will take 12 to 18 months to decide whether or not there is a reason to believe that they should investigate this further. and we will file a motion for dismissal. we think that a claim like this that's based solely on media reports and allegations is not the type of a claim the fec should take up. if you read the complaint, the complaint details five different scenarios.
they -- those, if you add up all the contributions in those scenarios, they don't exceed $1.3 million. and so, when we look at the fec process as a whole and the fec complaint as a whole, we do not believe that the federal allegations taken as a whole, as i said, would have a material impact on our business.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. and then just super quickly, if i can. just with respect to the originations here, the 1.7 gigawatts since the third-quarter call, this seems a little bit down from the last quarterly call update on the slides. can you comment a little bit about the trends? obviously, i'm cognizant of the comments you made about the overall expectation through '26.
how do you think about that materializing, and the pace and just what customer feedback is in putting in orders now versus in subsequent periods?
john ketchum -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. let me take that, julien. the first thing i would say is the demand for renewables is as strong as ever. when i look at the opportunities that the development organization has right now, they are significant.
i mentioned in my remarks, the term sheet we signed on the 800-megawatt facility, in the central part of the u.s. for a green hydrogen facility that we didn't even account, for example. and we have a lot of interest around hydrogen right now that's going to fuel a lot of renewable opportunities. the c&i market is extremely strong.
we are just seeing a lot of demand across the board. and so, i think that's why you see with the revised development expectations, 42 gigawatts on the high end. oh, my gosh. i mean, think, those of you that have been following the company for a long time, 42 gigs, that's a 15% uptick on the last four-year set that we had.
i mean, just to put it in perspective, i mean, fpl's total generation fleet is 27 gigawatts. so, to -- 42 gigs over a four-year period. hopefully, that provides a little color and context.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. absolutely. thank you, guys.
operator
the next question comes from shar pourreza from guggenheim partners. please go ahead.
constantine lednev -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
good morning. it's actually constantine here for shar. and congrats on the great quarter and just wanted to wish eric the best in the next step. certainly, i appreciate that.
eric silagy -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer of florida power and light
thanks.
constantine lednev -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
maybe as a quick follow-up instead of doing a question, maybe just on the -- then you've noted higher impacts of the ira having some pull and push on the demand for renewables. and maybe just specifically on the details of the cadence of the growth to reach those '26 targets, front-end loaded, back-end loaded. anything there?
rebecca kujawa -- president and chief executive officer, nextera energy resources
yeah. hi, constantine. it's rebecca. i think the best place to point you to is the development expectations slide that kirk went through.
it's slide 12 in the materials, and it lays out the ranges by technology for '23 and '24 and then '25 and '26. and, obviously, there's a significant increase in going into '25 and '26, really for all the things that we're talking about, the significant momentum, also a lot of resolution over the last couple of months and clarity around some of the supply chain disruption that we've seen on the solar side. so, it is building, and the momentum, as john highlighted so well, remains exceptionally strong on the development and origination side. so, i'm really excited about everything that we see in our traditional businesses, as well as the commercial and industrial sector.
and then, of course, the burgeoning opportunities that we see on the green hydrogen and related product side.
constantine lednev -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
excellent. and on a related note, on the kind of upside from repowering opportunities, do you have any thoughts on kind of solar and storage type of repowering? i know that's a -- when they're starting to make an exit plan. just curious on the other side.
rebecca kujawa -- president and chief executive officer, nextera energy resources
yes. we're looking at it. and there's a -- we think there's opportunities over time to repower both battery storage projects, as well as on the solar side. they can be a little bit more complex, and we're certainly looking for some guidance as we go through this year from treasury on this point, as well as others, that will be helpful in giving us context.
but some of this is also timing. so, as you get more mature projects, obviously, 10 years on the wind side, five-plus years on the solar side, will be opportunities then really to expand the horizon for repowering. but as i talk to our team every day, we're looking at our existing generation portfolio. and i see more opportunities today to enhance the value of our existing portfolio than we've ever seen before.
that, of course, includes repowering. it includes adding battery storage. it includes thinking differently because of the exciting opportunities around green hydrogen. about even sizing some of those load opportunities, the electrolysis equipment to produce that hydrogen at existing assets.
and we're also making investments in transmission across a variety of the integrated system operation markets to be able to add transmission to increase the value of the existing portfolio. so, we think there's tons of opportunities and so much more certainty looking forward than we've ever had before because of the clarity around the incentives.
constantine lednev -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
excellent. thanks so much. we're running a little bit late, so i'll get back in the queue. 
rebecca kujawa -- president and chief executive officer, nextera energy resources
great. thanks.
operator
sorry. the next question comes from david arcaro from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
david arcaro -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. i was wondering if you could comment on just your latest experience with access to solar panels supply, whether there's any risk that you see for executing on this year's development plan? and how the uflpa law has been impacting projects?
kirk crews -- executive vice president and chief financial officer, nextera energy
sure. hi, dave. this is kirk. i'll take that.
so, the last time we spoke, i believe, was on the third-quarter earnings call, and we shared with you that as our integrated supply chain team had worked and certainly had a challenging year in 2022. but as we highlighted on the earnings call today, despite that challenging year, they did a really admirable job. we were able to still put into service 5,000 megawatts. and i think that really speaks to their ability to navigate that disruption.
and, certainly, part of that disruption was what you highlighted, which was the challenges around the ports and trying to work through the panels that have been detained at the ports. and as i mentioned, the challenges around the -- in the third quarter that we highlighted with some of the panels being detained there, what we've seen since the third-quarter call is some positive improvement. we've seen some of the panels that had previously been detained, released. and so, i would describe it as positive movement.
we continue to see each day some positive movement. so, we're continuing to monitoring it. we're watching it closely. the team is actively working with our suppliers and continuing to monitor it.
but compared to where we were in the third quarter, i think we are cautiously optimistic that we are seeing progress. and at least from our perspective, we continue to feel like it's something that we can manage in terms of continuing to deliver for our customers.
david arcaro -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok, great. thanks for that color. and on the renewables development program, i was wondering if green hydrogen is starting to have an impact on the back end of the plan in terms of influencing the renewables demand outlook, yet? like in 2026, are you starting to kind of weave in expected demand on renewables for -- from green hydrogen at that point?
rebecca kujawa -- president and chief executive officer, nextera energy resources
it's certainly something -- it's rebecca, it's obviously something that we considered when we were setting the development expectations and what we laid out today for you all. i can tell you from a practical standpoint, it very much is starting to show up in the conversations that we're looking at, including the 800-megawatt term sheet that we signed in recent weeks for a project that would be expected to cod in 2026. at this point, i think there are a number of folks, and ourselves included, working hard to put the right development opportunities together, but it is a very active market. we're really excited about opportunities to partner with key folks.
linde, among them, as we talked about on the call, but others as well to put forward terrific projects and really bring forward the promise of this technology that we've now been talking about. but it's really coming to reality. i think '26 is probably on the earlier side of what we ultimately will see is a significant ramp-up going into the end of the decade, where there's more opportunity to have supply ramp-up for electrolyzers, as well as other related equipment for some of those green hydrogen related products, as well as working through the development opportunities and establishing the ultimate customers for these products. but everything i see is really exciting and really starting to take shape just now, a number of months after the ira provisions were ultimately passed into law.ok, great.
that makes sense. thanks so much.

thank you, jason. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 combined earnings conference call for nextera energy and nextera energy partners. with me this morning are john ketchum, chairman, president, and chief executive officer of nextera energy; kirk crews, executive vice president and chief financial officer of nextera energy; rebecca kujawa, president and chief executive officer of nextera energy resources; and mark hickson, executive vice president of nextera energy, all of whom are also officers of nextera energy partners, as well as eric silagy, chairman, president, and chief executive officer of florida power & light company. john will provide some opening remarks and will then turn the call over to kirk for a review of our fourth-quarter and full-year results.
our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. we will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the securities and exchange commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
today's presentation also includes references to non-gaap financial measures. you should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-gaap measures to the closest gaap financial measure. as a reminder, florida power & light completed the regulatory integration of gulf power under its 2021 base rate settlement agreement and began serving customers under unified rates on january 1st, 2022. and as a result, gulf power is no longer a separate reporting segment within florida power & light and nextera energy.
for 2022 and beyond, fpl has one reporting segment, and therefore, 2021 financial results and other operational metrics have been restated for comparative purposes. with that, i will turn the call over to john. 
john ketchum -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, jessica, and good morning, everyone. before i turn to discussion of our financial results and the future growth prospects, i'd like to make some comments on the status of our review. as a reminder, we reported last quarter that we were reviewing allegations of florida state and federal campaign finance law violations raised in the media articles and a related complaint filed in october with the federal election commission. our review of information reasonably available to us is now substantially complete.
regarding the florida allegations, based on information in our possession, we believe that fpl would not be found liable for any of the florida campaign finance law violations as alleged in the media articles. with respect to the fec complaint, you may recall that it was filed by a special interest group and primarily relies on media articles that allege certain violations of the federal election campaign act by various parties, including by implication, fpl. the fec process is a confidential civil administrative process with an investigation only commencing if the fec votes to do so. we plan to file a response seeking dismissal of the fec complaint in the next few weeks and do not believe it is appropriate for a complaint such as this to move forward.
the total amount of contributions referenced in the complaint is less than $1.3 million, and we do not expect that allegations of federal campaign finance law violations taken as a whole would be material to us. with that behind us, i would like to now discuss our fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 financial results and future growth prospects. both nextera energy and nextera energy partners had a terrific year in 2022, and both businesses have never been better positioned. the cost and efficiency of new renewables have improved significantly over the last two decades, while natural gas prices have seen an increase over the past year with volatility likely to continue going forward.
at the same time, landmark renewables legislation was entered into law last fall. after the passage of the inflation reduction act, or ira, we often said it was transformational for our industry and our business. before ira, we largely qualified for two federal incentives, wind production tax credits and solar investment tax credits. we always had the challenge of planning the business with those federal incentives expected to phase down and expire in a few months or years.
some years, they were extended. others, they were not. the uncertainty changed customer behavior, and it changed our behavior. today, the incentives are clear.
they support a broader range of renewable technologies. they are in place for a much longer period of time, and they incentivize the domestic supply chain that will further reduce the cost of renewables that are made in the u.s.a., creating new american jobs. in short, we believe the ira provides growth visibility for a broad range of low-cost, clean energy solutions in a predictable way and for a long time. we believe that in this environment, low-cost renewables will help nextera energy and nextera energy partners continue to drive long-term value for our customers and our shareholders and unitholders.
so, today, i am excited to share that we are extending our financial expectations for an additional year at both nextera energy and nextera energy partners, and i look forward to sharing more details on those expectations in a few minutes. in 2022, nextera energy continued its long track record of outstanding execution, delivering full-year adjusted earnings per share of $2.90, up nearly 14% from 2021. as a result of strong operational and financial performance at both fpl and energy resources, we achieved the high end of our adjusted eps expectations range. over the past 10 years, we have delivered compound annual growth and adjusted eps of roughly 10% for our shareholders, which is the highest among all top 10 power companies. nextera energy outperformed the s&p 500 index by nearly 10% in 2022 despite a challenging year in the financial markets.
in terms of total shareholder return, nextera energy has outperformed the s&p 500 index and the s&p 500 utilities index on a three-, five-, 10-, and 15-year basis. over the past 15 years, we have outperformed nearly all of the other companies in the s&p 500 utilities index and more than tripled the average total shareholder return of the index. over the same period, we have outperformed 75% of the companies in the s&p 500, while nearly tripling the average total shareholder return of the index. we are proud of our long-term track record of creating shareholder value, but we remain intensely focused on execution at both fpl and energy resources, and we remain committed to delivering long-term growth for shareholders going forward.
we have a long history of executing and delivering on our commitments, even in periods of uncertainty and disruption, and 2022 is no exception. despite a challenging macro environment, we invested more than $19 billion in american energy infrastructure, while maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. overcoming supply chain challenges, we constructed and placed into service roughly 5,000 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects, demonstrating the strength and resiliency of our team's expertise and competitive advantages. while disruption created some near-term challenges, it also created opportunities, and i am extremely proud of our team's execution in 2022 and delivering adjusted eps growth of nearly 14%.
during 2022, fpl successfully executed on its strategic initiatives while delivering on what we believe is the best customer value proposition in america. despite inflationary pressures, we further reduced our already best-in-class nonfuel o&m cost per megawatt hour by approximately 8.6% versus 2021. we also continued our investments in solar generation that can reduce the variable fuel component of our customer bills. we placed into service approximately 450 megawatts of cost-effective solar during 2022, and we anticipate commissioning another roughly 1,200 megawatts of low-cost solar in 2023 bringing our total solar build-out to roughly 1.7 gigawatts within the first two years of our current rate agreement.
our relentless focus on productivity and making smart capital investments for the benefit of customers is a significant part of what has kept our typical 1000-kilowatt hour residential customer bills the lowest among florida investor-owned utilities and more than 30% below the national average. fpl has also continued to provide exceptional service reliability and was recognized for the seventh time in eight years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation. our team responded exceptionally well in response to hurricanes ian and nicole. and during the year of high inflation and high natural gas prices, fpl used its strong balance sheet to provide bill relief for its customers.
looking forward, we remain committed to providing clean, affordable and reliable service to our customers for many years to come. energy resources also had a terrific year in 2022, delivering adjusted earnings growth of nearly 11% versus the prior year. with economics driving strong demand for renewables, energy resources had a record year of new renewables and storage origination, adding more than 8,000 megawatts to our backlog, as we continue to capitalize on the ongoing clean energy transition that is occurring across the united states. within -- with the significant net additions over the last year, our renewables and storage backlog now stands at a year-end record of approximately 19 gigawatts net of projects placed in service and provides strong visibility into the growth that lies ahead.
our continued execution, combined with the long-term visibility into clean energy incentives and the strong market backdrop for low-cost renewables gives us more confidence in our long-term outlook at nextera energy. last june, we laid out our vision and strategy to decarbonize both ourselves and the broader u.s. economy. in august, the ira helped provide more certainty and flexibility to plan for growth than at any other time in our history.
over the next two decades, we are well positioned to continue our track record of creating long-term value for shareholders through additional renewables and storage investments, expansion into new markets and products that enable even more renewables and organic growth opportunities to optimize our existing fleet by repowering assets and co-locating storage. at fpl, our plan is to lower cost for customers by accretively deploying capital into low-cost solar, storage, and eventually, hydrogen. by transforming our generation fleet and continuing our decades-long strategy of fuel switching, we will not only help customers by keeping bills low but also help the state of florida achieve energy independence. our customers have already seen the positive impacts of the ira on their bills.
we estimate that solar production tax credits are expected to save customers roughly $400 million over the term of our current rate agreement. this month, those savings started with a one-time $36 million refund on customer bills for our completed 2022 rate-based solar projects. with only about 5% of fpl's generation mix coming from solar today, we are still in the early stages of building out our low-cost solar portfolio. in april, fpl expects to file its annual ten year site plan which will present our generation resource plan through 2032.
last year's plan included roughly 9,400 megawatts of new solar capacity through 2031, including roughly 4,600 megawatts of additional solar after 2025. by incorporating the ira benefits, we expect the post-2025 new solar capacity, and this year's plan will more than double what it was last year. we believe low-cost solar will also provide a valuable hedge for our customers against rising natural gas prices in the future. at energy resources, the combination of low-cost renewables, higher natural gas prices, and the broader push toward decarbonization across the economy enables our strategy to serve both utilities and commercial and industrial customers with comprehensive clean energy solutions.
these comprehensive clean energy solutions are often complex and, in addition to new renewables, can include renewable fuels, hydrogen, and behind-the-meter projects, all of which are expected to ultimately create even greater demand for renewables. customers are looking for long-term partnerships with customized solutions at a scale unlike anything we have seen in the past. and we believe that no company is better positioned than energy resources to serve these complex customer needs in a way that helps them both save money on their energy bills and meet their emissions-reduction goals. we are particularly excited about the potential for green hydrogen and the role it will play as a solution to help commercial and industrial customers cost effectively lower emissions.
we are building the algorithms and tools to identify and optimize the best green hydrogen sites around the country and leverage our significant interconnection and land inventory position. we are using the skills and capabilities that we have developed over the decades that we have led the renewables industry to participate in emerging clean hydrogen markets in a big way. and we are already starting to see some of our early efforts materialize. last week, we signed a term sheet for approximately 800 megawatts of new solar generation, which we have not included in our backlog.
that is expected to reach commercial operations in 2026 and is expected to support a green hydrogen related facility in development in the central united states. additionally, energy resources is participating in the development of hydrogen hubs in the southwest and southeast. earlier in the month, these hubs were encouraged to file full applications for federal funding from the u.s. department of energy under its $8 billion program to create networks of hydrogen producers, consumers, and local connective infrastructure to accelerate the use of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier.
in the southeast, our plan is to support 140 tons per day clean hydrogen facility at our gulf clean energy center that would be powered by fpl solar projects. in the southwest, our plan is to build a 120 tons per day electrolysis-based clean hydrogen project in arizona in partnership with linde, the world's largest industrial gases company and the largest liquid hydrogen producer in the united states, with whom we recently signed a memorandum of understanding. the clean hydrogen produced by this facility would be used to support decarbonization of the west coast mobility and industrial end markets. these are just a few examples of clean hydrogen opportunities our team is actively pursuing.
we continue to work with various partners on hydrogen solutions, and we are excited by both the number and scale of opportunities in front of us. at our investor conference in june last year, we announced energy resources development expectations of roughly 28 to 37 gigawatts of new build renewables and storage through 2025. in sizing those expectations, we considered, among other factors, the expiration and phase down of production tax credits and investment tax credits under then existing tax law. typically, when tax credits are near the planned expiration dates, we see a spike in demand in the immediate years prior.
then after-tax credits are extended, demand weakens in the short term. even though tax credits were extended with the ira, we are continuing to see tremendous demand for new renewables. it is against that backdrop of strong market demand and the continued cost advantages of renewables, combined with our unparalleled competitive advantages, that today, we are extending our development expectations at energy resources through 2026. we now believe that we will place into service approximately 32,700 to 41,800 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects from 2023 through the end of 2026.
if you compare midpoint to midpoint, our new four-year development expectations at energy resources are approximately 15% higher than the previous four-year development expectations range that we announced at our investor conference last year. to put these numbers into context, just executing at the low end of our new development expectations through 2026, would more than double the size of our current renewables and storage operating portfolio, which took us more than 20 years to complete. due to our long-term visibility into clean energy incentives and the significant growth opportunities of both fpl and energy resources, i am pleased to announce that we are extending our adjusted earnings-per-share growth expectations at nextera energy by an additional year through 2026. for 2023 and 2024, we expect our adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.98 to $3.13 and $3.23 to $3.43, respectively.
for 2025 and 2026, we expect to grow 6% to 8% of the 2024 adjusted eps range. this equates to a range of $3.45 to $3.70 for 2025 and $3.63 to $4 for 2026. we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in each of 2023, '24, '25, and '26, while at the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. as always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions.
let me now turn to nextera energy partners, which had another terrific year of execution while delivering on its commitments to unitholders. for 2022, nextera energy partners grew its lp distributions per unit by approximately 15% year over year and delivered more than 20% year-over-year growth in adjusted ebitda, highlighting the strength of its operating portfolio. this growth is supported by nextera energy partners' outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets, which was further diversified in 2022. during the year, nextera energy partners acquired interests in approximately 1,200 net megawatts of long-term contracted renewables and storage assets from energy resources.
our confidence in nextera energy partners' long runway of growth has been further bolstered by the ira, against a backdrop that we believe includes at least two decades of clean energy incentives. we expect nextera energy partners' opportunity set for acquiring renewables from both energy resources and from third parties to continue to be robust. nextera energy partners' organic growth opportunities have also expanded significantly, and we are currently evaluating repowering investments for roughly 1.3 gigawatts of wind assets owned by nextera energy partners for 2024 through 2026. additionally, earlier this month, nextera energy partners leveraged its cost of capital advantages to execute early buyouts of tax equity interest on two of its existing asset portfolios for approximately $190 million.
these transactions are intended to enable nextera energy partners to take advantage of the ira's new transferability provisions, which allow for the sale of tax credits to third parties. with the buyouts and subsequent transfer of tax credits, nextera energy partners can now fully access two cash flow streams for unitholders, project cash flows and cash flows that result from the transfer of ptcs. taken together, nextera energy partners expect these early tax equity investor buyouts to deliver an attractive cash available for distribution yield for unitholders. the significant tailwinds provided by the ira and energy resources' future renewables outlook, combined with nextera energy partners' third-party m&a and organic growth opportunities and continued ability to raise low-cost capital even in a challenging capital markets environment, provide us with long-term growth visibility.
as a result, today, we are pleased to announce that we are extending our financial expectations for nextera energy partners by another year. we now see 12% to 15% per year growth in per unit distributions as a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. we believe that nextera energy partners' distribution per unit growth expectations are best-in-class versus any other company of its kind in the market and that the combination of nextera energy partners' clean energy portfolio, growth visibility, and financing flexibility offers unitholders a uniquely attractive investor value proposition. in summary, both nextera energy and nextera energy partners have never been better positioned.
we anticipate a tremendous acceleration of growth in renewables and storage deployment across the u.s. due in part to the ira, particularly in the latter half of the decade. and we believe that our substantial competitive advantages will allow us to continue delivering value to shareholders and unitholders for many years to come. before turning the call over to kirk, i'd like to talk about the important organizational changes we're announcing this morning.
after 20 years with nextera energy, eric silagy, has notified me of his intention to retire from fpl where he has led the team for 11 years. eric has been a passionate advocate for continuous improvement. and under his leadership, fpl has been transformed into the nation's largest and most reliable electric utility. over the last decade, eric has led the efforts to modernize fpl's generating fleet, make it one of the cleanest, lowest cost, and most fuel-efficient in the country.
his commitment to putting customers first is demonstrated every day by fpl's award-winning customer service, bills that are significantly lower than the national average, and the best reliability in the country. last year, during hurricanes ian and nicole, i saw firsthand eric's dedication and compassion for our customers as he steered the fpl team to quickly restore power and quickly get the state of florida back on its feet. over his 20 years of dedicated service to our company, eric has also been a tremendous supporter of the communities where we do business. his advocacy across the state has helped to foster florida's economic growth, strengthen our state university system, and grow the next generation of florida leaders, just to name a few of his many accomplishments.
i want to thank eric for his service and wish him and his family all the best on this next chapter in life. with eric's departure, we are excited to welcome armando pimentel, back to nextera energy as fpl's president and ceo. as you know, armando previously served as nextera energy's and fpl's cfo and the president and ceo of nextera energy resources. as a lifelong floridian, armando is a proven leader that will be relentlessly focused on serving our customers. he is also a good friend and colleague, who i've worked closely with for many years.
and i am confident that under armando's leadership, fpl will continue its long track record of delivering outstanding performance to our customers. let me now turn the call over to eric, who will make some personal remarks.
eric silagy -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer of florida power and light
thank you, john. i want to start by saying what an honor and a privilege it has been to work for nextera energy. this company's performance has been unprecedented in our industry, and i couldn't be more proud of the results that we have delivered for our customers, our shareholders, and our employees. when i joined nextera energy in 2003, fpl relied more on foreign oil to generate electricity than any other utility in america.
we knew that we needed to modernize our generation portfolio, and we recognized that building a clean, low-cost and fuel-efficient fleet was a great decision for our customers as it would save them money on their fuel bill. today, that long-term vision has saved fpl customers a cumulative $14 billion over the last 20 years. that's $14 billion that never came out of our customers' pockets, helped them pay for their kids' education, take their families on vacation, or pay for any other family expenses. these efforts began by thinking of ourselves more as a technology company than a utility, finding new and innovative ways to run the grid, and it led to improved reliability, reduced operating costs, and a totally different way to approach hurricane restorations.
ultimately, this new way of thinking led to faster restoration times, which has saved the state of florida billions of dollars. these are just a few examples of how we've transformed fpl into one of america's cleanest, most affordable, and most reliable energy companies. while saying goodbye to such a great organization is always difficult, i know that now is the right time for me to hand over the reins of fpl. the last year has been one of the most challenging of my career, given the number of distractions, including two hurricanes and significant supply chain and inflationary pressures, to name just a few.
when john became ceo of nextera energy last year, i committed to him that i would stay in my role for at least one more year and have now satisfied that commitment. in april, i'll mark my 20th anniversary with nextera energy, at which point i will have led the fpl team for going on 12 years, which is well beyond the tenure of most ceos. we have two more years of execution before our next rate case proceeding, which is, as all of you know, an all-consuming process. and i just wasn't sure that i could fully commit to.
so, i feel it's best for the transition to take place now and for new leadership to take the helm of fpl to ensure consistent management heading into a very busy next couple of years. it's been the greatest honor of my career to lead the fpl team, and i cannot thank our nearly 10,000 fpl employees, thousands more of our retirees enough for their hard work, for their dedication and for always putting the customers first. they have served our communities and our state with distinction and always challenged themselves to get better every single day. in my opinion, and i'm a little biased, fpl is the best utility in the world.
i'm so proud of what our team has accomplished and is extremely well positioned to continue to deliver exceptional value to both customers, shareholders and to the state. i wish john, armando, and the entire fpl team all the best in their future endeavors. and now, let me turn the call over to kirk for more details.
kirk crews -- executive vice president and chief financial officer, nextera energy
thank you, eric, and good morning, everyone. let's now turn to the detailed results beginning with fpl. for the fourth quarter of 2022, fpl reported net income of $763 million or $0.38 per share, up $0.07 per share year over year. for the full year 2022, fpl reported net income of $3.7 billion or $1.87 per share, an increase of $0.24 per share versus 2021.
regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11.4% for 2022. we continue to expect fpl's average annual growth in regulatory capital employed to be roughly 9% over the four-year term of our current rate agreement. fpl's capital expenditures were approximately $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full-year capital investments to a total of roughly $9.2 billion. for the fourth quarter, fpl's net income was impacted by a number of factors, including favorable weather, as well as an approximately $40 million pre-tax contribution to charitable foundations that will allow us to continue to support the communities that we serve.
for the full year 2022, fpl's year-over-year net income growth of nearly $500 million was aided by favorable weather, increased customer growth, and effective cost management that supported our ability to continue to deploy smart capital for the benefit of customers. fpl's reported roe for regulatory purposes is expected to be 11.74% for the 12 months ended december 31st, 2022. during the fourth quarter, we did not use any reserve amortization, leaving fpl with a year-end 2022 balance of $1.45 billion. our overall capital program at fpl is progressing well.
we continue to advance one of the nation's largest solar expansions and successfully met our solar deployment objectives at fpl in 2022. beyond solar, construction on our green hydrogen pilot at the okeechobee clean energy center remains on schedule as it continues to advance toward its projected commercial operation date later this year. earlier this week, fpl filed with the florida public service commission its proposed plan to recover approximately $2.1 billion of incremental fuel costs incurred in 2022. under our proposed plan, fpl utilizes its strong balance sheet to spread these unrecovered 2022 fuel costs over a 21-month period beginning in april '23.
additionally, fpl's proposed plan would further benefit customers by offsetting the 2022 fuel costs recovery by approximately $1 billion this year based on the recent drop in projected natural gas prices compared to fpl's original 2023 projections made in the third quarter of 2022. we believe this proposal is a reflection of fpl's customer-centric strategy to navigate challenging environments for the benefit of customers. separately, fpl is also seeking recovery of approximately $1.3 billion of storm costs incurred in 2022. under fpl's proposal, the storm costs would be recovered over a 12-month period starting in april 2023 to reduce the potential customer bill impacts that could result from the simultaneous recovery of charges related to future storms.
taking both proposals together, we anticipate that fpl's typical 1,000-kilowatt hour residential customer bills as of april 2023 will remain well below the projected national average and the projected average for florida investor-owned utilities. the florida economy remains strong. over the last 10 years, florida's gdp has grown at a roughly 6% compound annual growth rate. the gdp of florida is roughly $1.4 trillion, which is up approximately 10% from 2021.
at the same time, florida's population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the nation. over the past year, florida has created roughly 600,000 new private sector jobs, and florida's labor force participation rate continues to improve at a faster rate than the rest of the country. although we have seen the growth rates stabilize, three-month average florida building permits, a leading indicator of residential new service accounts have outpaced the nation's quarterly growth in new building permits by roughly 6%. other measures of confidence in the florida economy have meaningfully improved versus the prior year, including an 11% improvement in florida's retail sales index and a roughly 2% decline in mortgage delinquencies.
during the quarter, fpl's average customer growth was strong, increasing by nearly 74,000 from the comparable prior-year quarter. fpl's fourth-quarter retail sales were up 2.1% versus the prior-year period, primarily driven by a favorable weather comparison. for 2022, fpl's retail sales increased 1% from the prior year on a weather-normalized basis, driven primarily by continued strong customer growth. energy resources reported fourth-quarter 2022 gaap net income of $996 million or $0.50 per share.
adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $402 million or $0.20 per share. for the full year, energy resources reported gaap earnings of $285 million or $0.14 per share and adjusted earnings of approximately $2.44 billion or $1.23 per share. the effect of the mark-to-market on nonqualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings, was the primary driver of the difference between energy resources' full-year gaap and adjusted earnings results. energy resources' full-year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased by $0.11 versus 2021.
contributions from new investments increased by $0.04 per share due to continued growth in our renewables and storage portfolio. as we previously highlighted, the commerce department's decision to investigate circumvention claims led to delays in the development of renewables, which effectively pushed out the completion of certain projects that we previously anticipated in 2022. as a result, contributions from new investments were negatively impacted in 2022. we anticipate that energy resources' adjusted earnings per share contributions from new investments will be much stronger in 2023 when we expect many of these delayed projects will be completed.
our customer supply and trading business increased results by $0.12 versus 2021, primarily due to high margins, higher margins in our customer-facing businesses, and the absence of winter storm uri impacts. our existing clean energy assets also increased results by $0.02 per share year over year. all other net impacts decreased results by $0.07 year over year, driven primarily by higher debt balances, reflecting growth in the business. additional details of our full-year 2022 results at energy resources are shown on the accompanying slide.
as john mentioned, energy resources delivered our best year ever for origination, signing approximately 8,030 megawatts of new renewables and battery storage projects. since the last call, we have originated approximately 1,700 megawatts of renewables and storage projects, including approximately 300 megawatts of wind, 730 megawatts of solar, and 670 megawatts of battery storage. our origination performance in 2022 reflects continued high demand among all customer classes, for clean energy solutions that not only help achieve their renewable energy goals, but perhaps more importantly, allow our customers to save on energy costs by switching to lower-cost forms of generation like wind, solar and solar plus storage. today, we are extending our renewables development expectations through 2026 as a result of our tremendous progress in 2022, strong continued origination success and the strong market demand for low-cost renewables driven in part by the ira.
our revised expectations are by far the largest expected four-year development program in our history and reflect our high level of confidence in energy resources' ongoing leadership position and the continued acceleration of renewables penetration across the country. the accompanying slide provides additional details on our new expectations and where our development program at energy resources now stands. as you know, the industry has faced significant supply chain challenges and disruption over the past year, and yet our integrated supply chain and engineering and construction teams demonstrated their resiliency by continuing to execute for our customers. and we have been working for over a year with our suppliers to manufacture wafers outside of china.
we believe the commerce department's preliminary determination on circumvention of antidumping and countervailing duties late last year clarified that solar panels manufactured in southeast asia, using wafers and cells produced outside of china, are not circumventing antidumping and countervailing duty laws. we are confident that we can source panels consistent with these guidelines by the end of the two-year waiver period. finally, we continue to advance discussions to support the domestic production of solar panels. turning now to the consolidated results for nextera energy.
for the fourth quarter of 2022, gaap net income attributable to nextera energy was $1.52 billion or $0.76 per share. nextera energy's 2022 fourth-quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted eps were approximately $1 billion or $0.51 per share, respectively. for the full year 2022, gaap net income attributable to nextera energy was $4.15 billion or $2.10 per share. adjusted earnings were $5.74 billion or $2.90 per share.
for the corporate and other segment, adjusted earnings for the full year were roughly flat compared to the prior year. as john mentioned, we invested more than $19 billion in our businesses in 2022, which we expect will again place nextera energy among the top capital investors in the u.s. across all sectors. capital recycling remains an important part of our financing strategy.
and this year, we recycled more than $5 billion of capital through asset sales and tax equity financings. additionally, as we have often highlighted, our underlying businesses generate significant cash flow. and in 2022, our operating cash flow grew more than 9% year over year, despite fpl being under recovered for fuel costs and incurring restoration costs for hurricanes ian and nicole. as a result of this strong cash generation, we proactively paid down nearly $3 billion in 2023 maturities.
finally, we ended the year with $15 billion of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure on future debt issuances. as a reminder, the current interest rate environment is taken into account in our financial expectations. as john discussed, today, we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share expectations for 2023 through 2025 and introducing expectations for 2026. details of our new financial expectations are included in the accompanying slide.
we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges. for 2021 to 2026, we expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate range. we also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024, off a 2022 base. as always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions.
let me now turn to the detailed financial results for nextera energy partners. fourth-quarter adjusted ebitda was $360 million, up approximately 12% year over year. adjusted ebitda growth versus the prior-year comparable quarter was primarily due to new asset additions. fourth-quarter cash available for distribution was $74 million.
as a reminder, nextera energy partners operating expenses and interest expense on project debt are typically higher in the fourth quarter versus the first three quarters of the year. for the full year 2022, adjusted ebitda was approximately $1.65 billion, up 21% year over year and was primarily driven by the full -- by the full contribution from new projects acquired in late 2021. existing projects added approximately $13 million of adjusted ebitda year over year with the benefit of higher net generation for both wind and solar, partially offset by relatively higher operating and maintenance costs versus 2021. nextera energy partners' cash available for distribution was $634 million for the full year.
relative to the growth in nextera energy partners' full-year adjusted ebitda, its cash available for distribution from existing projects was also impacted by relatively higher allocation of production tax credits to investors due to favorable wind resource versus 2021. over the past five years, nextera energy partners' cash available for distribution has grown at a compound annual growth rate of more than 20%. as a reminder, these results include the impact of idr fees, which we treat as an operating expense. additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.
yesterday, the nextera energy partners board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.8125 per common unit or $3.25 per unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% year over year and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2022. inclusive of this increase, nextera energy partners has grown its distribution per unit by more than 330% since the ipo. during 2022, nextera energy partners executed several low-cost financings, continuing its successful track record of accessing attractive sources of capital to support growth for unitholders. during the fourth quarter, nextera energy partners entered into a new convertible equity portfolio financing for approximately $900 million, with a low implied cash coupon of roughly 2.8% for up to 10 years to be funded by the investors' share of ongoing portfolio cash flows.
in december, nextera energy partners raised approximately $500 million in new convertible notes with a 2.5% coupon which, along with a cap call entered into at the time of the financing, provides unitholders with dilution protection for up to 50% accretion versus the net unit price at the time of issuance. the implied total cost of the convertible notes represents the most favorable spread to an alternative debt issuance in our history. these transactions executed during the fourth quarter were a continuation of nextera energy partners' successful financing execution throughout 2022. in may 2022, nextera energy partners increased the size of its revolving credit facility to approximately $2.5 billion, nearly all of which is currently available.
with this available revolving credit capacity and the final funding of approximately $180 million expected from the 2022 convertible equity portfolio financing, nextera energy partners enters 2023 with significant financing capacity to fund future growth. additionally, nextera energy partners still has $6 billion of forward starting interest rate swaps, which is more than enough to cover its corporate maturities through 2027 and will help mitigate the impact of higher interest rates on future debt issuance, whether for maturities or net new issuances. taken together, we believe that nextera energy partners is extremely well positioned with significant interest rate protection and ample liquidity to finance future growth and to capture a meaningful share of the long-term opportunity set, which has expanded as a result of the ira. the significant opportunity set and nextera energy partners' meaningful financing flexibility provides us with confidence in our ability to continue to deliver long-term value for unitholders over the coming years.
from an updated base of our fourth-quarter 2022 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $3.25, we now see 12% to 15% growth per year in lp distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026, which is an additional year beyond our prior expectations, driven by the partnership's tremendous long-term growth visibility. we expect the annualized rate of the fourth-quarter 2023 distribution that is payable in february 2024 to be in a range of $3.64 and to $3.74 per common unit. nextera energy partners' rate -- run rate expectations for adjusted ebitda and cash available for distributions at december 31st, 2023, remain unchanged. year-end 2023 run rate adjusted ebitda expectations are $2.22 billion to $2.42 billion, and cash available for distribution of $770 million to $860 million, respectively, reflecting calendar year 2024 contributions expected from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2023.
as a reminder, all our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated idr fees as we treat these as operating expense. in summary, we continue to believe that both nextera energy and nextera energy partners have excellent prospects for growth, both in the near term and long term. near term, the progress we made in 2022 reinforces our growth outlook and sets the foundation for continuing to deliver on our financial expectations. long term, we believe that the low cost of renewables, combined with our -- with other clean energy solutions, enabled in part by the ira provides us with unprecedented visibility to extend our track record of delivering long-term growth for our shareholders and unitholders, and we could not be more excited about our future.
that concludes our prepared remarks. and with that, we will open the line for questions.
