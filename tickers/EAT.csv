operator
good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the brinker international q2 f'21 earnings call. [operator instructions] it is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, mika ware. ma'am, the floor is yours.
mika ware -- vice president, finance and investor relations
thank you, kate, and good morning, everyone. welcome to the earnings call for brinker international's second quarter of fiscal 2021. with me on today's call are wyman roberts, chief executive officer and president; and joe taylor, our chief financial officer. results for the quarter were released earlier this morning and are available on our website at brinker.com.
as usual, wyman and joe will first make prepared comments related to our operating performance and strategic initiatives. then we will open the call for your questions. before beginning our comments, it's my job to remind everyone of our safe harbor regarding forward-looking statements. during our call, management may discuss certain items which are not based entirely on historical facts.
any such items should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. all such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated. such risks and uncertainties include factors more completely described in this morning's press release and company's filings with the sec. and of course, on the call, we may refer to certain non-gaap financial measures that management uses in its review of the business and believes will provide insight into the company's ongoing operations.
and with that said, i will turn the call over to wyman. 
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
thanks, mika, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. q2 was a dynamic quarter, and joe is going to walk you through the details. you know, as we think about all the craziness 2020 brought across our industry and our world, we're also appreciative of the invaluable lessons we gained. we learned we have the right team in the field and here at the restaurant support center.
our operators are working tirelessly every day to deliver great experiences for our guests and team members as we aggressively pursue opportunities to grow our business organically. we learned that we can drive our business and increase market share despite the hurdles brought on by a global pandemic and widespread civil and political interest. in the second quarter, chili's increased its two-year trend of taking share and leading the category with an 18% beat in sales and a 25% beat in traffic according to knapp-track. we learned that our strategies work.
the ways we leveraged our scale and our ownership model and the investments we continue to make in technology and improving our operational systems, they were working well for us prior to the pandemic and continued to work even more effectively throughout the year. leveraging those competitive advantages, open up opportunities for us to grow our business in unique and innovative ways, like elevating our digital guest experience at both brands and leaning into virtual brands. those things are hard to execute and even harder to replicate. so we're taking those lessons into 2021 as we prepare to accelerate organic growth in a post-vaccine environment.
we believe like most others that a widespread vaccine will indeed release pent-up dining room demand, and our operators are excited to return to full capacity and deliver more great guest experiences in person. but we don't expect a return to the old normal. 2020 fundamentally changed us as consumers. we were forced to use technology to enjoy our favorite restaurants in new ways like third-party delivery.
crop side takeout, qr code menus, and mobile payment. and now that we've experienced greater convenience and control over our experience, we're not likely to give it all back. the brinker team knew that convenience was a big opportunity even before the pandemic. 2020 just accelerated our commitment to embrace consumers' gravitation toward digital interaction and meet them where they are.
we believe digital sales and traffic will continue to be a strategic driver of our results in both the near and long term. so in preparation for fiscal '22, we're dedicating even more time, effort, and capital to accelerate in our competitive advantage as a digital leader in the category and aggressively pursuing opportunities to drive our top and bottom line. at chili's, we're testing a fully integrated digital experience that gives our guests control over the pace of their experience and level of interaction with our team, whether they're dining in or off-premise. it's still early, but the team is making tremendous progress, and the guests and our test restaurants are responding really well.
we anticipate a rollout beginning fourth quarter. we've also spent a great deal of time and effort systematizing what goes out the side door at both our brands. we got really good at takeout and delivery during the height of quarantine. so while our dining rooms are still at limited capacity, we're ensuring we have strong systems in place to support our operators and execute a robust off-premise business even as our dining rooms returned to full capacity.
delivering a best-in-class off-premise experience also supports virtual brands, which is a key component of our growth strategy. our scale and our ownership model, coupled with our ability to mine data and develop systems, is proving very effective in this new world of virtual brands. it's just wings is on track and performing well. we believe there's significant upside.
so we're focused on building it into a strong, sustainable brand. some of the biggest brands in the world right now are virtual. so we know the model resonates with consumers as long as you deliver a great product. right now, we have a one-channel solution.
we're working to optimize that channel through incremental marketing opportunities and expanded consumer touchpoints. we're also going to grow the brand through additional channels like takeout. we're ensuring we have the right systems in place that will best support our operator's ability to execute at a high level, especially as dining rooms reopen. once we know we're consistently delivering a great guest experience and our operator at -- from our operators at full volumes, we'll move strategically to launch another virtual brand.
i anticipate that by the end of this fiscal year, we'll have a clear line of sight and be able to share more details with you. listing 2020 was a crazy year, but through it, we confirm that our strategies are working and that we have an outstanding team in the field and at the restaurant support center. every day, they demonstrate their ability to adapt for severe and win. as vaccines roll out and our country begins to leave their homes once again, i firmly believe we'll continue to win.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to joe.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
thanks, wyman, and good morning, everyone. let me finish our prepared comments by providing some detail and context to our second-quarter results, as well as offer a few insights for our january's period's sales performance. the second-quarter fiscal 2021, brinker delivered adjusted diluted eps of $0.35. brinker's total revenues were $761 million, and consolidated reported net comp sales were negative 12.1%.
a couple of items to note for the quarter. first, let me highlight impacts to the consolidated quarter resulting from maggiano's performance, which was highly constrained by covid restrictions and appropriate consumer reactions to the pandemic. as a reminder, the second quarter is traditionally their highest performing quarter. however, this year, covid eliminated most of their typically robust banquet and corporate catering channels, both of which tend to overdeliver to results for their second quarter.
the brand's operating profit was $22 million below last year, constituting virtually all of the reduction in consolidated operating profit for brinker. the impact on consolidated comp sales and restaurant operating margin were also outsized with the brand reporting net comp sales of negative 47% and a restaurant operating margin of 5.5%, down more than 11% from prior year. with the second quarter now behind us, we expect the impact from maggiano's to the consolidated performance of brinker to be more muted as we head into the rest of the fiscal year, particularly as the brand recovers from both an improved operating environment and the implementation of performance driving initiatives. now, moving on to chili's.
the brand continued its relative strong performance, although also impacted by covid restrictions during the latter half of the quarter. operating income for the brand was relatively close to last year and only $1.6 million. chili's reported net comp sales for the second quarter of negative 6.3%. this result does contain a holiday flip, which benefited the brand by approximately 100 basis points as christmas moved out of q2 and into q3.
the brand continues to meaningfully outperform the casual-dining sector with our gap strengthening in both sales and traffic through the second quarter. traffic gaps in the knapp index exceeded 20% throughout the quarter. performance relative to the competition was strong throughout the country, with double-digit sales gaps recorded in regions from east to west coast. included in the consolidated adjusted net income for the quarter with a tax benefit of approximately $2.4 million, primarily driven by employment tax credits.
part of this benefit is a $1.8 million catch-up related to q1, which was over accrued relative to our current expectations for our annual tax liability. the consolidated restaurant operating margin for the second quarter was 10.7%. most of the variance to prior year is the result of the lower-than-normal contribution from maggiano's, which impacted the consolidated margin by 130 basis points. the leverage due to top-line softening in november and december was the secondary influence.
a food and beverage expense was unfavorable year over year by 40 basis points primarily a result of menu mix, some higher costs from items such as cheese and produce. labor costs were favorable 10 basis points with savings in hourly expenses, offset by deleverage. included in this performance is a consistent level of manager bonus compared to last year's second quarter. we remain committed to retaining our restaurant leadership teams as they are critical to our success, both in the short term and as the operating environment returns to more normal conditions.
restaurant expense was unfavorable year over year by 170 basis points, driven by top-line deleverage, increased delivery, and packaging, partially offset by lower advertising and restaurant maintenance expenses. even with the volatile operating environment, brinker has delivered solid cash flow, generating $130 million of operating cash flow year to date. after capital expenditures of $37 million, our free cash flow for the first six months totaled nearly $93 million. as i mentioned last quarter, we first used our cash to invest in the business.
unit expansion is progressing with six new or relocated restaurants opened year to date. we also continue to invest in restaurant reimages, technology, and equipment to further enhance our guest experience and allow for better execution as our sales volumes, both on and off-premise grow. our second priority is to pay down debt. so far, during this fiscal year, we have retired over $66 million of revolving credit borrowings, and plan for further meaningful reductions as we progress through the second half of the year.
as i've indicated during prior earnings calls, we are strengthening our balance sheet by deleveraging to below 3.5 times lease-adjusted debt, which we anticipate achieving next fiscal year. from a total liquidity perspective, we ended the quarter with $64 million of cash and total liquidity of just under $658 million. while we are not providing specific guidance for the third quarter due to the ongoing operational environment, i do want to offer some perspective on january. while the first week of january was negatively impacted by the holiday flip of christmas moving to our third quarter, top-line results for chile's strengthened as we move through the remaining four weeks of the period.
underlying this performance is improvement in the net comp sales to a range of negative 5% to negative 6% for the last four weeks combined. these results obviously included the impact of ongoing covid-related restrictions, particularly dining room closures in our no. 3 and 4 markets of california and illinois. factoring out these two markets, the rest of the brand during the last four weeks of the january period should record net comp sales of approximately positive 2%, again, clearly indicating the brand's ability to perform in a strong positive sales manner with dining rooms open.
also supporting the january results is the performance of it's just wings. as you might expect, the brand does well in conjunction with sports, and our ability to market on the delivery platform around major events allowed highly incremental sales and set a number of sales records during the period. overall, we are hopeful for an improved operating environment as we move through the quarter with the opportunity to return to recovery level performance we delivered in the early fall. in march, we start to lap at the initial pandemic outbreak, which we anticipate will create meaningful year-over-year positive net comp sales comparisons.
looking beyond the short-term volatility caused by the ways of covid restrictions to the solid long-term strategy being executed by our operators, i'm confident as to what this company can deliver for our shareholders. our focus and execution will enable our continued performance as a leader for the casual-dining sector for the rest of this fiscal year and the years ahead. and now, with our prepared comments complete, let's move to your questions. kate, i'll turn it back over to you to moderate.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question today is coming from david palmer. please note your affiliation then pose your question.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks. evercore isi. just a question on marketing to start. how do you think you'll end up spending money, gross spending broadly? it can be advertising, whether that's digital or tv or your email promotions.
how do you think that will settle out for you, both as a percent of sales, but also the breakup between these? and then i have a quick follow-up.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
hey, david, it's wyman. i don't know if i can give you the percent of sales number right now. and again, with higher sales that we anticipate, those numbers are going to move around. but i will tell you, just as we think about marketing, we are just thinking about it differently and not in the traditional sense as much.
and so when you think about the significant reduction we've had in traditional media spending, but we've offset that with significant increases in digital direct and the support of our takeout and virtual brands through third-party partnerships and promotions, as well as fees. so we kind of look at that whole bucket. and in some cases, if we're going to leverage our database more, a lot of that shows up as comp expense, which doesn't really -- it nets out of sales. so you wouldn't even see it in the p&l as you're looking at net sales.
but we are committed to much more what we think is a forward-looking approach to marketing, much more direct, and much more digital.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks. and i have another sort of forward-looking one that hopefully you can give us some texture on, that's around your third-party brands or your virtual brands. you were testing a few. there was a thought that perhaps one of those tests stopped happening.
i think it was on flatters and pies. but perhaps you can talk about the pipeline of your virtual brand and what the stages are. and how you think you roll those out? it sounds like you're now going to maybe be unmasking. it's just wings by having it go out of the chili's itself as a growth thing.
but i wonder also those other brands in terms of the delivery side. thanks.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
well, first, david, let's just talk about the unmasking comment because we've never thought it was important, and this is through the whole testing process to keep these brands secretive, if you will, that we want to be upfront with consumers about where -- who these brands are sponsored by who actually is producing this product because we think that transparency is important. and so the process that we're going through is as we introduce a virtual brand in test, first understand how viable it is from two primary aspects, right? how big is the potential from a sales and a consumer perspective? and then how operationally executable is it in our restaurants. so when we stop a test, it doesn't necessarily mean that test was unsuccessful. it just means we're done testing.
we could very well be -- have everything we then know -- need to know to go. but what we're doing is we're taking it's just wings, and we're going to develop it further. again, we've got it into one channel. we're learning every day really how to maximize that channel.
joe mentioned we're in our first sports season really. and obviously, that brand resonates well during sports. so we're pushing the marketing in and outside the channel. and then we're pushing to take out.
and that takes an infrastructure build, that requires technology and support and then a marketing effort behind that. but we want to build that brand out. and then at the same time, get our operations lined up for full restaurant capabilities, as well as full takeout, both chili's and virtual brands. and that's all happening now.
and as soon as we get that brand kind of further built out, we'll go and look at the next brand and determine when to bring that into the mix. and that's the process we're going through.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. thank you.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
yes. thanks, david. good talking to you.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from james rutherford. please pronounce your affiliation then pose your question.
james rutherford -- stephens inc. -- analyst
yes. it's stephens inc., and thanks for taking the question. i wanted to follow-up on a comment that was made about the fully digital experience and test, i think it was at chili's. can you talk a bit more about how that would look in the restaurant and whether this is a direct response to the potential pressures on minimum wage? and kind of finally on that topic, the potential impact to margins if this rolls out to the system at the store level.
thank you.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
so, well, just to address the first question or the second question first, it's not a direct response to minimum wage. it's a direct response to what we talked about that consumers have been looking for, and we've been embracing, and that's convenience and control over their experience more. and so what we've done is we've taken a lot of the technology that we already had in place, like our tabletop technology. and we've incorporated some of the new technology or the technology that we've kind of built through the covid experience, which has a lot more to do with how you can talk to consumers in that third -- at their home and in other places, and we've kind of linked that more together.
so basically, if you're a family and, you know, you've got -- if you have small juvenile or if you have small children or not, james, but you know there's a window, right? you don't have an hour and a half. you have a limited time. and sometimes, when you go to a casual dining restaurant, it's that front-end that can take a little longer than you'd necessarily like. well, if you've got your order ready on your tablet or on your phone and you walk into our restaurant, when you sit at the table, our tabletop device will allow you to interact with it before they serve or even gets there as soon as you sat and your order then immediately goes into the kitchen, then your server sees that, brings out the food, starts the experience and then you're often running significantly faster.
you can close out at the same time on that device, and you eliminate some of the kind of stretch points, if you will, that can come into an occasion, if you're in a hurry. if you're not, we've got servers there, they'll take your order and bring your experience to you at whatever pace you want, but it allows you to control that more. so we're very excited about the opportunity to offer this to guests. we think it will pick up.
we think the table turns will be there. it will allow service to be a little more efficient. all those things are side benefits, but they actually have implication to the restaurant, especially, on a busy friday/saturday night.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. james, one of the things i would add just to the second part of that, while the specific digital connectivity we're talking here isn't design from a labor model standpoint. but we have shut -- what we found is we deal in a lot of higher labor states is technology does matter and technology will be helpful. so this and the other investments we've made in technology probably will have a role to play as you kind of work your way through higher-wage environment.
so i think we're well-positioned and understand how that can be a piece of the equation.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
and i'll just say that technology -- it's one thing to map it out. it's another thing to make sure it's stable and running well and that everything is working. because, again, on a busy friday, saturday night in the restaurant, if you're relying on that technology to be the backbone of your operations, it can go down because you don't have a backup. and so that's why some of these things that sound fairly simple or easy, at the end of the day, you've got to make sure your technology and your infrastructure is solid because you're going to bank on it and the guest experience is really determined by how good you are at delivering them.
and that's what we're excited about kind of locking that down.
james rutherford -- stephens inc. -- analyst
sounds very interesting. thanks for the help.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
thank you.
operator
our next question today is coming from brett levy. please announce your affiliation then pose your question.
brett levy -- mkm partners -- analyst
great. thank you. mkm partners. i appreciate the call.
we're in a time where, obviously, sales are going to be volatile, and there's quite a shift in what's going on with the input costs. how are you thinking about, not just the traditional, but also the newer prototypical units? what kind of margin potential there is either where you can see savings on the labor front, where the incremental costs can get pushed aside or they're just going to become overbearing? and do you think your new experience type units have the potential to actually expand margins and how greatly? thank you.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. brett, let me make a few comments, and we'll take it from there. again, everything we're seeing today despite the volatility, it's not changing our view of how we can grow margins and that's through top line. our new restaurants are well received as we open them.
we're really pleased about the outperformance we've seen from the group that's come in so far this year. so again, it's a prototype that plays well in a variety of markets. i think it's going to work well to increase top line. it's all about, really, how do you take that average auv up from that $3 million-ish range into the mid threes.
so we target and think about $3.5 million auv. that's where the big opportunity lies to be a more efficient operation at the restaurant level as we get toward that. so as we grow the base business, as we connect digitally, as we layer in virtual brands, those are all going to be key pieces of the equation. yes, there are places that we will be more efficient and how we use technology to offset headwinds, how we make sure that our supply chain is effectively dealing with those markets.
all comes into bear. but it's a growth strategy to manage margins as opposed to how do i cut the bare bones. i mean, one of the things we saw in the second quarter as we went into a little bit more volatile environment was obviously a deleveraging impact, but we also don't want to overreact. we wanted to maintain levels of spend that we thought were appropriate for what we thought was going to be a relatively short period of volatility.
we're not through the woods yet, but we are back into recovery. but i think the comments i made about manager bonus are probably indicative of that and how we worked on and making sure we were still while being judicious, right levels of r&m spend and other spends that you could have quickly knee-jerked back very dramatically just to gain a couple of tenths of margin. so we're trying to take a longer view.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
yes. the only thing i'd add, brett, is it really is about systems, right? and what we're doing and what we've taken the opportunity to do in a lot of restaurants where the capacity is down is put in systems that will allow us -- well, in all our restaurants but in places where we're down, it's a little easier to put in these systems, especially around takeout and delivery that will allow the restaurants when we're back up and running and growing the volumes that joe talked about to execute at a high level. and that's how we're going to grow the business. and with that, we'll come leverage and better margins.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
thanks, brett.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from chris o'cull. please announce your affiliation then pose your question.
chris o'cull -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
stifel. yes. good morning guys. i had just a follow-up question on the margin, response you just gave, i'm trying to understand how chili's segment restaurant margin moved quarter over quarter.
i know it was -- i think it was up 50 basis points to the prior year in the first quarter but fell 80 basis points to the prior year on higher sales this quarter. and so i was hoping you could just explain what drove that sequential change in performance? and how we should be thinking about recovery and especially the labor dynamics as sales start to recover?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. chris, good to talk to you. again, we're real comfortable with the way chili's is going to be managing margins going forward. chile is actually continued early on in the quarter.
so when i look in the october time frame, it was expanding its margins. i think the delta that took place was simply the covid restrictions and the volatility of this top-line sales that came into play as you saw that those reductions in that deleverage. i think you've seen the month -- the weeklies we gave you back in december and kind of moving from pretty much a flat to slightly positive comp into a -- down in the teams, it was just the quickness of the deleverage and our choice, again, to maintain some of the cost dynamics that we thought were important to the business for it coming out of recovery and, again, manage our bonus.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
yes. i think, chris, if you just think about -- let's just say california. the magnitude of the hit there has been significant as everybody is well documented, right? and so we're paying those managers really solid bonuses. even though their performance level in a typical environment, that wouldn't happen, right? i mean, if we were doing this off our typical, hey, sales and profit drive your bonus payment, they probably wouldn't be getting any bonus.
but we're recognizing the need to keep these operators motivated to keep them in the shop with us because we know it's going to turn around. it's already starting to turn around, and we need them there. and so there's a little bit of that in the mix. so again, we're confident about where margins are going to play out.
we've seen it as the business gets stronger. i think if you just look at chili's in the quarter, even with all that volatility, the margins are relatively flat. so it's not something we're overly concerned with at all. we're actually very excited about the growth potential and how margins will then react.
chris o'cull -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
excellent. thank you. and then just one follow-up. how should we be thinking about the flow-through? i mean, the flow-through is obviously very high with these virtual brands.
how should we be thinking about changes to the potential flow-through with these initiatives like takeout and some other things that you're introducing for it's just wings?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. again, one of the things we like about the virtual brands is the flow-through and the ability to leverage the existing structures and operations, and management teams we have in place. we're learning how to invest into those brands. so that's going to be a big piece of the equation.
but as we make those decisions as to right level of brand building spend, and again, these are younger brands, and they will need nurturing and investment, and we want to expand and build those brands in a number of different platforms and consumer access channels. we're going to start from a pretty high level of flow-through. so we're very comfortable with the ability to invest back into those brands. when i just look at the base level of flow-through that they develop.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
yes. so a little heavier on the front end and especially with to-go, very profitable on the back end as the brand gets established and we build that -- we're just in that process to understand, ok, what's it going to take to get a little bit more brand awareness out there direct.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
and i think that's a great point as we move from one channel right now into some other channels, there's opportunities there because you don't have some of the delivery fees associated with it to go. that's why we're very excited not only about the growth potential of it's just wings to go but the flow-through potential, too.
chris o'cull -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from andrew strelzik. please announce your affiliation then pose your question.
andrew strelzik -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. bmo. i actually wanted to follow-up on some comments you just made. can you share with us where the awareness is right now for it's just wings and how that's been trending? and then when you think about brand building in virtual brands.
i mean, just kind of holistically, you've talked a little bit about marketing and some of the channels that you might move into. but just holistically, how do you think about building those virtual brands into brands with recognition and sustainability in the context of a category that obviously is getting more competitive, not less competitive over time? and so just how you think about standing out in that context?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
all the data we have, again, we're primarily a one channel brand right now, right? so we're a doordash brand. and so everything that's been -- primarily. i mean, there's some pr and some other things that have been out there. but most of it, it's either order mouth or you're learning from it on doordash.
and the growth and all the acceptance and the repeat numbers are all real positive. we're excited about how the brand is building. it's a limited channel. it's a big channel in one aspect, but it's just one channel.
so as we look to grow this brand more broadly, we'll use the traditional marketing approaches that you used to build any brand. so obviously, as we've talked about, it'd be a more digital and more social approach. but we will start to move people directly to it's just wings' website and get overall awareness and how we get them there will be typical marketing activity that we already have a lot of history with in terms of how to do that effectively. you have to have the infrastructure in place first, though.
so you have to have the technology and all of the ability to -- for people to map and get to that location and understand what it's just wings is and how to get there. and that's all kind of being built and has been built now. and so now, we can start to push that channel, and we'll see how quickly we can build the brand and where it goes.
andrew strelzik -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
and just on some of the investments that you're talking about, more capital being put behind kind of the systems and some of those things on the digital side, are you assuming that you can do that in a way that's not going to impact the margin progression? or should we expect a little bit more choppiness or kind of taking aside the sales volatility?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
well, from a capital standpoint, these investments are very small, i mean, relative to building restaurants and staffing them. we're talking about very small investments in technology and sometimes it's in materials like shelving. and so it's important, but it's not expensive relative. and so again, on the flip side, the expense necessary to build the brand, as joe talked about.
we're just going to have to see how that works and how quickly and how effectively we can do that. we're confident that we have a lot of history and a lot of experience and some great marketers that can help grow this brand quickly and effectively. but we'll have more on that probably next quarter.
andrew strelzik -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. thank you very much.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
thanks, andrew.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from greg francfort. please announce your affiliation then pose your question.
greg francfort -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey. it's bank of america. wyman and joe, my question is on the news recently around minimum wages and tip credits for minimum wages. and you guys are in a lot of states where the wages are already at $12, $13 now, or headed to $15.
can you talk maybe about some of the experiences that you've had operating in those markets either around price elasticity or kind of what you've done around labor controls or new equipment that may be an indication of how you would handle sort of a broader national minimum wage going up?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
yes. greg, i think it's a combination of all of those things, right? so we are definitely leveraging technology, and we put it in states that we're experiencing higher labor costs that allow us to be more efficient, also allow our servers and our team members to make more money because, again, the tip pool and the tip amount is then spread over fewer team members, so they make a lot of money, and that's great. we also then are looking at ways to be more efficient and effective around tip pooling sometimes. and that opens up sometimes as you get into some of these higher-cost situations that allow us to mitigate some of the costs that we may have to pay by letting the tip will help bring up the heart of the house wage rate if you will.
and then from a pricing standpoint, we do see that competitively, especially folks that can't do the things i've just talked about, they basically deal with this from a pricing perspective. so competitively, you have a little bit more room to price interestingly enough though, in california. we have three for 10 out there, and it works fine. and we've just built a model.
it's not efficient, not effective, and it drives that much traffic that the leverage helps us become competitive now. how long we can afford that price point in that market, i don't know. but it's out there and it's been out there for a couple of years even as the price and the wage rates have gone up. so i think our scale really helps us in this environment.
and at the end of the day, these things that across the industry are going to be much more difficult for restaurant operators. and again, in our case, that's half the category that don't have scale. the way you deal with this most effectively is through technology and through systems, and we have the ability to do that and have been doing that. and we're excited about rolling some of this technology to other markets fairly soon.
greg francfort -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
that's great perspective. and then i had one other question. just on your thoughts on chili's as potentially being -- chili's really hasn't been a very strong unit growth chain for a little bit of time. are you seeing that pandemic as an opportunity to accelerate that? and are you seeing the real estate market free up to kind of make that happen? and that's it.
thank you.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. greg, i think, again, we do think we are reaching a point in the brand's evolution that we can increase our unit development. you got to remember we have also done a couple of acquisitions of franchise that have brought units back into the corporate ownership side. so we have grown the base.
again, i think we've indicated we want to get up into that 1% to 2% net growth on an annual basis. i'd like it to be, over time, toward the higher end of that. there's a pipeline in a process, and we've got great folks in our development teams already working that. we are seeing some changes in the real estate market.
i think we are seeing conversion opportunities at a much higher level, which are interesting because i'm seeing our ability to access certain markets now that you probably wanted to have had the same level of access to pre-pandemic. so i'm excited about that opportunity. we're positioned in the company so we can grow at that level from both a capital perspective and a team perspective, develop -- again, keeping and developing our leadership is a critical part of that equation. so, yes, i think as we move really into '23 and '24, you'll start to see that higher level of new restaurant developed work its way into the system.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
and that's one of the benefits of these acquisitions. we've brought back territories that haven't been built out as well or as effectively as texas. and we're now opening restaurants in these markets and having a really great reception. so we're confident that there is probably more green space out there than we had before for that reason as well.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
and the strategy has also played to -- again, the ability to open $3.5 million or $4 million restaurant gives you a lot more access to markets you want to be in. tit's just a better model to have them if you're trying to open something at a significantly lower auv.
greg francfort -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
thanks, greg.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from robert derrington. please announce your affiliation then pose your question.
robert derrington -- telsey advisory group -- analyst
thank you. telsey advisory. joe and wyman, i'm trying to think about it's just wings and kind of a transition from being just a brand that's available through the doordash app to being possibly available in other ways. one thing that certainly has benefited chili's in many ways has been the leverage that you have on the information that's received if i place an order through the my chili's app.
you control that, you can use that within your rewards and your loyalty program. is there some thought of as you add to-go with it's just wings, does that give you more leverage? does it get you better access to information by which you can communicate with your consumer?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
absolutely, bob. i mean, again, it fits the model we have, as you just spelled out. we have these infrastructures in place to do direct marketing very well. we will deploy that against the it's just wings brand and create that.
the beauty of the brand so far is that it's a fairly incremental guest to us in terms of it doesn't just overlay with the chili's guests. so it's a different occasion. it's a different user-based. and so it helps us broaden our base of users, and again, leverage all the infrastructure and capital that we've already put in place.
and including leveraging our marketing capabilities and with regard to direct. so it's absolutely a key to the strategy going forward.
robert derrington -- telsey advisory group -- analyst
a quick follow-up, sorry. is there the potential that you could add possibly a loyalty or rewards program to it's just wings? and what access do you have now of that consumer data that, i guess, goes through doordash first?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
doordash is a great partner. they share a lot of information in broad terms. they don't share individual guests contact information. we are working with them to be more aggressive and to partner at a higher level with regard to trading loyalty data or at least giving guests the opportunity to become chili's loyalty guests through the doordash app.
and so we're working that opportunity. but right now, it's really -- it's more just general market information. so how do i know that the doordash, it's just wings guests isn't the same as the chili's guest because doordash helps us understand the broader characteristics of those two segments?
robert derrington -- telsey advisory group -- analyst
terrific. thanks so much.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
thanks, rob.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from jeff farmer. please announce your affiliation then pose your question.
jeff farmer -- gordon haskett research advisors -- analyst
thank you. gordon haskett. you touched on a couple of questions i wanted to dive into, but i did want to approach it from a little bit of a different angle if i could. so with the potential minimum wage increase clearly in investor focus, i am curious what is the hourly labor expense for, let's say, chili's or just brinker in its entirety as a percent of total labor expense? and then as a follow-up to that, what is the average hourly wage when including front of house workers that are potentially receiving tipped minimum wage in the states that allow them to do so?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
they're looking, jeff, to see if we can give you a number on the first question. on the second question, the average tip server is in the $20 range. again, it varies. in california, it's significantly higher because there's no tip credit, and they're at $15.
so you can imagine in california, they're closer to $30, maybe a little bit lower than that in the two and 13 states but not too far below 20, and we average well into that low to mid-20s.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
jeff, when you look at labor expense, roughly two-thirds of it is going to be on the hourly side of the equation.
jeff farmer -- gordon haskett research advisors -- analyst
ok. so again, in terms of -- this is almost sort of your editorial thinking about this. so the conversations with peers have been that $15 looks like a long shot, somewhat increasingly looking like a potential that it could happen, but the tipped minimum wage was always sort of a bridge too far to the extent that the casual dining sector, in particular, is under a lot of pressure right now. and then that's probably something that is unlikely to happen, that's my comment.
but how are you guys thinking about it?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. again, jeff, this will be a debate. i think it's going to be front and center for an extended period of time this year. i've been involved in a couple of minimum wage debates over the years, and they do tend to be intense discussions.
there's passion on both sides of the equation. they tend to extend over periods of time. i'm not going to get into the various sausage-making of buttoning of budget reconciliation versus regular order versus things of that and how the congress works its magic. but i think there's probably a decent down the road possibility of a wage increase.
i think we have to be realistic in our thinking to that. i don't see that happening in the short run and we're going to focus our time and attention on the specifics underlying that because, again, there is a complexity of the way minimum wage works at the federal level, and we're going to focus very heavily from our sector perspective, on the tip side of the equation. it's been an effective methodology on how that legislation has worked in the past, and we're going to continue to advocate strongly that that methodology be maintained in some form or fashion as we go forward. that being said, we operate in a number of higher-wage rate states that have their own approach to things.
i think there's 20 or so that have opted outside, including our no. 2, 3, and 4 markets. so we're used to large numbers of restaurants in higher-wage states. but it will be a debate.
and i think we can't just assume things are not going to change, and we'll engage, and we'll be prepared as we kind of move forward that. but i don't see it impacting this fiscal year and, frankly, maybe not even in the first part of next fiscal year.
jeff farmer -- gordon haskett research advisors -- analyst
ok. that's very helpful. and just a separate follow-up on california. so obviously, the mitigation efforts in that state have been one of the headwinds you face from a consolidated same-store sales standpoint for the chili's concept.
but what i'm looking for is sort of an understanding or better understanding of the case study. so obviously, california, in july, went ahead and reinstituted indoor, some dining suspensions. and then remove those, i think, late august, september, depending on what part of the state was. my question is how quickly did that california consumer respond to the reopening of indoor dining.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
very quickly, yes. it's an immediate response. and again, california is a very -- i mean, when covid's over and you do the case studies of why a state that closed restaurants still has some of the worst result. it's just interesting, right? so it comes back to -- it doesn't look like if you're running restaurants the right way.
it's not the driver of covid. and i think california has felt that that's some editorial from my perspective. but that said, when we open up parking lots and put tents in them, people line up. i mean, they're just dying to come to a restaurant and eat and get out of their house.
and so you can do that safely. in california, they've i think overreacted â listen, they've got a covid problem. so i'm not dismissing that. i just think their solution, which is really heavy on the restaurant business has been not as effective, obviously, because it hasn't really dealt with the covid crisis that they needed to.
so when they -- we'll start to see -- we've already started to see it. as soon as they start to lighten up and open up even outdoor dining, which is, i think, is usually the first step, and then they'll go to some indoor, we see the immediate response. but california has been the biggest negative drag throughout the whole pandemic because it's never consistently up and down the state, had a policy that has had dining rooms open at the same time throughout the state at any capacity level.
jeff farmer -- gordon haskett research advisors -- analyst
right. i appreciate that. thank you.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
and we're excited when they do because i guarantee, there's some pent-up demand in california.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from brian vaccaro. please announce your affiliation then pose your question.
brian vaccaro -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks. raymond james. good morning. good to hear from you, guys.
i wanted to circle back on it's just wings. in prior calls, you obviously mentioned the sales of around $3 million a week or annual run rate of over $150 million. could you provide a tighter update on the brand's more recent sales performance, either dollars or contribution to chile's comps? and then what's the timeline on when you expect the takeout channel to be rolled for the brand?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. brian, let me talk to the first part of that. again, the $150 million annualized sales, we're extremely comfortable with and confident with that. there's been no deviation from the way the brand has been performing, it gives us any doubt there.
and that's a number talking to the corporate side of the equation. the franchisees have now embraced it and are starting to perform nicely also in their own regard as it relates to wings. and as i mentioned in my commentary, what we're seeing as we learn how to promote, particularly around sporting events, some nice incrementality off of that. so again, there's a number of ways we are now learning how to grow the brand, how you market it, how you tie it to different sporting events, and now how we take it to other channels.
i think, from a timing standpoint on.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
well, i mean, if you're in doordash today, in some markets, it's already turned on, and you can have that option. now, most people that go to the doordash app, obviously, are looking for delivery. but we are experiencing -- we have some guests today who are in the doordash world that choose to pick it up. and so we're already out there with a system, really testing the system, both external and internal that allows us to deal with pickup it's just wings guests.
we're in test markets, some significant test markets with the infrastructure in place to allow the website that direct people to the right restaurant to pick it up, and that test is now technologically in place, and now we'll start the marketing aspect of it. and i would think by the end of this year, we'll have this thing rolled out and movement is our goal.
brian vaccaro -- raymond james -- analyst
all right. that's helpful color. and one quick follow-up, sorry if i missed it. but what was chili's off-premise sales mix in the fiscal q2 and the split between delivery and takeout?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
the split between delivery and takeout has remained relatively consistent, kind of at a two-third/one-third split. it's been interesting as the whole off-premise channel grew throughout the pandemic in the ups and downs that has stayed relatively consistent. and i want to say the overall mix continues to be in the high 40s, yes, that 45% to 47-ish percent bouncing around. i would expect, as you get some of these larger markets opening, you'll probably start to see that, again, start to come back down again like we saw during the last wave.
mika ware -- vice president, finance and investor relations
kind of accelerated.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes.
brian vaccaro -- raymond james -- analyst
all right. that is all for me. i will pass it along. thanks again.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from john ivankoe. please announce your affiliation then pose your question.
john ivankoe -- j.p morgan -- analyst
hi. thank you. i'm with j.p. morgan.
a couple of questions if i may. first, can we talk about the 2% comp, excluding california and illinois? how, i guess, widely distributed is that number? in other words, can we talk about comp performance in kind of some of the key southern markets like florida, for example, maybe texas? and as some of these markets have added 100% of seating capacity, more or less, back for customer usage and customers, in fact, are, in many cases, using that capacity. how are trends in those kind of markets? and as you've reopened the dine-in have been opened the longest of markets like that, what has been the overall trend in sales dollars of your off-premise business? and i have some follow-ups too.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
hey, john, first, there are very few -- i mean, to my knowledge, states of any or geographical areas that are 100% dining room capacity. there may be some folks who are pushing that, but we're not. we're continuing to abide by the restrictions and the guidelines. and so first off, all these numbers are still, for the most part, a large part, we're probably closer to 50% capacity.
and the breadth of that sales result is broad. it is across our regions, both southern and midwest, new england. so, yes, it's not like florida is up 20 and everyone else is down five. now, it's a fairly consistent pattern with the typical geographical variances, but nothing dramatic, which has got us feeling pretty comfortable about, as joe said, our ability to deliver positive comp sales.
we're doing that with 50% dining room capacities.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
and what we also see, john, just to add a little more color is it's why do we feel comfortable? well, we're getting -- we're definitely stretched on the weekends. weekends are where we struggle the most from a sales perspective because we just don't have the capacity. and so our comp numbers on the weekends are more challenged early week where your capacity isn't as big an issue, very strong.
john ivankoe -- j.p morgan -- analyst
ok. i have a question -- sorry. go ahead, joe.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
it's been interesting to see in a number of these other markets that have gone to constraints and restrictions and then come off of them, how quickly the bounce back has happened. again, when you look at some of the mountain regions that have moved in and then back out, again, you get a return to what we were experiencing kind of in that september, october in relatively short order.
john ivankoe -- j.p morgan -- analyst
ok. thank you. and secondly, one of the -- obviously, the overall driving themes or positive themes. and i think you've kind of touched on it in terms of sub conversion opportunities that are arising for you is kind of consolidation of supply.
certainly, one of the hardest things for us is not just to look at it at a national or state level, but in individual trade areas like your own. and obviously, you guys, over whatever the last 40 years, whatever it is now, 50, i guess, 40, have done a great job of selecting real estate. in other words, i think you've generally chosen to locate chili's and trade areas that have gone up in value, not gone down. how much effective supply i can use? i guess a specific term, do you think has come out in the marketplaces in which you compete, i guess, on a trade area by trade area basis? i know, i think, listen, i'm asking you for a number, but it's a qualitative comment.
i mean, how big of a contraction do you think has actually happened at this point of where you say, hey, listen, not just number of restaurants, but the effect of supply, in other words, sales dollars or customer occasions, whatever that may be, have actually come out of the market that you might be able to capture some long-term share from?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean, again, it's difficult to pinpoint. and you have to look at, particularly when you're thinking about conversion is why is that available. is it just a bad location that eventually went away, or is it a franchisee, for instance, or something that the larger entity went away and had some good opportunities embedded within it? so we've got to look very carefully at that.
again, we tend to have higher auvs. we tend to penetrate into a market a little more effectively than some of the competition. so i think there's some upside there. but again, we want to be -- we're probably more judicious about looking at conversions to make sure that we're understanding what the real opportunity is there.
from a capacity standpoint, i think that question is still open. you see, for instance, the national restaurant association is -- right now, they look at the world, and they look pretty extensively through their state restaurant association network down into the breadth of the market, and they're talking about one in six restaurants being closed. now how many of those stay permanently closed? we'll see. i've seen distribution numbers a little bit below that, but they tend to look more extensively into the higher end independent operator, which probably has a little bit more survivability to it.
so i think they'll be there. and then again, it is side by side by side. and so you got to be careful about kind of the broad-brush national look at individual real estate markets.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
and then one out of 15 --
john ivankoe -- j.p morgan -- analyst
very helpful -- go ahead. sorry, wyman. go ahead.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
john, just to put some color. the one out of six closures, we know, obviously, independents have been heard more significantly. and they tend to not run as a group at higher volume. and so i wouldn't translate necessarily that same percentage into sales opportunities.
but it's definitely going to be a different landscape post-covid.
john ivankoe -- j.p morgan -- analyst
thank you, guys.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
yes. thanks, john, for talking.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from jeffrey bernstein. please announce your affiliation then pose your question.
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you. from barclays. a couple of questions just from a sales trend perspective.
i'm just wondering what you think drove the sequential uptick in january. i think you set down 5% to 6% all-in versus what we think was like down 12% in december. i'm wondering whether you think the broader industry participated in that directional trend and whether you think it's stimulus or less political noise or how sustainable might that be. just any thoughts on that, and i had one follow-up.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
jeff, it's, like, clear it's covid. i mean, it's just covid. i mean, restrictions come in, we close dining rooms. so sales go down.
we've been up the hill and down the hill, and now we're kind of going back up, i mean, up to --
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
positive.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
positive sales, yes. and it's, i'd say, 90% just restrictions and the reaction to the communities to the pandemic appropriately, for the most part, i would say. there's probably some stimulus in this month, obviously, those checks have been out, and that's probably -- that couldn't hurt. it can't hurt when the government throws significant dollars into the economy.
so there's some of that in the mix, but we're seeing a pretty consistent trend. so we don't think it's the major driver.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. and the interesting thing about that, i do think there's some stimulus there. but again, one of the things covid constrained pretty much across the sector, well, gift card sales, so you probably don't have quite as much of a gift card impact that you would normally see january. so they're kind of offsetting factors that are sitting outside of the whole covid impact.
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays -- analyst
understood. and then as you think about the kind of casual-dining segment from a promotional environment perspective, it seems like there's less discounting, like you said, i mean, everyone has limited capacity to satisfy the customers. so why would you deep discount? so i'm just wondering on how you think that's going to play out as we move through and beyond covid? it seems like, safe to say, it's more peers because i know you guys have talked about easing up on your ltos in recent quarters and years. but just wondering [audio gap]
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. we kind of got out of -- yes, for us, we just kind of got out of that game really under our third year now, jeff, chasing promotions at a casual dining level, our belief is it's kind of a lot more wasted energy, and it's not very efficient. you're going to get pops. you're going to hit something every once in a while, but all the energy and effort and the brand, what i'll call, degradation to going through those cycles isn't worth the effort is kind of where we're at.
and so it's always a competitive category. it's always going to be. we just talked about the landscape will look different post covid, so we'll see how that plays into the mix. but we're going to go after with the strategy we've always -- we've been employing, especially the last few years, which is a strong base value propositions, talking to consumers more directly and incenting them that way versus some broad thrown out message that doesn't necessarily work very well.
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays -- analyst
understood. and lastly, joe, you mentioned that you didn't want to necessarily give fiscal third-quarter guidance. i know during the second quarter, you were more comfortable to do so. i'm just wondering, directionally, whether you could offer any color on margin or earnings if the comps were to stay at this down mid-single-digit level, or is it just not worth even attempting?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. jeff, i'm not going to go there. again, as i indicated in my script, we do have some beliefs around recovery as we kind of move through. and as we demonstrated in the fall with some of the numbers you saw, and we've talked about that level of recovery has those positive directional impacts on things like margin.
so i'm looking forward to some near time ability to talk about that kind of activity.
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays -- analyst
looking forward to that. thank you.
operator
thank you. our final question today is coming from jon tower. please announce your affiliation then pose your question.
jon tower -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
awesome. great. thanks for taking the call. wells fargo.
just a couple of questions. first, on the it's just wings and moving to a potential physical presence, is this a pusher pole, meaning are consumers asking for this today? or are you essentially getting ahead of any potential demand in the pickup channel and especially with the knowledge that the economics are more favorable to you versus, say, traditional delivery transaction? and then my follow-up question is i know there are a lot of moving pieces in the business right now. but i was hoping maybe you could help frame the long-term margin and profit opportunity for breaker as a whole, perhaps even referencing the margins relative to fiscal '19 levels. like where do you think this business can move from where it's been in the past? thank you.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
let me take the back end of that first, again, from a margin perspective. again, we're still very firmly of the belief, as we've talked about this in the past, that we can grow margins and grow them from that '19 level over the course of the next couple of years, that's the opportunity of taking a 3 million auv to 3.5 million auv in that dynamic. those will grow -- that will grow margins. we're not pinpointing down a specific level, but it's definitely at a higher mid-teens kind of thought process is what we've talked about.
and again, as we move further down this path and get better insights, we'll start to give you that down the road, but it's definitely a nice upside opportunity at those level of auv to leverage the system very nicely. i mean, as far as --
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
yes. i think the push/pull, it's interesting. we're in a channel that doesn't really -- i mean, consumers don't expect when they're in the delivery channel to pick up. so there's not a -- that's all -- that's really -- that's the only segment that knows of it's just wings per se.
but we know based on the strength of the product and the acceptance in that channel that there's broader possibilities and greater consumer acceptance of the product. so i can't tell you that the people that are on doordash today are saying, oh, why can't i pick it up? because they don't want to pick it up. they're on door dash because they want someone to deliver it primarily. but we know that the brand itself, and we know based on our history, i mean, if you look at the mix within chili's world, takeout to delivery, takeout, 2 to 1, right? so the takeout guest is a broader category than the delivery guests in our broader world.
so we know there is a segment out there that have no problem picking up.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. i just want to be clear, too, john, because you made a comment in there about as you move to physical locations. so i just want to make sure there's no misrepresentation. we're talking about pickup at a chili's.
so not putting a separate physical location out there.
jon tower -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
correct. got it. and just a follow-up on that. the magnitude of the difference between a delivery transaction and the to-go transaction.
is there any way you could help frame it? i think today, the incremental margins on, and it's just wings transaction is somewhere in the 40s, say, that was to flip to a physical pickup transaction, how much better can that be?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
well, again, i think you benefit from -- if i break it into specific channels, as you're talking about there, you're going to benefit from not having to pay the delivery costs. and those are inconsequential. they're, obviously what we think are very well negotiated rates, but those don't exist. now, how you market into that channel and the cost if you put to make sure that there's awareness and understanding, building out a website, marketing through google, doing things of that nature is another cost.
so all in, it's definitely going to be a more favorable flow-through for that particular channel.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
and it's a lower cost to the consumer as well, right?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
because they're not paying for those fees. so those things are all kind of -- they're all positive price -- total price for the consumer and margin for us. the magnitude will kind of tbd.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes.
jon tower -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
got it. thank you and good luck.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president;
all right. thanks, jon.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
thanks, jon.
mika ware -- vice president, finance and investor relations

thanks, mika, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. with the rollout of vaccines in full swing and restrictions lifting across the country, our guests' pent-up demand for a dine-in experience is being released as well. people are finally starting to feel safer to venture out and spend more -- spend some of the money they've been saving over the past year. we're excited about the positive momentum in our economy and the resurgence in our dining rooms.
when we last talked at the end of january, we were already seeing progress in the business, even as we were navigating a covid spike that drove another wave of capacity restrictions in our dining rooms. just as we started to see numbers of cases come back down, we were hit with the winter storm of the century that impacted our restaurants across texas and the southeast at levels we haven't experienced before. but despite the challenges at the start of the third quarter, we ended strong, delivering an adjusted eps of $0.78 with chili's sales returning to positive territory from an absolute perspective. and we've seen those sales trends continue into april.
when we look at our more normalized performance of fiscal '19, chili's sales are up 10%, and nearly three-quarters of our restaurants are generating meaningful positive results, even though we're still social distancing and wearing masks in all of our restaurants and we're still operating under capacity restraints across the country. we believe, all along, the consumers' increased demand for convenience would continue post-pandemic, and it's playing out that way. as our dining room traffic increases, our off-premise business continues to hold strong. we expect that when things normalize, we'll see stronger dining rooms and a takeout and delivery business stronger than it was pre-pandemic.
as you think about maggiano's in the context of this recovery, upscale casual is playing itself out a little differently. we're pleased with the significant improvements in the maggiano's business, especially in their dining rooms. now, it's just a matter of how quickly banquets come back. we know there's significant pent-up demand and we're well-positioned to meet it.
we're already seeing signs of social occasions returning, and we feel good about building our corporate business back in time for the important holiday season. staying focused on our strategy throughout the extraordinary events of the past year has served us well as we consistently outperformed the industry. we have good line of sight to hit the targets we were expecting post-pandemic at both chili's and maggiano's. navigating the past year taught us we can run this business even more efficiently than in the past, and we're committed to keeping our cost structure in line.
we think our category leadership -- driven by the multiyear investments in our infrastructure and digital capabilities will help us continue to outpace the industry. we still have a lot of heart for our restructured marketing approach, and we'll continue to leverage our digital expertise to connect with consumers and drive traffic. the subject of labor is clearly top of mind across our industry. today's labor market is one of the toughest ones we've experienced, but we have the tools to navigate through it successfully.
while our performance throughout the pandemic enabled us to keep higher levels of staffing in our restaurants, we are hiring more team members than usual to support our increased volumes. we're also benefiting from our decision to keep our managers on board throughout the pandemic as they provide the operational leadership to staff our teams and take care of our guests. we're fortunate to be able to leverage our scale, the digital expertise we built, and our peopleworks team to recruit talent in creative ways to keep our cost structure intact and our guests coming back. we know the best way to maintain profit margins in this business is through volume, so we leaned into virtual brands as a way to leverage our assets and tap unused capacity.
it's just wings continues to perform well, and we're on track to hit that $150 million target we set at the beginning of the year. almost all of our domestic franchise partners jumped on the opportunity and globally, several of our partners have already picked it up. wings is now in nine countries and 160 locations outside the u.s., making it a formidable brand in just its first year. it's a real testament to our methodical and disciplined virtual brand strategy, how we've executed it and the leverage it brings to our p&l and to our franchise partners' business.
we have the system up and running and we're executing it well, especially during high volumes. now, we're focused on building the brand and leveraging the growth opportunities ahead. we believe takeout holds a lot of potential for us. and now that we've invested in the technology and infrastructure to support it, we're working to increase awareness levels outside the delivery channel.
we've learned a lot this year with the launch of it's just wings that will leverage when we're ready for our next virtual brand. we're pleased with the current results from the expanded test of maggiano's classics, and we're working through the timing to ensure we're able to support our operators and deliver a great guest experience. so this has been an exceptional year of learning for us, not just with virtual brands but in many ways. we've learned the restaurant industry in general, and specifically, our team is full of unbelievably resilient amazing human beings.
i'm so impressed by how this team has risen to every challenge that's come our way. we're stronger for it, and we're prepared for the growth opportunities ahead as vaccinations spread across the country and dining rooms fill up. as we look forward, our ability to navigate through any short-term cost headwinds is solid. our scale affords us advantages in terms of forward contracting, keeping our employment base intact, and delivering one of the strongest value propositions in the industry.
longer term, we see a lot of organic growth potential for brinker. obviously, we'll continue to execute our multiyear virtual brand strategy and protect our improved business model. and with higher volumes, we'll capture new development opportunities and keep the brand fresh through our remodel program. i'm proud of our progress on our results, the strength of our brands, and our line of sight to future earnings performance.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to joe.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
hey. thank you, wyman, and good morning, everyone. the third-quarter results reported this morning represent another successful quarter for brinker and its brands. while the quarter definitely had its unique issues, i'm most pleased with the momentum we are generating as we move closer to a more normal operating environment, setting up further success both this quarter and next fiscal year.
for the third quarter of fiscal 2021, brinker reported total revenues of $820 million with consolidated comp sales of negative 3.3%. our adjusted diluted eps for the quarter was $0.78. chili's recorded flat comp sales and positive 4% traffic for the quarter, with the year-over-year performance improving throughout the quarter. regional performance is strong nationwide with a broad range of state markets rebuilding their dining room sales back to higher levels, above 75%, let's say when compared to pre-covid performance.
we do still have a smaller set of state markets such as california and illinois, which are important markets for us, that are earlier in their dining room reopening process. we anticipate they will follow similar growth patterns as we move through the next several months. a couple of items to note related to the third quarter. first, we had a holiday flip the first week, with christmas moving into the quarter, resulting in a negative 1% comp sales impact.
in february, we experienced uri, a most unique winter storm that hit with historic subzero temperatures and power outages for more than a week, affecting approximately 30% of our restaurants. the material impact of the storm resulted in an estimated $10.5 million in lost revenues, a negative impact to consolidated comp sales of 1.2%, and reduced adjusted eps of approximately $0.06. once things thawed out, our positive progression returned, with average weekly sales volume hitting record highs in march. as we started to lap the beginning of the pandemic in mid-march, as one would expect, comp sales moved significantly positive and are likely to remain elevated for the foreseeable future.
while pleased with this progression, we believe a two-year comp comparison is a more insightful view of our performance. in this regard, the consolidated two-year comp results for brinker for the first four weeks of april was a positive 6.3%, driven by chili's results of a positive 10.1% for the same time frame. i would note that chili's is lapping off of a positive 2.9% in the third quarter of f '19. increasing sales volumes also favorably impacted margins, resulting in a consolidated restaurant operating margin for the third quarter of 13.9% compared to 12.8% for the third quarter of fiscal '20.
again, the winter storms had a negative impact on rom, reducing the margin by an estimated 30 basis points. food and beverage expense as a percent of company sales was 70 basis points favorable to prior year, primarily driven by menu mix as we featured steak on three for $10 in the prior year. pricing was slightly favorable, and commodities were flat. labor expense, again as a percent of company sales, was favorable 70 basis points as compared to the prior year.
during the quarter, lower dining room capacity year over year resulted in a reduced hourly labor cost. we do anticipate hourly labor to increase, importantly along with sales volumes as capacity restrictions lift in certain states. during the quarter, we meaningfully increased our manager bonus payout, impacting margins by approximately 60 basis points as we move to reward this critical leadership level for outstanding performance. by leveraging our scale, our well-established people, practices, and benefits and utilizing our digital connectivity know-how, we are confident in our ability to effectively manage through the current labor market environment.
restaurant expense was unfavorable year over year by 30 basis points, a reflection of increased off-premise costs such as packaging and fees, driven by our successful off-premise sales channels. advertising expense continues in a favorable year-over-year position as we lean into our digital and loyalty-driven marketing strategy. brinker continues to deliver strong operating cash flow. year to date, we have generated $268 million in operating cash flow.
during the third quarter, we used a portion of that cash flow to repay $115 million in revolver borrowings, bringing the outstanding balance to under $300 million. we anticipate further borrowing reduction in the fourth quarter. additionally, we are investing significantly into the growth of our brands. capital expenditures year-to-date totaled approximately $62 million.
we opened two new chili's during the third quarter and two additional locations in april, bringing our total for this fiscal year to 10. we are moving aggressively to further build our development resources and increase the nro pipeline. we continue to target expanding new restaurant development to a range of 18 to 22 restaurants a year. we also are investing in reimages of our existing fleet, with a particular focus on the midwest restaurants acquired in early fiscal '20.
brinker has continually proven to be a leader in utilizing technology to enhance the guest experience and improve operational performance. in fiscal 2021, we will invest approximately $20 million of capital and technology that enhances our digital guest connectivity, supports our virtual brand growth, and improves our in-restaurant dining experience. now, turning to our expectations for the final quarter of this fiscal year. we expect both chili's and maggiano's to maintain their current favorable sales trends throughout the quarter, assuming covid cases continue to decline and state and local restrictions continue to ease.
let me provide some additional specifics for the fourth quarter. total revenue is estimated to be in the $950 million to $1 billion range. adjusted earnings per diluted share are estimated in the $1.55 to $1.70 range. weighted average diluted shares are estimated to be in the 47 million to 48 million share range.
also, as we have previously noted, fiscal 2021 includes a 53rd week at the end of this fourth quarter. as we settle into the last quarter of the fiscal year, we are excited about the momentum we have built from the uncertainty that surrounded the restaurant industry a year ago. during the past year, the members of our support teams here in dallas stepped up and provided innovative solutions to any number of issues since the pandemic changed how we all approach our work. and our frontline team members in the restaurants have continually delivered for our guests in ways none of us would have contemplated not too long ago.
we are grateful to both these groups of team members who combined to lead the casual dining sector throughout this past year. they are all committed to finishing strong this fiscal year and then carrying the success forward. and now, with our prepared comments complete, let's open that up for questions. so, paul, i'm going to turn it back to you to moderate the call.

operator
thank you. ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [operator instructions] and the first question is coming from john glass. john, your line is live.
please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
sure. thanks. it's morgan stanley. first, can you just maybe just be a little more explicit as you think about the fourth quarter versus '19, what the embedded comp for chili's is? are you thinking about winning stimulus benefits? or how do you balance kind of what you're experiencing now versus what you might experience throughout the quarter? and i had a follow-up on the margins, please.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. again, i think -- john, this is joe. we're thinking about it in a very positive manner. i think we're going to continue to see the same progression that we saw coming out of march and into april.
there is a stimulus environment out there. i think that's very apparent. it's more than simply the stimulus checks. i think you have, again, that pent-up demand that is getting a lot of publicity and discussion.
and not only pent-up demand, you have pent-up capability to meet that demand on the consumer side of the equation. so we're pretty bullish on where the consumer is and how they will continue to reenter kind of back into a more normalized environment. and we also continue to see restaurant reopenings and capacity restrictions lifting. the progression that we're seeing in the performance of our restaurants as a percentage of '19 continues to go up materially as we work through each of the months.
so i think we'll see some favorable progression there helping to drive the successful quarter we're guiding you to for f4.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
and just as a follow-up, wyman, you mentioned labor shortages. obviously, it is top of mind. can you just talk about how you think about margins over the medium term because of that? first of all, labor shortages actually, if there are some actually becoming impediment, for example, opening dining rooms. can you also just talk about what is the gross impact of the delivery cost in the business? what is the structural layer of cost? i know there's other offsets, but what's the layer of costs that have been added into the delivery channel, both through virtual brands and as your own brand has grown so much?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
hey, john, i think there's two questions there. one is around what are we seeing with regard to the challenges with current labor environment and then there might be a labor or a margin impact to delivery. so let me just talk to the labor situation because i know it's -- again, it is top of mind for really everybody, not just in the restaurant industry, but in a lot of places out there right now as we are in this unprecedented situation with a fairly significant unemployed population and real challenged staffing. so we don't think that's obviously a long-term situation, right? it's never happened as far as i can remember that you've seen this kind of a robust economy and 9 million to 10 million people out of work and not really aggressively looking to get hired.
so what we're focused on is, again, leveraging our scale and our systems to staff our restaurants so that we can provide the support that we need to our managers to open and stay open and provide great guest experiences, but to also make sure that we're doing it in a way that doesn't significantly -- and from a long-term impact our cost structure. and so there are some additional things we're doing to entice and to recruit. but for the most part, they're more variable and their incentives to get people to join and not so much about the long-term wage rate impact that we'll live with for a longer period of time. so we feel good about that.
we also feel good about the fact that we're just not out there as aggressively having to hire because we just didn't cut as many, and we didn't cut any managers. so those are things that are keeping us probably in a little bit of a better situation than maybe some that didn't kind of fair, as well as we did through the pandemic. so again, more short-term impacts than longer term, and we'll continue to monitor this and see how it plays out over the next couple of months.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
and then, john, as it relates to the delivery side of the equation and the virtual brand side of the equation from a cost perspective, i mean, systemically, what you're really thinking about is delivery fees and packaging supplies, the incrementality of that. now, that's obviously embedded into the modeling we do around the channel itself. but looking at company sales, you're talking a couple of percent there, probably 2% to 3% from an incremental cost standpoint. and then in some restaurants, you will see some additional labor in the equation, but that's simply volume-driven.
so as you see successful volumes at a certain restaurants, you may have additional labor, which clearly is -- the volumes are clearly what we're driving for on that side of the equation. but i think systemically, that's really the major differences in those channels.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from nicole miller. nicole, your line is live. please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
nicole miller -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. piper sandler. good morning. i wanted to ask about the comment around development resources.
what are those resources? is it something to do with bench strength? or is it just the actual commitment around the pipeline? and what's the incremental cost or not of the development resources to accelerate?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. it's really the people side of the equation. we're increasing our development team to make sure that they have the ability to broaden their scope as much as possible around the country. there could be some incrementality around some outsourced brokerage opportunities and support staff there.
but it's really headcount, and i can use one hand because they can be very effective if they're giving the right tools and support behind their efforts. we want to make sure that they're out aggressively looking at opportunities on a nationwide basis.
nicole miller -- piper sandler -- analyst
and is 18 to 20 the goal and the run rate? or is that the first step in a continued acceleration?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
it is the level we are getting to, and i'd put it probably more in the first step than the run rate. as we get closer to that over the next two years, we'll continue to evaluate it. again, we think there's great opportunity to grow this brand, to grow it maybe in some different ways and footprints. we'll continue to look at all those opportunities as we move forward.
so it's nothing to say that you can't go beyond that, but we'll get more specific with those plans as we get further down the path, but we definitely plan to get to that level at least.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
and then what happens in the real estate markets is going to be critical there as well, right? and so we know there's a lot of expectation that with the results of the pandemic, real estate prices will have come down. we just haven't seen that yet and whether or not that comes to fruition, we'll see. but if it does, that opens up more opportunities. so there's a couple of things in the current environment where we know we can grow and depending on which -- what happens in the future, there could be even more aggressive growth.
nicole miller -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you very much. appreciate the update.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
and the next question is coming from alex slagle. alex, your line is live. please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
alex slagle -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks. good morning. jefferies. just a follow-up on the short-term variable incentives around labor.
i mean, do you think the magnitude will be similar to what we've seen in 3q? or should we expect the sort of step-up into the fourth quarter?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
you know, i think there'll be a little bit of a step-up, but it's not going to be meaningful. we don't anticipate it. we've given you guidance as to kind of how we see the quarter, and it doesn't include a huge impact to that. one of the things we're seeing, which is a little bit of a good news for our operators and our -- some of our team members is -- we'll just use more -- a little more overtime than we've used in the past.
and a lot of our team members, especially in the kitchens, in the heart of the house, they prefer to work a few more hours and get the overtime. and so we may have to use a little more overtime than we would historically use. and again, that's a short-term kind of solution to get us through what is a very unique and, really, non-sustainable situation here with labor.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah. alex, i think in the past when we've talked about labor inflation, we typically looked at that 3% to 5% kind of range is the normal conversation we had about labor inflation, that includes the overtime and training and bonus structures we deploy. we'll probably be, i think, in the short run, running at the higher end of that level, that the numbers i talked about for the fourth quarter embed that thought process into it, and we'll see it as it develops. but we're very comfortable.
we have the -- all the tools in place to manage through this short term.
alex slagle -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. and on it's just wings. just now that you've established the strong delivery business on doordash and expanded into pickup. the brand has some website, i guess, now and integrated with google, what's the next phase of marketing for the brand and building awareness outside doordash?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
you're a little ahead of schedule there. so we do obviously have the great doordash relationship in the delivery side. we've integrated with google. our website and our marketing push to a broader consumer about pickup really hasn't taken off yet.
that's kind of going to happen more here in the fourth quarter as we continue to see what the upside is with the pickup aspect of wings, which we're very optimistic about. we think there's a real nice growth vehicle there against that brand and against any other future brand. so again, a lot of infrastructure work has to go into play to make that happen, and we're almost finished with that. and then we get to push it to the consumer to see how they react, and that's kind of coming.
alex slagle -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from eric gonzalez. eric, your line is live. please announce your affiliation then pose your question.
eric gonzalez -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thanks. it's keybanc. you said you haven't seen any degradation in the off-premise business as capacity restrictions eased. are we to assume that the digital mix is sustained in that mid-40% range?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
we have seen some denigration, eric. i mean, we were running in -- obviously, at the peak, we were running at 100%, and we're now much -- we've seen it go from the 40s as restaurant dining rooms get closer to that historic level, it's dropping down in that mid- to low 30s. and so we do see some but we think it's going to stay closer to that 30% range. again, if you remember, pre-pandemic, we were just starting to push up to 20%.
so between everything we're doing and all the different aspects of the business, we're thinking that it will probably stay in that low 30 range as dining rooms get back to full capacity.
eric gonzalez -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. then if i can maybe sneak one in about it's just wings. i was wondering if you could -- i know you don't like to discuss the sales mix in particular. but maybe if you could speak directionally about how the sales contribution has trended in recent weeks as those dining rooms opened up.
and are you seeing anything to suggest that you might need to invest more to support that brand as things normalize?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah. eric, i think, again, i think the brand is performing as we expected it to perform. the fourth quarter was the strongest quarter of the three. i should say third quarter -- sorry, i just got a lot of three fingers just raised in the room.
so the third quarter was the strongest quarter as we kind of learned how to use the brand around some of the major sporting events. but it's trending how we would need it to trend to hit those results as we talked about. i think there's going to be some seasonality as you look at this business as you go throughout a year. and this is probably one -- we expect it to have a little seasonality in the fourth quarter.
and i imagine we're going to see that based on the first couple of weeks, but again, right in line with what we need to do to get those targets in.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. and when you think about the fact that really not a college football season last year, so we're excited about what the fall will hold for the brand. it's been a really great year of learning around the virtual brands, it's just wings and others, around how to market them effectively, about how they play to different audiences, and who the target is. they definitely -- we've experimented and tested several brands now and they all have unique aspects to them.
so getting those insights this year has been very helpful. and then obviously, getting our restaurants to execute and operationally locked down so that as dining rooms pick back up, the wings business is integrated seamlessly has been hugely important and something we've been very encouraged by how it's all playing out.
eric gonzalez -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
and the next question is coming from dennis geiger. dennis, your line is live. please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you. ubs. curious if you could share some more thoughts on kind of regional performance, and specifically, what you've seen in off-premise in those markets.
maybe kind of touching on maybe it's just wings' performance in those markets as well with the greatest capacity as things have reopened. and wyman, you just gave some good color, i think, on the -- how off-premise has trended and what you expect, but curious if you could share kind of what you've seen in those regions, specifically.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
well, i mean, yeah, dennis. by far, the biggest variable to regional performance is still, far and away, restrictions. and so it's all the other things you were wanting to talk about are really insignificant to dining room capacity restrictions. so in states, as joe mentioned, michigan, california, illinois, where we're still seeing some fairly stringent capacity issues, that's what's driving the regionality.
in states that have been open more, we're seeing obviously much better performance. and we anticipate as those states see better covid results and covid becomes less of an issue, their capacity constraints will be lifted and we'll see that same performance. so we're actually very encouraged about the breadth of the recovery when you kind of factor out covid restraints. now, specifically, when you think about it's just wings, it's not so much a regional, it's almost a market by market and sometimes restaurant by restaurant.
that's what i was talking about. depending on who the consumer is for a virtual brand really drives -- area. so there are some regional moves if you were to pull all the way back at the national level. but for the most part, where we see the real interesting learning is at the restaurant-by-restaurant, market-by-market area.
and that's what we've kind of started to better understand. and then with regard to delivery and takeout, again, broad-based, nationally pulling kind of similarly.
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
great. and maybe if i could, just one more, wyman. curious, your thought and given your perspective on kind of industry supply, how you think this plays out going forward and ultimately how you -- the brands benefit from that. i'm not sure if you've seen any kind of discernible benefit yet from supply coming in.
but overall, kind of how you think this benefits you from a market share gain perspective going forward, recognizing it might be a little early to make that call.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
and really dealing with closures is what i think you're --
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yeah, you're talking about a number of restaurants?
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
yes.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
ok, sure. so we don't have -- i don't -- we're not out there tracking the number of restaurants that are opened now versus prior year. obviously, the number has been estimated somewhere in that 5% to 15% range. i think in most of our trade areas, it's probably on the lower end.
i think you're going to see a significant restructuring in major metropolitan areas, obviously, in the new york cities and the chicagos. how quickly they come back will be very interesting. there's a lot of stimulus, there's a lot of interest and so that -- but that doesn't really impact our business as much. so we're not really counting, if you will, on a great tailwind.
we're seeing what we see today. we think that's projectable out into the near future. and we'll see what happens with regard to competition, if you will, as we get past covid and things get to be more normal.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
i think, dennis, one thing anecdotally we are seeing on the development side of the equation, as we cast that net wider, is more and more opportunities of looking at sites that are closed restaurants from other brands. so we're seeing that at a higher rate than we've seen in the past, so another data point there to look at.
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
and the next question is coming from jared garber. jared, your line is live. please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.
jared garber -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks. goldman sachs. can you give a little bit more color on the $20 million tech investments that you mentioned earlier and how you see that flowing through, whether that's in-store technology or more sort of mobile or website technology? and then also on the new unit opens that you talked about, any color on maybe the shifting in asset design, especially as it relates to potentially supporting these digital brands through the chili's kitchens? thanks.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
jared, i'm not going to walk you through the detailed breakdown of it. but i will tell you just one example of some of the things we're excited about or one of the things we're excited about with technology spend, and that's the rollout of our handheld devices across the country. so again, we've been working on a handheld solution for multiple years. it's been employed in over 100 restaurants.
but it wasn't quite ready, and so we've done a lot of work and we've invested a lot of time and energy and capital into getting it right. and we now feel like we do have that right and solved with -- and so we'll roll that technology out across the system. and that's going to do a couple of things, first, we think provide a better guest experience. it also allows us to run more efficient restaurants in the front of the house.
it will make more money. so that's a great tech investment that we will roll out here in the next fiscal year. and that's just one example of what goes into that $20 million bucket.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah. one thing i would add to that, too, jared, because i think it's important to understand, that's not a one-time unique investment. you can pretty much think of that as a run rate from a capital investment standpoint. one of the -- and i think the market-leading advantages we've developed is because we've been very consistent on that level of investment into technology really now for a number of years.
so it's building on a base that i think is outpacing many in the industry and giving us that competitive advantage. and also supporting that, that's the capital spend. supporting that is an infrastructure spend that is even at a higher level that is making sure we have the development capabilities and the innovation to support things like our apps and our websites and our connectivity. and so it's a -- technology is just a key component of how we approach the business, and those spends are embedded into our base and our thinking going forward.
jared garber -- goldman sachs -- analyst

and the next question is coming from sara senatore. sara, your line is live. please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
sara senatore -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
all right. thank you. bernstein. i wanted to ask a bit about the virtual brands and maybe the competitive set there.
i think it was interesting to see a lot of restaurants maybe follow you into that virtual market, utilize excess capacity, and, in many cases, i think we're seeing fairly similar menu offerings. so i guess, one, could you just talk a bit about the competitive environment there and to the extent to which that informs how you're thinking about growth? and then two, whether you think that use case and that those menu items have benefited from pandemic-related dine-in â or rather at-home dining similar to maybe what we've seen in pizza just insofar as we think about as people leave their homes, again, some of these -- i think some of the food categories are probably going to see different dynamics, headwinds versus tailwinds. and wings in particular seems like one that's benefited. thanks.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
sure. great question, sara. i think the -- there's two things, right, that kind of boldness, if you will, around a virtual brand strategy. one is it really is about scale and being able to do large numbers.
it's about how many locations can you put out there. and with 1,200 restaurants in the u.s., we're able to kind of meet that criteria. and so, yes, there's a lot of people doing it, but not a lot of people with scale and so they don't really impact you very much. and then operationally, just getting it right and positioning a brand is not easy.
and so a lot of people can throw stuff out on the internet or put it on a website for a delivery company, but then to execute it right to price it, to have a value proposition that's really compelling, i mean, we think our positioning in the wings business is very strong. and we can do that. and then when you consider our scale to buy and source product and all the things we bring to the table, it just gives us competitive advantage. so i'm not too worried about people coming in.
and i think the thing that doesn't get talked about the most, it's probably the most important is what's it doing to your base business? and are you able to pull this off? and i've seen examples of people throwing maybe three or four virtual brands, and it's just very, very hard for me to imagine how that executes from an operational standpoint. and sometimes, as they talk about simplifying their menu and their base concept, it's like that, they just -- they just don't kind of go together. so you have to be very diligent about all of that to make it work both from a brand standpoint and from a consumer perspective. so that's kind of how we see it.
i think there's going to be some winners and losers. with regard to the product and is it just being kind of artificially pumped because of the pandemic, we don't think so. we think the wings business for -- as an example, is a strong baseline business. and we don't think we're going to see significant deterioration as we go back to more normal levels of restaurant operations and some of our other concepts, we think you're probably going to see even more support than that.
so we don't think we've gotten into anything that's too trendy, if you will, based on the pandemic.

thank you. and the next question is coming from greg badishkanian. greg your line is live. please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
sure thing. from wolfe research. it's actually fred wightman on for greg. in the release, you guys mentioned that you're meaningfully above 2019 levels for sales and traffic.
so i'm wondering if you could just give some context for that 10% quarter-to-date chili's comp that you highlighted? and maybe just touch on how you think traffic and check are going to progress over the next few quarters here?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes, fred. currently, it's traffic-driven, and that's by design. i mean, we're really leaning in to make this a traffic story. it has consistently been a traffic story for over the last year really in going back, really, two years before that.
so that's why we're being very diligent and disciplined around pricing. now, clearly, you have a mix situation over the course of the last year with restaurant capacity shutdown. so you're not -- you haven't seen the alcoholic beverages, the apps, the desserts, things of that nature. now, as you start to reopen restaurants, we think there is going to be a nice opportunity year over year on the mix side of the equation.
so i think that will be some incremental opportunity that flows back in. but what we're most gratified by is if you looked at the traffic numbers, they line up very, very tightly with those comp numbers we gave you. so it is a traffic-driven story. and i think that will continue kind of as we move forward.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
perfect. and then you guys had alluded to some uncertainty on the event side at maggiano's, which makes sense. but is the holiday season sort of the line in the sand or your best guess for when that could normalize? are there any sort of market-level indicators that suggest that could come back sooner than the holiday season? anything would be super helpful.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
well, i mean, i think the cdc came out with some new guidelines maybe as recently as yesterday around vaccinations and people that have been vaccinated and their ability to congregate in larger numbers without math. and so you're really -- we're very encouraged again by, first, the overall impact that vaccinations is having on the country and allowing people to move more freely. and we anticipate that as more people get vaccinated, that this will improve, and people will not only be allowed to but feel more comfortable gathering. and we're seeing that.
you're seeing that in the travel industry. you're starting to see this process move its way through. and i think as you start -- if you will, ticking off, ok, well, what would be the next thing that would kind of open up sporting events? and then social gatherings are going to be very high on the top of that list. so we just anticipate that happening really organically with all the improvements that are happening through the vaccination process.
and then corporate will kind of follow after that. so i think, again, we're not predicting, but if you continue this positive trend with vaccinations, i think by the end of the year, toward the end of the year and the holiday season, we could be in a very nice place, and people could feel very comfortable gathering again.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
makes sense. thank you.

thank you. and the next question is coming from chris o'cull. chris, your line is live. please announce your affiliation, and pose your question.
chris o'cull -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi. it's stifel. good morning, guys. one, are you seeing it's just wings growth rate level off, maybe period to period? or are there any indications you could see significant growth over the $150 million into next year?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. i think our -- again, we've talked about it a couple of times. the idea that takeout on that brand, what could the takeout business be? what potential do we have when we start to build the brand outside of just the delivery channel that we have today? again, don't know exactly. we're going to find out here in the very near future.
but we just know just in general, consumers take out more than they deliver. so we have to build the brand's awareness and that's going to take a little bit of work. but if you were to just kind of use historic ratios, you'd be pretty encouraged that, hey, a pickup business or a takeout business for this brand could do very well. and so we're excited.
that will be the lessons that we learn here in the next couple of months as to how hard is that, how heavy a lift is that to get the brand awareness up and what kind of response do we get. so that's -- we're already having -- i mean, again, we're already having people every day in every restaurant come and pick up each day. the numbers are fairly small now because we're not pushing our own website and an aggressive marketing plan, but we'll start to test that. so that's where we see the biggest opportunity.
but we also know, again, this was a year of learning around the marketing. and so as we start to better understand how this was our first season of sports, and it's a very sports-oriented product. and so we'll get smarter about, ok, here's how we better market or more effectively market against the various seasons as they come around. and we're also now very much aware of where our markets that do well versus those that are a little softer.
so all of that learning comes into play in terms of how do you grow the business going forward.
chris o'cull -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
do you anticipate being aggressive with the marketing efforts to build awareness? or do you think this is something you need to build gradually over time because it could be -- you can make the operations a little more complex?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yes. i think we've got -- we feel very comfortable about our ability to execute wings in the restaurant at high volumes. again, i mean, gone through our first super bowl. we know there's a lot of capacity and capabilities in our restaurants to execute this brand at a high level of sales.
and when you say aggressive, i think we're going to be very targeted and very -- and we will address -- but you're not going to see a national ad campaign -- you're not going to see a tv ad with it's just wings on it on national television. we're going to be very targeted in our approach to knowing how to connect and talk to these consumers.
chris o'cull -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thanks, guys.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yeah.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from brian vaccaro. brian, your line is live. please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
brian vaccaro -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks. raymond james. and good morning. wanted to circle back just on the recent sales trends, and i appreciate the monthly comps you provided versus '19.
but joe, could you help us translate that a bit into average weekly sales? we don't have monthly aws back in '19, so i was just hoping you could level set where quarter-to-date average weekly sales dollars are for each brand.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
when you look at average weekly sales, again, and then comparing it to '19, as you said, you have a -- some different deltas there. you don't have the midwest in '19, which we have in our current levels. and of course, wings is in our current levels and didn't exist in '19. so we've been running very consistently up in those mid- to upper 60s for the chili's brand.
and then you can layer on for maggiano's, you're running in the $5 million to $6 million level kind of on a weekly basis. the nice thing is, as i mentioned in the script, is coming out of uri, the storm, and you start to then build into march, you saw these weekly average sales moving north. i mentioned the record levels we hit in march. you obviously had stimulus dollars flowing in kind of in that mid-march time frame.
but we've seen a very consistent maintenance of those levels in april.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
but seasonally, brian, these are our biggest months. so if you're just looking at average weekly sales volumes for chili's, obviously, maggiano's has big months in the holidays, but for chili's, the spring are our biggest months. and so we're seeing some absolute high volumes, and we're wrapping on those.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
and again, that's probably -- and again, you're looking at an overall system that's probably running, on average, in the high 70s from a capacity standpoint compared to that time frame that you're looking at. so again, when you think about california, 10% of the market and significant markets in places like illinois and new jersey and some of the upper midwest states that are not carrying those levels yet, we're comfortable they will. there's upside to that.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
the other thing we can see, brian, it gives us a -- well, when you just -- again, it kind of builds off what joe was just saying about the constraints. so we are still constrained in our dining rooms. our weekend volumes are still being hampered. so we're seeing stronger f '19 builds, if you will, weekday because we don't have as much capacity constraints because those are some of the lower volume dayparts and weak parts.
when you get to the weekend where the capacity comes in, you're still being constrained. and so as the constraints get released, we'll see bigger and better numbers, again, across the system but especially in those states that are most constrained, california, illinois, michigan.
brian vaccaro -- raymond james -- analyst
that's great. and, you know, i guess parlaying that a little bit into your fiscal 4q guide, it would seem to embed -- correct me if i'm wrong, but it would seem to embed perhaps a little lower aws volume than that at chili's, say, for your fiscal 4q guide. is there a degree of seasonality we should be mindful of as we think about may and june? we can obviously see it on a quarterly basis. first half of your fiscal year is usually higher than the second half.
but is there a degree of seasonality there or just perhaps broader conservatism as you set the 4q guide as we see how stimulus rolls off, etc., etc.? or just wondering how you framed kind of that fiscal 4q guide a little bit.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
i don't think there's significant on either of those fronts. i mean, we're pretty much kind of projecting similar kind of trends that we've seen in april through the rest of the quarter, as joe kind of mentioned. and the absolute levels are in the ballpark of what we've just been talking about.
brian vaccaro -- raymond james -- analyst
great. and on the effective capacity, thank you for that, i think you said upper 70s at chili's. what does that look like in markets like florida and texas? are you able to get back closer to 100% or is there a natural ceiling with social distancing and other considerations in place?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
you definitely see it in different markets. we have markets that are back above 100%. we have market -- we have a number of markets sitting in the 90s. that kind of goes -- as you get reopened, you tend to see it move into the 70s then progressing to 90s as people get more comfortable.
i think vaccines is driving a lot of that progression.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
hard to get to 100%, though, without fully open, and no one's fully open. we're not fully open. even if they say they're fully open, we're still doing some social distancing and we're still wearing masks. so until it gets quite open, back to, hey, there are no restrictions and everyone's comfortable, there will be some constraints.
i mean, it's hard, hard to get to that 80%, 90%, and then the takeout business is covering a bit. to get all the way back to 100% because then you got those weekends volumes that you've got to -- where you need every seat, that will be a bigger challenge. but we're optimistic that that's going to happen fairly soon. and the -- yes, go ahead.
brian vaccaro -- raymond james -- analyst
i'm sorry. sorry to interrupt you there. yes, last one i wanted to just touch on the tightness in the labor market. if you have it handy, where does your employee count stand at the end of the fiscal third quarter? and could you frame how many employees you think you need to hire to catch up to sales? and then maybe wrap it up into the fourth quarter.
could you ballpark kind of the one-time hiring and training costs or elevated training costs that you've embedded in your 4q guide? thank you.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah, brian, we can probably follow back up with some of those specific numbers. i don't have those team number levels. again, we've maintained a level of staffing throughout this. it is a good starting point, we're hiring consistently really in the 5,000 per team member per month kind of which is a little bit higher than you would typically see, again, a lot of that driven by the reopening trade as you come back in line.
so as it relates to those specific cost numbers, that's getting a little into the weeds.
brian vaccaro -- raymond james -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from john ivankoe. john, your line is live. please mention your affiliation and pose your question.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
thank you. at jpmorgan. maybe a little bit on that last question. with labor costs running at the higher end of 3% to 5% and obviously, the stimulus and just money, in general, that's in the economy, what is your thought on menu pricing? might we expect a significantly above-average menu pricing year at least over the next 12 months? and then i have a follow-up as well.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
john ivankoe, good to see you or good to hear you. again, with regard to any of the pressures that we're anticipating. the good news is for a lot of our cost structure, it's locked down, right? so especially on the cost of sales side and the commodity side, we're feeling pretty good. we've got a good line of sight and we've got some fairly good costs locked down.
so then the labor issue that you're talking about could put a little pressure on it. as joe said, we're talking to maybe 3% to 5% is what we're dealing with. we know we like to price in that 1% to 1.5%. but again, if anyone's got pricing powder, if you will, that's kept dry, it's us.
we haven't priced at all. if you look at our differences between us and the industry on sales versus traffic, we've been playing the traffic game, and we've been really kind of significantly outperforming and working on the traffic piece and keeping our pricing powder dry. and so if we need to go a little more aggressive to a pricing situation, we think we can. again, it's our last option.
frankly, we like to keep the restaurants busy. we like to give guests great value propositions. and so -- but we feel comfortable that if this thing were to play itself out a little longer than we think it will or be a little more difficult to manage, that we have more pricing flexibility in our -- and we absolutely have more than, i think, a lot of other people do.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
makes sense. there might be an expectation for higher prices from the consumer, so it will be interesting to see how that plays out.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
well, they're seeing that, john. and they're not -- and they're -- i think that one of the things you have to -- there's -- the consumer sentiment during the pandemic was -- the consumer was fairly lenient during the pandemic on pricing. i think as things go back to normal, there were two things that they kind of gave permission to: one was pricing, and one was selection. and a lot of people took price and cut options.
and consumers kind of understood it. there was a pandemic. there was all this -- but i think in the future, they're not going to just kind of like carry those -- those are things i don't think they carry forward. i think they're going to want convenience and everything else, but i don't think they're going to just say, ""oh well, it's ok that you've overpriced and cut my selection."" and we didn't do either of those things.
so that's why we're -- we feel really good about where we're positioned.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
understood. and the second part of the question and you touched on it was regards to cost of sales. and whether it's a base commodity or it's shipping costs or what have you, including labor that exists, a driver in the warehouse side, all the things that we're reading about, there does seem to be some underlying cogs pressure that is coming, if not necessarily for you in the very near term because of contracts, it might be, i don't know, six or 12 or 18 months away, depending on what your contracts are. could you kind of look forward a little bit beyond the fourth quarter and kind of talk about the cogs environment, maybe highlight some of the more major commodities to make us comfortable with your fiscal '22 exposure?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah, john, again, i do think there are some pressures that are existing out there. the commentary around those spot pressures is what you typically will see out there, doesn't come into play, as you say, in the next couple of quarters because of the contracting positions we've built. so we are protected really across all of our major commodity components for the rest of this fiscal year. and then you build a lot of protections into the proteins and things of that nature as you get through the calendar year and even out into the beginnings of calendar '22.
i mean, their distribution channels are still unwinding and those do have impacts from time to time. again, the nationwide distribution channels that we've established and the relationships we have with those broadline -- mainline carriers are very solid and are in place and are delivering for the restaurants. so again, scale matters and support systems matter in this case. and we have just an excellent supply chain group, particularly when it comes to the logistical side of the equation.
so it can be an all hands on deck, experience is different time to time, but we're working through all of those issues and are not seeing the broad-based disruptions that you hear about from some folks. so really pleased with the way that they're performing there. and again, that supply chain will sort itself out. i think the disruptions are sporadic more than systemic and will correct themselves as they kind of move forward.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yes. i think, john, two other things you got to remember with us. well, first, the distribution issues are really, again, more market-based and not national, and the team is doing a good job to deal with those market-based issues. and then the beauty of -- especially the chili's menu is broad-based use of proteins, very flexible and a lot of chicken breast.
and again, the commodity market looks fairly good. looks like it's going to be another good year. it doesn't look like -- the grain harvest looks solid. so those are the things that typically would get you concerned about the longer term.
if we're looking out into the future, the things that drive commodity costs longer term tend to be droughts. and it's looking like it's going to be a good harvest. and so those things bode well. and then we'll get through some of these labor issues better than most.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
thank you, guys.

thanks, john.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from jeffrey bernstein. jeffrey, your line is live. please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays capital -- analyst
great. thank you very much. from barclays. just following up on some earlier comments.
wyman, you mentioned that your goal would be, from an off-premise perspective, to hold on, i guess, maybe in the low 30% range versus your pre-pandemic of 20%. so clearly, that's a healthy 10% incrementality if you believe it's incremental to your in-store. so i'm just wondering if that was to play out in terms of that 10% incremental sales. how do you think about that in terms of the margin outlook? it would seem like even before covid, obviously getting 10% more sales would help you leverage your fixed costs and give you a better margin.
but through covid, it seems like everyone's talking about doing more with less and being more efficient. so where do you see that incremental sales flowing through from a maybe margin upside perspective, whether it's relative to historical highs or however you think about that incrementality? and then i had one follow-up.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yeah, jeff, great question. i do think that's kind of center to our organic growth story, right? it's the leverage that we get through higher sales, a lot of that higher sales are going to be coming through off-premise. and it's a combination, it delivers great margins in and of itself, and then it also allows us to leverage the fixed costs and grow the margins from that aspect as well. without getting specific to what the numbers are, that's the strategy, and we're very excited about it and it's playing itself out as we would expect.
we're also not just counting on that. we're also, as you've mentioned, as others have said, there are other things we've evaluated aggressively to rethink, to make sure that we're as efficient as possible while we support our restaurant operators to deliver great guest experiences. and some of those things are proving to be sustainable as we get back to kind of more historic levels of dining and traffic, and that's encouraging.
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays capital -- analyst
got it. and then just from a cost perspective, maybe you could just address quickly marketing and g&a. marketing, it seems like it will be down year over year pretty significantly with a lot less maybe national television of late. so just your outlook on the continued favorability.
and then as it relates to just underlying g&a, what you kind of think of as the normalized core spend as we now wrap on '21 and look into fiscal '22, whether you think about it as relative to revenue or opportunities from that g&a perspective? thank you.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yeah, i'll hit marketing, and i'll let joe touch on g&a. so i think what's sometimes missed in our story is we didn't just cut marketing, we have rethought our marketing approach. and so while if you were to look at maybe the national network television line item yet significantly down. but we've reinvested and we feel like the model we've been running this last year with the pandemic is pretty much the model we will run going forward.
so we're not -- we didn't just cut those dollars and not reinvest them. now, they show up in different places in our p&l so it's not as easy as just the national network line. but those places we were invested in are obviously places we feel much better about the return and we can measure that return. and so it's in those much more effective channels of marketing.
and so we don't anticipate having to -- or going back to a very aggressive television campaign, if you will, on a national basis. we like the model that we're using today.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
and then on the g&a side of the equation, jeff, i think from a rule of thumb, without getting specific to future fiscal years, i think 4% is a good benchmark for you to thinking about. the thing i like about g&a from a strategic standpoint is it is very leverageable. so i think there is some opportunity there to that number as we kind of move forward. and remember, already embedded in that g&a number is significant technology spend that is important to drive the business going forward.
we obviously have all of the compensation programs across all -- across the support staff embedded into that program. so when we think about how you invest into the business, we're going to have the flexibility to do what we need to do on the g&a side of the equation to drive development, to drive technology, to really grow the initiatives without having to alter that structure as you kind of move forward. so i think there's some -- definitely, it will be one of the points of leverageability as you build those volumes, as you go toward that $3.5 million average volume level.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. another thing we did this year, jeff, kind of along those same lines, if you think about manager bonus, doesn't show up in g&a but it shows up in the labor line. and we paid manager bonuses out at a higher level this year, significantly higher by the time the whole fiscal year is done than we did last year. so through the pandemic, we kept them whole at bonus levels even though obviously, we were making a lot less money.
and we did that. and so next year, as you try and project out next year, we don't have a big hole to fill with regard to manager bonuses. we anticipate and want to play them even more, but it's not like we cut bonuses way down. so now, as we grow into next year and things get back to normal, we got this significant gap to close.
and so we feel good again about how we've maintained our cost structure and supported our people through the pandemic. and then what that bodes for as sales and traffic kind of come back, not having to kind of, again, fill some holes.

thank you. and the next question is coming from david palmer. david, your line is live. please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks. evercore isi. a question on restaurant margins. the margin implied by your guidance in the fourth quarter would seem to imply new peak levels already.
i don't know if you think if you could endorse this, but it seems like it will be near 17% for the quarter, which would be better than your -- than what we see in our model for past fourth-quarter peak margins. obviously, it's a weird time, staffing levels, partially reopened restaurants, so obviously, these may not be indicative of where things would settle out as you get to a fully reopened restaurant base and society gets fully reopened. but how are you thinking about where your margins can be versus fiscal past peak of around 15% on an accounting-adjusted basis? what are some gives and takes as you're thinking about the -- your margins and where they can go? thanks.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah, david. i'm not going to argue at all with your math on the guidance and the perceived margin that you put forward there. i think again, we're very optimistic about it. in fact, i'm more optimistic today than i was a year ago, obviously.
but as we continue to see the strategy unfold and the fact that it does drive the incrementality from a margin standpoint, i'm comfortable with the target being able to get back into those ranges over time. we'll talk again more specific for future fiscal year. but definitely, upward trajectory is involved. i would mention, too, as it relates to the fourth quarter, remember, that is a 53rd week, which does create a leverageable event in that in that last week.
but even taking that into consideration, it would not surprise me to see, again, comparing back to pre-covid days, your fourth-quarter margins demonstrating the ability to leverage and move that margin up nicely above where we were in the past.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. thanks. and just a question on complexity. i think there's some questions on this call that touched on a little bit but i think there's a little bit of an implicit worry.
one of your answers, wyman, you even touched on it, that you're comfortable with one brand. but when i think about things getting to maybe two virtual brands and your own brand has -- is fully up and running. the stress is on the kitchen. you can imagine a saturday night, maybe there being moments where you're freaking out about capacity.
and i think some others have worried aloud about a company like yours pursuing the strategy that you do pursue in that it will jeopardize that on-premise experience. so how are you feeling about that today? and are you still as confident as ever that you have the capacity to deliver when you get particularly to a busy saturday night?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. well, first, david, we are in some busy saturday nights. i mean, we're setting records right now. and we have two virtual brands in a number of restaurants.
and so we're learning the lesson that you're asking about and it's a critical lesson, right? and we're feeling good about where we're at. we got some work to do still to just really ensure that exactly the issue you're talking about is dealt with and that we're giving operators all the tools they need and the systems in place to execute and that's what we're doing. and that's, again, the beauty of the scale, the beauty of the resources we have here, both supply chain and our culinary people and our op support people and the great operators we have. so it's not to be taken lightly and we don't take it lightly.
and that's why sometimes, i think people might be a little bit -- we wonder why we're just not rolling out the next virtual brand tomorrow. and it's like, oh, we want to make sure it's absolutely locked down and that we can support our operators so that on those busy nights, we've got mother's day coming up. i mean, you've got to be able to say, yes, this is doable. the good news is with these higher volumes, they get labor.
they get additional labor in that kitchen. and so we can give them an additional person. and sometimes, it can just be a dedicated person to just doing that. if you're doing enough volume on a virtual brand, you're going to have a dedicated cook just focused on that.
so all the other stuff still happens without really being impacted if you set the system up correctly. so that's -- but it's really, i think, the critical question.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. good to see you there. good talk, too.

thank you. and the next question is coming from andrew strelzik. andrew, your line is live. please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
andrew strelzik -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thanks. bmo. good morning. two quick ones for me.
i'm sorry if i missed this, but on the unit growth side, did you say how long you think it will take to build the development pipeline to get to that kind of 20-ish openings that you talked about? and then the second thing on virtual brands. obviously, you've talked about it's just wings, $150 million-plus. but just broadly speaking, for a virtual brand to kind of warrant a national rollout, is there a sales threshold that you kind of think about either at launch or from a sales perspective, like over time, that you kind of think about in terms of warranting that level of rollout? thanks.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
so, andrew, as it relates to the development side of the question, i expect it to be a stair step over the next couple of fiscal years. i think we will look to build that pipeline a little bit further than where we've been at. next fiscal year '22 and then '23, i think there's some -- they're working hard on the opportunities there to see it come in line with what i was talking about there. so we'll definitely continue to move closer as we go through this next fiscal year â two fiscal years.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
and then i don't know, andrew --
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
sales lines on the virtual brand side of the equation.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yeah, in terms of when do we see the opportunity. give me that question one more time, andrew. i wasn't quite tracking with you.
andrew strelzik -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yeah. i guess i'm just wondering if there's kind of a minimum sales threshold that you think about from a virtual brand perspective, that it would then warrant a national rollout.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
sure, absolutely. and we've -- yes, and we have those targets. and i don't know why, let's just say, less than $100 million. i don't know.
i'm just putting a number out there now, but you want it to be significant, for all the reasons we just talked about, in terms of adding that complexity in the restaurant. you don't want people to have to work hard at something that doesn't sell. so what that number is exactly but it'd have to be significant. we think $150 million is significant, but we're also trying to grow that.
so to go through the effort and do it right with the systems in place, you'd want it to be significant. then you've got this issue of, ok, well, in some restaurants, you may not see those levels of volumes. and so do you -- we still have that opportunity to say, ""oh, you know what, that's a market that doesn't do as well in that virtual brand. so let's not burden that restaurant with that."" and maybe we'll find another virtual brand that does better there or maybe we just take that load off of them.
so we're going through that whole process. and again, it's inorganic, it's kind of a learning process that we will continue to kind of work our way through. but yes, it has to be significant. we don't want to mess with something that's not really going to make a difference.
andrew strelzik -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you very much.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
right. thanks.
mika ware -- vice president of finance and investor relations

wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, mika, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. brinker's fourth quarter was one of our more profitable quarters in recent history, marking a solid finish to a successful, albeit unusual year. underpinning our fiscal '21 results is a consistent strategy that differentiates us in the marketplace and an exceptional team that executes every day in our restaurants. we were already growing sales and taking share before the pandemic hit, and we made the decision to lean further into our strategy of providing convenience, value, and a great guest experience by doubling down on third-party delivery and improving our take-out systems.
in a year of social distancing, our teams came together safely to lead the industry on traffic and regained positive sales momentum. in a year of closures and shutdowns, we opened our first virtual brand in over 1,000 restaurants by leveraging our technological infrastructure, it's just wings surpassed our $150 million target in our company-owned restaurants. and along with the support of our franchise partners, it's just wings became more than $170 million business in the u.s., with many of our international franchisees also now operating the brand. in a year that started with unemployment near record highs, we kept all our management teams employed and paid them solid bonuses.
we put a retention plan in place for our strongest team members to encourage them to stay with us as the staffing environment continued to change through the spring and summer. in a year where gatherings and special occasions at maggiano's were restricted, steve and the team restructured the value proposition, the takeout proposition, and reengineered the heart of house. the brand is already delivering much more profitable sales as volumes come back and guests have responded very positively to the changes. in a year, we thought we might have to borrow money more to survive the pandemic, we paid down our debt by over $300 million and we're committed to continuing that trend this year.
and in a year where we worried we wouldn't be able to support our charitable partners at levels we're used to, our team set a record, raising more than $10 million for st. jude during an exceptionally critical time for their patients and families. our teams have raised nearly $90 million for st. jude's patients during our partnership.
thanks to the strength of our operations team, we've emerged an even stronger business than before. in fact, we've positioned ourselves to invest aggressively to grow this business during fiscal '22 and beyond and to keep our balance sheet strong. the ability to make these kinds of investments starts with owning our restaurants; having the opportunity to leverage our fleet and realize the full potential -- the full profitability of our efforts. the pandemic solidified our commitment to corporate ownership.
despite the challenges of owning restaurants like dealing with labor issues and commodity cycles because ownership gives us the scale to effectively manage the issues, it allows us to steward our brands consistently and have control over the investments we make to grow the business. this year, our investments will target more ways to offer convenience, value, and a great guest experience. by doubling our pipeline of new restaurant openings, reimagining to keep our assets strong and vibrant, accelerating our technology advantages, and expanding our portfolio of brands. currently, we're in the middle of rolling out our second virtual brand, maggiano's italian classics.
it's now in over 250 restaurants today and doing very well. this one will be a slower roll for a couple of reasons. it's a little more complex. and since we're back to fully operational dining rooms, we're being very intentional about the experience for our operators and our guests.
we're excited about it. we're getting great guest feedback, and we're anticipating being in restaurants 900 restaurants by the end of the fiscal year. we're also investing in both takeout and delivery by pursuing opportunities to increase visibility and drive awareness of these channels across all four of our brands. we recently implemented technology enhancements to our curbside takeout system, which is already simplifying the operational side of the business and improving guest metrics.
it's just wings has gone live with a website that offers online ordering for takeout as well as delivery, and we're excited about the growth potential for the brand. these technology investments are helping us do a better job handling the increased mix of off-premise business from pre-pandemic mid-teens to what's now more than 30%, and as well as leveraging the full capacity of our assets with very little incremental capital. it isn't every day you more than double your off-premise business and add a couple of brands to your base. it only happens well with best-in-class systems to enable it and a strong team to execute it.
our team is critical to our success, and we take the current staffing environment very seriously. we've executed a full-court press to hire, train and retain our talent. while the challenges came fast and furious for all of us in march, i'm pleased with the progress we've made. there are still opportunities, but isolated to specific trade areas, and we're confident we'll get these staffing challenges resolved in the near future.
to further support our operators, we're rolling out a new service system with handheld devices that we've worked on for three years to perfect. it isn't as easy as some might claim it. to implement a system that operators can execute during high volume that saves labor and still delivers a great guest experience. ours is also putting more money in our team members' pockets, so they're staying with us longer, which is crucial in this environment.
it's in more than 250 restaurants now, and we anticipate full implementation by november. and finally, because we chose not to take price at chili's during fiscal '21, we have room to take some price this year as consumers return to work and income levels return to normal. we're evaluating how we'll address those opportunities, especially in channels like delivery while all while protecting our industry-leading value proposition. we spent last year learning to run a much more efficient and robust revenue-generating model.
we're spending this year and beyond capitalizing on the opportunities for growth that are not just available, but achievable for brinker. there's nobody who's doing this better than this team, and i'm honored to be part of their story. now i'll turn the call over to joe. joe?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
thanks, wyman, and good morning, everyone. let me continue our prepared comments by providing some additional insight to the fourth-quarter results released this morning and then share some limited thoughts on our current expectations of certain aspects of the overall fiscal-year plan. as wyman indicated, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to our fiscal-year 2021. for the fourth quarter, brinker reported total revenues of $1.009 billion, with a consolidated comp sales of 65%.
in keeping with our ongoing strategy, the majority of these sales were driven by traffic, up 53% for the quarter, a 10% beat versus the industry on a two-year basis. these sales translated into solid eps with fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.68. as noted in this morning's press release, the fourth quarter included an extra operating week, our 53rd week, which contributed approximately $70 million to total revenues, 90 basis points to restaurant operating margin and $0.34 to earnings per share. at the brand level, chili's comparable restaurant sales were positive 8.5% versus the fourth quarter of fiscal-year '19, which we believe is the more appropriate comparison for the quarter.
additionally, on an absolute dollar basis, the fourth quarter was chili's largest sales quarter on record, topping $900 million in total revenue. maggiano's, while down 18% compared to fourth quarter of fiscal '19, made very solid progress with its recovery curve and built positive momentum to carry into the current fiscal year. moving down the p&l. our fourth-quarter restaurant operating margin was 16.9%.
adjusting this performance for the impact of the 53rd week, the resulting 16% operating margin still represents a material year-over-year improvement and more importantly was a 110-basis-point margin improvement versus the pre-covid fourth quarter of fiscal '19. food and beverage expense for the fourth quarter as a percent of company sales was 20 basis points unfavorable as compared to prior year. this variance was driven -- primarily driven by increased commodity costs, particularly for chicken and pork products. labor expense for the quarter, again, as a percent of company sales was favorable 240 basis points versus prior year, primarily driven by the extra week sales leverage versus fixed labor expenses and the slower reopening pace in a couple of high wage states such as california.
during the quarter, our managers focused considerable efforts toward staffing our restaurants to support the solid demand for our brands. scale clearly matters in this area, as they were effectively supported by our experienced hr teams who help deploy hiring tools and events to assist in the process. given the more challenging hiring environment, the dynamic of hiring, training, and retaining team members resulted in an increase in labor inflation in the mid-single-digit range, a dynamic we expect to continue in the near term. to reward our operator's strong performance throughout the fiscal year, we also chose to further invest in our hourly team members and managers through a variety of incremental bonus structures, totaling approximately $4 million for the quarter beyond our normal payout formulas.
this incremental investment impacted quarterly eps by approximately $0.06 and increased labor expense margin by roughly 40 basis points, well worth the benefits it will accrue. restaurant expense was 830 basis points favorable year over year as we fully leveraged many of our fixed costs, particularly from the benefit of the additional week in the quarter. the continued positive operating performance did result in a meaningful increase in our quarterly tax rate, 15% for the quarter, which includes a catch-up adjustment to increase the annual income tax accrual. this increase negatively impacted fourth-quarter eps approximately $0.06.
our operating cash flow for the fourth quarter and fiscal year remained strong with $101 million and $370 million for those time frames, respectively. ebitda for the quarter totaled $144 million, bringing the fiscal-year ebitda total to $368 million. during the fourth quarter, we continued to use a significant portion of our cash flow to further reduce revolver borrowings. by year-end, our revolver balance was reduced to $171 million.
this decreased our total funded debt leverage to 2.5 times and our lease-adjusted leverage to 3.6 times at year end. speaking of the revolver, we have reached agreement on terms and conditions for a new revolving credit facility with our bank group. the new $800 million five-year revolver includes improved pricing allows the return of restricted payments and provides ample liquidity and flexibility to support our growth strategies. our board of directors has also reinstated the share repurchase authorization that was suspended in the early days of the pandemic with an authorization amount of $300 million.
now turning to our outlook for fiscal-year '22. at this point, with the volatility and unknowns of the current operating environment, we can only share some high-level thoughts for certain annual metrics. for example, we expect commodity and labor inflation percentages each in the mid-single digits with commodity inflation toward the lower end of the range. capex of $155 million to $165 million, an annual effective tax rate of 14% to 15%, and weighted annual share count of 45 million to 47 million shares.
as we now move ahead with fiscal 2022, the reality of the pandemic with all its uncertainties is still part of our everyday operations. that being said, all now four of our brands are well prepared and positioned to perform in whatever environment they face throughout the year. we are very proud of their efforts during the past fiscal year and are confident of the experiences, the growth, and the strength of their business models will continue to deliver quality results as we move forward from here. with my comments now complete, let's turn it back to kate to move on to questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question today is coming from david palmer at evercore isi. your line is live. you may begin.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks. i guess i'll get one out of the way. your quarter-to-date sales look pretty good, and i would think that would give you confidence. i'm wondering if you're seeing some weekly sales data or perhaps some regions that are giving you more pause with regard to the delta variant? and i have a quick follow-up on the labor line.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
david, wyman. yes, i mean, obviously, you saw the numbers. we had a really good quarter, especially at maggiano's, and we started the fiscal year in july, really pleased with how maggiano's is kind of moving forward and starting to see some of those pieces of the business come back that were most kind of impacted by the pandemic in banquets and catering. so some good progress through.
but as the delta variant has kind of picked up some steam here in the last few weeks, we have seen some softening. we're still above the f '19 kind of base. but with the uncertainty of the pandemic, we're just unsure, right? and i guess, from my perspective, i was probably a little optimistic last fall and was surprised by what happened in november and december. well, i don't think that's where we're headed.
we're just going to be a little more cautious as we work through this variant, with delta and see where it's at. there has been a little -- it tends to be a little more regional. again, the overall numbers are still positive, and we're comfortable our strategies are all working, so cease the external factors, primarily, i mean, that's the pandemic that we're just still not quite sure what's -- what the time line is going to be before this thing gets put back into a place where we're not seeing consumers having to react and potentially more regulation put on restaurants. right now, there's no distancing or in your -- but we're back in masks in some towns and so we're just being cautious.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
makes sense. and i just wanted to ask on labor costs, you have two parts. you have hours and wage inflation on any modeling. i'm trying to think about a way that we can perhaps model this for fiscal '22 based on how you gave a mid-single-digit type inflation.
your labor costs were up, mid-single digits in the quarter. you say that that's going to be roughly the case in fiscal '22. that's from just a wage inflation standpoint. the labor cost per restaurant was up 3% versus the pre-pandemic fiscal 4q 2019 per restaurant on a week-adjusted basis.
and i'm wondering, can we think about that? can we think about a sort of how much your labor cost per restaurant would be versus pre-pandemic as a way to perhaps model this into '22, assuming that sales are roughly equal on a multiyear basis to the type of momentum you had in that quarter? any help on that would be great?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes, david. i think that is a decent proxy. again, the top-line piece of the equation does matter when we look at the overall labor. so as you commented, keeping that consistent, i think i would expect kind of the labor dynamics to remain relatively consistent as we move forward from here.
you could get some variance if you get a top-line change that's not quite expected in the numbers, depending on where the consumer goes. we're seeing a little bit of what i would consider to be transitory costs in that, too, i mentioned that we made a decision in the fourth quarter, which i think was well deserved to create some incremental bonus structures. that was about a 40 basis points increase to that labor margin expense, as i mentioned in my script. but if i also look at some of the -- what i consider to be a little more transitory costs like, there is some incremental overhead that's being used in the system over time -- excuse me, overtime.
there's a little bit -- there is some incremental training. i mean one of the things that goes with the cycle we're in right now is a lot of new team members. and with that goes some training costs you want to have that to improve your productivity as you move forward. both of those two incremental pieces are roughly about a combined 60 basis points to that margin, too.
so i think those probably remain in place for some period of time. but i think as we get more balance back into the labor system as you improve the productivity through the training, you'll start to see some of those incremental pieces come out of the system, i would expect in the second half of the year. so with that additional detail, i think fourth quarter is not a bad proxy for the environment that we're going to be in here for the short run.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, dave.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from chris o'cull at stifel. your line is live. you may begin.
chris o'cull -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thanks. good morning. wyman, can you give some more details about what you've seen in the stores with the maggiano's italian classics. i'm just curious if you're seeing maybe sales lift similar to it's just wings? or is the margin structure similar? and maybe what makes it more complex for the restaurants to execute?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
sure, chris. i'll give you some. i'm going to be a little bit guarded just for competitive reasons. but -- so what's got us excited about maggiano's classics, it's first the quality of the product.
before we put the maggiano's brand on a virtual brand, we wanted to make sure that we could deliver against the standards, and we've done that. the team has done a great job developing a really great lineup. it is a little bit more complicated than just our wings product because it's got a little more breadth to the offering. and so we're making sure that as we bring it to the restaurants, we're training, we're setting up that part of the line, if you will, to support this business and not be detrimental to what we're doing in our dining rooms in chili's every day.
so that's what's got us excited. it's also -- it's a higher check average product and so we love the fact that we're -- this isn't -- it's just wings, it's more of a value brand, killer wings at stupid price is our tag line. so with maggiano's, we get a nice -- a much nicer -- a much bigger check average. so that's encouraging to us.
we like the way the consumers are accepting the product. the demand looks good, and we're executing at a high level. so all those things are positive for us. the thing that we love about these two virtual brands in conjunction is that they do work against different targets.
so the wings guest is not the same as the maggiano's italian classics guest for the most part. there's a -- and so that allows us also to see when the push comes for wings, it comes at a different day part, it tends to come on to weekends. it tends to come with game nights. maggiano's italian classics one of its busiest day parts is sunday.
it's more of a family offering. and so those are the things that have us excited about rolling this second virtual brand. we're not looking to have a huge portfolio of virtual brands, we're very limited. these two were probably going to be focused for a while.
we think they've got -- we've always said we weren't going to put a brand out there that didn't have at least $100 million worth of sales potential and we'll build from there. and we think both of these brands, obviously, wings has proven that. and we think maggiano's classics will build through the year as we roll this thing out over the next few quarters.
chris o'cull -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and joe, just one other question. could you give a little bit more color on what's driving the higher capex next year? and is that range a good run rate going forward? or are there some nonrecurring investments planned for '22?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
no. actually, i'll kind of go in reverse order. that is a good proxy, i think, for how we will look at capex going forward. we're first and foremost, again, from that strong cash generation going to invest aggressively back into the business.
i think we've talked on previous calls that what we really like about the transformation of the strategy is the organic growth story that it's starting to develop as we kind of move forward. one of the bigger deltas you see going into this next year is that pipeline of new restaurant development that is starting to take place. we obviously had a pause during the pandemic from a real estate standpoint. that's now back online very fully and very aggressively.
in fact, we're moving -- our pipeline now north of 20 restaurants. that's not for fiscal-year '22, those will start to really fall into place back half of this year and into the next year. the rest of the -- we're going to continue to reimage. there's a little bit more spend on the reimage side of the equation again.
some of this is pause versus run rate. so you're really getting that back to a level that we had seen pre-pandemic. but you also have the typical investment back into the r&m side of the equation and technology. again, we talked about the benefits we're going to continue to accrue from technology, tse was one wyman talked about.
so we're going to be pretty robust in continuing to invest at those levels. so those are the primary areas. and i think it is going to accrue to the organic growth story quite well as we move farther into this year and clearly, as we move into '23.
chris o'cull -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thanks, guys.

mr. long, your line is live.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
no nicole. no josh. no love from piper sandler. all right? moving on, kate.
kate, let's go to the next.
operator
your next question is coming from jon tower at wells fargo. your line is live.
jon tower -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. yes. first, on the pricing side of the equation.
wyman, it did sound like earlier in the call, you were alluding to more pricing at chili's in '22. any chance you can give us some sort of degree of magnitude perhaps across the different channels? it sounded as if you're leaning a little bit more on the delivery side, taking a bit of pricing there. and then a question for joe, specifically on the labor side or how we should think about these handhelds that i believe, wyman, you mentioned we're going to be in stores fully by november? how that's going to impact the p&l in terms of perhaps seeing better productivity? and then for labor hours moving a bit lower per store or perhaps an improvement in food waste? i'm just curious to hear your thoughts on how those handhelds might impact in-store ops.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
sure. let me -- i'll hit a little bit probably at a higher level and joe can give you more of the detail with regard to p&l impact. so i think from a pricing standpoint, obviously, we chose to take a different tack than many during the pandemic. we kind of held prices, and we wanted to just make sure that we were supporting consumers fully.
and that contributed greatly to our traffic improvement relative to the category of double digits throughout the whole pandemic. and we're maintaining that solid traffic position as we kind of sit today. and that's important to us, but we also realized with what we're seeing, obviously, with the inflation numbers that joe shared with you that we're going to need to take some price. and we're probably going to have to price a little more than, historically, we've said 1% to 2%.
we're going to probably go over that number this year. we're currently sitting what, joe, at one and a half?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
right.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
and we're targeting probably to be over two here and there before the second quarter. so i don't know how much more we'll need in the back half, but we do feel comfortable that we've got room to take it to that mid- to low two range in the near term, and then we'll evaluate kind of how these. again, it's a question everybody's got, right? is it structural? or is it transitory? and we just want to be cautious about how we deal with transitory costs, both with labor and with the commodities in building in pricing and wage -- just making pricing and wage decisions, you can't really back off. so that's how we're doing it.
some of that shows up in some of these programs joe talked about where we're more open to running maybe higher overtime or offering incentives to stay versus jumping on wage rates. so those are just some examples. with regard to the handheld devices, tse, as we call it, obviously, what it does is it allows the front-of-the-house servers to be more efficient and then we run a server-runner model. so right now, we don't -- we just run a straight server model.
and so this allows us to get servers to be more efficient. they can take more tables and then they use the technology to bring food out of the back and run the drinks with the runners. and that just -- it's a more efficient model. it's also a better model from a guest perspective.
we get better guest satisfaction scores. so that's why we've been working on it so diligently for three years. it's technology, though, so it has to be working on a friday night under high volumes with -- when you're counting on wifi and all this technology interface. and that's what we've just perfected really over the last year, and we're excited to finally get this thing rolled out companywide by november.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
and, jon, i'll just add to that, that, yes, there is -- there are benefits that will accrue from a productivity, from a labor management side of the equation. i do think you may see some other things. again, we expect to see benefits to gwap. i think you mentioned avt, some things of that.
and you can see that accrue at different points. now what we haven't done in any of the limited thoughts that i provided you at this point on '22, if i'm not assuming a big delta based on tse. as we get that out there in that november -- by november time frame and start to utilize it and develop it, and i think we'll give you more insight at that point as to how we're seeing those numbers. but i'm not making the upfront assumption that i'm going to get x amount of great benefit in my current environment from a labor perspective.
jon tower -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. thank you for your time.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yes.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from brett levy at mkm partners. your line is live. you may begin.
brett levy -- mkm partners -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. i guess just continuing on, on the labor side. one of the strengths you've had has been your refined operations over the last few years and the implementation of technology, but it sounds like you're reintroducing more items, whether it's the four brands across the system now, bringing this technology on board, just the on and the off-premise balance.
how should we think about where you are in terms of your staffing levels? what you still need to do to be able to add back either the labor hours or reacquire additional bodies? and what do you think all of this could translate into from a longer term on your overall restaurant-level margin?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
well, let me just talk a little bit about staffing, brett. so the staffing issue, it's a serious issue, right? i mean -- and it's an issue that we're all over because at the end of the day, it's about getting our teams, the resources they need to deliver great sales and a great guest experience without putting too much pressure on them. and the current environment, while things have gotten much better from where they were in march, there are still pockets out there where we don't have restaurants fully staffed. and so what that means is it puts a lot of pressure on the management.
it also is limiting some of our sales potential. and so our first priority right now is to just get everybody staffed up, get our management team stabilized and staffed and get that foundation strong. it's kind of a unique situation. i've been in the business for a long time, have never quite experienced situation where we've got so many people unemployed and still such a challenge to find people to come and take really good jobs that we provide for the industry.
so we're seeing progress, though, and we're making headway, but we still have some pockets where that's a challenge. and so with that, i kind of leave it to joe to answer the kind of the --
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. brett, i think, again, i'm not seeing anything that is changing any of our thought processes around the long-term strategies and long-term opportunities from a margin stand. those are all very much still intact. again, as we've talked in the past, and we'll continue to talk going forward, i mean we think margin opportunity, first and foremost, is going to emanate from our ability to drive top-line sales.
in the very short term, we're just trying to get a better feel for what that short-term dynamic is before i talk more specifically about things. but i still am very comfortable and confident in our ability to move margins wider as we kind of move forward with the strategy. the virtual brands, obviously, contribute meaningfully to that, but we are going to continue to grow the base to chili's. and then we've already talked about the great improvements that maggiano's making in their business model.
so that will accrue to the benefit of margins as we go forward. again, i think the short-term dynamics of what labor and the commodity markets are ones we can deal with on an ongoing basis. we did not price last year. we're now bringing that level back into play.
and when i think about the typical 1.5% to 2% pricing dynamic that we've talked about is kind of our strategic benchmarks. so i think that is at a level that allows us to manage both of those issues as we move forward. at any given period of time, you may see us delta off of those two, but clearly, price will be a big piece of the equation as we move back into, i think, that more normalized post-pandemic operations.
brett levy -- mkm partners -- analyst
and then just one quick follow-up on the pricing. how are you thinking about that from a qualitative and a quantitative basis? how much of that is going to be internal just based on what you see in your model and what you need versus analytics across the landscape and what you're seeing from the competitive set?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
i think first and foremost, we look at on the need state side of the equation. the value positioning of both of our brands is an important dynamic, and we want to continue to maintain that. we're very aware of what's going on in the industry, and you're seeing some fairly aggressive moves on pricing. but i always go back to the strategy drives traffic.
and this is a -- particularly a sector that has seen negative traffic trends really for a long period of time now. and that's not something that we want to fall into. so we're going to be very focused on our ability to continue to drive traffic and how price may or may not intersect with that thought process. we've kept pricing power intact, and we will use pricing power, particularly as we go through this fiscal year.
i think there is an ability to price and a permission in the short run to price. but you got to be careful about over time, getting out ahead of the consumer and changing the value dynamics of your brands. so we're -- so if i -- we lean very heavily in that equation, you just talked to the internal value perception and how we think about the need state of the longer-term strategy. thanks, brett.

thank you. our next question today is coming from brian mullan at deutsche bank. your line is live. you may begin.
brian mullan -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok. thank you. just a question on it's just wings. you've spoken before about the takeout opportunity related to that.
you've spoken about you need to generate awareness outside the delivery channel. so can you just talk about how you plan to do that going forward? and specifically, should we be thinking about any increased advertising budget here? and is this an initiative you plan to lean into in fiscal '22? or is it a little bit further out on that front?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
brian, wyman. yes. no. we're -- it's taken us frankly a little longer than i would have thought to just get the infrastructure up and running to support this aspect of that virtual brand, but it's up now.
it's just recently been put up, as i mentioned. the website is up. you can go to ijw.com, and you can order wings to go or you can order them through delivery also on our website. so now it's just about how do we get some awareness of that brand.
and so we will spend behind it. but again, it's a very efficient spend, a very targeted spend. we know who this target is. there's a lot of online opportunities.
there's a lot of -- so it's not like you're going to see national television advertising around the ijw brand. but we will spend some time and energy here in the next quarter or two, really seeing how much awareness we can create and how much business we can drive. so you've got two ways now between google and the website to find the brand for a takeout opportunity. and so now we're going to continue to build that.
more on that probably in the next couple of calls we'll keep you posted on how we're seeing that initiative kind of build.
brian mullan -- deutsche bank -- analyst
and then just as a follow-up. i saw the board reinstated the share repurchase program. it's encouraging to see. joe, could you just speak to your philosophy there opportunistic repurchase versus perhaps more programmatic repurchase? and the share count range you've provided with the guidance is somewhat wide.
can you just confirm does that just have to do with the pace of buybacks, which is maybe unknown at this point?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. i think that's an accurate way to think about it. again, we appreciate the support and the bullish statement, i think that the board is making on how they're viewing the business with the reinstatement of that program. again, we're going to first and foremost use our cash to invest in the business.
you're seeing that that heightened level of capex, which i think will be maintained. we're going to continue to delever on a metric basis. i would anticipate getting down into the lower threes we finished at three, six. we're going to continue to pay debt down and grow the business.
it will allow that metric to continue to move lower as we go forward, but we generated a lot of cash. and at that point, there's still cash that we now have the ability to return to shareholders. i like to be both opportunistic and programmatic at the same time. so we do generate cash on an ongoing basis.
and depending on where we are in any of those other given programs, we'll deploy it. i would expect that to be over the course of the fiscal year. we have not been into the market, obviously, yet, but that will be coming down the road. that was guidance does incorporate some thinking about what might go on in this fiscal year.
brian mullan -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thank you.

thank you. our next question today is coming from nicole miller regan at piper sandler. your line is live. you may begin.
nicole miller regan -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. we're here. i promise. sorry about earlier.
great update. two quick ones on our side from us. the first is on the store level margin, where the commentary so far is very helpful. i was very curious on it's just wings impact on the p&l, specifically, obviously, store-level margin.
i'm thinking there, its contribution there, is it something you can call out? and then wing prices have been sky high, i think, moderating a bit. so maybe you could net out the transitory nature of that too, and we could start to understand that for modeling purposes for next year as well? thanks.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes, nicole. i'm going to defer on several of those. we haven't broken out a lot of the dynamics in a specific level. it is definitely a positive contribution to that store-level margin.
again, we look at an allocated p&l for the virtual brands. and i think we've talked about before that it generally is north of 30%. a lot depends on what you're doing in any given time period from a marketing standpoint because, again, i want to fully allocate the cost as we can, but they do lever the store p&l, which is, again, that nice piece of the volume increases that you see coming out of the virtual side of the equation. we've noticed a little elevated price on the wing side of the equation.
and we've had to make some adjustments in our cost dynamics on wings. but we've obviously maintained supply and ability to keep that product in front of the consumer. just a great job by our supply chain team and a very unique in that times trying environment for them. so they are elevated.
i think at some point, you will see that dynamic shift and that will accrue to the benefit of that brand. at the -- i would anticipate, nicole, a fairly robust discussion around virtual brands at the analyst day in the not too -- so hopefully, i'm going to defer some of the specifics to then, but more insights to come.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yes. the only thing i'd add, nicole, is obviously because of the incrementality, the high incrementality of those sales to our business, the flow-through, and the profitability are impressive and important.
nicole miller regan -- piper sandler -- analyst
and then just on maggiano's. i mean you kind of clued us in to be realistic, if not cautious, but i would be curious just what kind of behavior you expect for the upcoming holiday season? and do you have any indications yet of requests for private dining or parties are catering or anything of that nature?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
well, as you can see in the information we shared in the release, the movement from just fourth quarter to july was impressive at maggiano's. and so as we were working as a country out of covid and people are starting to feel comfortable again about socializing, we saw the part of the business that was really being curtailed the most, which was their banquet business and their catering business start to come back, and it's ahead of schedule from our perspective. it's mostly social. so the business side of the equation hasn't come back as much yet.
but obviously, you can see they're running again above the '19 numbers in july. so those are all very positive things. what that portends for the holiday season? i mean, i wish i could tell you, nicole, we're optimistic. but we're also being cautious both because, again, the pandemic isn't quite totally put to bed with this whole delta variant and we're not exactly sure what that -- what the status will be.
i think if we get some clear road prior to the holiday season from a pandemic standpoint, we'll see a pretty robust banquet business in the holiday season. we know consumers want to gather. we know they're ready to celebrate together and eat together. and if there's permission to do that in a comfort -- a level of comfort around that, then i think we're going to see a good season.
but we're all just kind of waiting to see.
nicole miller regan -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president

thank you. our next question today is coming from andrew strelzik at bmo. your line is live. you may begin.
andrew strelzik -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hey. good morning. thanks for taking the questions. i was hoping, first, you could do a little bit more comparing and contrasting between what you're seeing or expecting at maggiano's italian classics and it's just wings.
you mentioned the check, the occasion, anything else that we should be mindful of as we think about that rollout? and if you can comment on the margins of the flow-through compared to it's just wings that would be helpful as well?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
i mean we're not going to get too specific, andrew. i mean i think i've given you most of the color, i'll probably give you on how the brand plays. the biggest difference, i think, is just what we've talked about in terms of rollout. i mean we were comfortable enough to roll -- because of what was happening primarily in the dining rooms with a lot of constraints we felt we could focus on rolling out the wings brand overnight to 1,000 restaurants.
well, obviously, our dining rooms are busy again, and we've got a lot of things going on in the restaurants with some initiatives like tse that we've talked about that are requiring us to support our restaurants on a more kind of moderated basis as we roll this brand. so it's not going to hit like wings hit. it's going to be rolled out throughout the year. but our energy and our excitement about the brand are comparable, i would say.
we like both of these brands a lot. we think they -- there are -- it's manageable, first of all, within our system to really leverage these assets and drive continued growth within the assets that we have, and it delivers a great guest experience. the return rate on it's just wings is exceptional based on the information we get from doordash. so once we get trial, we get really good repeat.
and i think we'll see the same thing with the maggiano's classics. so again, we're just focused on getting it into the restaurants in a way that our operators can execute it and then building these brands over the next really years to come.
andrew strelzik -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and i wanted to also ask on the food cost side. and i apologize if i missed this, but how much visibility do you have from contracting to the inflation outlook that you gave on the food cost side? is there anything that we should be mindful of from a cadence perspective? and just from suppliers, your conversations with suppliers, what's kind of the tone and kind of the expectation about sustainability? i know it's a tough one to call, but just any insights you could provide there would be really helpful.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yes. again, we have a good contract positioning is really most of contracting running the rest of this calendar year, some of it runs into the first quarter of next calendar year, so the back half of our fiscal year. we see a higher level and actually a significantly higher level of our inflation beliefs is built into the back half of this -- of our fiscal year due to that contracting. so again, good contracts in place, we've had at times during the last quarter discussions with some of our partners on where contract levels are and volumes, price, and things of that nature.
we've adjusted a couple in conjunction with them on the chicken side of the equation. i think that's gotten the highest level of dialogue around the industry and that those issues have been real. we've managed through them through those kinds of adjustments. but again, we're comfortable with the inflation that we have built into our thought process here that i talked about, and it is a more back half of the year thought process.
andrew strelzik -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president

thank you. our next question today is coming from jeff farmer at gordon haskett. your line is live. you may begin.
jeff farmer -- gordon haskett -- analyst
thank you. we've discussed a lot of p&l lines this morning, and i was just hoping to get a little bit more context color on the g&a line. so specifically, will 2022 be an incentive compensation reset year? and will there be any other factors that could potentially push that g&a number well above or just above the 2021 number?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
no, jeff. i think it's going to be a relatively consistent year in that regard. again, we build our beliefs around g&a based on hitting targets and things of that nature. so i think we accommodate the incentive compensation pretty well.
i always like to have an upside to g&a from an incentive standpoint if that works. i think you'll see from a dollar basis, you're probably up in the $8 million to $12 million range, i think, in that range. but as a percent of sales, i want to -- i would assume you could model relatively close to 4%, low 4s, let's say, 4% to 4.2%, and be right in line with our thinking on that specific line item.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
and most of that, jeff, is really --
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
-- our way down the p&l as we go on our --
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
i just -- and on the g&a front, some of that -- the bulk of that is really instituting some programs that we had to restrict as we got into covid, right? and so it's putting those that's getting a little more travel now as people are getting back out and moving around. so pretty much in line with our history in terms of how we run a very very efficient restaurant company.
jeff farmer -- gordon haskett -- analyst
that's helpful. and just one more unrelated on the off-premise mix. i believe you said chili's was, i think, the quote was more than 30%. so question is what the more precise percentage is for chili's off-premise? and then your updated thoughts on where you think that that chili's off-premise mix will settle as we get further sort of past covid or we move past covid?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes, jeff. it is staying very consistently in, let's say, that 33% to 35% range throughout the quarter. and i think as we -- so we've seen more and more and more evidence as we've kind of gone through the last year based on recovery curves that, that, let's say, the 32% to 35% range is going to be the sweet spot going forward.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yes. the only thing that's still out there, jeff, and we'll keep you posted as we learn, but there's still a lot of concern about covid with consumers. and i think there are still some consumers that are preferring take out to dine in still. and as -- because our take-out business is really the thing that surprised us.
the strength that takeout has been the biggest surprises. dining rooms have opened, we thought maybe more people would move back into the dining room, and we haven't seen quite as much. so that could take a little while for everybody to get kind of back to, hey, i'm not going to restrict my preferred choice by an outside influence like a covid.
jeff farmer -- gordon haskett -- analyst
all right. thank you.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yes.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from brian vaccaro at raymond james. your line is live. you may begin.
brian vaccaro -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks, and good morning. i just wanted to start with clarifying two items on your comments during the q&a. so first on commodities, just to make sure i heard correctly, you expect the second half to be significantly higher than the first half. so we might be only talking about slightly inflationary in the first half and then maybe high singles in the second half.
did i hear that correctly, joe?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
i didn't give you specific high singles or that. i think we have more inflation built in to the second half of the year. that's based on the contract structures we have out there. there's obviously some inflation that will work its way into the first half of the year.
a lot of those are spot market-driven items. you think about produce, avocados, things of that nature, you'll probably see some inflation in that regard. you may see some inflation on the ground beef side of the equation. but our beliefs around inflation based on current markets that we're looking at and the timing of contracts lead us down a path of more inflation in the second half of the year.
now markets can change, and we'll update you as we kind of move through and get closer to some of those time frames.
brian vaccaro -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then on the off-premise sales mix, you were talking about kind of that 33%, 35% range. so that's the -- do you have the tight number for the fiscal fourth quarter? and where was quarter to date? is it also in that 30% to 33% range at chili's?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
at chili's, for the fourth quarter, we were 36% to 37% range, a little bit above that fourth quarter. we don't have a year -- i don't have a quarter-to-date. it's probably -- i'm pretty comfortable it's going to be consistent with that. you're not going to have maybe a slight downward variance from that.
brian vaccaro -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. and within that, thinking about third-party delivery versus takeout, what kind of changes are you seeing within the mix of your off-premise mix as you've moved through has it shifted? i think it was 60-40 prior? have you seen much shift in the two channels?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
no. i think -- again, i think we're seeing a pretty consistent flow of those channels in the business right now.
brian vaccaro -- raymond james -- analyst
ok. great. great. and then i guess my question, i wanted to just circle back on labor, if we could.
could you just give a little more color on the restaffing progress that you've made in recent months? perhaps you can level set where -- i know it's isolated, but maybe level set just where current staffing levels are on average versus '19 or perhaps versus some targeted level at recent sales volumes that you're working toward?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yes. i mean, in general, when you look at the overall number of team members we have, brian, we're at staffing levels that are equivalent to pre-pandemic. now that every restaurant probably could use another body or two, but that's not unusual for the restaurant industry. you could always use another cook or another server in most restaurants on any given even day.
so that's not a real issue. the real issue is more where you're down several, primarily especially in the heart of the house. so what we've seen is especially in the one thing we have seen as some of the stimulus is kind of abated. we've seen front of the house, so servers become more available, not as big an issue for us with front of the house, heart of the house is still a little bit more challenged in those areas.
again, this isn't a nationwide issue. but in those pockets where we're more challenged with staffing, those are the bigger issues. it's getting the kitchen staff is the biggest challenge. and again, we're making good progress, but we've still got a little ways to go.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
and again, i would add to that, brian, i think it's important from our perspective is that's opportunity for us.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yes.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
again, as we bring more stability to those pocketed areas, you're going to see some capacity opportunities too. so we look at it as upside from where we go from here.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yes. our sales were absolutely impacted in the quarter because we weren't at full staffing capacity capabilities. and so as we get fully staffed, which we anticipate doing soon, that's opportunity, as joe said. good.
kate? thanks, brian. kate?
operator
our next question today is coming from john glass at morgan stanley. your line is live. you may begin.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks, and good morning. and can you just talk a little bit about where you stand on the reimaging for chili's? i know probably last year or this past fiscal year, it slowed down. where are you in the estate? and if you think about remodeling going forward, have the plans changed? you've got virtual brands now versus two years ago, you didn't. you've got a bigger off-premise business, so are you thinking about how and how much and how you spend on remodeling differently now?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
good morning, john. we're back full bore on the reimage side of the equation. right now, we're actually focused very heavily in the midwest, which was the acquisition we did two years. those probably are in most cases getting fuller reimages because they had not necessarily been reimaged at the same level and pace that we had done the brand.
so a little more higher spend and intensity there on those reimages and you get a nice incremental lift out of that, too, when you do a full reimage. we probably still have a couple of years to go, two and a half years or so, on the reimage program. over time, when i think about the base reimages outside of those acquired restaurants, that spend has come down as we've kind of perfected our thinking and understood where the bang for the buck really was. so you've seen a decrease in the individual spend on any given restaurant.
but we're also looking very specifically a lot of opportunities within the restaurant base where can i do a more fulsome bar reimage for instance, and things of that nature that can really help increase volumes with any one given restaurant. so we have the general program and approach, but we're also trying to be very systematic and looking at great opportunities on individual restaurant basis. but that's a program that's going to continue for the next couple of years as we kind of move through that process.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
one thing we have done, john, this is wyman. i think we've gotten really good at it. as we remodel thinking about future r&m expense. and how do we take these reimage investment dollars and help offset future r&m costs that we experienced.
so two examples. one is the new awnings that we're putting on at chili's, they're metal. we're not going to be dealing with faded painted awnings that become a challenge on a cycle and show up in your r&m expense. we are also excited about maggiano's reimage program that will kick off here pretty soon.
and a lot of the dollars that go into that reimage are going to make the building and the experience much better, but they're also going to take out some of the things that really drive up the cost to maintain that restaurant. so changing finishes out, changing some of the products out that need to be changed out, but changing amount with a product that's a lot easier to maintain. and so those are some of the things we're doing as we kind of keep moving through and refreshing and keeping the brands relevant through time.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
john, from an off-premise standpoint, we haven't had to change our thinking too much within the reimage process based on that dynamic. we have brought, as we've talked in previous calls before a new off-premise system on how we move actually the food from line out to the cars into play. it's production capabilities in shelving and the technology that we're now using to manage the parking lot that helps in that. but we haven't had to make a lot of structural physical changes to make that happen.
our new restaurant design, we have adjusted very slightly to increase the ability -- the size and the ability to flow food through that side door. we just opened a brand-new restaurant here in dallas just a week or so ago. i was in there last week. and that dynamic really works well and looks great and how you help off-premise.
so we're incorporating it where we can, but the systems we're putting in place to support that, that line of business are probably more important in the physical space changes.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
so at chili's, obviously, there was a different lap than in prior quarters. dining rooms were opened, so you've probably got some higher alcohol sales. is there anything else in mix that's notable? consumers are buying premium products, for example. should we think about this kind of mix dynamic playing out similarly over the next couple of quarters as you cycle the negative mix from a year ago?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yes. i think the biggest one, john, is just alcohol sales. as dining rooms are open, the biggest thing we've seen is just alcohol sales, and that's always been the case, right? first, you can't sell it in a lot of places. and secondly, beverage sales in general is what you pick up the biggest incremental mix benefit of getting dining rooms up and running and that's what helps the check average the most.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. thank you.

thank you. our next question today is coming from john ivankoe at jpmorgan. your line is live. you may begin.
john ivankoe -- jjpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
hey, guys. how are you? happy national fajita day. i just got a notification from you.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
you have noticed that. there you go.
john ivankoe -- jjpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
thank you. literally it came in during the conference call. so the question is on other opex. normally, that's a line item that has a lot of fixed costs, including marketing, which is -- i know it's a percentage of sales, which is normally relatively steady.
but fiscal '21 presumably was not a run rate year, things like advertising, repair and maintenance, maybe insurance and some other cost items that came out through at least the first half of the year. so the question is, i mean, how do you think about that cost category as a percentage of sales, especially as your comps improve? and obviously, i understand there's probably a lot of benefit in the fourth quarter from the 14th week in that line as well. so i just want to make sure that we're all on the same page for that cost category.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes, john, again, i think we'll continue to maintain the marketing strategy that we deployed really going on two years -- two and a half years now. so we're comfortable that we have enough marketing firepower built into the other opex. as i think you know, we really think about marketing in a different mindset now where a lot of quote your marketing expense is going to show up in your net comp line as we use that digital capability and that one-to-one contact with our loyalty guests to drive traffic also. it continues -- there's a leverageability opportunity.
again, when we think about margins and think about top-line growth, that restaurant expense, other opex, as you've referred to it, is going to be a point of leverage because it does contain a lot of fixed costs within it. so i think there is a year-over-year opportunity to expand margins generally, but specifically in that category too.
john ivankoe -- jjpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
that's great. thank you.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer

thank you. our final question today is coming from jeffrey bernstein at barclays. your line is live. you may begin.
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you very much. just two questions. the first one on the unit growth following up from the comments earlier.
joe, i think you mentioned opening 20 plus per year. i think you said starting in the back half of this coming year. so i just want to make sure i understand that correctly that, that is kind of your run rate assumption for the next few years would be 20 units plus? and maybe if you can share any color in terms of whether by brand or u.s. versus international, how we should think about this acceleration in unit growth to the north of 20 that you mentioned earlier?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. and again, the comments there relate to the chili's domestic side of the equation. we have a pipeline already that's starting to push north of 20. i would expect based on timing of construction and actual opening that you'll probably see somewhere in the six to eight, maybe push toward nine in this fiscal year because of the pause in real estate and construction that's also probably going to be more of those in the back half of the year.
so not as big of an impact in '22, but the pipeline then moves very quickly up toward that high teens 20 -- low 20s. so you'll start to see that in '23 really come to realization. and our intent is to continue to maintain and build that pipeline in that, let's say, 20 to 25 range as we kind of go forward from here. so again, some nice organic growth and will start flowing back into the system.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
it really was made possible, jeff, as we made the acquisition of the midwest restaurants and as we look at opportunities in these areas where franchisees just haven't developed as rapidly as we have. it just opens up additional real estate opportunities for us that we're excited about getting into. and as we've now started to open some of those restaurants in these markets. we're really pleasantly surprised by the reception the brand is getting and we're excited about getting more restaurants open, not only in texas where we have quite a few, but in other parts of the country.
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays -- analyst
and, wyman, that's a great segue. i feel like you were beating all of us in your prepared remarks when you talked a couple of times about being much more convinced and sold on the company-operated model. just wondering whether you could provide any color behind that? i mean you mentioned there are some scale benefits when you go through issues like we've gone through. is there any thought in terms of whether it's going to be buying in existing u.s.
franchisees? i'm wondering whether there's right of first refusal opportunities. i know you currently have like a 15% plus mix of franchising. but that, coupled with your commentary around maybe wanting to accelerate growth where franchisees might not want to. just wondering what your thoughts are in terms of that franchise mix u.s., i guess, or international?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
well, i mean, jeff, i think just looking at our history, you can see, obviously, we believe in the company-owned model. we've got the majority of our u.s. restaurants are company-owned. we have a couple of good franchise partners still out there.
and we're obviously having conversations with them about what's their future look like. and are they -- how excited are they about growing the brand and staying connected with all of the things we're doing, that's my commentary on ownership really has to do with these investments we make in getting the scale leverage beyond the supply chain, because obviously, you can do that in a franchise system. but really across everything across technology, across the position of the brand, across the operating systems. we're moving at a rapid pace.
you start to do virtual brands and keeping everything in sync in a restaurant is hard to do even with good franchise partners. i mean there's a lot of moving parts to a casual dining restaurant. and so we do believe in that. we're going to continue to look for opportunities, and we'll have these conversations, and we're excited about the potential.

operator
good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the brinker international q1 f '22 earnings call. [operator instructions] it is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, mika ware, vice president of financial and investor relations. sir, the floor is yours.
mika ware -- vice president, financial and investor relations
thank you, kate and good morning, everyone. with me on today's call are wyman roberts, chief executive officer and president; and joe taylor, our chief financial officer. as many of you know, we pre-released limited results for the first quarter, ahead of our investor day hosted here in dallas on october 20. we released full results for the quarter earlier this morning, which are available on our website at brinker.com.
since we have recently shared details regarding the first quarter, wyman and joe will make prepared comments related to our operating performance and then we will open the call and jump straight to your questions. before beginning our comments, it is my job to remind everyone of our safe harbor regarding forward-looking statements. during our call, management may discuss certain items which are not based entirely on historical facts. any such items should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
all such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated. such risks and uncertainties include factors more completely described in this morning's press release and the company's filings with the sec. and of course, on the call, we may refer to certain non-gaap financial measures that management uses in its review of the business and believes will provide insight into the company's ongoing operations. and with that said, i will turn the call over to wyman. 
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
ok. thanks, mika. it's good to be back with you all again. it was great seeing some of you in dallas and many of you virtually during our investor day a couple of weeks ago.
thank you for making time to get an in-depth look into our business. what you should have taken away from that was this, we're very optimistic about where the business is going. we're managing for long-term success and we're confident in the strength of our brands and the levers we have yet to pull to continue to grow the business. from a top-line perspective, we're sitting in a good spot.
sales numbers are solid and traffic numbers are extremely good. our near-term challenge is not creating demand but rather it's working through the latest pandemic-driven staffing and supply chain issues that are impacting our cost structure. as you know, there are -- these are the same challenges impacting the industry as well as much as the economy. but after 40 years in this business, i'll take managing costs over searching for sales and traffic any day.
those are good problems to solve because they're largely within our control. our operators are working extremely hard every day to train our new team members, deliver great guest experiences and tying up the middle of the p&l. we've taken some additional price during the quarter to help offset our structural labor and cost of sales increases. as i mentioned during investor day, we're not going to price to buy a quarter.
but as we closely monitor the issues, we've layered in incremental pricing to offset what we believe are the structural labor and cost of sales increases. and joe will give you more detail on that. moving forward, if we discover that what we thought was transitory, it turns out to be more structural, we'll deal with that from a pricing perspective with a disciplined approach that protects our traffic performance and keeps our brands strong. we know we have pricing power if we need it, particularly in the delivery in virtual brand channels and we're committed to maintaining our margins and our business model.
and that's what we wanted you to hear. we're also working hard to remove transitory costs from the system with full recognition that the headwinds are notable and persistent, especially around labor. and while it takes some time, we're confident with the progress we're making and we will significantly reduce these costs by the back half of the year. the spike in turnover we experienced during the quarter created short-term pressure on the business as we trained our new team members to run our systems.
the good news is we are quickly building staff and have as many team members now as we did pre-covid, though there are markets that are still not fully staffed, which is limiting their capacity. this is particularly true in the midwest, where it's taking longer to reach these optimum levels. the impact of these staffing challenges cost us 3% to 4% in first quarter in sales, which we view as upside as we -- as we get those restaurants staffed and trained over the coming months. our top talent is engaged in these markets to solve these issues as quickly as possible.
meanwhile, the base business is strong, especially where dining rooms are fully open. when we look at the totality of the business, chili's is running positive sales and traffic and maintaining a sizable traffic gap to the industry, most recently at 9% on a two-year look as measured by naftrack. and we've got sales leverage around virtual brands and deliveries that we're holding in reserve until our operations teams are stabilized and fully trained. and while the last quarter was more challenging than we expected, we're making great progress and my expectation is we will end the year strong.
and as we shared with you during investor day, we've got exciting initiatives and innovation we're working on and we're confident in our future growth opportunities. now, i'll turn the call over to joe to share more insight into the quarter and guidance for the year. joe?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
thanks, wyman, and good morning, everyone. let me continue our prepared comments by providing some additional insight to the first quarter results and then share some guidance on our current expectations for the balance of fiscal year 2022. during first quarter, top-line sales performed well and outpaced pre-covid levels by a very respectable amount despite covid-related constraints. for the first quarter, brinker reported total revenues of $860 million with consolidated comp sales of 17%.
keeping with our ongoing strategy, the majority of these sales were driven by traffic up 11% for the quarter, a 9% beat versus the industry on a two year look. the top-line increase resulted in an adjusted earnings per share of $0.34, up from $0.28 in the previous fiscal year. it will come as no surprise, our most significant challenge during the quarter came in the form of industrywide headwinds from both commodity costs and labor-related spend, which negatively impacted our margins and bottom-line flow through. we experienced commodity inflation in the mid-single-digit range, with significant price from pork and chicken driving the increase.
as wyman mentioned, with a greater-than-normal influx of new team members, we experienced outsized costs in training and overtime. we do consider the portion of these costs above our normal operating levels to be transitory, approximately 130 basis points in the quarter, 60 of which are incremental training and overtime costs. i anticipate these costs working their way out of the system over the course of the next couple of quarters. in the near term, i expect a significant portion of these transitory costs to remain in the system for the second quarter.
we are taking thoughtful incremental price increases to help offset these higher costs. our third price action of this fiscal year is scheduled with our next chili's menu update in two weeks. following this increase, chili's will be carrying a total of 3% of incremental price compared to last year. of course, the mid-quarter price action will not fully impact the total price reported for the quarter.
due to the timing of price actions and the fact that maggiano's will evaluate its menu pricing after the holiday season, we expect the second quarter blended brinker price to be closer to 2%. our cash flow for the first quarter remained strong, with cash from operating activities of $40 million and ebitda of $69 million. when compared to first quarter last year, our strength in operating performance and lower level of outstanding debt have combined to improve our balance sheet and leverage position. our total funded debt leverage was 2.6 times and our lease-adjusted leverage ended the quarter at 3.7 times.
as indicated during our recent investor day, we are targeting to move these leverage ratios below two times and three times respectively over the course of the next two years. now, turning to our outlook for fiscal year '22. we provided some guidance metrics for certain items during our last call and we are reiterating those levels as of this report. in addition, this morning's press release included incremental guidance for both brinker's annual revenues and annual adjusted earnings per share.
specifically, annual revenues between $3.75 billion and $3.85 billion and annual adjusted earnings per share between $3.50 and $3.80. this incorporates our current view of the casual dining operating environment, which assumes continuing challenges in the near term, especially related to supply chain and labor issues. this guidance, both reiterated and new, assumes no additional meaningful top-line covid-related disruptions. while guidance is for our fiscal year performance, i can provide some directional thoughts related to the second quarter.
with the exception of banquet sales at maggiano's, we expect sales to exhibit closer to normal holiday seasonality, although impacted by labor shortage constraints in certain markets. as mentioned earlier in my comments, restaurant operating margins for the second quarter will again be impacted by higher food and beverage and labor costs. we do expect restaurant operating margin to improve when compared to both the recently completed first quarter as well as the second quarter of last year, ending the quarter at a level comparable to the pre-covid second quarter of fiscal year '20. clearly, these are unique times for our industry, creating a variety of short-term challenges to work through.
challenges we can and will solve. we firmly believe our strategic initiatives focused on driving traffic in organic top-line growth will differentiate our performance over time with the overall benefit to our team members, our guests, and importantly, our shareholders. with my comments now complete, let's turn it back to kate and move on to any questions.

operator
[operator instructions] our first question today is coming from nicole miller at piper sandler. your line is live. you may begin.
nicole miller -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. good morning. two quick questions. i want to start with the big picture on labor and i appreciate the update there.
i was listening to one of the rideshare apps have reported earlier this week as well. and they talked about as the stimulus is easing off. they're seeing more employees come back into the driving pool. and i'm wondering if that suggests to you that restaurant workers are going somewhere else or that you too are sharing in that labor pool coming back to work?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
hey, nicole. it's wyman. yes, great question. we absolutely are seeing better response to recruiting back into the restaurant.
as a matter of fact, as i mentioned, we're back to pre-pandemic levels of staffing in the system. we've got these hotspots still, but we've been averaging about 1,000 new team members a week over the last month. so we're absolutely having some better success than we had earlier in the quarter at recruiting and having applicants show up at the restaurants and join the team. and now we're in that process of just getting them trained up and proficient at the work.
nicole miller -- piper sandler -- analyst
and just a second and last question, i think we all understand the price now, how it's being dictated, how and when it will flow through. but remind us of how you get there. how much of it is an algorithm or third-party science combined with the art of your experience as an operator?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
again, a really good question. we are a little bit more deliberate around pricing and making sure as best we can. there's no guarantee when you take a price that you'll understand the full impact across all of your guests. but especially when we start to price in what we would consider our value propositions and where there may be some more value-sensitive guests to get a look at it and to get a response.
and whether that we use multiple ways of testing that out, if you will, some of them in market, some of them through research to just understand the sensitivity to this pricing. the good news is the pricing that we're taking has been tested both from a consumer perspective conceptually, but also in market. and we're feeling really good about the responses and the strength of the value propositions post price and that gives us a lot of confidence that we can continue the traffic momentum that we have post the price increase that joe had mentioned is coming here in the next couple of days.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah, nicole and i would add to the equation as we broadened into multichannels, i mean, again, when you think about pricing experiences where we're typically taking a broad-based menu-oriented price, there was probably a lot more clarity around realizing that price. so it's one thing to take a price action. the more important thing is to realize as much as you can of that price action. and there's probably some greater sensitivities when you start thinking about price in different channels or geared toward specific products, where consumers can move within channels or they can move from one product to another more readily.
so we want to make sure that there's as much certainty around realizing the price as there is to picking the amount of price we're going to do at any one period of time.
nicole miller -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks again for the update. thanks for taking my question.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
thanks, nicole.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from jared garber at goldman sachs. your line is live. you may begin.
unknown speaker
hi. this is michael on for jared. just a couple of quick ones for me. first, in terms of cogs for this year, definitely going to be elevated.
you touched on that definitely in the next quarter. how should we expect that to kind of progress throughout the rest of the fiscal year and then kind of into the start of '23 as we think about some of your long-term guidance you gave a couple of weeks ago? thanks.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. our expectation is obviously we're going to see an increase in cogs costs and impact of the cogs margin versus the sales level. we were in that kind of three and a half to 4% inflation range for the first quarter. and that's going to move up into the higher single digits as we progress into the second half of the year.
i think we've been talking about this year, we've been pretty clear that we expected more cogs inflation to hit the system in the second half as you roll through some of the contracts we have in place. and we're very comfortable that is still the situation. the guidance we have provided you incorporates all that. so our line of sight to the -- our expectations around food and beverage costs i think is pretty tight right now.
we are seeing, again, some markets at extremely high levels compared to historical norms, pork, in particular, chicken being the other one. we are anticipating high levels, but there's also probably some opportunity as those markets may normalize. the question is the timing around when they do normalize over the course of the next year. but again, i'm feeling good about what we have embedded from a cost of sales perspective into our cogs around the fiscal year.
unknown speaker
thanks. appreciate that. and then another quick one. in terms of comps dynamic within the current quarter, what are you guys seeing in terms of versus the number you gave quarter to date, mainly chili's and maggiano's as well, at your investor day and then the update you gave today, maybe a little bit of acceleration there.
what drove that? and how you expect that to continue to change especially on a traffic basis? thanks.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yeah, jared. i hate to be talking about week-to-week traffic and sales changes but because we did give you two data points, there's really not much in that. we see the business pretty stable. there's been some shifts based on some holiday timing and it has probably a little bit more to do with what happened for a couple of weeks back in 2020 than it has anything to do with what's going on today.
so we anticipate and we're seeing pretty much consistent sales and traffic trends. and so nothing to really report there in terms of a deceleration or anything.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. the related data point we gave you a couple of weeks ago was that average weekly sales and showing how they had started to move back up again in october and that situation is very much still in place.
unknown speaker
thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from eric gonzalez at keybanc. your line is live. you may begin.
eric gonzalez -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey. thanks for taking the question. can you perhaps clarify that restaurant margin comment you made toward the end of the prepared remarks? i think you mentioned fiscal 2q would be comparable to the second quarter of '19, which if my model is correct, is about 12.7%. and also, i think you discussed a lot more inflation will hit the p&l in the second half, but perhaps some of the transitory costs are all over that time.
so should we assume that the restaurant level margin for the year is roughly flat to '19? i know you've got this three to five year outlook, which calls for 50 basis points on top of the '19 baseline.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
eric, to clarify, it's a big one for you. it's not '19, i said '20. so you need to look at second quarter '20 as a guidepost that i gave you.
eric gonzalez -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
2020? sure. it's $7 mllion.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah. so i'll just refer you back to my comments that, again, moving up from what we saw in the first quarter and above what we saw last year, which is fiscal '21 and then comparable to that f '20 number.
eric gonzalez -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
sure. so then as you look at the second half of the year with some of that more inflation coming on, but also the transitory costs rolling off, should we assume that the margin is maybe flat to how should we think about that versus the 13.2% baseline you established at the analyst day?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
no. i think there's, assuming there's those two events and the normal seasonality we have, remember, third and fourth quarters are our higher volume quarters. i think there is leverageability and upside to those margins as we move through the rest of the fiscal year on a quarterly basis. we're not going to get into that specific level, but i would expect to see normal seasonality patterns play in those quarters.
eric gonzalez -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok, thanks.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, eric.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from john ivankoe at jpmorgan. your line is live. you may begin.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hi. i wanted to get a sense of how you guys thought you were kind of staffed for kind of between christmas and new year's. i mean i know you've talked about the number of people that you're hiring on a weekly basis. but do you have the staff on average and also the staff on a store-by-store basis to basically you'd be able to serve this real wave of demand that the industry normally sees in the month of december or might this be a particularly capacity-constrained scenario that we actually might see in december relative to some previous months that you've talked about?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. great question, john. there are really two -- the two brands are significantly different with regard to what happens during the holiday and traffic. at chili's, our traffic patterns during the holidays are elevated, but they're not extreme.
it really is more about those specific days. you have some -- you just have a couple of bigger days if you will a few more weekend days during the week, almost is one way to think about it at chili's. and we absolutely have -- feel good about, as i mentioned, where we're moving with regard to staffing. we still got those hotspots.
we've mentioned the midwest is really kind of the biggest challenge for us right now in terms of if you want to talk about regionality of labor and the constraint. but for the most part, we feel pretty good about being able to be staffed and ready for the holidays at chili's. maggiano's again, bigger issue, especially if we see the kind of historic demand for banquet business and large groups, which we think we're feeling pretty good about right now. but again, time will tell as we get closer to the date.
and they're working aggressively to staff up. and that may be a little bit more of a headwind, but i think they're -- we're going to be fully staffed to handle the business we expect. now, whether the -- if the environment is overheated, we may not be able to take all the potential business that we could have gotten if it just becomes a really kind of a gangbuster kind of holiday season. but they've got plenty of staff and management now in place to handle what we anticipate being a solid holiday, probably not a record-setting holiday.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
that's helpful. good to know. thank you. and then -- and secondly, i was hoping for kind of i guess a real-time education of what you're seeing in the chicken market.
i mean we -- as an industry, kind of you saw stable boneless, skinless breast prices for years. i mean they kind of -- we're in a fairly tight range and obviously, are very elevated now. when you talk to your suppliers and you kind of just -- you talk to the people that are really in that market, how much of those costs do you see as transitory versus structural? and as you're kind of thinking about the chicken contract as that comes up for renewal, i mean, i guess, how much rest do you think there could be that we'll be looking at fiscal '23 versus '22 as another escalated year of commodity increases?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah. john, it's set to pinpoint exactly what i said to be transitory and structural there. i think it's a high level of transitory again, what we're hearing is, obviously, it's not an issue of number of chickens. there's -- and this is pretty consistent across a lot of the protein commodity bases is that there's enough supply.
it's a production kink that really is throwing some wrenches into the system and creating that incremental cost. so i think over time, we do have a strong belief that that is going to correct itself. and we're hearing anecdotally from partners that they're seeing better hiring rates, very similar kinds of patterns that as they work through some of the systems, we would expect to see greater production capacities, which should definitely impact the price as you go forward. our chicken contract runs well into the -- well, it runs into the fourth quarter, into the april time frame.
so while you start those conversations in real-time as to what that look like, we're going to watch that very closely as we move through the next several months and start moving more toward dates that you might traditionally commit for new contracts and keep our options as broad as we can there for as long as we can. we've got good partners to work with in this regard and we'll work it actively as we kind of move toward that april kind of time frames.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
you're right, john. there's nothing -- if you just look at that market over the last, really almost 10 years, there's nothing structurally that's changed besides maybe some of the labor component costs that aren't going to -- that wouldn't support the kind of potential inflation that's out there now. so we think it's going to mitigate to some degree and we'll make some bets based on that thinking, going forward. you there?
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
all right. thanks, guys. i'll mute. take care.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
all right, john. talk to you later.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from david palmer at evercore isi. your line is live. you may begin.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. thanks. first, a question on labor. are you still thinking the mid-34s there for as a percent of sales for fiscal '22? and if so, how are you breaking that down in terms of labor hours per unit versus the previous year and versus pre-covid? and are you anticipating any sort of change there from handhelds in the new service model? and lastly, what sort of wage increases are you anticipating also in this guidance on a one-year basis?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. from this guidance, david, i'm almost taking those in reverse, from a average wage, we expect that to be in -- elevated as to what we've seen in the last several years, but in that upper mid-single-digit range. so if you're thinking 6%, 7%, that's been a fairly consistent range as of late and we're incorporating that into our thinking for this fiscal year. obviously, we've talked a lot about the opportunities we see around deploying tsc.
it's out in most of the system and we're getting close, really within the next several weeks of getting that fully deployed. we like it as a labor operating system in the front of the house because, one, we think it's the best guest service model we can deploy. it also has great retentive value. and the fact that one of the things you quickly see is average earnings or servers going up from that model.
so we like the ability to lean into that in this current model. it obviously has a runner system involved with it. so the hours aren't that dissimilar but maybe -- but are deployed across some different functions different than what you might see here. so we're not anticipating a step change in any way, shape or form a number of hours having to flow back in, you will get hours in the second half of the year naturally from a seasonality standpoint.
so from this point, i think volumes will dictate the amount of hours flowing in the system and we would expect to see greater hours as we have success on the top line in q3 and q4 that we normally would expect to see.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
and then i wanted to ask you a question that we talked about during the...
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
and david, by the way, yes and that the number for the fiscal year, the target we talked about at investor day is still definitely in play that mid-34s.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok, thank you. and then wyman, we talked about this pricing strategy for off-premise versus the on-premise. it feels like the incremental margin for off-premise has been well below the incremental margin for on-premise. and i know there is -- you effectively want to get these virtual brands launched and there's been a lot of outsized inflation perhaps in wings and -- but delivery fees, there's a lot of players out there pricing this along to the consumer and the consumer seems to be taking it because they're willing to pay up for convenience.
so i'm wondering, is that on the table that you could do a step change in pricing for that business, assuming you're taking your pricing right now for off-premise is similar to your on-premise? is that on the table as something of a price lever? and i'll pass it on.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. it is, david. and just to remind you, there are certain things we don't do in delivery, like the value proposition that is three for $10 or three for $10.99. we just don't offer that.
so one of the ways we address some of the issues you're talking about, there is additional price. so we are already pricing at a premium and we will continue to look at how much more of a premium we need to get to make that channel carry its weight, if you will. but we also haven't -- we just don't put some of the offers out there that are more value and maybe not carrying as great a margin. so between those two things, between the mix and the price, we will continue to make sure that the delivery channel is carrying its weight and delivering good returns.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yup. thanks, david.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from chris o'cull at stifel. your line is live. you may begin.
unknown speaker
hey, guys. this is patrick on for chris. my first question was just for the quarter. i was curious if there was any step-change in your promotion of the three for $10 platform in the base chili's business? and if so, what role that played in driving traffic in the quarter, but maybe also what additional pressure that might have added to the cost of goods in the quarter?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
no. no real change there, patrick.
unknown speaker
ok. that's helpful. and then i also wanted to ask about the planned expansion to the third-party aggregators that you discussed during your investor day. just as you initiate those new partnerships, does your doordash agreement actually allow for that or should we be thinking about there being a change in the economics in that agreement as you add on additional partners?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
without getting into details, we continue to appreciate our partnership with doordash and as we look to expand channels with other third parties and other ways to grow the business like our own websites, we'll continue to evaluate the relationship we have with doordash. but nothing specific to announce today.
unknown speaker
ok, great. thanks, guys.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
all right. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from brian mullan at deutsche bank. your line is live. you may begin.
brian mullan -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks. i just have one clarification item on the guidance and a follow-up. joe, i'm just wondering if the at least $400 million of ebitda comment that you made at the investor day, does that still stand for fiscal '22? that's just a clarification question.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes, it does.
brian mullan -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok, thank you. and then as a follow-up, at the investor day you shared and it's just wings p&l, it showed marketing expense at about 9% of sales. so could you just discuss the degree of confidence in that marketing spend level holding firm at around 9% as you seek to grow that revenue over the next couple of years? and i asked because you talked about driving direct traffic via seo and sem, keyword search, google food ordering. when you look at other consumer spending categories that have shifted in these can be expensive and competitive activity, so just any thoughts of that 9% is a firm number? and is there a marketing percentage of sales threshold or a ceiling, where investing to drive that business direct gets less attractive from an roi perspective? thank you.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
hey, brian. it's wyman. yes, i think what you're seeing there is an elevated investment level with the introduction of a brand-new brand, right? so obviously, we're very excited about our two virtual brands. we're going to spend up on them as we establish those brands in the marketplace.
but to your point, the beauty of how we market these brands is it's very trackable. we have a pretty good line of sight as to the return we're getting on these marketing investments. and i will say, again, in the first year, year and a half, we've made some decisions that haven't paid out as well, but we now understand where we're getting the best bang for the buck in the marketing programs and how to push these brands forward and build them in the various channels that we're now moving toward. so i'd say that's a number that's probably on the high end.
it's an introductory brand kind of investment. and as we establish these brands, establish their customers through loyalty, specific loyalty programs we're building around them, that we'll see that number come down.
brian mullan -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yup. thanks.

great. thanks for taking the question. first clarification, you've said on the margin, i know you've answered it twice now, but you said going back to fiscal '20, did you mean going back to fiscal '20 or back to fiscal second quarter '20 when we're talking about the absolute restaurant-level margin?
mika ware -- vice president, financial and investor relations
brett, actually, we meant to say it will be similar to q1 f '20.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah.
mika ware -- vice president, financial and investor relations
yeah.
brett levy -- mkm partners -- analyst
ok. f 1q '20, got you. second, when you think about pricing, you've obviously stepped up your levels and you've had a greater frequency of adding price to the menu. how long or how quickly do you need to see prices maintain or pull back before you start to think about the next tranche of pricing? and do you think there is a maximum gap you need to keep versus your peers when you look at pricing? because obviously, you're in line with some but short of others.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yeah, we're not -- we tend to not benchmark against peers. we tend to want to stay closer to our customers and our guests and understand how is the pricing affecting their ability to and desire to continue to engage with these brands and our value -- how is our value proposition holding up. and so that's what we really kind of benchmark against. so we're kind of daily monitoring that through our guest feedback loops.
and we'll continue to watch that. and i guess, the biggest question we have and what we've reiterated to the group here is what we see as structural, we feel pretty good about having that covered, but we do have a fairly significant transitory bucket, if you will, that we're working down. and if for some reason, the changes in the environment that have been really primarily covid-related, if those tend to be more structural now, then we'll have to take some more pricing as we move forward. and we can do that relatively quickly, but we always like to be connected to the guest and diligent about what the impact is going to be as best we can.
brett levy -- mkm partners -- analyst
and then just finally, are there any promotional mismatches we should think about over the next two to five months?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
no, the beauty of what we've been doing really prior to the pandemic is we haven't been -- we weren't an lto promo-driven concept. we kind of got off that carousel years ago. and so that's why our value propositions and the base business is so important to us, because that's what we drive this business from. we don't want to be kind of bound by limited-time offers or other gimmicky kind of things that have to drive traffic.
we'd much rather be working off a stable day in, day out proposition for guests that we know resonates well. so nothing there.
brett levy -- mkm partners -- analyst

operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the brinker international q2 f22 earnings call. [operator instructions] it is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, mika ware, vice president of finance and investor relations.  ma'am, the floor is yours. 
mika ware -- vice president of finance and investor relations
thank you, kate, and good morning, everyone. welcome to the earnings call for brinker international second quarter of fiscal year 2022. with me on today's call are wyman roberts, chief executive officer and president; and joe taylor, our chief financial officer. we released full results for the quarter earlier this morning, which are available on our website at brinker.com.
as usual, wyman and joe will make prepared comments related to our operating performance and then we will open the call and jump straight to your questions. before beginning our comment, it is my job to remind everyone of our safe harbor regarding the forward-looking statements. during our call, management may discuss certain items which are not based entirely on historical facts. any such items should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
all such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated. such risks and uncertainties include factors more completely described in this morning's press release and the company's filings with the sec. and of course, on the call, we may refer to certain non-gaap financial measures that management uses in its review of the business and believes will provide insight into the company's ongoing operations. and with that said, i will turn the call over to wyman.  
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
all right. thanks, mika, and thank you all for joining us this morning. i'm pleased with brinker second quarter performance in the progression throughout the quarter. it was great to see the effects of the delta spike dissipate.
our momentum come back and flow through improve. take-out and delivery remain strong in the mid-thirties, while dining room demand was on the rise. all our brands had impressive holiday results as guests got more comfortable coming together in groups, which helped us deliver a better than expected quarter with positive sales of 17.7% and adjusted eps of $0.71 cents. these results demonstrate that would diminish covid interference our business model continues to perform well, particularly at volume.
now we, along with the restaurant, the rest of the restaurant industry are not without our headwinds. obviously, there are cost pressures, with inflation at the highest levels we've seen in years. we've responded with appropriate pricing actions and with our most recent price increase, our menu price is now up over 4%. we've been deliberate about taking incremental price increases throughout the year to ensure that with every step, we protect our traffic advantage, and we've done exactly that.
chili's continued its trend of beating the industry, marking the 16th consecutive quarter of traffic outperformance. this trend has continued into january, despite being on the current spike. our fundamental belief is that the key to healthy, sustainable growth is to have an increasing number of guests choosing us, so we will maintain a disciplined approach to determining the timing and amount of future pricing actions. to ensure we deliver a great guest experience, and continue to grow the base business, we're focused on making sure chili's is staffed with stable, well-trained teams and smooth operational systems.
the staffing situation across the country has been the most unique i've seen in my career, but we're pleased with the hiring progress we've made. we have more team members on a per restaurant basis today than we did pre-covid. just last week, when i was out in restaurants, managers were saying that they're where they used to see only two or three applicants for a job and now getting 10 or more. so we're devoting increased time and attention on providing high quality training and improving retention for our new hourly team members and managers.
and with the added pressure that covid has put on our operations team, retention today is about more than just a paycheck. it's also about improving quality of life and creating a sense of belonging. we found new ways to leverage our technology to accomplish these goals. we're implementing a virtual learning platform that allows us to train both hourly team members and managers from the restaurant support center.
this is a live, interactive experience that improves the speed, quality and consistency of our training while reducing costs and the burden on our restaurant managers. with this system, we're experiencing a 20 percent retention improvement for new hourly team members. for managers, we're also focused on increasing career progression and diversity that's so important to our business. we're doubling down on leadership development programs for both new and tenured managers like our highly successful women, take the lead program.
we see much higher retention levels among those who've engaged in these programs. our rehire rates also demonstrate further evidence of the positive impact of these efforts. historically, the rehire rate for managers who, for whatever reason, chose to leave chili's and then come back to us has been in the low to mid-single digit range. today, that rate is more than double, and it's even higher at the hourly level, which speaks to the power of our culture and the strength of our business.
we know how crucial it is to support our teams with efficient, effective systems that enable smooth operational execution, improve the guest experience, and strengthen our base business. this is another area where our technology, expertise gives us a big advantage. at chili's, we recently completed the implementation of two major technology systems. the first, is our handheld system, which redefines how we serve our guests.
with this system, our servers cover more tables and earn more money. we're already seeing an average of 15% higher server earnings and significant improvements in guest metrics. we've been testing this in restaurants for years now so we know the potential once it's fully up and running. we're also capitalizing on the consumer's increased demand to dine off premise with a new curbside system that provides a more seamless guest experience.
the operators are getting comfortable with it now, and restaurants that have fully adopted are generating 15 to 20 point improvements in guest metrics. these efforts to strengthen our base set us up to accelerate additional growth vehicles. we've ramped up chili's development plans and currently have in excess of 20 new full size restaurants in the pipeline. we're also testing small footprint off premise centric designs for densely populated markets that don't make sense for a full size prototype.
we've opened our first urban kitchen in manhattan, offering both chili's and it's just wings. and i never thought i'd see the day when i'd see a chili's in manhattan, but it's been up and running for a month, and we're encouraged by its early performance. we plan to open two small footprint locations and trade areas adjacent to college campuses in the near future, and virtual brands continue to be an important growth vehicle for us. we remain fully committed to this strategy.
our size and scale are uniquely suited to enable growth through this vehicle. it's just wings continues to perform well, and as of this week, maggiano's italian classics is up and running in over 700 restaurants. we're actively working to expand sales channels, build brand awareness and accelerate this part of our business. second quarter proved that when our business operates with minimal covid impact, guest demand is high and the model is strong.
we generated solid cash flow and good earnings. as we continue to navigate the inflationary pressures and respond prudently for the long term health of our business, we want you to know we're committed to keeping our business model strong and we still have growth ahead of us. we see a lot of opportunity to leverage our scale, our ownership model, to grow the brands in our portfolio and move the business forward and deliver a great return for our shareholders. and this is only possible because of our amazing teams working tirelessly in the restaurants, and in the support center.
and i want to thank each of them for their passion and commitment. and now i'll turn the call over to joe to give you more details on the quarter. joe. 
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
hey. thanks, wyman, and good morning, everyone. let me continue the overview of our second quarter by providing additional insight into our operating results, as well as briefly touching on the initial post-holiday operating environment as we move into the back half of our fiscal year. for the second quarter of fiscal 2022,  brinker reported $0.71 of adjusted diluted earnings per share, up from $0.35 in last year's second quarter.
brinker's total revenues were $926 million for the quarter, and our comparable restaurant sales were positive 17.7%. for some context around this performance, our sales trends improved steadily as we move through the quarter as guests resume their routines with the waning of the delta wave of covid. our restaurant staffing improve through the quarter, and by the holidays, we experienced some of the highest level of dining room capacity recovery since the beginning of the fiscal year in july. we ended the quarter on a high note with a strong december, driven by the several weeks leading up to christmas.
chili's comparable restaurant sales were 12.1% for the second quarter. their comp sales were negatively impacted approximately 1.5% by christmas, shifting back into the quarter from q3 prior year, and close to 0.5% from closing early on christmas eve. we chose this year to invest back into the well-being of our teammates in the restaurants and sent them home at four o'clock to spend time with family and friends. this reaction reduced company sales by approximately $4 million.
maggiano's reported net comp sales for the quarter of a positive 78.1%. the much improved performance resulted from a higher pace of dining room recovery and importantly, improved banquet sales. the team has also done a nice job maintaining their elevated carry-out business, which appears to have stickiness in the mid 20% range, even as the other business channels improve. still recovery to go but the top line performance coupled with an improved business model, allowed maggiano's  to deliver an above expectations quarter.
a nice step forward for the brand. during the quarter, chili's inclusive of the virtual brands took several incremental price increases and exited the quarter carrying approximately 3% menu price compared to the prior year. in addition, as wyman mentioned, we have taken further pricing actions in january, resulting in chili's now carrying price of over 4% and maggiano's adding 5% price with their latest menu rollout. we do anticipate maintaining price at these historically higher levels for the foreseeable future.
brinker increased its consolidated restaurant operating margin to 11% in the second quarter versus 10.7% a year ago. we continue to be very encouraged in periods of low covid impact, as it allows us to realize the power of the business model and the ability to leverage margins with more normalized top line performance. food and beverage costs were unfavorable, 120 basis points driven by commodity inflation, partially offset by price. we are seeing stabilization in our supply chain and have a good line of sight into the balance of the fiscal year, with a large majority of our contracts locked for the next six months.
we are expecting high single digit inflation for the third and fourth quarter. labor for the quarter was then favorable 60 basis points versus prior year. our recruiting and training efforts a good progress throughout the quarter, and the higher sales volumes in the latter part of the quarter work to effectively leverage the six components of these costs. wage rates at the manager, an hourly level remained elevated in the high single digits, and we expect to see this trend continue as we work through the remainder of the fiscal year.
as the teams continue to stabilize outside of covid spikes, we should make incremental progress in reducing costs such as training and overtime utilization. the crept into the system during times of higher turnover and lack of labor availability. restaurant expense was favorable 210 basis points year-over-year, as the improved sales performance effectively leverage the fixed cost included in this category. as we work to further build our sales channels, we should see this leverage dynamic continue, and how balanced the inflationary aspects, and other parts of [inaudible] our cash flow for the second quarter remain strong with cash from operating activities of $67 million and ebitda of $88 million.
our total funded debt leverage was 2.6 times and our lease adjusted leverage was 3.6 times. both down slightly from the first quarter, but down significantly from prior year. let me finish my prepared comments with some perspective related to our january periods operating performance that closes today. this has been widely reported.
the omicron variant spiked rapidly just after the christmas holiday, and played havoc throughout the industry with staffing and sales capacity, particularly with dining rooms. we have not been immune to that impact. after a challenging first couple of weeks, we have seen the spike dissipate in many markets and are seeing improvements in our sales week-to-week as team member exclusions come down almost as fast as they rose. while it's good to see what appears to be a much quicker resolution of this covid wave, the january period will be a setback to our overall operating results.
it's important that we quickly move back to a more normalized operating environment in order to meet our expectations for the fiscal year. taking a step back from the volatility in the current environment, and looking past the veil of covid, we remain confident in our ability to drive improved business results across our brands. we see good growth ahead as we invest in our strategic initiatives, open an increasing number of restaurants, and leverage our technological advantages. we also remain very appreciative of our restaurant leaders and teams, and the efforts they are making each and every day to deliver the results, we simply report.
now that my remarks are complete, let's open the call for your questions. kate, i'll turn it back over to you to moderate.

operator
thank you, ladies and gentlemen. the floor is now open for questions. [operator instructions] our first question today is coming from dennis geiger at ubs. your line is live, you may begin. 
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
great. wyman and joe, thanks for the insights. really helpful. just wondering, joe, i guess following up on some of the comments you just made, if you could speak a bit more to the full year, it sounds like you're talking about assuming the environment starts to normalize pretty quickly, you can meet prior expectations for the full year, but wondering if you could unpack that and just speak a bit more to that, and some of the moving pieces there, please?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah. dennis, good morning. i think one of the keys that you just mentioned is normalized operating environment. of course, our expectations for the year don't anticipate operating environments similar to the first part of january in particular with those kinds of spikes.
so let's assume that we're working our way through that. i think again, as we look at the various factors driving the business, demand is there. our expectations around the willingness of the guests to interact with the brands in a variety of ways is playing out, as we would expect. the inflationary factors are also there, too.
again, i think we're comfortable with the perspective we've given you on inflation. we we had anticipated a little bit higher inflation on the commodity side in the second half of the year, and in that line of sight still exists, which will kind of level us into that mid- upper mid-single digit range by for the year. so i think, generally speaking on the tracks that we were anticipate as we go.
dennis geiger
very helpful. just a quick follow up, joe, if i could. there just on the staffing, it sounds like managing it quite well, considering that the difficult environment, any more color on impact to sales in the quarter? i think you guys have touched on that in recent quarters. how's that has been trending recently, and how much more staffing from here? if you could speak to that within those company stores.
thank you very much. 
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. hey, dennis. it's wyman. so yes, in the quarter, our second quarter, we were still working through some of these staffing challenges.
both finding team members and managers, given some of the activity that we saw early in our fiscal year, in the summer. and then, late in the quarter this omicron spike really dealing with call-outs and exclusions, right? there were a lot of people that had gotten sick late in december. the good news, though, is that on the hiring front, as i mentioned in my remarks, we're seeing much better tick up and we have more rest, more team members in our restaurants today on an average than we had pre-covid. so, we're getting back to being fully staffed.
now there are a couple of hot spots here and there. the p.w. team here are hr group has done an amazing job supporting our restaurants and hot spots to really be aggressive in recruiting and hiring, and that's turned out very well. so we, as joe said, as we look at the our back half, we don't see as much headwinds due to staffing.
we're feeling pretty good about our ability to keep our restaurants up and running and open full hours, keeping the dining rooms full. so the big question really now is just, what's covid going to do as we work through it, and again, we're encouraged by how we've seen on the come down, but we need that to continue. but , we're ready to do the business. and again, the consumer seems very comfortable coming to the restaurant. 
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
and if i could just take on just a little bit of that, why it's that staffing in particular, the ability to bring dining rooms back up at higher capacity. because when we see our highest operating periods, like a december, it's when you're getting, as i mentioned, as those dining rooms functioning back up to closer to normalized capacity. it's that's the opportunity that staffing brings us, you don't have to throttle that important channel or most important channel down as much. 
dennis geiger
thanks very much, guys. 
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, dennis. 
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from david palmer at evercore isi. your line is live.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks. and thanks, joe, for the commentary on the guidance or the fact that you didn't renew that now. but, perhaps the way things happened with omicron in january that you're perhaps -- that guidance a little bit? i wonder if you could talk about how much january was a setback in terms of sales and ebitda for the year? its almost like a one time thing if we are getting past the worst of covid, we'll look at january's as its own thing. could you talk about that? and i have a follow up.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
david, the period is actually closing today, so i'm not going to get into any details on a period that we really haven't closed the books on yet. so it's a meaningful impact, particularly in those first couple of weeks. one of the interesting things i will say to on that quarter is, we expanded our gap to the industry in that environment. so, we started seeing that expansion grow as the expanding of the gap really back in the latter part of the second quarter.
and, we continue to maintain that growth in the gap as we worked through the last several weeks. so those are kind of the lines of sight we see. but yes, it's not an environment that it's an environment we hope is episodic, and that december environment is going to be the one that is more analogous to the rest of the year. so that's part of wanting to understand a little bit better, where we go between those two two variations of a theme. 
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
and the only thing i'd point to david, you see the industry numbers, so you kind of know what's happened in the industry. and as joe said, we've outperformed the industry. so, omicron was definitely had an impact on the industry through the back half of december and into january. we fared better than the industry, but we were impacted as well.
and as joe said, though, we're very encouraged by how it's working its way out of the system and as you look through the month.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
and as you look at the second half of this fiscal year, it looks like you're going to have pricing maybe a point and a half more pricing, maybe give a sense of your food cost resets and maybe your feeling of labor, just things that are a little bit more permanent versus the january stuff, but things that are more permanent feeling things about the second half margin trend versus the first half. and i'll stop there. thanks.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
again, from a margin perspective in this fiscal year, again, we expect both of those components to continue to run in that high single digit rate. and again, we're seeing particularly inflationary environments in the cost of sales side of the equation pretty much line up with our expertise. we have good line of sight of that through our contracting, and on the supply chain side of the equation. so, we understand what it is.
we have taken incremental pricing actions to help mitigate against that. but i think that is again, the area that there is a belief, we'll have a downward cycle at some point not calling timeframe on that. but we do still believe commodities are cyclical. and whether or not it's the back half of this calendar year or getting into next fiscal year, there's probably some relief on the absolutes of those.
the labor side of the equation is more structural, and we do anticipate that those inflationary rates that high-single digits will moderate over time. but, we're still working our way through the structural upticks that we've seen in labor. again, the labor environment itself, as we've seen, more activity coming back into that market, i think will help stabilize that over time also.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst

operator
no problem. our next question is coming from jeffrey bernstein at barclays. your line is live.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
one jeff to another. 
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
we just got another jeff. 
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays -- analyst
it's not one jeff, it's another. couple of questions. one, just wondering if you can talk specifically about the restaurant margins for the second half of the fiscal year? obviously, much improved this quarter versus last. but you think about the line items of the greatest volatility.
it sounds like you have a pretty good line of sight into commodities and labor. so i'm just wondering, especially with the pricing now at 4% at chili's, what your outlook is? specific to the second half and whether that price increase is seeing any consumer pushed back, or whether you see any elasticity issues. it sounds like you're really not seeing any, but just trying to figure out how you would gauge that.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
hey, jeff. joe will talk to you about the specific margins, but i do want to talk a little bit about what i think is probably not as clear. and that's the impact of that this covid episodes and spikes omicron have on our mix. and so, the good news is, we continue to to drive traffic and beat the industry by not a small margin, but by double-digit numbers on traffic.
but it does shift from more dine-in to take-out, and that's a pretty significant check hit. obviously, the alcohol sales, and the other things that don't happen as much when people dine-out, now we're happy to have the guests still engaged with us. but, what we see and we saw in december, we saw in july when covid started, we get back these dining room numbers and the impact is significantly more than i think people understand. and probably much more than other brands or companies you may follow.
and i just so the margin story and our ability to cover costs get much better because the check average goes significantly much more than the pricing impact that we tend to focus a lot on, whether it's going to be a 4% or 5%. the bigger impact for us is, when we shift out of dining room and to-go because of covid, we lose a lot of average check, and that's just out of our control. when we start to see them come back, all of our checks by channels, so take-out, delivery are up over pre-covid by double-digits. we're just not seeing all of that impact because of the mix shifts, and the mixed kind of shift back, we start to feel that in the margin pressure becomes a lot less.
i just wanted to share that because i do think sometimes it gets lost in the conversation about, ""oh, you're taking 2% or 3%"". we have much more of an impact on shift out of dining room into take-out than one another point in price is going to get us. 
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah. and jeff, again, as we continue to move through the second half of the fiscal year, while january gives us a little bit of a stub-on-the-toe from a performance standpoint to overcome. i would expect moving out of this environment that you'll see the typical margin growth that you would in the back half of our fiscal year. we tend to obviously see progression in market and margins at the at the rom level as we move through some of our higher volumes in q3 and q4.
and, i think that environment is very much still in place. obviously, the dynamics that impact rom, we're actively evaluating an ongoing basis and as we think both said in our comments, we'll take further action if we think it's necessary to continue to support that margin growth.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
and just to your point, the pricing we've taken so far doesn't seem to have gotten a lot of push back, and we think in this environment that's pretty consistent. but we also don't think that this environment is necessarily the environment that's going to hold forever. and, and we want to be very cautious about when consumer perceptions, and the economy maybe shift a little bit more that we have the value propositions, and the and the quality of the brands from a value perspective that that drive consumers or appeal to consumers in maybe a different consumer environment that may or may not come,  but typically they cycle back.
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays -- analyst
understood. and my follow up was just to clarify, i know there was no mention of formal fiscal '22 guidance in your prepared remarks, but the fact that you gave very specific guidance last quarter for the full fiscal year. just wanted to clarify, it sounds like labor and commodities are in line with what you were thinking, but is it otherwise a reiteration of the total revenue, total ebitda and total eps for the full year? similarly, second quarter a little bit better. and then, january like you said, stubbed-your-toe.
but all and all, those key line item metrics are still reiterated for full year fiscal '22?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah, jeff, again, we didn't speak to guidance with any updates or further information as it relates to what we gave you the last quarter. so, as per our policy, that guidance is still there. 
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks very much.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
all right, jeff. 
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from james rutherford at stephens inc. your line is live. you may begin.
james rutherford -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
hey, thank you, and congrats on the quarter here. i wanted to circle back to the discussion of menu prices and consumer demand running over 4% menu pricing today at chili's and clearly prices are going up across all the food service, and food at home. and i think you said you're not seeing an impact on demand yet, but why? what risk do you see that the low income consumer potentially gets incrementally pressured through the year and consumers simply shift at the margin from casual dining, either quick service or more at home consumption? just how would you respond if that event occurs?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
we control what we can control, right? and what we can control is our value propositions, and the quality of our brands, and we have one of the strongest value propositions in the industry in casual dining. so, we've seen during covid, interestingly, the consumer kind of shift up in casual dining. and so, we think that probably the first thing they'll do is probably come back down a little bit. and so, if you just think about the amount of steak consumers have eaten in covid, it's kind of interesting.
and that's usually, a higher price item, it's a higher check average concepts, and we imagine there may be under pressure. some drift back to maybe some of the lower and check average concepts before they jump right in. we do know that in tough times, it's not like consumers, they want to dine-out during every recession, we've never appeared to have looked at. it's always confirmed that consumers continue to want to dine-out., they don't know how to cook.
it's not like they learned how to cook until covid, but they're still wanting to go out or have their food brought to them. and, we just want to make sure that if things get a little tighter, we have a really strong value proposition. that's why we're very cautious about how we price and making sure that our pricing actions don't do damage to the overall value propositions that we offer for consumers, which is why we think we've been able to again, beat the category for 16 consecutive quarters on traffic.
james rutherford -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
that's a helpful perspective. my second question is around unit growth in the urban areas, and you mentioned your efforts there, but some in the industry have chosen to partner with companies such as rieff across these urban areas. it sounds like you're taking an approach of, if i understand it correctly, building your own to-go and delivery focused kitchens. i'm just curious what your view is on the pros and cons of the different go to market strategies there, and how big you think the total opportunity would you have for these smaller footprint stores? thank you very much.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think that we're trying to keep all of our options open in that regard. in fact, the manhattan location is a third party kitchen location that we have have space in. so, that's an option.
and, in certain circumstances and really dense urban markets that might make the most sense. the options we're looking at right now that are there, the two units that we're looking at, that are by college campuses, one here in dallas and one in columbus are going to be in line a little bit larger, kind of more in that 1500-1800 square foot that we would lease and manage. so, they all are kind of off premise centric in their approach. but, i think there's different ways to approach different incremental markets.
and so we're making sure we understand all of those options. so, it's not going to put a specific metric out there yet as a target, but it's meaningful enough to spend a lot of time on it. we think there's a number of different markets, be they urban [inaudible], be they college campuses that respond extremely well to off premise, both to-go and delivery. there could be some fill in markets and other places that we have penetrated significantly on the suburban rings that we may go into.
so again, it's just opening up a fairly large addressable market by thinking a little bit differently, and leaning into really, you know, that's one of the covid takeaways is that off premise is a bigger component of what we will do going forward. so we want to make sure we're taking full advantage of that consumer shift. 
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
and i'll just add. now having a portfolio with a couple of virtual brands in there, allows us to leverage these spaces. and when you read and study what's happening in the space, a lot of times it's just they're just not able to get enough velocity, right? they're just not able to generate enough sales to cover it. and this is where our portfolio has helped us, and our ability to understand how to run this portfolio in a very tight kitchen environment, even in a chili's, it translates very well into this world.
and so the teams working hard will have a lot more information as we continue to get a couple of these things in the ground and up and running. but we're encouraged and it could be a meaningful growth vehicle for us in the future.

thank you. our next question today is coming from jeff farmer at gordon haskett. your line is live. 
jeff farmer -- gordon haskett -- analyst
great. thank you. hopefully, you guys can hear me this time?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
we got you jeff.
jeff farmer -- gordon haskett -- analyst
ok. awesome. so, you touched on a little bit, but in terms of, i'm curious, how do exclusions work at chili's? and, what i mean by that is, when those employees are held out for protocols or for whatever reason, do they get paid? and then you guys bring in a secondary employee to make up that shift? how does that work when you actually do have exclusions with your employees?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah, jeff. well, first, managers and hourly team members getting covid or being exposed to covid. there's been a very interesting process right over the last two years, the exclusions of managers, obviously, you know, when a manager gets sick, they're salaried. for the most part, they're paid, they're covered, but it's very difficult if you have a manager or 2 of 4 managers come down with covid.
we don't have like managers laying around that we can just go and replace them. so oftentimes, that's when the restaurant is without the leadership, it needs to stay open all full hours, right? so we end up having to throttle the business, what we call throttle the business down to adjust for the ability we have of leadership to run the restaurant. with team members, it's different. oftentimes, we don't know because they're hourly, and they may or may not come in on the schedule, they may just call out.
it's not as clear oftentimes what's going on with hourly team members, but we we are committed to supporting all of our team members through the covid experience, and we do everything we can, and i think we do a great job keeping them safe in the first place, and then supporting them through this environment. but it puts a lot of pressure on the restaurant, both from a manager and an hourly perspective, because it happens without any warning, right? you just get a call in that says, ""hey, i'm not coming in today."" and while you want to try and replace those shifts with other team members, it's not always easy to do, especially in the environment we've been running in.
jeff farmer -- gordon haskett -- analyst
that's helpful. and just one more unrelated. some of your peers have discussed this over the last week, which is that, greater than an expected supply chain pressures have added to some of their commodity inflation pressure. sounds like a lot of these supply chain members are seeing some of the same staffing issues, some production issues as well.
so my question to you is, and i apologize again if you've already discussed this, but on your supply chain, have any headwinds there materialize to make your commodity situation a little bit more challenging than it already is?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
well, again, everyone's been impacted by omnicom, and the i think the significant impact it had on the country in terms of people contracting covid in the late december, january time period, impacted anyone that was producing product. just like we were just talking about our restaurant managers and our team members, getting covid and not being able to come in while that was happening in plants and production areas. so there were some, i'll call it, wobble in the supply chain system. but, we've managed it and the team, again, after almost two years of figuring out how to work through a covid environment.
i'm really proud of the work we've done, and it hasn't had a dramatic impact on our restaurants to this point. we've been very flexible in terms of being able to ship product and move it around. we've got a good line of sight into how to keep our restaurants staffed or stocked up, and supplied. doesn't mean we don't have issues that we're dealing with on a daily basis with all of our supplier partners throughout the country, whether they have delivery issues or getting supply to that to the centers.
but a good job overall, and i'll let joe talk --
joe taylor
yeah. i think, jeff, particularly as you think about where does cost of sales go from here ,and we start thinking about particularly moving into next fiscal year, and what the cyclicality may look like. the underlying inflation that all of us have been dealing with for more than a year now., there is a component over that and probably a fairly meaningful component that is coming out of those disruptions that you talk about production cutbacks, the staffing issues that you see within production, within distribution, all the different components of the supply chai, that is has fared fairly meaningfully that inflationary cycle. so, as that stabilizes, which again, i think similar to we see stabilization continuing to work its way and grow within the hour side of the equation, i think we'll see that on the supply chain side of the equation.
so i think, it's not too far fetched to believe that those inflationary drivers may start to dissipate. again, i think it's still several quarters out, but i don't anticipate still having that level of underlying issues that they face as we move into the next fiscal year in particular.
jeff farmer -- gordon haskett -- analyst
all right. thank you for the thoughts. thank you. 
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from andrew strelzik at bmo. your line is live. 
andrew strelzik -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you and good morning. i actually wanted to start by following up on that point you were just making about food inflation, food costs for next year, not looking for guidance, certainly. but i'm just curious as you either starting to have those conversations or are we going to start having this conversation? how -- what is your philosophy around locking in food costs for next year? are prices at a level that you're comfortable to do that? would you want to see things change? i'm just curious with it, for your philosophy and your willingness to do that at these levels.
joe taylor
yeah, and that's why as soon as i started, i know that as i start talking about next year, i have. but i think again, philosophy is we don't. our supply chain doesn't function on fiscal years and how they think about accessing markets, and building contracts that we already have contracting, that is working out into next fiscal year. check in and in particular.
so we're always evaluating the different flows of the markets, getting a lot of input as to where the folks that follow the commodity industry very actively think things are going. there's a balance here. it's almost almost sound like i'm going to talk about the fed, but there's a there's a dual responsibility we have with the supply chain to manage and provide price stability, but also make sure product is there. and frankly, over the course of the last year, and i think for a foreseeable period of time, that responsibility of product availability is very critical.
and so again, you kind of balance those two as you go in thinking through your contracting. but we're  we're always layering on contracts and different pieces of the equation and building forward, it's not contracts are run fiscal-year-to-fiscal-year. they're on an ongoing basis. so, hopefully that gives you little more insight there. 
andrew strelzik -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yeah, absolutely. 
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
[inaudible] again, i'll just say my belief is, having been through a couple of these cycles with products specifically, that there are some products that are at all time highs and they will come down. and so where we have typically been looking to contract for a longer period of time, we'll not do that as much. we'll play the market a little more and there's some risk associated with that. obviously, more volatility but we don't think it's prudent necessarily to lock in on these prices.
there's really no historic support for them. and we have a belief on a couple of specific products we're going to ride the market a little, probably more than we typically do. and that's just kind of what the market's giving to us.
andrew strelzik -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
got it. that's extremely helpful \. and my other question, i was hoping that you could dig in a little bit more on some of the december performance is really strong dining room demand, weeks before the holidays that you talked about, which presumably are hopefully might look like maybe a normal environment could look like at some point. i guess, i'm curious what the chili's off premise sales looked like at that point? regionally, was there any pre-broad based or were there markets or regions that didn't participate as much, any kind of learnings or insights from that period that informed on your thinking going forward?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
well, i think the best story i can share with you and without getting too detailed into all of our performances is, is really the maggiano's story. in terms of what happened during the holidays, it was very, very encouraging. so as you know, the delta kind of spike kind of dissipated. what we saw at maggiano's was a real willingness for consumers and our guests to come back in large groups, and the banquet business performed much better than we had anticipated.
both the social side of that, as well as the business side, did better than we had thought, and marciano's had a great december, really kind of showed us that, ""hey, that's a brand that is even more impacted by covid because of the large party nature of the banquet side of that business and so as that started to go away, we were very encouraged and it was pretty much across the country and so, that's probably the best example, again, we saw we've talked about the importance of getting dining rooms mix back open at chili's, and we saw that as well. but the real bright spot in december from a future perspective and a consumer insight was kind of what we saw with marciano's. 
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah. and i would just add that december isn't an outlier. again, if you go back and look at other [inaudible] really going back into last fiscal year, so if i go back into the to the spring and summer, and looking through some of those periods, you look at july, you look at the periods that really have been nominal covid, we see the exact same thing happening is that the dining room, you don't have to throttle as much a dining room capacity comes back online. the demand is there.
you can meet that demand more aggressively and those dining rooms are the channel. that's the engine that drives the entire machine here. so, you really see the positive results coming from those kinds of environments so it's very encouraging and it's something we have a lot of confidence in going forward.
andrew strelzik -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great, thank you very much.
operator
thanks and thank you. our next question today is coming from brian vaccaro at raymond james. your line is live.
brian vaccaro -- raymond james financial inc. -- analyst
thanks and good morning. i just had a couple of questions on the on the quarter itself. just some clarifications on the labor side. joe, on the last call, you provided some good detail on what you viewed as sort of transitory costs in that labor line.
i think it was over 100 basis points, just to make sure we understand what's in your labor line from that perspective, can you give a little bit of a more color on those components over time, training, etc.?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah, and again, as i mentioned in our ability to improve within specifically within labor, those are two areas that continue to be elevated. i think, you're looking at the opportunity probably to be in that 75 basis point range between the two of them without having to get overly aggressive. and that's just normalizing back to levels of typical training and levels of [inaudible] again, turnover rates are coming down, so you would expect over time that that's going to going to help on the training side of the equation. but it is still important that we lean into making sure that we have the muscle memory, and the capabilities in the restaurant.
so we're not going to be bashful about training, particularly to the effectiveness of our systems. so i think that will over time dissipate. and i think again, having more team members coming back into this, into the system and having availability across all the different day parts and shifts will improve over time. so they're still there.
they're still negatively impacting more than we'd like to see. but, we have a pretty good line of sight to how to work those off over time.
brian vaccaro -- raymond james financial inc. -- analyst
all right. that's helpful. and just looking at that labor line and with i took on a cost per week basis and think we're up 4% on our math, maybe versus a pre-covid trend and thinking about high-single digit wage inflation, it would seem that hours per store might be down four to five percent? is that generally in the ballpark? and if so, do you think that's sustainable or could you frame where you think we're current staffing levels currently are versus some target that you might have in mind for a post-covid environment?
mika ware -- vice president of finance and investor relations
hey, brian, it's mika. hey, part of that element was even though wages were elevated with all the staffing issues we had throughout the quarter, sometimes you were probably more understaffed than you wanted to be. so that dynamic is what's making it look lower. but, it'll all kind of normalize over time and then we'll start work.
productivity will stabilize and we'll work out the overtime trading numbers back out. so there's a lot of moving pieces in labor.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yeah, but it is the dynamic, brian, we've experienced, we've seen a lot of our competitors where the [inaudible] look pretty good because they're not fully you're not running, fully staffed, full operating restaurants. and all of that margin stuff is good, but there's nothing better than a restaurant running at full capacity, full volume, and doing it with the sales. and i know it's hard sometimes to see the line of sight because it gets it gets a little blurry because of these constraints, which are unique to this, to this environment, we have never dealt with this in decades,  where you're throttling restaurants, you've always held the door a little bit, but never where you're seating half your dining room or you're shutting off your your to-go system because you don't have the people. the good news is those are becoming less and less of an issue as we get fully staffed and trained. 
brian vaccaro -- raymond james financial inc. -- analyst
all right, that's helpful color. thanks, wyman. one one more for me, just on g&a, joe. it was quite a bit lower than we would have expected here in the second quarter.
just color on the underlying dynamics there is that timing. or has there been a change to your annual guidance? i think you were looking for up eight to $12 million year-on-year. is that still an expectation, or is there been a change there?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
i think we're still running in that in that ballpark, we're investing in the g&a side, where we need to from an it perspective. obviously, the percentage, has as leverage ability in it, and we saw a little bit of that this last quarter. i think, overall incentive comp is probably down a little bit relative to where it was in prior year. it's a lot of mix and match is we're being very diligent.
and i think, one of the things that comes with waves is you get less travel, less meetings, all those kinds of things that flow into that g&a side of the equation. but i think that growth in g&a is still in line, probably toward the the lower end of it.
brian vaccaro -- raymond james financial inc. -- analyst
ok. all right. and sorry, one last one. in that other revenue line, that franchise and other revenue line in this current quarter.
i noticed that jumped up pretty meaningfully. and, i just wanted to provide color on how much of that was related to the higher maggiano's  banquet fees? or was there any impact of gift card breakage or some other one time dynamic we should be aware of? thank you. 
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
it really was across a number of different areas and you hit on several, like the banquet revenue does flow into there. so as we talk about banquet revenues coming back., a gift card revenues are also up. but, all the things that you would expect to see as dining rooms are open table top revenue, the franchise revenue itself, as you've seen, particularly the international franchise, markets improve and put more sales on. so it was across a number of those areas.
and, the only very few negative numbers flowing through that that piece of the equation. 
brian vaccaro -- raymond james financial inc. -- analyst
all right, thanks. i'll pass along.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from nicole miller at piper sandler. your line is live. 
nicole miller -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. good morning. can you please share with us the average weekly sales for october, november and december and then validate? i look back in the model and it looks like january, in the current quarter would be a lesser average weekly sales compared to fed in march. and so, to the degree you're off an average weekly sales in january.
you have a whole lot of sales opportunity to make up in february and march. is that right?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
well, again, we don't typically get into that the specifics. but yes, again, your average weekly sales are going to get impacted meaningfully in spikes such as you saw. so we would intend, one february and march tend to be higher volume months than january, anyways in a normalized environment, on an average weekly side of the equation. and i would expect not only bounce back from covid, but to see that continue to play out as we kind of go forward.
nicole miller -- piper sandler -- analyst
all right. can you talk a little bit about the fleet from a suburban versus urban footprint, like what percent is suburban? what percent is urban? and how did those areas compare to one another? and from from a chili's perspective?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah. we have very nominal what i consider urban penetration is a suburb -- you have some maggiano's, it said, within more urban environments, more downtown environments. and again, marciano had a nice quarter. the chili's really is in suburban ex-urban, smaller market footprint.
so we again, when we think about the the new initiatives, we may be looking to try and penetrate some of those markets, but generally speaking, very little that i would consider to be true urban.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. nicole. and i think if you're looking for some kind of regionality play. for us, it's what we've talked about in the past, it really is more covid driven.
so whereas covid having a bigger impact, so the midwest is more heavily impacted and california is a little more heavily impacted and those are really the variations you're seeing in the business are much more covid driven and those are areas that are more impacted. now. there are individual markets in all of every state that may have a restaurant that's in a trade area that's maybe having staffing challenges or a covid spike. but overall, that's the big story there.
and the good news again, is getting better across the board.
nicole miller -- piper sandler -- analyst
yeah. let me clarify. that's a really good point. i think that's helpful.
i was also thinking like high level tech curbside systems, maybe help us understand like, where are you in a mall? where are you free standing? i'm not sure if that's the right application, but, where are you going to get your bang for your buck essentially on some of the investments you're making on that side?-- does that even matter? does the format matter i guess? 
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
well, it does. that's a good point. but again, i think to joe's point, the two technology systems will just use the two we talked about today, the handheld server model. obviously, that works everywhere. 
nicole miller -- piper sandler -- analyst
right. 
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
and then our to-go system works in 90%, i'd say 99% of of chili's that i was in a restaurant in miami that happened to be in a mall. and it's not as easy in a mall parking lot because you don't have the dedicated spaces and some of the technology doesn't work as easily. but that's a that's a rare, rare instance where most of our restaurants are freestanding, they have this structure and the curbside. take-outs system works perfectly well in all of them. 
nicole miller -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you, appreciate the feedback. 
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from jared garber at goldman sachs. your line is live.
jared garber -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, thanks for the time and all the good color this morning. wanted to ask on the unit growth side, we noticed that the company on unit guide was at eight and now on the gross open basis is now at four. so just wanted to get a sense of maybe what's driving that is, is it a timing related and maybe some of those development plans just get pushed out into the first part of next year? and just any color on that development cycle would be great. 
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah, jared. we're really excited about what the development team is doing, they're developing a pipeline has now moved well north of 20 units. there is some timing when you look at that chart that does the fiscal year timing deal, we've seen a few that were right at the end of fiscal year slip into the next fiscal year. construction, it's taking a little bit longer in some respects.
we're seeing some impact there. nothing material or something that gives me any pause. but, i'm expecting twenty three numbers to be very exciting. i think we'll be, definitely over 20 units in the fiscal year.
but continuing to maintain, i'm more focused on maintaining a pipeline as we kind of move forward. that is, in that mid- 20s and they're delivering exactly along that line. also, real excited about what we're seeing as we do open these new restaurants. not a huge numbers so far this year, but the ones that are coming online with the prototype are pretty exciting to see what can happen there.
and again, they also have the ability now to more to incorporate more fully the technological advantages of moving in, particularly the curbside to go side of the equation and really trying to make a few little adjustments here and there to more fully accommodate that. what is now going to be, that mid-30s percent of the business going out to the side door. so, a lot of great things and again, the development team and the design teams, and all the good work that goes into that are doing a great job. and starting to deliver what's going to be a good growth pipeline.
jared garber -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks. that's really helpful, and then just onequick follow up on that. you talked a little bit earlier about some of these newer concepts that's near your new york city location or some of these college campus tests that you're running. in the development plans, is there something we should be thinking about in terms of average weekly sales like a delta there versus,  as those as those units maybe come into the fold and how those would play versus the base business that they're coming in against?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yeah, well, we've talked about so far from a pipeline standpoint, really is the traditional corporate on chili's. so again, we haven't updated as we as we understand more these opportunities than we'll get to that kind of kind of information. but everything right now is  based on current prototype chili's openings, and we'll test these other ones to be able to give you that type of perspective.
jared garber -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thanks for that. i'll pass it on. 
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from chris carroll at rbc capital markets. your line is live.
chris carroll -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks. good morning, wyman. you noted consumer trading up during the pandemic and just following up on this from a value perspective, can you share any further thoughts on gas utilization of your platforms like three for ten ninety nine and the meal for two? and to what extent do you see any potential for incremental pricing actions on those platforms specifically?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
hey, chris. well, first with the first part,  i mean, again, it has been interesting to just watch the dynamics in casual dining and throughout the industry, , both in fast food and we study it all. and, i've been intrigued as to why and i think sometimes with so much when somebody is paying for your meal and with so much government support out there, i think, you tend to maybe buy up when it's not your dollars as much. and so i think we've seen a consumer that's had a lot of cash and has decided,  that maybe they treat themselves a little more.
and so, they've bought up in the category and it's going to be interesting to see what happens with some of this moves out of the the system a little bit, and our expectation is that we'll see some of the shift back into the concepts that have a little lower check average and maybe a better value proposition like ours. and that's so we think that's upside going forward. that said, throughout this whole pandemic, and again, i've heard a couple of times, but i'm really proud of what the team has done to grow traffic through this time period better than the category. so with that, we know,  pricing puts pressure on traffic.
we've been really strong with our traffic. so yeah, we probably have some additional pricing power, if you will. in the menu, we can be very cautious about how we take pricing actions as we move forward. we have price our value platforms this year and so, we're watching them closely.
the the mix to your point, is holding solid. we haven't seen a lot of shifting there. the guest's comments and ratings on those platforms has held solid. and so we continue to lean into those.
but we're also looking at new ways to position our brands, specifically chili's on value, but also maggiano's both channel specific, day parts specific, we're always looking at alternative ways to give the consumer great value, but also maybe pass a little price along with that. 
chris carroll -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great, thanks for all that detail. and then i guess just following up on labor, i think, joe, you noted turnover rates are coming down, but curious if you could expand on just turnover levels a bit more particularly in the first few months following hiring? how does that turnover rate today compare to more recent levels and perhaps pre-covid levels?thanks again.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yeah, so it's been a it's been a journey, right? so pre-covid levels from an hourly perspective spiked dramatically into the spring and summer with everything you're aware of, they've come down fairly dramatically, not back to pre-covid levels. we've seen this,  this higher-level of turnover, both in hourly and manager early on in the process, and that's why we talked about our new training platform where we train virtually. with this increase in turnover, it put a lot of pressure on the managers to train a lot more new team members. and so we're taking some of that off of them.
and what we've seen with turnover is if they're trained well and they're onboarded, if you will, into the brand. well, then they stay longer and they are actually stickier and they get through that first 30-60 days. and so we're we're really focused on that retention, with both groups. and that's why at the at the hourly level, it's about training, and at the management level, it's about engaging them in other activities like our women, take the lead program, that gets them kind of bought into the brand and understanding, what's great about this company, which if they stick around for a couple of months, they get it.
and they and we have a much better 10 year experience with our team members. so, i hope that helps. 
chris carroll -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks so much. 
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from john ivankoe at jpmorgan. your line is live. you may begin. 
john ivankoe -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. a couple, if i may. first, [inaudible] handheld, are they being used in 100% of the stores, 100% of the time? i know you mentioned that. at least i think you mentioned the waitstaff was getting your tips up 15% to 20%, there's increased customer satisfaction, but i wanted to get an understanding of the current usage across the system? and, are you realizing or could you realize any margin benefit from that system going forward? not just satisfaction?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. hey, john. so yes, the system after years of getting the technology right and actually having to rebuild it and using our technology expertise to make sure it's 100% dependable in high volumes. it's rolled out nationally in every restaurant, has it.
every chili's has it, and is now going through what i would call the learning curve just getting used to how to run a different model where you serve or stay out on the floor and you've got a runner component, and the technology is communicating back and forth. but it's out. it's running. and we're just getting proficient at it, i'll say.
now, we've had it in some restaurants for years, but that was 10% or less of the system and now it's 100% of the system. there is some efficiency with it, , with that investment in capital and  the level of efficiency and the payback is really kind of linked to the cost of those hourly team members. so in california, where you're paying a much higher wage rate, it's a significant number. and, in some other places it's not as much, but it's just a better program.
and again, one thing we know is when our team members are making more money, which we focus on that extensively, they stay longer. so time back to the other question retention goes up when server earnings go up. and both of those things are happening.
john ivankoe -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. all right. so i guess you use it to some extent, you answer the question, is it getting proficient with it means in some cases that system is being used? in some cases, the legacy system is being used in terms of taking orders or where would you kind of put us on that timeline?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yeah, i think, john, again, you've got servers, we have servers that have been working for us. i actually went and recognized a server that's been working for chili's for 40 years. so there's some muscle memory with how she takes the work, right? and we've given her a new piece of technology. and so, yeah, they're just getting them up the curve and getting them trained on how the pad works and not going back to the pos terminal like they've done for in some cases decades.
yeah, you just got to get that muscle memory locked in. you've got to get them to rely on runners and the technology to have the food come out so they stay on the floor. that's just a couple of things, but it is. it is critically important for us to get the system.
we have great metrics by server, by a runner, as to how they're using the system. so we know what usage rate each server has. and and so we're the operators are all over this and we're very excited about how quickly they've gotten to where they are today. and we don't think it's going to be much longer than then.
we'll be kind of pretty much fully up to speed. 
john ivankoe -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok, thank you. and the second question is on delivery. could you talk about what that is as a percentage of sales this year versus last year? maybe growth or decline this year versus last year? and whether you think you're potentially reaching all addressable business based on your current relationships. and if that might change.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yeah, john, i don't have the numbers in front of me. i mean, what we know is it might happen. but, what we know is when the, when we get these covid spikes, we see, people shift from the dining room to take-out and delivery. and so, in the second quarter, we saw some of that occur again.
but it is still very strong, our numbers on off premise,  both take-out and delivery, as i mentioned in my comments, still in the solid 30% range, even as we moved into december. so, we're happy with kind of our position, if you will, in and take-out and delivery but we do see opportunities to expand kind of where we are. and, we've we've already talked about the fact that we're no longer exclusive, going to be exclusive to just one third party distributor. and so we're expanding channels, and that's going to be another growth vehicle for us.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah, john, at delivery, it continues to be in that mid-teens. so again, some good stability there, and i would anticipate it kind of staying in that 15%-16% is as we kind of move forward. 
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yeah, most of the shift back into the dining room will probably come from takeout because those are the guests that are more familiar with the location and don't have the delivery piece.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
and at marciano's, the delivery piece has grown dramatically. it continues to be real strong driver for them. 
john ivankoe
got it. thank you. 
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
thank you, john. 
operator
thank you. our final question today is coming from eric gonzalez at keybanc. your line is live. you may begin.
eric gonzalez -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey, thanks for squeezing me, and i'll just ask one question. it's on virtual brands learning how incremental to carry out channels into these concepts? and maybe if you could touch on the overall contribution to the growth from these brands whether they're commenting about the system or generally holding a constant mix of sales? thanks.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
hi, eric. with regard to the incrementality of the brands, i'm sorry, i just want to of the virtual brands incremental to the overall. -- yeah, it's very highly incremental, , so that we know the virtual brands are significantly incremental to  our sales stories. and again, offer us some really unique opportunities to explore some of these ideas that joe was talking about with the urban and smaller takeout delivery centric prototypes.
and then year-over-year,  we're rolling out magianno's ten class, there's no year-over-year there. we're very happy with where we're at with it's just wings, the business that continues to be strong and we'll keep you posted as we kind of get to the next level. once we get the classics rolled out, we start to expand some channels of distribution where we see this business moving. 
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
and they're maintaining a pretty consistent percent mix of total sales similar to what we've talked about in the past. again, the whole concept of throttling when you throttle a restaurant, which typically includes throttling your off premise system too impacts not only the basement brand, but also impacts virtual brands again, getting out of that throttling environment is important across across all of the brands. so, but again, very, very positive, encouraged on what these brands are going to contribute as we continue to move forward.
eric gonzalez -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
has the carryout channel been incremental? or is it still too early to talk about that [inaudible] 
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
it's incremental. it's just small. still, we're still trying to build that awareness levels. and again, the bulk of the business is still delivery.
and so we continue to try and drive awareness of of takeouts. but, the bulk of the business is still doing it.
mika ware -- vice president of finance and investor relations
all right. i think ran out of time, everyone, but i appreciate your questions and look forward to reconnecting with everyone after our third quarter.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer

operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the brinker international q3 fy '22 earnings conference. [operator instructions] it is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, mika ware, vp of finance and investor relations. ma'am, the floor is yours.
mika ware -- vice president of finance and investor relations
thank you, paul, and good morning, everyone. with me on today's call are wyman roberts, chief executive officer and president; and joe taylor, our chief financial officer. results for the quarter were released earlier this morning and are available on our website at brinker.com. wyman and joe will first make prepared comments related to our operating performance and strategic initiatives, then we will open the call for your questions.
before beginning our comments, it's my job to remind everyone of our safe harbor regarding forward-looking statements. during our call, management may discuss certain items which are not based entirely on historical facts. any such items should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. all such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated.
such risks and uncertainties include factors more completely described in this morning's press release and the company's filings with the sec. and of course, on the call, we may refer to certain non-gaap financial measures that management uses in its review of the business and believes will provide insight into the company's ongoing operations. and with that said, i will turn the call over to wyman. 
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
all right. thank you, mika, and thank you all for joining us this morning. the last time we talked with you at the beginning of february, we were just emerging from the omicron wave, which, while thankfully was a short-lived strain, had a whipsaw effect on january staffing and sales. we got back on track quickly and generated positive progression in february and march.
brinker ended the third quarter in a good position with an adjusted eps of $0.92, which is up significantly from last year's $0.78. considering all the noise in the results and comparisons, we believe average weekly sales may be a clearer guide to the growth of the business. chili's average weekly sales accelerated throughout the quarter, with february and march reaching four-year highs. now as consumers navigate the economic challenges that are starting to play out, we're cautious but optimistic about where our top line sits.
at chili's, we're encouraged by the shift we're seeing back into the dining rooms, which is driving higher check averages. off-premise remains at more than 200% over pre-pandemic levels as we continue to grow the delivery business. and the same is true for maggiano's. we feel really good about the changes we've made to the business model, specifically the restructured value proposition for both dine-in and off-premise.
the brand's off-premise business is up 180% versus pre-pandemic and data shows the brand's delivery business is attracting a highly incremental guest. so as banquets come back, maggiano's is poised for some really good growth. on the cost side, we're seeing labor pressure start to stabilize now that we've addressed our most critical staffing needs. we don't foresee as much inflationary pressure on wages going forward like we experienced in the last year.
and now we're focused on managing that piece of the business as effectively as we can as we work through training our new team members to run our operational systems and deliver a great guest experience. it will come as no surprise that, looking ahead, our biggest challenge is commodity inflation. we do believe the elevated costs we're dealing with today won't stay at these levels permanently. so we'll continue to leverage a pricing strategy that isn't passive but isn't reckless either.
we've taken six pricing actions already this year to ensure consumer acceptance and protect our long-term traffic growth. we've put a stake in the ground as an industry leader in value, which has been key to driving our aavs and our guest frequency. and as we move into a slower economic cycle, this becomes an increasingly important competitive advantage for us. so to further mitigate the inflationary pressure, we're also actively pursuing ways to run a more efficient operation.
in a few weeks, we'll roll out a new menu that reduces operational complexity, restructures our value proposition for better margins as well as future pricing flexibility and takes additional price, which will get us close to 6%. we're also achieving efficiency gains with our now fully implemented service model that leverages both handheld and food runners. with this model, we're already seeing front-of-the-house labor hours at near-record lows, and servers are making more money than they've ever made, which we know reduces turnover and the associated pressures on the p&l. and those tenured team members deliver a better, more consistent guest experience.
as we continue to manage these near-term headwinds, we're also playing offense on a lot of fronts. i'm really excited about how we're investing in the business and accelerating our time lines to aggressively grow the business longer term. we're investing in our restaurant pipeline. all the hard work we've done to build the pipeline has come to fruition, and now we start opening new chili's on a consistent basis, and the response to the brand has been tremendous.
for example, our most recent opening just outside san antonio did more than $100,000 in sales during the first week, beating expectations as all our most recent new locations have. our operators are doing a great job creating loyal guests in these communities by delivering great experiences from the very first visit. as we move into next fiscal year, we have plans to open two to three new restaurants on average every month. we're investing in our virtual brand business on two fronts.
first, we're expanding our delivery business in existing markets with additional third-party partners, which drives business across the whole portfolio. and second, as i mentioned last quarter, we're taking our brands to previously untapped markets and expanding points of distribution around the country through ghost kitchens and smaller footprint locations. we've seen our global partners embrace this as well, so we're optimistic about the potential, both domestically and internationally. now that we've fully implemented our new technology-based front-of-the-house service model and takeout systems, we're pivoting our innovation efforts to upgrade our kitchens for the first time in close to 10 years.
we're testing some exciting new equipment that makes our heart-of-the-house team members' jobs easier, delivers a better product, is more efficient, and more effectively supports high volumes. we're moving quickly down that path. so more on that to come. and finally, we're taking the robotics technology we've been experimenting with at the host stand for nearly three years now and incorporating it into our new service model.
our robot, rita, has been promoted to food runner. she does a fantastic job and our guests love her. we've expanded to an additional 50 restaurants, which is yet another example of how we're bringing our technology expertise to scale and bear. it's been nearly 40 years since norman brinker founded this company, and remains today a strong innovative organization with exciting growth potential and competitive advantages.
from our leading-edge technology stack and the systems that enable us to run higher volume restaurants to the exceptional quality of this team. our operators are doing a great job managing through headwinds. and our leadership team continues to navigate the most challenging business cycle menus i've ever seen. we have a clear grasp on what will grow this business in the near and longer term, and i couldn't be prouder of the work this team is doing.
now i'll turn the call over to joe to give you details on the quarter and update guidance for the year. joe?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
thank you, wyman, and good morning, everyone. the results reported this morning represented another quarter of top-line progress for brinker, but also one that is representative of the challenges still facing our industry. for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, brinker reported total revenues of $980 million with consolidated one-year comp sales of positive 13.5%. our adjusted diluted eps for the quarter was $0.92.
as mentioned during our last analyst call, january was a particularly difficult month due to the omicron spike and meaningful weather events. both brands experienced a short-term pullback in guest demand during the spike, as well as staffing challenges during the month. we estimate our consolidated eps for the quarter was negatively impacted from these january issues by approximately $0.35. guest traffic and labor availability bounced back nicely with a positive progression in our performance as we move through the rest of the quarter.
for the quarter, chili's recorded positive one-year comp sales of 10.3%, which included 2.1% of positive traffic. maggiano's one-year comp sales were positive 50.5%, with 28.9% positive traffic. as we move through the two-year lap at the beginning of the pandemic, average weekly sales is a useful lens to the growth of the business. average weekly sales per restaurant at the consolidated brinker level were $63,000 for the third quarter.
both brands average weekly sales accelerated throughout the quarter, with chili's averaging $63,000 in march. maggiano has also gained strength throughout the quarter as dining rooms further recovered and off-premise sales remained strong. the brand reached average weekly sales of $157,000 for march. for the third quarter, brinker recorded a year-over-year price increase of 4.3%.
both brands took pricing actions during the quarter, with chili's exiting the quarter carrying 4.6% of increased menu price, while maggiano's exited with 5.1% of additional menu price. we anticipate further pricing actions in the fourth quarter with chili's approaching 6% year-over-year pricing in june. our price actions continue to be determined in the context of maintaining our sector leadership in guest value perception and our traffic-focused strategy. now turning to margins.
third quarter consolidated restaurant operating margin was 12.2% and adjusted operating margin was 5.7%. inflationary pressures throughout the p&l continued in the third quarter with incremental impact beyond our original expectation in numerous areas. in the quarter, food and beverage costs were 180 basis points higher year over year, driven by commodity inflation of 11%, partially offset by menu price. as you have heard throughout this earnings season, commodity markets are being incrementally impacted by world events, a situation that will maintain inflationary pressures longer than originally expected.
we continue to believe that commodity markets will eventually moderate as the environment changes, likely as we move into calendar '23. labor expense, again as a percent of company sales, was unfavorable 100 basis points compared to prior year, primarily driven by wage rate increases of 10% and the lapping of onetime favorability in the prior year due to closed dining rooms in high-wage-rate states. we also incurred elevated training and overtime costs of 60 to 70 basis points, which we expect to work out of the model as turnover normalizes. restaurant expenses were favorable year over year by 110 basis points as we continue to leverage our fixed cost with an improved top line.
that being said, this area was also impacted by inflationary pressures, in particular, areas such as utilities and maintenance, reducing year-over-year favorability by approximately 90 basis points. our cash flow for the third quarter remains strong. brinker has generated year-to-date operating cash flow of $212 million and year-to-date ebitda of $255 million. as wyman mentioned, we continue to invest in the growth of our brands at an increasing level.
capital expenditures year to date totaled $109 million, driven by investments in new restaurant development, technology, and reimages. we expect our pace of investment to increase as we move more fully into the construction phase of our expanding development pipeline. from a balance sheet perspective, our quarter ending total funded debt leverage was 2.41 times, and our lease-adjusted leverage was 3.48 times. in addition, we repurchased $26 million worth of shares during the quarter.
this morning's press release also updated certain aspects of our fiscal year guidance. we do expect both chili's and maggiano's to continue their solid top-line performance, assuming no further covid spikes or softening of consumer demand due to macroeconomic pressure. some specific updates. we continue to expect annual total revenues to be in our previously guided range of $3.75 billion to $3.85 billion.
due to the omicron spike and continued elevated inflationary pressures, our annual adjusted eps is now expected to be in the range of $3.05 to $3.30. fiscal '22 capex should be in the $160 million to $165 million range. we welcome the appearance that most of the u.s. is moving beyond the last two years of pandemic-driven environment.
this next phase of recovery still has inflationary-driven challenges to work through in the short run. however, we remain confident that our strength with our guests, the perception of good value from our brands, and our ability to invest actively in improving operations will bring us through in a strong form. and with our prepared comments complete, let's open the call for questions until just about the top of the hour. paul, i'm going to turn it back over to you to moderate.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and we did have a few questions come in. the first question is coming from alex slagle. alex, your line is live.
please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
alex slagle -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you. good morning. jefferies. just wanted to start on cost of goods.
obviously lots of inflation and want to be smart on pricing. curious if you could discuss the opportunity to drive the dine-in volumes back toward the '19 levels and what impact that has on cost of goods, just with the improved profitability dynamics and additional beverages and food attach and just kind of wondered how material that is. and then, i guess, if you could expand on the other opportunities with the menu that you brought up in the prepared remarks.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. i'll talk a little bit about the opportunity, alex, and then joe can fill in on some of the details on commodities. i think, well, first off, the margin differential between the various channels, both dine-in and take-out from a margin perspective are pretty similar. so we don't see -- we've made sure that in pricing like take-out that -- and delivery, that we maintain solid margins.
you're absolutely right though, when we get guests in the dining room and there are things like alcoholic check average really helps build a stronger check. and we're seeing that business come back. it will come back organically as i think more and more people feel more and more comfortable that the covid situation is really behind us. we continue to see that.
we see opportunities from our perspective through some efficiency plays that we mentioned to help the throughput, to create more opportunities to bring people in faster, more efficiently, both through our new service model as well as some of the things we're excited about testing here on the kitchen side of the equation. so we're going to see both just the natural move back into the dining room, and then we're going to continue to incent and change the business to encourage people to come in at a greater rate. and that's an important part of the model. but we're comfortable with kind of how it's moving right now.
joe, you got anything to add to that?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. and alex, i'd just say right now we're getting our dining rooms back into that mid-80% area. obviously, they've moved down meaningfully in january. so for the quarter, really -- again, that front-end impact of january can't be overstated.
and i think there's -- we'll definitely continue to see upside as again, just, generally speaking, i see the country moving farther and farther past kind of that significant pandemic environment. there's about an $8 -- a little over $8 difference in your incremental guest in the dining room as opposed to the to-go side of the equation. so the leverage ability of that guest is pretty important because it's not just about the cost of goods, and there can be a little variance between the channels and what that mix looks like. but the ability to leverage off that incremental check.
and as you said, build that check from add-ons, alcohol sales, and things of that nature that i think everybody is pretty familiar with.
alex slagle -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. on the average weekly sales metrics that you provided, how much are those impacted by the recent franchise acquisitions? i'm not sure if that does make much of a difference.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. it's a good point. well, it makes a little difference, alex. it's a good question.
just basically the nature of the restaurants and some of the markets that we're in, things of that nature, they come in at a slightly lower average volume. so i think roughly probably $1,000 impact between those restaurants in the current fleet. and again, i think that we view that from a rationale of the acquisition is a great opportunity because i think the closer we can bring those restaurants to average is going to be incremental to the performance.
alex slagle -- jefferies -- analyst
the margins, too, i guess.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. without a doubt.
alex slagle -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from jared garber. jared, your line is live. please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
jared garber -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. thanks for the question. goldman sachs. joe, if i could just dig into the sort of the full year guide and what's implied for the fourth quarter.
obviously, the top line seems like it remains pretty healthy and that's kind of in line with what we've heard from others, but obviously, the margins being pressured by some cost increases. can you just frame maybe how you're thinking about that 6% price? is that the guide for the fourth quarter here? and then how are we thinking about sort of the inflation metrics? i think last time it was -- the last time we spoke, maybe it was a high single-digit number in the second half, but the third quarter actualized above that. are you thinking that we're seeing that commodity inflation will be greater than that high single digit in the fourth quarter? just trying to figure out kind of the puts and takes on the eps line.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah. if you think about the construct of the guidance, obviously you have the impact of january embedded in that. and then frankly, the rest of the delta is related to the inflationary pressures we're seeing. because you're right, the top line is really performing pretty much at the levels we anticipated they would perform.
so we do expect inflation, and i think you were referencing the cogs inflation in particular. but we do expect that to continue at that low -- that 11% range that we kind of gave you, i think, is very operative for the foreseeable future. so that is definitely factoring into the equation.
jared garber -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and then just one follow-up on the pricing. the 6% that you noted -- yeah.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
that's the exit pricing. so again, that move, as wyman indicated, takes place in a couple of weeks. so it will have some impact in the -- but it's really the back end of the current quarter. so it's really going to be more indicative of the price that will be carried heading into next fiscal year.
jared garber -- goldman sachs -- analyst
'23. ok. great. that's really helpful.
thanks so much.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, jared.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from joshua long. joshua, your line is live. please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
joshua long -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. thank you. piper sandler. wanted to follow up on the new price piece as well.
as you mentioned, in six windows thus far, six incremental pricing actions thus far. just curious what you've learned in terms of the guests and where they're at. i mean, the narrative we're hearing is that maybe in line with what you're seeing too, more frequent but smaller price increases, and there doesn't seem to be too much pushback. but just curious what you've experienced and how you think about reworking that value proposition, as you mentioned in some of your prepared comments.
obviously, you want to keep things balanced and you want to provide some optionality for the guest, but just curious what you can share there that doesn't tip your hand too much before those new menu items come out.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
sure. well, josh, like we said, we understand the challenges with the inflationary pressure we're seeing but we also understand the importance of getting your pricing strategy right. and so we have chosen to be probably more thoughtful in terms of timing-wise through this year about our pricing action. we've tested them all before we've taken them across the system to make sure that we were understanding the guest reaction, and we've taken them across different channels, whether they be base business, virtual brands, delivery, to make sure that the impact to the demand side of the equation wasn't too onerous, that we weren't chasing away too many guests with these price increases.
and as you've said and as most people have said, so far the consumer has been fairly receptive to these pricing actions. we do see in the broader industry data, some concerns about consumers' value ratings and how they're kind of reacting. so we want to be cautious to that and always be looking at kind of their expectations and their perceptions of value. as we think about our value propositions, we are restructuring those as we talked about.
that menu will come out here shortly. it's been in test. we feel good about the way we've restructured our platforms to deliver better margins, but also to deliver more pricing flexibility across geographies and across various menu items, especially as we're starting to see commodity prices significantly different in various categories, right? and that's been one of the benefits of chili's, is we've got a varied menu. we've been able to, in the past, kind of move around some of the cost issues that have affected product because they've been more unique to whether it's beef or chicken or -- and now it's a little harder to move around when everything is kind of moving up, but we anticipate we'll see more of that going forward, kind of more of the typical, hey, this is the product that's going to be the most challenged and how do we move the mix around that and get our guests to kind of maybe shop a little bit differently in our restaurants at a more favorable cost area in the menu.
so that's where we're at. we're excited about it. but again, we're very cautious about how we move forward with price to make sure that our long-term value proposition, especially at chili's, is intact. and especially as we look at kind of a little bit of an uncertain future with regard to where the inflationary pressures are going to take the consumer, we want to make sure we have that real strong value proposition for them to lean into.
joshua long -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. that's very helpful. when we think about trends by day part or geography, anything worth calling out there? i know you mentioned that as dining rooms have come back in, the off-premise has been holding in there as well. but just curious if we kind of expand that conversation out to either day of the week, day part, regionality, anything that's worth calling out or that you found interesting.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
well, there's a lot of things going on that are very interesting, josh. without giving too much away, i will say there's some geographical. not everyone's reacting the same. as we kind of come out of a post-covid environment, you are still seeing more regional variability than we typically had seen prior, right? i mean where in the past a two- to three-point difference in sales trends was probably what you'd get.
you're still seeing some high-single low-teen numbers with regard to various geographical areas and their response to this now, kind of what we'll call maybe a little bit of a post-covid world. so we anticipate those things kind of settling out. and we see upside to that because we're in some of those areas in fairly large numbers. so that's where we see some upside as those areas get a little more on their feet, if you will, post-covid.
so taking some of those a little bit longer. beyond that, i think that we like the portfolio for that reason. we're everywhere. and for the most part, we balance off and balance out some of these kind of more challenged areas with the ones that are doing better.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
josh, from a day part standpoint, still staying pretty typical to what we've seen. it's a two-thirds, one-third dinner to lunch. i would note that you're probably seeing a little increased favorability on your weekend lunch side of the equation, which again i think is reflective of more normal activities at a higher rate than we've seen a little bit lower early day lunch part, which probably is indicative of reopening to a great extent. so really kind of opting back to what we've typically seen in a pre-covid structure.
joshua long -- piper sandler -- analyst
very helpful. and if i could squeeze one more in on the cogs visibility that you have running about 11% for the basket now. just curious to your commentary, i mean is that everything going up higher, i mean, largely protein-driven, any sort of commentary you can provide there? and then what type of visibility do you have? are we still in that environment where locking in pieces of the basket doesn't necessarily make sense for the premiums you have to pay?
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yes. i mean, josh, again, the big drivers of our basket are really the proteins, right? so chicken, beef. and you're seeing more broad kind of movements in the whole chicken complex as well, right? so what has historically been kind of a wings environment with volatility is now kind of moved more into other more traditionally stable chicken products like breast meat. and so that's just kind of out there right now.
we'll -- again, we don't -- when we look at the commodities environment and you just do kind of some of the math on the costs that are going into the input side of this, it doesn't really add up to these prices. so there's got to be inefficiencies, as we all know, in the distribution, in the supply chain side that are being taken into consideration that are taking these prices higher than they would normally go up. and then there's, frankly, just some opportunistic pricing going on. and both of those things, we think, will settle themselves out and bring us back to a more reasonable level in the not-too-distant future, although nobody knows exactly what that looks like.
so it is a little broader across those proteins, and that's why it's a little just harder to kind of move people around, and we're a little more cautious about just pricing right for it because we do believe it will come back to a more reasonable level here in the not-too-distant future.
joshua long -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. thank you.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
sure.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from john ivankoe. john, your line is live. please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
hey, john. are you here?
operator
john, your line is live. please go ahead.
john ivankoe -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. sorry about that, guys. the question is on capex, new store development, i guess, overall capital return. and obviously, or maybe not obviously, i mean i ask this in the context of the stock price and the stock price declined today.
i mean, i guess, how much does senior management and does the board kind of think about previous periods where brinker has added a lot of value to shareholders. and i go back and i think about maybe it was kind of the 2008 and 2009 timeframe where there was a significant reduction in capex where capex was less in d&a, we saw this enormous free cash flow yield, capital return to shareholders, and you basically focused all of your attention on improving returns at existing units and basically not really growing new units at all. so it's a philosophical question, but you guys know how i think. and i know how you kind of responded in the past.
i mean, how do we kind of consider this current environment? and again, if the stock is kind of an indication of, hey, listen, here are the type of returns that you can get in buying back your own equity, why doesn't significantly slowing down that capex and new unit construction make more sense in the strategy in what is obviously still a not great consumer environment in a very bad cost environment. and thank you for allowing me to ask that long question.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
sure. sure, john. i think it's -- it probably has more to do with your time lines, john. i think if we were talking about what would you do today, investing back in our stock at these prices, we think it's a great investment because we absolutely believe that these prices are too low.
we kind of understand what the market's reacting to in terms of this inflationary environment. but when you think back, you referenced back to 2008, we were opening 125 restaurants a year in that time frame. so when we talk about growing the portfolio from a traditional standpoint to 20 to 30, it's significantly lower capital spend than what was going on prior to the time you referenced. and we're doing both, frankly.
and when we talk about the opportunity we had back in 2010 through 2012, we really got much better at the operating level and strengthen the business model. we see those opportunities now with the new handhelds and bringing technology to bear with our new service model upfront and what we're excited about doing with our kitchens again, which is what we did 10 years ago that you're referencing, investing those dollars into being more efficient in the heart of the house, helping our margin situation as well there and helping us build sales. and so i would just say, as we think about how to help our investors realize gains, we believe it's a balanced approach, but organic growth is key to that story. and you've got to have an organic growth model, and that's what we're focused on, is how do we balance that organic growth model.
we generate a lot of cash, but we want to have an organic growth story as well. and so when we think about virtual brands and different distribution points to grow the business organically as well as all the things we just talked about, that's why we're trying to find that sweet spot there, to bring great cash returns, to deliver back to the shareholder that way, but also find a good organic growth story.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. the one piece i'd add to that too, john, is when the period of time you referenced before, we did it at a more leveraged basis too. so again, the balance is going to be important as we think about this going forward, but we want to do it at -- and we want to be able to invest in the business, grow organically, and also return capital to shareholders, but at a lower leverage position. so part of this is the transition.
covid obviously got in the way and slowed that down for a period of time. but once we rebalance the debt levels back to our targets, that's really the trade-off. then you can start directing more of those dollars back toward the return to shareholder standpoint, while still growing at a decent clip and investing in the business.
john ivankoe -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah. and certainly, and i guess maybe the question was whether the debt holders or to equity holders, but at least not a new unit construction. so let me ask this question just as memory or maybe it's changed. how much is the fiscal '23 capex guide? how much of that capex is -- would you consider to be fully nondiscretionary or necessary, if you will, to basically maintain or grow the cash flow in the business? how much flexibility do you have if that conversation were to happen in the future?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah. you do maintain a lot of good flexibility there, john because when i think about maintenance expense and ongoing it investment, you're really going to be in that $70 million to $80 million range, and there's probably even a little variability in those numbers. but that's kind of what i consider to be that keep the engines running and moving forward kind of capital spend.
john ivankoe -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
that's great. thanks for the patients, guys.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
thank you, john.

thank you. and the next question is coming from david palmer. david, your line is live. please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks. evercore isi. i would imagine it might be too early to talk about fiscal '23 restaurant margins in total, but you're going to be making some changes here in the near term in terms of the menu simplification, the price increases. and i would imagine also you have pretty good visibility on your cost through the rest of this calendar year.
so i'm wondering if you could talk about how you're thinking about restaurant margins sort of exiting fiscal '22 into the first half of '23. i guess i'm specifically thinking you might be on path to doing 12% plus restaurant margins in the first half, which might set the table for something closer to 13% for that next year. but i don't want to put numbers in your mouth here. how are you thinking about margins?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yes. and david, i don't want to get into a '23 discussion or forecast. at that point, we'll have a very robust discussion about that on the next call. but i think, again, as you heard us comment on some of the drivers impacting current margins, i think there's opportunity there.
we do believe commodity prices will moderate. that can have a meaningful impact to margins. and i think we gave you kind of -- we see that moderation starting in calendar '23, which again would be the back half of our next fiscal year, so. but we also, again, as we continue to improve turnover and improve training, there are dollars that are impacting in those areas.
that's at 60 to 70 basis points of transitory costs i talked about. we think we can start to wean that out of the system. so again, there's opportunities to continue to improve margins. and i think we will do that over time.
i'm not going to put any specific number on the table today, but i think the progression of top-line growth too is going to help too. i would expect you will see a discussion of continued top-line growth for the brand as we move into next year. and with that comes leverage ability opportunities. optimistic on the direction, david.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
yes. no, i hear that. i guess i'm curious also about the two things, that service -- the customer experience today and service levels, you talked about labor hours in the front of house being near all-time lows, but i -- we've all heard stories about not just chili's, but everybody in this industry has kind of had some bad service scores from the consumer for obvious reasons. but i wonder how you're thinking about that and where you are versus pre-covid and getting that customer experience up.
and then i'm also curious if you -- that 13.7% to 14.2% margin that you talked about as an intermediate target, is that still a pretty good working intermediate target for margins? and i'll pass it on.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
yes. so two questions. so let me just give you the service take, david, as we see it. so two components, right? so first, as we mentioned, it was getting staffed back up.
and so a lot of new team members in the system and in the industry, right? i mean, we just had a big turnover. the good news is we have more team members in our restaurants today than we had pre-pandemic. so we've got the team members we need to run the restaurants, but they're newer and they're not trained as well, and we've changed our system, our service model. and so we need to -- what we know is when that model is running well and running as it's kind of programmed to run, service scores are outstanding.
team members make a lot of money, more money than they were making pre, and the experience is better. it's faster. it's more personable. so we're focused on getting to that state with all of our restaurants as quick as possible.
and we're just in that curve of training everybody up, getting all of the leadership to understand the model right now and get comfortable with it because it's a new service model for most of the system and then moving it throughout every team member that runs it. so that's that. additionally, as we talked about, we see opportunities with the kitchen to get the kitchen side of it much more efficient. and that will speed service up.
that will get one of the biggest challenges that you have in the restaurant industry right is, hey, where is my food. and so as we can speed up the process in the kitchen while delivering a better, more consistent product, we see another real win for the guests there as well, as well as helping us put more -- push more people through their dining room, get them in and out of the restaurants in the timely fashion that they're looking for. so we see a real nice bright future for both our team members and our guests with regard to the systems and the technology we've got in play to kind of move us forward. first, we got to train, and then we've got to roll out some kitchen stuff to even take it to the next level.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
david, in the second half of your question, without getting into any specifics, obviously a lot has changed since we talked about those numbers originally. but again, i remain optimistic in our ability to improve margins over time. again, these initiatives have a line of sight to how that can happen. i think, again, we'll continue to leverage our top line as we go forward.
so i know you used the term intermediate, anybody can have a perspective on what that means. but i do envision as we kind of move out of this inflationary cycle on the cogs side of the equation, whenever that happens, that you will see margin improvement out of the business.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, david.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] the next question is coming from brett levy. brett, your line is live. please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
brett levy -- mkm partners -- analyst
thank you. brett levy, mkm partners. just building a little bit more often for that question. on the labor side, as you think about your labor expectations.
i know you said you don't expect much pressure on wages and you did talk about that 50 to 75 basis points of transitory. can you pass out a little bit more given everything? that's going on competition for labor? how we should think about it from a cost perspective. you said you have stable you have a solid headcount, but how should we think about where you need to supplement that? and just from a broader brushstroke, what do you think you can do specifically to drive those gains. and then just secondarily, you talked about a 35% hit from january in your estimates was that already implied in the guidance from last quarter, or is that new to this morning's guidance? thanks.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
i come at -- 35 was not implied we didn't make any guidance commentary really on the last call. so and obviously we had not even close january at that time so 35 is implied in this guidance level.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
so we didn't count on it. but without getting too into the model, just what we're seeing out in the marketplace is that obviously with all of the movement in the industry negatively last summer, spring, and summer, there was a lot of pressure on restaffing and with that, increase in demand. a little bit of a challenge in supply. you saw people having to raise rates wage rates to recruit.
and we were in that situation as well as having to spend quite a bit of money just recruiting. so advertising expense for recruitment is up significantly, just getting these folks into the restaurants. and the good news is, especially over the last three months, i mean, you've seen the employment numbers, the ones that just came out today that i saw showed almost 500,000 jobs added in march. and i think almost 100,000 of those came from -- came into the hospitality area.
so we're continuing as an industry to be staffed up. and that takes the demand or the supply and demand equation. it balances that out a little more. so we're not seen as much pressure to have to raise rates to just get folks in.
there's always going to be legislative pressure, right? so minimum wage increases are going to happen on their calendar. but it looks like everything we can see that the demand-supply pressures are easing and we're not going to see as much of that in the coming months as we have seen in the last 12. so that's really kind of how we see that marketplace going forward.
brett levy -- mkm partners -- analyst
thank you.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
all right. thanks, brett.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from dennis geiger. dennis, your line is live. please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
thank you. it's ubs. just wondering if you could speak at all a little bit more to what you're seeing very recently from a sales perspective, maybe in the quarter-to-date period at a high level, just given the relatively dynamic environment that we're in right now. and then i guess, more importantly, i mean, you gave some helpful comments on the consumer broadly how you're thinking about the consumer relative to pricing, etc.
but i'm just curious if you could comment on anything that you've seen to date from your customers, any changes in how they're using the menu? that weakness from the lower-income consumer, specific to do your brand, anything on virtual brands where behaviors are changing just anything along those lines that you've observed to date. thank you.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
hey, dennis. without getting too granular into the quarter, i mean, i'd say in general, we're seeing stability in the sales experience through from the third quarter, the back end, february, march. we already talked about what happened in january driven but since we've kind of been post-covid major impacts the trends have been holding and that's encouraging. it's solid sales levels above pre-pandemic at both brands now and the virtual brands are now, comping positive.
so we feel good about kind of that top-line situation, especially, given we've taken a lot more pricing we've taken in the last, 20 years in the in a period of time is short as this. so we're watching it closely. the trends seem to be holding. it's more about, ok, what where's the consumer going to go as far as the economy times up and maybe with all of the strength on the balance sheet that consumers have and the continued great labor market, that they'll work through this and there will be more opportunity to price if we have to price, but also will as we see commodities kind of mitigate and move themselves down to more moderate levels.
we'll be where we need to be without having to price a whole lot more, but we're very cautious about watching that. i'd say anything on the menu side that we've seen with regard to shifts in behaviors have been more driven by us than by consumers. we've pushed people in and out of the menu or moved them, shifted them more from a marketing perspective than they've kind of gone on their own. and we do that.
we do that quite often just to make sure that we've got them where we think is the best place for them to sit relative to the variety of our menu and the costs that we're dealing with.
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
appreciate that. and one quick follow-up on that, if i may, just as far as the look ahead, if the consumer becomes particularly pressured. you've spoken to this some, but just thinking about how your position from a value perspective, you haven't taken much pricing in recent years. you've got some really compelling promotional offers, as a staple to the menu, of course.
just anything more there on how resilient the brand will be. and on a relative basis, maybe where you take share from the category, if the consumer comes under incremental pressure, if all that's fair and if you have anything else to add to that.
wyman roberts -- chief executive officer and president
well, then i am i'm glad you asked the question. i don't think it gets brought up enough in terms of market share of traffic. so our firm belief is that that's probably the most critical measure of brand strength and success. and we've taken market share of traffic and casual dining and continue to take even in this environment for the last four years.
and so when we think about the position of the brand, especially chili's, it's a beloved brand. it's a ubiquitous brand and it just needs to be available for folks. and obviously, the business model has to work, but the business model works so much better when there's more bodies in the restaurant. and so we do trade-off in the short term, maybe some potential sales that would come from pricing to ensure that we have the traffic that we know is critical to the success of running a busy restaurant.
it's just very difficult to run a restaurant successfully if you don't have a lot of bodies in it. and so that's our positioning. it holds up well against our value propositions and against the balance of both price and other elements that come into building our value proposition. we think we're well-positioned in a tougher economic environment for the consumer to embrace us.
and so we're making sure that that doesn't get damaged as we kind of work our way into what could be a more difficult consumer environment.
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
thanks, wyman.

operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the brinker international q4 f'22 earnings conference call. at this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for questions and comments after the presentation. it is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, mika ware, vp of finance and investor relations at brinker. ma'am, the floor is yours.
mika ware -- vice president of finance and investor relations
thank you, paul. and good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in today's call. with me are kevin hochman, our chief executive officer and president; and joe taylor, our chief financial officer. results for the quarter were released earlier this morning and are available on our website at brinker.com.
as is our practice kevin, and joe will first make prepared comments related to our operating performance and strategic initiatives then we will open the call for your questions. before beginning our comments, i would like to remind everyone of our safe harbor regarding forward-looking statements. during our call, management may discuss certain items which are not based entirely on historical facts. any such items should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
all such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated. such risks and uncertainties include factors more completely described in this morning's press release and the company's filings with the sec. and of course, on the call, we may refer to certain non-gaap financial measures that management uses in its review of the business and believes will provide insight into the company's ongoing operations. and with that said, i will now turn the call over to kevin. 
kevin hochman -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, mika, and good morning, everyone. with this being our first call since wyman's retirement, i wanted to take a moment to recognize him as the leader of our great company for the past nine years and to thank him for our many strategic accomplishments. in addition to being a coach and a friend to so many brinker heads, wyman led the growth of our brand's significant technology improvements and developed an industry-leading off-premise business. i know he's listening and cheering us on, so on behalf of our 62,000 team members, thank you, wyman, for entrusting your legacy to us and preparing us for the future.
this organization has a solid foundation, well-known brands that have stood the test of time, and an ownership model that allows us to move quickly, a strong leadership team and the most dedicated operators in the industry. during my first two months on the job, i've spent a lot of time in the field with our restaurant teams and our above restaurant leaders to better understand their challenges and to exchange ideas on how we can accelerate the business together. i'm happy to share they are hungry for growth and they have great ideas on how we can make running restaurants easier, more profitable, and a better experience for both our team members and our guests. and while i'm forming our longer-term growth strategy with our senior executive team, in order to deliver better results over time, we must deliver meaningful improvement to the four-wall economics of owning a chili's and owning a maggiano's.
so we're working quickly to identify the things we can do to grow the business sustainably, improve the guest experience, reduce cost and complexity, and implement more strategic pricing, which will in turn expand restaurant margins, and grow profits. our evolved pricing strategy will include providing focused, everyday value for guests who need it, but will move away from frequent and deep discounting. we will also right-size the mix of everyday menu items offered on deal, but we'll make sure there's something available for the cashed-up customer who needs a superior value to enjoy casual dining. we will also do a better job of recovering expenses for inflated commodities as well as the added costs for delivering chili's, maggiano's, and our virtual brands.
i have chartered two teams of senior executives to make quick interventions that will build momentum in our business. one team is dedicated to near-term ideas to drive sustainable and profitable sales layers. they have been charged with identifying customer insight-driven sales opportunities, as well as bringing exciting new initiatives to our dining rooms to help accelerate traffic recovery. the other team is charged with simplifying operations so we can improve our guest experience.
we will take unnecessary cost and complexity out of the business, which will free up labor to reinvest in the things that will help us win with the guest. the team is looking at all aspects of operations from focusing on the menu, to streamlining back-of-house prep, to eliminating time-consuming processes that don't add value to our guest experience. we shared some of those early ideas with our operators at our annual chili's general manager conference last week, and i have to say the team is very excited to get after it. i have also asked our chili's executive team to refocus the portfolio, a project we are working on to prioritize the most important and stop the ones that won't have a meaningful impact on our core business.
i'm very pleased with the progress we are making on the prioritization front. as for our longer-term strategy, our biggest opportunity is also to focus on the core chili's business. we must identify how our brand can uniquely add value for guests in a modern and relevant way, strengthen our positioning within casual dining, leverage technology to remove friction for guests and team members, and continue to reduce unnecessary complexity. all of which should lead to a better guest experience, higher sales, and stronger four-wall economics.
i am also very pleased to share that we brought on george felix as our new chili's chief marketing officer. george is known for taking well-known brands and reminding customers what makes their brand special in a contemporary, relevant way. he is currently working to define our northstar positioning in the market, which will help us make strategic choices on marketing, as well as help, guide us on where to focus operations and improve our guest experience. i'm excited that george is already making an impact with several of our sales driving and simplification initiatives.
as for maggiano's, it's on a good trajectory. the improvements we made to both off-premise business and removing costs from the middle of the p&l during covid have allowed the brand to emerge much stronger. maggiano's menu travel is off-premise exceptionally well, and now that dining rooms are coming back, we have lots of runway for growth. i couldn't be prouder of the work that steve provo and his team have led to getting maggiano's through the pandemic, which i would expect will continue to be a source of growth for our business.
we find ourselves in interesting times with the inflationary environment, a dimmer economic outlook, and a worried consumer. i'm confident the interventions we're putting in place today to simplify operations, to win with the guests, to implement more strategic pricing, to launch sales-driving initiatives, and to take cost out of the business will help us fight through our near-term challenges. they will also build the momentum we need to put the business in a stronger position for longer-term, sustainable growth. now, i'll hand the call over to joe to walk you through the numbers.
go ahead, joe.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
hey, thank you, kevin, and welcome to the quarterly earnings calls. and good morning, everyone. as detailed in this morning's press release, brinker reported total revenues of $1.22 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year '22. consolidated comp sales for the quarter rose 3.1% as pricing and mix increases offset negative traffic.
fourth quarter adjusted eps was reported at $1.15. now, let me unpack several of the pieces from the top line through the bottom line results. as a reminder, we had the 53rd week in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, which impacts the year-over-year comparison of revenues, margins, and eps for the recently completed quarter and fiscal year. our restaurant comp sales are stated as 52-week comparisons.
at the brand level, chili's comp sales on a year-over-year basis were positive 0.3% lapping fourth quarter comp sales of 59.8% in the prior year. looking at sales performance relative to the pre-covid environment. fourth quarter average weekly sales of 59,500 were up 4.5% when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. traffic was negative at chili's for the quarter and decelerated throughout as some guests appeared to react to the challenging inflationary environment, particularly during the weeks of very elevated gas prices.
we also experienced approximately a 1% negative sales impact to the quarter as some restaurants were not able to fully open dining rooms, particularly at peak times, or had to throttle back online orders giving limited staff availability. i would note that chili's traffic trends since the end of the quarter saw sequential improvement into august, although they remain in the mid-single digit negative territory. we did see positive sales and traffic in chili's dining rooms for the quarter as guests returned to more normal dine-in routines. at the same time, their off-premise channels remain strong, constituting approximately 34% of sales during the quarter.
maggiano's continued a solid recovery, posting positive restaurant comp sales of 30% for the quarter, driven by positive price, favorable mix, and strong traffic from the return of their dining room guests. when compared to the pre-covid fourth quarter of fiscal '19, average weekly sales increased by 7.3%. importantly, the post-covid level of the brand's off-premise business remains intact at above 20% of sales, providing a meaningful avenue to improve guest frequency as the brand moves forward. brinker's franchise and other revenue increased year over year, due to incremental gift card breakage and increased banquet revenue related to maggiano's.
moving further down the p&l. our fourth quarter restaurant operating margin was 10.3%, down from the prior year due to the magnitude of inflation we experienced throughout the major categories of restaurant margin. restaurant margin was also negatively impacted by approximately 80 basis points from lapping the 53rd week of the prior year. food and beverage costs as a percent of company sales were unfavorable by 310 basis points compared to the prior year.
as you might expect, this was driven by higher commodity costs, with inflation hitting close to 15% for the quarter, a high for the fiscal year. every major commodity category was negatively impacted, with poultry being our largest year-over-year increase. chicken mix is high across our menus, with approximately 52% of our overall protein mix exposed to the high-cost dynamics of the poultry market. fortunately, we're now starting to see steady cost reductions for chicken working their way into our supply chain.
a trend that has the potential to create favorable cost comparisons as we move further into the fiscal year. labor for the quarter was in favorable 70 basis points, primarily driven by wage rate increases in the 6% to 7% range. additional hours were utilized in the restaurants as we incrementally staffed our dining rooms and continued elevated levels of training expense for new team members as a result of higher turnover rates than we traditionally experience. restaurant expense was unfavorable by 280 basis points as higher energy prices inflated our utility expense, and we experienced higher rent and increased repair and maintenance costs.
we also lapped a one-time advertising-related credit of approximately $6 million taken in the fourth quarter over the prior fiscal year. operating cash flow for the fourth quarter and fiscal year remained strong with $41 million and $252 million recorded for those time frames, respectively. adjusted ebitda for the quarter totaled $100 million, bringing the fiscal year adjusted ebitda to $355 million. now turning to our outlook for fiscal year '23.
this morning's press release included several target ranges for our current fiscal year. our cautious view of economic conditions, particularly for our value-oriented guests, reflects negative traffic expectations in the low single digits for chili's. we believe the significant headwinds from commodity inflation will lessen as we move through the year, a trend that could continue for a period beyond the current fiscal year. our year-over-year increase in food and beverage costs is forecasted to be at their highest point, almost 400 basis points in the current first quarter before narrowing mid-year and turning favorable year over year by the fourth quarter.
for the year, food and beverage costs are expected to be up in the neighborhood of 100 basis points. for the full year, we have the following expectations, revenues in the $3.9 billion to $4 billion range, capex in the $155 million to $165 million range, weighted average shares in the $44 million to $45 million range, and annual adjusted eps in the range of $2.45 to $2.85 for the fiscal year '23. as it relates to pricing, we are planning near-term pricing actions for both brands. chili's is expected to exit the first quarter at close to 8% price, a level the brand will maintain throughout the fiscal year.
maggiano's will exit the first quarter in the mid-5% range and is anticipated to average closer to 7% for the year. regarding restaurant development, the schedule for our current fiscal year has slowed somewhat as several anticipated openings are pushed into fiscal 2024. we now anticipate opening 19 new locations during the fiscal '23 year. let me provide some insights on quarter one.
our current first quarter is likely to be the low point of our operating results for the fiscal year, as we work through the cresting of inflationary pressures for our brands. with that in mind, let me provide some specific insights for the quarter that also help define the expected meaningful positive progression of operating performance, as we move into and through the remaining quarters of the year. as is typical, we expect the first quarter to be our lowest revenue quarter, generating between $920 million and $930 million of company sales for the period. the year-over-year impact of inflationary increases for the first quarter will increase costs in all the major categories of restaurant margin.
food and beverage expenses alone are expected to be up more than $50 million for the quarter. when combined with the lower revenue of this quarter, we expect restaurant operating margin to be between 4.5% and 5.5% for the first quarter. this restaurant margin will result in an overall operating loss for the quarter with a negative operating margin expected in the mid-3% range and first quarter adjusted eps estimated in a range of negative $0.70 to negative $0.60. while we anticipate a disappointing start to the fiscal year, we maintain a clear line of sight to meaningfully improved operating performance throughout the year as incremental pricing, lower food, and beverage costs, and sales driving initiatives all kick in during subsequent quarters.
on behalf of the brinker leadership team, we're pleased to have kevin on board. he has quickly focused the team on simplifying operations, improving four-wall economics, and driving growth in the core business. i'm confident that this will not only move us through the current more difficult operating environment in better form but will provide the foundation for sustainable long-term growth and better profitability for brinker and its brands. and with my comments now complete, let us turn it back over to paul to moderate your questions.

thank you. ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [operator instructions] and the first question is coming from david palmer from evercore isi. david, your line is live.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks. good morning. just a question on strategy. kevin, you talked about some opportunities to improve the economics of the -- in the four walls with, perhaps pricing being a part of that.
but i'm wondering more about the investment areas that you see as an opportunity, is that labor, is that marketing? how are you thinking about ways that you can improve that guest experience that you were talking about in driving sales, in your highest margin business? thanks.
kevin hochman -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. thanks for the question, david. so we're thinking about it in two ways. one is there are some short-term interventions that we have to make that we just can't -- we cannot wait to make those interventions based on where the business environment is now.
and so, what i had the team working on is the short-term wins and then we'll talk in a second about what we're doing from it on a longer-term basis. so, i've charged a team with how we improve restaurant margins quickly. and obviously, the number one thing is to grow comp store sales. so we've got a growth team that we spun up that is looking at what are different areas that we can quickly grow the business and kind of mute some of the headwinds of traffic that we've seen.
obviously, strategic pricing, which we talked about in our prepared comments, there is a significant reduction in discounting that we're working on, that's in a couple of areas. one is we give away a lot of free food and our my chili's rewards. there's probably a better way to do that and still maintain the traffic that that drives without, constantly giving away free food every week. as well as redoing some of the value sections of our menu so that we don't have so much of our menu mix on the deal, but still have very attractive, exciting offers on whole meals for that guest that's cash trapped that otherwise couldn't enjoy casual dining.
and then we're also working on some cost reductions that will also help with also labor would simplification in a restaurant. so specifically that's eliminating low mixing or redundant menu items, eliminating redundant pantry skus that are in the back of the restaurants, removing unneeded dishware which will help with both labor as well as some cost on small errors, and eliminating unneeded processes that happen that don't really help the guests but end up being literally years of labor hours annually that we're spending money on, and then, reducing administrative work in the back of the restaurants that's not helping the guest. we also are working on some new item innovations to drive traffic, which i'm excited that you'll see in the next couple of weeks of starting to roll out, which will also help drive some traffic in our bar. and then, the last thing that we're doing is updating our strategic loyalty program to drive more traffic by reducing some of those discounts, i was telling you.
that's the kind of short-term interventions that we're making. i'm meeting with my leadership team offsite in the next couple of weeks that we're going to talk about, what are the big things that we need to do over the next few years to unleash both restaurant margins and accelerated growth for our business. and i think those are the big discussions on labor, and equipment, and all the things that we need to make long-term improvements in the guest experience. and i hope, when we're ready to surface with those interventions are that we'll be able to share them with all of you.

thank you. and the next question is coming from nicole miller from piper sandler. nicole, your line is live.
nicole miller -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you so much. one for you, joe, first and then i have one for you, kevin, as well, if i can sneak it in. but joe, you said something about dining rooms, 34%. can you just -- can you walk us through, please, in the fourth quarter or even for the year, frankly, doesn't matter the construct of the revenues for the dining room off-premise? and i guess kind of the everything else bucket, but it would be nice to get at that it's just wings.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah. nicole, i think the comment you're referring to is 34% of the fourth quarter chili's sales mix was off-premise, which is relatively --
nicole miller -- piper sandler -- analyst
that was off-prem. ok.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
that was off-prem. we did see, slight traffic improvement and positive comp in the dining rooms for the quarter. you're starting to see, i think, a little bit more of a normalization of that dine-in experience. so the relative mix dine-in into two off-premise has remained relatively consistent and that kind of two-thirds, one-third, mixing area over the course of the year.
nicole miller -- piper sandler -- analyst
perfect. just want to match that up with what margins might be in those channels. and then, kevin, can you talk about, the customer base you have today? and as you think through the strategy options, and totally understand your thinking through them, is it changing that mix? is it changing the frequency, both like how are you thinking about that?
kevin hochman -- chief executive officer and president
well, we have to start with just who our customer base is today. and it's pretty broadly spread out. so it's not like we're, overrepresented with low-income guests or high-income guests. it's pretty much representative of the casual dining population, and so we have to play a barbell on this, right? number one, we have to make sure that low-income guests that is extremely cash trapped.
how do we make sure that we have offerings on the everyday menu, that they know they can get an affordable meal at chili's and be excited about that and continue to come in? on the flip side, we've got to mitigate how much trade down that we get from our guests that can afford more, as well as start to innovate so that we can drive both check and traffic with that guest. so we think there are a lot of opportunities, both in terms of food innovation, as well as in drink innovation to drive a higher check, guest check, as well as drive more traffic with those guests.

thank you. the next question is coming from chris o'cull from stifel. chris, your line is live.
chris o'cull -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thank you. good morning, guys.
kevin hochman -- chief executive officer and president
hi, chris.
chris o'cull -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
i had a question for joe and kevin. first, kevin, i'm interested in hearing your assessment of the virtual brands and maybe how important you believe those brands will be to the company's future growth.
kevin hochman -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. so let me just start with virtual brands will continue to play a meaningful role in our business. i mean, they're currently about 6% of the mix. so, they're a part of our business now.
that said, we do need to right-size the time and attention, and investment for a sales layer that is 6% of the business. so specifically we have to make sure that we're right-sizing the amount of incremental pantry sku ingredients that we need to service these brands. for example, on maggiano's virtual brand, it's currently 26 unique skus to service about 2% of the business, that is just too much, right? so we've got to make sure that we cut that number probably by more than half. we think we can retain most of the sales mix on that business, but make it a whole lot easier for our team members to run that part of the business, as well as mitigate a lot of the food waste that shows up in cost in our business.
on the opportunity on it's just wings, it's a lot less in terms of simplification because it was designed, i think exceptionally well to marry within our kitchen. there are really two things we're working on that brand. one is we have a smoked wing on that lineup that is extremely well mixing. it provides a lot of food waste.
we think that most of that volume will migrate back into it's just wings. so we think that we can improve the p&l on it's just wing by eliminating that item. the other thing that we're working on it's just wings is because a lot of those orders come in a very tight window and typically it's during that kind of busy dinner service, we get kind of stopped up sometimes on zone one, which is our fry zone. and so we've got to make sure that we figure out ways to build capacity in that area because i think both it's just wings as well as in the chili's business that zone one will be a source of growth going forward.
so we're working very closely with our operations team and understanding how we can free up some capacity in zone one. the other things that we're doing to grow the business, we're going to take pricing and virtual brands as the vast majority of businesses go out to delivery customers who are much more focused on convenience and are willing to pay for that convenience, i know that from my pizza days. and then, we are going to be taking some of the virtual brand investment and putting it back on core chili's. and we just look at the numbers even in just off-premise core chili's does roughly 5 to 6 times the business in our virtual brands.
and so we think there's also an opportunity not just in the virtual brands, but growing off-premise on the core chili's business. we also have some growth ideas for virtual brands. so one of the big ideas that i'm really bullish about that we're going to be rolling out next week is taking all of the it's just wings, wing flavors, and curly fries, and putting them on core chili's. and if you think about that, the core chili's does about 24 times the sales of it's just wings.
so why not take these amazing flavors, and these amazing curly fries, and put them into chili's business, as a premium at the bar? we are very bullish on what that could mean for the business. and likewise, we have an amazing -- we call it the crispy chicken crispers, it's a chicken tender. why not take that product on chili's, and put it in it's just wings to create a meaningful business in that business? chicken tenders in the chicken segment are a lot bigger than chicken wings. so we think, we'll probably never sell more chicken tenders than chicken wings on it's just wings.
but we think it could be a meaningful source of growth without any new incremental skus, or incremental training, or incremental process for the back of the house. so we're very bullish on being able to leverage some of the great items on it's just wings on core chili's, as well as doing it vice versa to grow both businesses.
chris o'cull -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you. i just had another quick one for you, joe. it looks like the company expects earnings to increase by about 18% and 19% for the last three quarters of the year.
assuming the midpoint of your guidance for the first quarter in the full year. is that about right? and are there any unique things that are going to drive that growth?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah, it definitely is a forecast that obviously starts off in a negative position and ramps up quickly as we move to the last three quarters. a number of things, and obviously, the pricing initiatives we've talked about is the elimination of discounting has an incremental impact as we move through the fiscal year. the commodity, the inflation cycle and cycle and total, but specifically the commodity cycle we see materially improving as we get through the year and actually turn to a year-over-year favorable dynamic as we move into that fourth quarter. so yeah, that hockey stick is in place, and we have a pretty good line of sight to it too.
i think you kind of hitting the dynamics based on the points and the guidance that you're referencing. so, yes.
chris o'cull -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from jeffrey bernstein from barclays. jeffrey, your line is live.
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you very much. two questions, first, kevin, excited to obviously have someone from the industry leading the team. just wondering if you can maybe talk about the differences you see between running a qsr versus a casual brand and seemingly a franchise system that is primarily a company-operated system.
if you could talk about maybe the collateral implications or the potential synergies that you see and maybe what your greatest strengths are as you make that transition from one type of business to the other?
kevin hochman -- chief executive officer and president
well, it's a great question. i'd start with some of the real positives that i see, the fact that we own, most of our own of our restaurants has allowed us to move a whole lot faster, i think than we would be able to do in a franchise system, and we need to make some quick interventions. and so, the teams have really responded well and it's allowed us to move very fast. i think as we get further down the road in terms of technology improvements, one of the things that i'm talking about, with our leadership team is what can we use technology to do, to make it both a better experience for the guests as well as, take some of the work out of the team members hands.
and, in a world where we own most of our own restaurants, it gets a whole lot easier to test and roll out a whole lot faster. so technology, as and everybody that covers the industry is where everything is going, right? so i think that's going to be a huge advantage for us. i think there are some things i can bring from kind of my qsr days that i think can help the business. i think more strategic pricing, i think qsr does an exceptional job of understanding, how do we make sure that the great values that we offer in advertising drive traffic.
and so we need to make sure that we have industry-leading value with our 3 for me program that starts at $10.99. and yet, in my experience, because we haven't spent a whole lot of dollars on it, a lot of customers don't know about it, right? so, one of the lessons in qsr is, if you're going to have a great value, going to make sure that you talk about it and quite frankly, have been a little bit invisible, in our business the last few years. and we need to get back on air once we're ready to do that. so that's one example.
another thing i think that we can bring is, how do we manage the merchandizing of value and the merchandizing of items at the restaurant level to make sure that we're driving as much check and trade up as we can, as well as minimizing trade down. i think these are very obvious opportunities that i've seen early on and that we're working on, and i think you're going to see improvements in our restaurant margins because of some of those learnings i'm bringing from qsr.
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays -- analyst
understood. and the follow-up, just because of the fact that you come from a portfolio of brands and i was wondering whether you could offer some thoughts on how you see brinker best positioned. and you look back a decade or so, and brinker had eight or nine brands now running two, along with a couple of virtual brands. and i was wondering how you think about a portfolio versus a single brand approach, whether you have any views on that as you look forward?
kevin hochman -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. i don't have a perspective on that now. i know that's probably not the answer that you want to hear. i'm really focused on improving the four-wall economics of both chili's and maggiano's, and that's really what i've kept the team focused on right now.
obviously, if we can do that successfully, that opens up a whole lot more opportunities in the future for whatever we want to do in terms of a long-term strategy. but it starts with making sure that we have very strong restaurant margins and four-wall economics because we own all these chili's and maggiano's, and that's what i'm committed to doing with the team.
jeffrey bernstein -- barclays -- analyst
understood. thank you. best of luck.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from andrew strelzik from bmo. andrew, your line is live.
andrew strelzik -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking the question. i just had two for me, one first. as a follow-up, do you have a sense based on, obviously, the cost environment pricing that you're talking about some channel shifts that have occurred over the last couple of years? do you have a sense for what restaurant margin this business should be able to achieve, kind of as you are a goal may be in mind, as you kind of work toward implementing the strategies that you've talked about? and then, my other question is just on capital allocation priorities.
obviously, no buyback in the guidance, which is not unusual, and lower capex, it sounds like some delays in the unit growth. i'm just curious, should we expect any changes in their kind of overtime? and does accelerating unit growth, which i know had been in the plan. does that make sense now? thanks.
kevin hochman -- chief executive officer and president
yes. let me take the restaurant margin question, and then, i'll kick it over to joe on the new build question. so we're in the -- we're kind of in the low double digits right now. i think, between 10% and 11% restaurant margins.
we think that we can probably get to the mid-teens. now, i don't know -- i don't have a specific timetable exactly on when. so -- but when we look at, i think we can get we can get a couple of points when we think about strategic pricing and reducing discounting, and then we think about operational improvements and leverage if we can get the business growing. now, i think mid-teens are achievable and that's where i'm going to have the team focused on.
i think if we can get to those numbers, certainly it's going to unlock a lot of value for our business. and that's what i have the team is laser-focused on.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
and i think that goes right into the capital allocation nicely because obviously, that will feed future capital allocation discussions as we go forward. andrew, you're right, this year, cap allocation is pretty straightforward. we're focused on the capex dynamics that $155 million to $165 million, which is the same buckets we've typically seen in there from development to reimage to obviously a big chunk of that are return maintenance expenses within the current fleet and it. and so it's a fairly straightforward and typical construct on the capex side of the equation, the new build construction has slowed somewhat, the markets a little bit longer date timelines on some of the construction, you have seen some increased costs which have caused us to pull back in different places to make sure that we are -- if we are constructing, we're constructing within a dynamic that we think we can get a good return.
and we've been pleased with the restaurant development we've done the last couple of years and the operational performance of that cohort. so, yes, i'm comfortable as we kind of move forward, continuing the restaurant development, we think it's a great opportunity to provide some incremental growth into the equation as we go forward. obviously, improving the four-wall economics is one of the best things we can do to continue to bolster the performance return of not only the existing fleet but these new builds as we move them forward. so we'll continue with a new piece of the equation.
other pieces of capital allocation down the road, obviously, we'll look at those opportunities based on the performance of the overall company and the cash flow generation. so that's kind of where the near-term is with the opportunity down the road.
andrew strelzik -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from brian mullan from deutsche bank. brian, your line is live.
brian mullan -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, thank you. just a little bit of a follow-up on development. the 19 that you are going to open this year, are these the ones that are simply under some form of construction now? and then, pausing a bit for the rest of the time all the operations get tightened up. or is that not the case? just a little clarity there.
and then kevin, it would be great to hear your longer-term thoughts on chili's development opportunity. how do you think about it over the long term? and do you need to see those mid-teens restaurant-level margins restored before you'd really want to lean in there aggressively? just any thoughts on, how you're thinking about it?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
brian yeah, i think it's not a bad way to think about it. it's not universal to where we've gone from the higher 20s that we talked about down to 19, but we have pushed back, some have pushed back just under the timelines that it's taking to develop and open a new restaurant. but we've also pushed back starting times for development and things of that nature. all those 19 are in the process.
yeah, so you're talking about committed leases and in most cases, some level of construction starting with that. so it's most of those openings will take place in the first half of the fiscal year. couple as you kind of move into the early part of the second half and we'll continue to then develop what that pipeline looks as we move more into the f'24 timeframe. and we could communicate that as we kind of go through the rest of this fiscal year.
kevin hochman -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. and to answer your question, how i think about development, i think it's kind of twofold. one is, as we complete our northstar work about, what is -- where chili's positioning in the marketplace, i think that will help us think about what is the next-gen chili's looked like. so obviously, it's maybe it's not as big a dining room space and it's optimized for off-premise.
we certainly can optimize the kitchen if we understand the northstar better. that will create, obviously lower build costs. and then, concurrently we can improve restaurant margins that will obviously, accelerate paybacks, right? so, in order to answer your specific question of like, are we waiting to get to, mid-double-digit margins to start accelerating builds again, it's hard to answer that question until we get into the details of how much cost can we take out of the building based on a next-gen chili's as well as, how fast we accelerate margin improvement. but i do think the fact that we can get to better margins, the faster we can return to building again.
brian mullan -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from john glass from morgan stanley. john, your line is live.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. good morning. congratulations, kevin. great to hear your voice.
first, kevin, i just want to maybe sort of put together the pieces, as you drive through or endeavor to restore traffic, you're talking about strategic pricing, you're talking about reducing a decent amount of discount. those generally don't coincide with better traffic. was it your analysis that the discounting, and the promotions that my chili's awards just did not drive traffic, so we're moving them? isn't it an impediment to restoring traffic? how do you make that decision? and why do you think there is a risk of further degradation in traffic if you remove some of those promotions?
kevin hochman -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. well, as john, there are lots of different ways to drive traffic, right? and, one of the things i think we need to evolve over time is driving the right traffic that is sustainable growth versus the traffic for traffic's sake. so so let me give you a couple of thoughts on how i'm thinking about driving traffic, which i think is kind of at the heart of your question. we have seen low-income customers start to visit less often, which is why we've seen those traffic trends turn negative.
we are implementing several initiatives to call back as much of that traffic back. so the first thing is on that low-income customer that i think you're kind of referring to when you're talking about, the ability for those discounts to drive traffic, and we simply need to do a better job of talking about the unbeatable value that we have on a 3 for me menu. and so, specifically, you can get chips and salsa, a burger, fries, and unlimited soft drink refills and it's just $10.99. and we have a few other entrees that start at that price point, too.
and i will tell you, we had a -- it was like a famous broadcaster, jeff lewis, on his radio show. we didn't pay for that. he just kind of went to a chili's in encino and just raved about how much food he got from -- at an $11 price point from chili's. and there are two observations from that, and then, he talked about it for the next couple of days and brought another celebrity in with them.
the first one is we have an unbeatable value at a time that customers needed the most. and that was clear from just hearing him rave about the amount of value that he got from that 3 for me deal. but the second thing that it tells me is we have to do a much better job of talking about it. so our guests are aware of that value, right? so we have a great value in the restaurant today.
we don't plan on getting rid of it any time soon. and so what are the things that we can do with our limited marketing dollars to make sure that we're driving awareness of that? right now, we're spending our limited marketing dollars primarily either on talking about, free things that are available with my chili's awards, or focused on digital off-premise and the virtual brand. so i think there's an opportunity right there. the second thing that we're doing is we're launching we're calling the raise the bar initiative to reignite traffic at the bar, which we think will spill over into the dining room, too.
so the raise the bar initiative includes a completely new drink lineup, a new bar food lineup, happy hour that's available every day, and the launch of nfl sunday tickets into our restaurants, which will drive traffic via sports viewership. beyond nfl sunday tickets, we're looking at other things that we can use outside of football season to help drive traffic. obviously, those are more full revenue guests that we can get in to enjoy food and drink. and then, we're going to reboot the my chili's rewards program.
we probably will still give some things away, but it will be focused more on compressing the time between visits for our loyal guests. and we think we can make that loyalty program more traffic driving, but less costly with a better strategy and execution based on key customer insights. so i do think that my chili's rewards will still play a big role in driving traffic, but i think there's probably a better way that we can utilize it going forward.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
it's super helpful. thank you. and joe or kevin, the most recent trends you called out are the traffic declines. how much of that is the industry? in other words, you've talked about your share gains in the past.
is this idiosyncratic or more severe at chili's than the industry or what you're experiencing? your view is just the industry slowdown in general.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
i think that the bulk of it is similar to what you've seen in the industry and heard other folks talk about. when you look at the fourth quarter, for instance, you saw that traffic deceleration with june being the worst traffic positioning for the quarter, which again coincided with a lot of the very excessive inflationary factors like $5 gas, average gas prices, things of that nature. i will say that we have not performed as well relative to the industry as i'd like to see us do. so i think there's work for us to do in our house, too, that is beyond, the macro environment.
and that's when we focus on retaining team members, that's a big piece of the equation. we need to bring turnover down to make sure we can get dining rooms fully open, particularly on peak times and on the weekends, we will not have the throttling of the off-premise online ordering system, so that -- which is really their dining room. so we don't want to want to constrain that piece of the equation, too. so simplification is geared at helping to move the needle in that space.
but we're very focused on the retention side to try and get back into that, better than industry positioning on traffic. so some work to do there, but i think, most of it was similar trends to what you saw from the industry side of the equation.
john glass -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from john ivankoe from jpmorgan. john, your line is live.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
yes, hi. thank you. in listening to the call and talking about things like changes in loyalty, reduction of discounting, and pricing, all also seem to be very data-driven decisions. so, i guess the question is, did that data exist before? but, whether it was a feel or an experience, just different decisions were made in the past.
do you have new data that's suggesting, that some of these changes, i guess can be made in a positive manner? or is this still kind of a feel and experience in the type of decision where we're making maybe some of these decisions without necessarily the support of data today? and i have a follow-up.
kevin hochman -- chief executive officer and president
well, to answer your question, a lot of it is supported with data and or testing. some of it is moving faster than i think we would normally do just given the circumstances. and then some of it is just based on my experience with pricing and discounts on two other brands that i kind of led we're in a similar place of having a huge percentage of their mix on discount. so, in our example on chili's, 37% of our checks are moving to some type of discount.
and that's just simply too high for our brand and we just need that -- we need to figure out ways to get that lower. so it's not a question of like if we should do it, it's how we should do it. and, we're probably moving a little faster than we normally would. but, we're going to, of course, correct the things that we think we go too hard on.
but we do think that there we do have some pricing power in different areas in the business between being a little bit slower than the industry last year on taking everyday pricing, making sure that we have really sharp pricing for that guest that's cash trapped that's available in the restaurant every day, which we're going to maintain. and then, the reduction of discounts over time that we think will help us, earn better pricing on the business. so to answer your question, it's a combination of both. and but the most important thing is that over time, we get to a more sustainable business with better four-wall economics and better restaurant margins.
john ivankoe -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you. and secondly, the kfc brand in the us really became a much stronger brand after it actually significantly shrank its footprint in the us it really, decided, where it wanted to be with what type of customer, where they felt that, the operations could be solid. are there other opportunities, specifically to chili's for you to really rethink the portfolio, and maybe you kind of get better and stronger by being, at least in the short term smaller? how do you kind of see if there's a way to compare and contrast, the turnover opportunity at chili's relative to what was successfully achieved at kfc in the us if that's appropriate?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
john, i think we're always going to be taking a hard look at the performance dynamics of the fleet, and frankly, may take an even harder look at that spectrum of restaurants, which are always going to have some that are at the lower end of the spectrum, you might -- could we be a touch more aggressive on closing and relocating? i think as we kind of go forward, possibly it's something we'll look a little, little deeper at and maybe not carry as many along. i think we've talked in the past about our ability to carry restaurants, again, since we own all of our restaurants and we can kind of bring the fleet along in mass. we probably don't have to be bringing some of that level along as we have in the past. i don't see that as a radical change, though.
i don't want to take you down a path that there's going to be a significant initiative any time in the near term on meaningful closures. but we won't be afraid to close a restaurant, or not renew a lease in a lot of cases of some of these getting to expire if we don't see an ability to improve the operations and performance of an individual restaurant. so maybe a tick more than you've seen in the past, but nothing planned dramatically in the near term.

thank you. and the next question is coming from jared garber from goldman sachs. jared, your line is live.
jared garber -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thank you for the question. over the last maybe year or so, we've heard a lot about technology initiatives in the restaurant to help the operations. and i think kevin talked a lot about simplification initiatives moving forward.
so i just wanted to get a sense of maybe what some of the initiatives that were in place in terms of ai and robotics that were being tested, and some other initiatives in the back of house and front of house and how you think about those things going forward.
kevin hochman -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. so we have a lot of opportunities in technology. one of the things that the leadership team did when i first got here was we literally laid out all of the projects that we were working on kind of a two-by-two. one was its ability to impact, sales and profits in the next few years.
and then, the other access is like the probability of success, how much investment in time we need to put into this. and we made some strategic decisions to accelerate some projects and to stop other projects so the robotics project, i think you're probably referring to, we're going to we're pausing right now, but we are going to try to accelerate what we call kitchen of the future 3, which is equipment that will make it a lot easier, faster, and more consistent, and dramatically reduce cook times on the majority of the items on our menu. we believe that getting the speed of service up through that equipment will lead to turning tables faster and higher sales. so we are aggressively looking at technology as a way to improve restaurant margins and productivity.
there are a couple of other areas that we are looking at that we'll be talking about in terms of our long-term strategy. there's clearly an opportunity to remove friction for both our team members and guests with this with better use of technology. for team members, there's a clear opportunity in our heart of house, or our back of house with our kitchen display systems improving the order flow and in the to-go area, which is now 35% of our business. there are also several tasks that we think that guests might want to do for themselves with the right technology, if we can deploy it properly in the restaurants like seating, ordering, and payment, this will make it easier for the guests and reduce how much time our team members have to do those tasks for our guests today.
and then, we also have -- we think, a pretty big opportunity in our mobile site interface. the vast majority of our off-premise guests are using that mobile site to order, and we think we can make that easier and faster to help build stickier online customers. so to directly answer your question, we're going to stop some of those projects that we just didn't have a line of sight to a return on the business, but we're going to double down and accelerate the ones that we think will have a more meaningful impact on restaurant margins and a quicker impact on our business.

thanks. that's a really helpful color. and then, joe, if i could just follow up on our question around pricing, i think you said the expectation is to run about 8% price to the full year at chili's, so does that suggest that you'll be taking incremental price increases throughout the year to maintain that 8% level? because presumably, you'll have some price actions from 2020 to fiscal year '22 rolling off at various points around the year. so just wanted to make sure i understood that commentary properly.
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
yeah. you're understanding it correctly. we'll take, a series of different price increases, not necessarily just menu price increases. obviously, looking at a lot of different dynamics of where you can take actionable price.
you'll probably actually see it on a quarterly sequencing chili's tick up a little bit above that average level, as you kind of move through the middle of the fiscal year. and then, depending on any incremental decisions we may make down the road, we've left ourselves the optionality on how we think about price in the second half of the fiscal year, you would then gravitate back into that kind of 8% range. so that's kind of the flow of pricing for them.
jared garber -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. great. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from dennis geiger from ubs. dennis, your line is live.
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you. just first wanted to ask another on the pricing levels and really anything that you've seen with respect to pushback, or resistance from the customer to date. kevin, i know you spoke to having pricing power in pricing below peers in past years.
just curious about what you've seen most recently from a feedback standpoint from customers?
kevin hochman -- chief executive officer and president
well, we continue to see mix be fine. so we haven't seen really any trade-down. what we have seen is the traffic with that low-income guest tail off a bit. and so one of the things that we need to do is superior that -- we have to really superior values in our restaurants today.
we have a $9 lunch combo, which if you look at the fast food index of combos, it's beneath the head so and that's casual dining, right? and then, we have our 3 for me program, which is essentially an appetizer, an entree, and unlimited drinks starting at $10.99. these are both unbeatable values in the market. and so we have to do a better job of taking the limited marketing dollars that we have and making sure that we're shouting those things for the guests, so that the low-income guests that literally wouldn't be able to choose casual dining unless they had those price points available to them, are aware of them, right? so that's why we're pivoting some of the dollars that we're spending on comps for my chili's rewards and trying to figure out, how do we reinvest that back into advertising the everyday value that we have today that we think is unbeatable in the market. the other things that we're doing in terms of pricing when we think about like reducing the number of items that are offered on that 3 for me menu to just make sure we have a couple of things that are really good for that guess but not discount large swaps of the menu.
we think that will have a positive impact on pricing, reducing the number of free offers, which we talked about on my chili's rewards. and then, the other thing i don't think we've talked about is just accelerating pricing and recovering the costs of delivering our food, both on maggiano's, chili's, and the virtual brands. historically, we just haven't recovered all those costs. and we know that guest is very price inelastic and really value convenience over menu price.
so it may not be in the context of like how you think about pricing power, but there clearly is opportunity and upside on being -- i'm pushing a little harder on those things in a smart way while protecting those opening price points for that guest that just desperately need that price point.
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
very helpful. and then just one more, if i could, just on the food and beverage inflation side of things of the expectations there, what are the biggest drivers maybe for the fiscal 1q target, as far as poultry, how much of pressure is that based on the latest contract and maybe just kind of what you're seeing for the full year, how contracted you are for the full fiscal '23? joe, if you could kind of speak to that a little bit. thank you.
mika ware -- vice president of finance and investor relations
hi, dennis, it's mika. so actually, poultry and oils are probably the two biggest drivers of our q1 inflation. and for the first quarter, we are actually we're probably 99% contracted. we're more contracted as well into the second quarter and open in the back half of the year where we do think the markets are going to come down.
but that's where we stand today.
dennis geiger -- ubs -- analyst
very helpful. thanks, mika.
mika ware -- vice president of finance and investor relations
thanks, dennis.
operator
thank you. and the next question is coming from chris carril from rbc capital markets. chris, your line is live.
chris carril -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks. good morning and thanks for the question here. so can you talk about the staffing environment today? maybe focusing on turnover relative to pre-covid levels? joe, i think you had alluded to elevated turnover in the 4q versus historical levels. and then i guess a high level.
how are you thinking about balancing all of the strategic initiatives that you're anticipating with what you're seeing in staffing today?
joe taylor -- chief financial officer
let me jump in on the first part, and then, kevin if you want to jump in on the back half of where we can see that heading. yeah, we're running within the hourly population. we're running much higher turnover rates than we did pre-covid, retention is the area that we're really focusing on there, we're not having difficulty from a hiring standpoint. the number of people staffed in the restaurants is fairly similar to pre-covid, but it's the turnover rate that is generating higher than normal training expenses, utilization of overtime, and some of those dynamics that keep that overall labor cost more elevated than we'd like to be.
so we're really focusing a lot of attention on how to approve the retention rates. and that starts with, making sure we have the right dynamics of hiring practices in place and the right training programs. our initiative around virtual training and onboarding, i think is going to be effective as we just start to deploy that into the restaurants. but that is clearly a hyper-focus, on how we improve the labor situation and we need to bring those levels, particularly for the hourly.
gm turnover is very stable where it needs to be improvements in the overall manager and then it and then a lot of attention on the hourly side of the equation.
kevin hochman -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. and i think this is going to be a work in progress. we do continue to have a higher level of turnover versus pre-pandemic at the team member restaurant level that joe referred to. during my listening tour and restaurants, what i've learned is we don't have a problem attracting enough folks to work in our restaurants.
we have a challenge in retaining them. and in talking with the operators, what i heard is it's more difficult to work in a chili's, and it's not as fun to work in a chili's than it was pre-pandemic. i think we're competitive in terms of wage rates, it's more about the actual work. and so there are two big things that we're working on.
one is the simplification initiative where we've got this team of senior executives working on things that are going to make it easier to work in a chili's. and then, we're going to we're also having spending up some ideas on how to make it fun again to work in a chili's. so the simplification one is kind of more obvious in the near end. there are just a lot of tasks that we do in the back of the restaurant that doesn't necessarily help the guest experience and can be frustrating for team members.
i'll give you one example of the view and idea of the stuff we're working on. so we have this thing called portioning that we do for a lot of our proteins, which is before service, we'll literally like count the number of shrimp or measure the amount of brisket, and we'll put that into a, into a plastic bag, and then, we'll, we'll stage that, in a cooling area. and, in my restaurant tours, i saw pretty much every morning. i've just seen people just counting shrimp, or measuring brisket.
and just to give you a sense of like how much time that could be and how much money that could be for our business. just one hour of prep per day per restaurant is roughly 46 years of labor that we're paying for annually when you add that all up, right? and when the team member said, well, i don't know why we, count shrimp counting shrimp, i put them in a bag. i said, well, how would you do it? they said, when the customer orders a shrimp dish, i would count eight shrimp and i do it before service, right? and, that seems pretty logical and something that we could immediately do. and probably there was a time that when we put that in that proteins, we were really worried about the waste on them, and labor rates weren't where they were.
and so it might have been good decisions when we made those decisions 15 years ago. but today, in a world where, wage rates are where they are and, turnover rates are where they are. and that's not, the most fun task to do. like, why don't we get rid of that and save millions of dollars in terms of labor that can either be redeployed back into the restaurant or potentially to the bottom line, if we can change the amount of hours that we deploy to the business? so that -- so many examples in our business that we can remove some of the cost and complexity out of our business, but don't really meaningfully impact the guest experience.
and then from a fun standpoint, there are plenty of ideas that we've heard from the restaurant teams that we think actually could not just make the business more fun to work in, but actually drive some traffic. so, one of the things that we're bringing back that we had pre-pandemic that i heard from the restaurant teams that we announced at our conference last week give back night. so it's literally any of your guests in your local chili's can ask to use the restaurant for a night and they will attract the guests and 10% of the proceeds that night go to that guest's nonprofit charity, and they will do, the recruiting to bring guests into the restaurant because it's for a cause that they all care about. and obviously, the team members love it because it's something they can give back to their communities.
it's a form of driving traffic and it's a whole lot of fun for everybody. so there are so many different ideas that we can do both to simplify the restaurant and make it fun to work at chili's again. i think we do those things, i think you'll see those turnover rates for our team members start to go down.
