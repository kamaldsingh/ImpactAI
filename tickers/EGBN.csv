ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to eagle bancorp's first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to introduce your host for today's program, charles levingston, chief financial officer. please go ahead.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, jonathan. good morning. this is charles levingston, chief financial officer at eagle bancorp. before we begin the presentation, i would like to remind everyone that some of the comments made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements. our form 10-k for the 2019 fiscal year, our quarterly reports on form 10-q and current reports on form eight-k identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning.
the company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. this morning's commentary will include non-gaap financial information. the earnings release, which is posted in the investor relations section of the company's website and filed with the sec contains reconciliations of this information to the most directly comparable gaap information. our periodic reports are available from the company or online on the company's website or the sec website. i would like to remind you that it is our policy not to establish with the markets any earnings, margin or balance sheet guidance.
now i would like to introduce susan riel, the president and ceo of eagle bancorp.
susan g. riel -- president, chief executive officer and director
thanks, charles. before i begin my formal remarks, i wanted to mention that jan williams, our chief credit officer, is also here with us and we'll all be available later for questions. i would like to begin by extending our best wishes to all our shareholders and others on this call, during this time of great stress and concern related to the covid-19 pandemic, which is impacting our whole world. this disease has changed the way we live and certainly the way we do business. i would like to give you a brief summary of how eaglebank has responded to the challenges presented by this environment. in late february, when we realized the potential severity of covid-19, we started taking steps to protect the safety and health of our customers, employees and the community. we immediately enhanced our system capabilities for remote access.
within 10 days, we had over 50% of our staff working remotely from their homes. during that period, we increased the sanitization of our facilities to enhance the safety for our employees who were coming on site. in all situations, we have followed cdc guidelines and local government authorities. prior to federal plans kicking in, we established the eaglebank relief program to allow for additional paid leaves for our employees and worked with carefirst to improve the medical coverage for covid-19-related matters. we continue to monitor the spread of covid-19 in the washington metropolitan area and will take steps as appropriate to foster the safety and health of our employees and their families. we've closed 14 of our 20 branches and left six open with drive-through access to offer the necessary services. to maintain a high level of service, we enacted outreach programs to our customers to encourage and facilitate use of our online and mobile banking services and ensure that customers knew how to reach us remotely. we worked with our vendors to make sure that the appropriate technology was available.
for example, for one customer, we had 37 remote deposit terminals delivered and installed within three days. we contacted our borrowing customers to assess how they were doing and to discuss the need for loan modifications where appropriate. we have assessed the risk and exposures in our portfolio and we'll discuss those later in our call. to support our small business customer base, the bank is participating in the cares act paycheck protection program, which offers sba guaranteed forgivable loans to small businesses to fund payroll and other costs. the administrative aspects of this program have proven to be very difficult, and initially, our processing systems had trouble keeping up with demand. we enhanced our processing capability, and to date, we have approved approximately $107 million of loans through this program. we are focused on being responsive to our customer needs as expected, the additional funding for this program and we'll be able to better handle the additional funding for this program, if approved.
during the last six weeks, we have relied on our communications technology and other systems to support our business operations as we have really put them to a test. as a group, we have adapted to the use of meetings conducted through teleconferencing and video conferencing. our core processing and backup systems reacted very well to the finastra wire transfer disruption incident in late march. and we have the framework in place to hold a virtual annual meeting with our shareholders in may. given the impact that the covid-19 pandemic has had on the economy, we have spent quite a bit of time assessing the risk in our loan portfolio for those business sectors hit the hardest by the downturn.
of our total loans of $7.8 billion, we have $761 million or 9.7% of the portfolio in loans to firms in the accommodation and foodservice industry, and another $90 million or 1.1% in retail trade. there has been global concern about rent payments. and so, note that $2.4 billion or 31% of our portfolio is comprised of income-producing cre loans and another $971 million or 12% of the portfolio in owner-occupied cre loans. we would also note that these two loan types have been better performing segments of our loan book during previous economic and credit-down cycles. during this period of uncertainty, our board of directors has been attentive to matters that would affect risk to our employees, our customers and the stability and outlook of the company. under the board's guidance, we have been responsive to regulatory guidance and enhanced reporting, federal and state mandates and actions including loan forbearance provisions and stimulus legislation.
we don't have a crystal ball. however, we are confident of our ability to work through the coming challenges for two reasons: one is our strong capital position and profitability, which should allow us to work through the current credit cycle. and the second is our market position as one of the leading community banks in the washington, d.c. metropolitan area. the federal government has created a major stimulus program intended to restart the national economy. and our past experience from previous federal stimulus programs is that a significant percentage of the funds from the new government efforts will stay here in the washington metropolitan area. this region is currently, and we believe is likely to remain the fifth-largest regional economy in the u.s.
now i would like to turn the discussion to the company's financial results for the first quarter of 2020. for the quarter, we reported net income of $23.1 million as compared to $33.7 million for the first quarter of 2019. earnings per share, basic and diluted, were $0.70 per share as compared to $0.98 of earnings per share, basic and diluted, for the first quarter of 2019. a straight-up comparison of the earnings for the two periods isn't really meaningful because each period had some major unusual items. the results for the first quarter of last year included a nonrecurring charge of $6.2 million, 13% $0.13 per share for compensation expenses related to the retirement of our former ceo. and the results for q1 of 2020 includes significant additions to loan loss reserves related to adoption of a new accounting standard known as cecl.
this new accounting methodology had, as expected, a significant impact on results for the first quarter. the cecl methodology was adopted as of january 1, 2020, and the resulting day one adjustments, which were charges to stockholders' equity, were an increase in the general allowance for credit losses of $10.6 million and an increase of $4.1 million to the reserve for unfunded commitments. during the first quarter of 2020, we have made additional provisions to both the general allowance and the reserve for unfunded commitments totaling $16.4 million. of those additional provisions, about 2/3 can be attributed to covid-19 matters. we continue to monitor the portfolio for potential losses due to the economic turmoil from the covid-19 pandemic. since mid-march, we have been reviewing individual credit to assess how volatile the volatile economy is impacting their cash flows and ability to service their debt.
as of april 16, we had reviewed and approved loan modifications for 234 loans, totaling $298 million. the net result of all of these factors was an increase in the allowance for credit losses from 0.98% of total loans at december 31, 2019, to 1.23% of total loans at march 31. the adoption of the cecl accounting standard and related provision had a negative impact on pre-tax income of about $12.1 million for the first quarter of 2020.
with that said, i would state that we are pleased with the results of the first quarter, during which we saw continued growth in total loans, total deposits and a stable net interest margin, continued solid asset quality and continued strong efficiency and productivity. in addition to the cecl-related adjustments, the other major item impacting the quarterly earnings was the continuation of an elevated level of legal expenses. the net interest margin was 3.49% for the first quarter and was the same as the margin in the fourth quarter of 2019. we were pleased to see this leveling off after several quarters of decreases from the level of 4.02% in the first quarter of 2019. during the first quarter of 2020, loan yields decreased by 11 basis points to an average of 5.07% for the period. importantly, we were able to significantly reduce our deposit cost by pushing down money market and cd rates in line with the fed the fed moves during the quarter.
the cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased by 17 basis points to 1.52% for the quarter. while many of our competitors did not adjust deposit rates as much, we moved aggressively in anticipation and in response to short-term rate reductions by the federal reserve and successfully reduced our deposit rates and our aggregate cost of funds, which was 1.06% for the first quarter of 2020. the net interest margin was impacted by two other factors during the quarter. the first item had a negative effect on the margin, was the more than sufficient on-balance-sheet liquidity we held during these uncertain times. the result was that we had about $200 million in excess liquidity invested with the federal reserve as they reduced rates to near 0.
the average loan-to-deposit ratio for the quarter was 99.4%. on the other hand, our cost of funds and margin continued to benefit from our ability to maintain average demand deposit accounts at 29.5% of total deposits. our high level of dda deposits continues to be a major strength of the bank. we continue to have strong credit quality statistics for the first quarter of 2020. net charge-offs annualized were 12 basis points of average loans for the quarter, decreased from a level of 19 basis points to the first quarter of 2019 and 16 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2019. nonperforming assets increased by $5 million during the quarter, due to the addition of two pieces of oreo property acquired through foreclosure.
at march 31, nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 55 basis points as compared to 50 basis points a year ago and 56 basis points at december 31, 2019. nonperforming loans at quarter-end were $47 million and as a percentage of total loans were 60 basis points as compared to 56 basis points at march 31, 2019, and 56 basis points at december 31, 2019. as mentioned, the allowance for credit losses was 1.23% of total loans at the end of the first quarter due primarily to the cecl and covid-19-related adjustments. overall, credit quality remains solid. at march 31, 2020, the coverage ratio was 205% of nonperforming loans as compared to 174% at march 31, 2019, and 151% at december 31, 2019. at these levels, we believe the bank is adequately reserved. for the first quarter of 2020, average loan balances were 8.7% greater than in the first quarter of 2019. we achieved loan growth during the first quarter of 2020 of $295 million or about 3.9%.
average loan balances for the quarter were 2% higher than during the fourth quarter of 2019. the largest increases during the quarter were in c&i loans and income-producing cre loans, while we saw a decrease in construction loans. since march 31, 2019, we have grown our c&i loans by 11% and income-producing cre loans by 13%, while our construction loan portfolio has remained flat at just about $1 million. a significant portion of the growth in c&i lending in the quarter was due to advances under the lines of credit as clients added to their liquidity positions in march in response to covid-19-related matters. we estimate that about half of the loan growth during the first quarter of 2020 was attributable to this activity. our loan pipeline continues to look promising, but demand for new loans is hard to determine due to the uncertainty caused by the pandemic.
on a period-end basis, total deposits grew by $917 million during the first quarter of 2020, while average deposits experienced a slight decrease of $20 million. our deposit balances saw significant fluctuations during the first quarter of 2020. while balances were seasonably low early in the quarter, we saw significant increases in february and march as many of our customers' accumulated cash in response to the pandemic and the volatile equity markets. average deposits for the first quarter of 2020 were $7.7 billion, little changed from the fourth quarter of 2019, but exhibiting a healthy annual growth rate of 10% as compared to the first quarter in 2019. noninterest income was $5.5 million for the quarter as compared to $6.3 million in the first quarter of last year, a 13% increase. the decrease in revenue was attributable primarily to lesser gains on the sale of residential mortgages as an otherwise very strong quarter of residential mortgage loan originations and sales volume in 2020 was negatively impacted by hedging losses due to the dislocation in the market pricing of mortgage-backed securities.
net investment gains were slightly lower at $822,000 for the first quarter of 2020 as compared to $912,000 for the same period in 2019. the efficiency ratio was 43.83% for the first quarter of 2020 as compared to 43.87% a year ago and 39.71% in the fourth quarter of 2019. the higher efficiency ratio in the first quarter 2020 was attributable to both reduced level of revenue due substantially to lower interest rates and a higher level of legal fee expenditures related to the previously disclosed governmental investigations and our defense of the previously disclosed class action lawsuit.
while we are all grappling with the uncertainty caused by the covid-19 pandemic, we are cautiously optimistic about the long-range prospects for the washington metropolitan area. at the end of 2019, we had the fifth-largest regional economy in the united states with a gross regional product of $541 billion. the fuller institute at george mason university recently released their analysis on the effects of the pandemic, which indicates that if our local areas shut down for 90 days, the impact on the regional economy would be a reduction to grp of 1% or $5.4 billion this year and that the growth rate would return to its normal level of about 2% growth in 2021. as with the national level, the biggest damage locally would be to the restaurant and hotel sectors. so we will continue to closely monitor those exposures in our loan portfolio.
our board is committed to maintaining a financially sound, well-capitalized institution. we have done that over the last four quarters as the additions to retained earnings from our combined continued profitability have been offset by the effect of adopting the cecl standard and by the share repurchases made prior to our recent suspension of the repurchase program. the board will continue to assess the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the regional economy and our asset quality statistics in considering any potential capital i'm sorry, any potential capital-related actions. we are proud that even with all of the challenges we have addressed over the last four quarters, our company has earned $132.3 million in net income. during that same period, we have returned to our shareholders $128 million through cash dividends and share repurchases, and have increased the tangible book value per share by 11% to $33.54. at march 31, 2020, the total risk-based capital ratio was 15.69% as compared to 16.20% at december 31, 2019, and 16.22% at march 31, 2019.
the tangible common equity ratio moved from 12.59% a year ago to 10.90% at march 31, 2020. these levels are well above peer averages and regulatory well-capitalized levels. we appreciate the support of our shareholders and those of you on this call. i would like to remind you that our annual shareholders meeting will be held on a virtual basis at 10 a.m. on may 21. we hope that many of you are able to participate. instructions on how to register for the meeting were included in our proxy, which was published on april 6. that concludes my final remarks. we would be pleased to take any questions at this time.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of erik zwick from boenning and scattergood. your question, please.
erik zwick -- boenning and scattergood -- analyst
hi, good morning. given that the internal reviews by your special compliance and audit committee have concluded, should that be interpreted as a sign that you'd expect the government's investigation could also be nearing its conclusion?
susan g. riel -- president, chief executive officer and director
we continue to engage with government investigations, and it's still impossible to predict the outcome and the resolution, the timing or anything. that said, i will offer my opinion. as each quarter proceeds, we believe we are that much closer to resolution of these matters. it is my understanding and belief that these investigations are proceeding expeditiously and in a professional manner. i understand we are making efforts to complete to the extent feasible, the document production phase of the investigation cycle. we are hopeful that these efforts may permit us to lower outside counsel expenses during a potential summer low before picking up again. for emphasis, these observations are my opinions. and as my general counsel has warned me, it's impossible to predict the pace, the direction or outcome of government investigations. but i thought it would be helpful to share some of that.
erik zwick -- boenning and scattergood -- analyst
i appreciate the color there. with regard to the two high-end properties that you foreclosed on. were these newly completed projects or were they the seasoned properties the sponsor is trying to sell? and i guess, how long have they been for sale? and do you see any other similar properties in your portfolio that could be experiencing stress?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president
this is jan williams. there really aren't significant similar properties in the portfolio. one of the properties are both single-family residential properties. one of them just finished a historic restoration and is very high end. that being said, whether it's salable in a quick turnaround during the current coronavirus era, is difficult to say. we are well within margined appraised value. so feeling fairly comfortable with that. i think the timing is more difficult to call. the other property is also in washington, d.c., one is in georgetown, one is on embassy row, mass avenue. the one in georgetown is an older but very large property. and that property has not been renovated. so that property is at a reduced value to the first one i was speaking about. but again, they're expensive properties. and it's not exactly a great time to be the realtors to be taking people around to look at houses, so it could take a while to disposition them, but i am comfortable with the carrying values.
erik zwick -- boenning and scattergood -- analyst
understood. and just one last question for me, and i'll step aside. the construction portfolio today at about approximately $1.1 billion. can you provide some color into diversification in terms of the intended end-use of those properties by industry type? how far along construction is? and what percentage is the construction still ongoing today? thank you.
janice l. williams -- executive vice president
well, in terms of ongoing construction, i can give you stratification across different property types. i can tell you that there has not been, at this point, disruption in construction. it's been considered an essential service. so there haven't been any issues with slowdowns on projects. that doesn't mean that there couldn't be in the future or that there couldn't be supply chain issues in the future. but for right now, the construction portfolio is performing exactly as we expected. about 25% of it is multifamily, about 20% is mixed-use, of about 16% in residential condominiums, about 15% in single-family, office is around 10%, hotel is a little under 5% and retail is less than 0.2%. so overall, we're pretty comfortable with where we are. as you know, for the last several quarters, we've been talking about how we've been deemphasizing construction in our portfolio. and i've been thinking about it in terms of a likely recession in the first part of 2021. obviously, the time line on that has been thrown for a bit of a loop with coronavirus, but i think that we're confident that what we have in the queue will be finished and will be finished according to the original anticipated time line.
erik zwick -- boenning and scattergood -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions.
janice l. williams -- executive vice president
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of steve comery with g.research. your question, please.
steven comey -- g.research -- analyst
guys, good morning. one i wanted to ask about the ppp disclosures. i know susan, you talked about $107 million of balance. just wondering if maybe you could tell us how many loans that was? and kind of what the makeup of that was; like for most of these existing clients or new clients? and then maybe if you can just give us a sense of how many applications they were that went unfilled before when the program ran out of money?
susan g. riel -- president, chief executive officer and director
the first round, i would have to be i would have to say that it is not was not a stronger performance on the bank side as we had hoped. we had a difficult time bringing a system up, an automated system up. the average size of the loan that we approved was about $250 million. we received somewhere around $200 million. it was very mixed, primarily for smaller businesses. and it was about $110 million. those are approximate numbers. we are very geared up and have been working around the clock to get prepared should there be an additional funding approval, which we expect that to happen. and we have been working around the clock to get more applications ready to present as are many, many banks doing the same thing. so we expect to have a better performance. and no guarantees at this point since we are not given any guarantee our money will be the money will be set aside for us. so hopefully, that answers your question?
steven comey -- g.research -- analyst
yes. that's very helpful. okay. and then i wanted to ask about the loan floors. i appreciate the disclosure in the press release. i just wasn't sure, is that referring to end of quarter? or is that now in april? and maybe wondering if you could give us kind of an indication about the size of the balances affected by floors at each point in time?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so thanks, erik, this is i'm sorry, steve, this is charles. that's a great question. obviously, a lot of that fed movement took place in march, but resets don't typically take place until the beginning of the month. so at the end of the quarter, those floors, the loans at the floor were about $2.2 billion. sitting here in the late april, we're probably closer to $2.8 billion. and that's out of a total loan with floors of, i want to say, right around $3 billion, $3.1 billion. so most of the loans at with floors will be at floors by the end of this month.
steven comey -- g.research -- analyst
okay. very helpful. and then just one more for me. i know you talked about increasing the provision allowance, increasing the allowance to 1.23% of outstanding based on cecl and then sort of just your own estimation of credit performance. just wondering how comfortable you guys feel about that level now versus how you felt on march 31 when that was set?
susan g. riel -- president, chief executive officer and director
i don't think our comfort level has materially changed. there is a great deal of uncertainty still on when businesses will be operating again, but the various tools that we've been able to employ working with our borrowers, i think, give me a fair amount of confidence that we're not likely to see a significant near-term change if we were looking at what the cecl model has driven off some forecasts, including unemployment numbers. so if there's a significant change in the forecast that's brought about over the next quarter, next couple of quarters, that could cause the allowance to grow, just impossible to tell at this point.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. one element that we want to make sure is appreciated is certainly the resiliency of the d.c. metro relative to the rest of the nation. obviously, d.c. is somewhat of a disproportionate recipient of a lot of the relief that's passed at federal level. so that is accounted for in our modeling and something that we want to make sure that we consider going forward.
steven comey -- g.research -- analyst
okay, thank you very much.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.

our next question comes from the line of catherine mealor from kbw. your question, please.
catherine mealor -- kbw -- analyst
just a follow-up question on the reserves and the cecl bill this quarter. can you just talk a little bit about some of your baseline economic assumptions that you used to build the reserve further this quarter? and is that how you're thinking about maybe how some of those scenarios may have changed since quarter end?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
right. so we actually utilized an economic forecast published by the wall street journal. and again, as i mentioned previously, made adjustments based on the local d.c. metro performance through crisis. so that economic forecast was actually published on april 10. so again, not a lot of change today from then. so what we determined is, in looking at the unemployment again, as jan mentioned, a significant driver in our cecl model. looking at the unemployment rate nationally that was forecasted in that survey, we measured that against d.c.'s performance in difficult times, specifically looking at the period between 2008 and 2012 of the relative difference between d.c.'s local unemployment rate versus the national unemployment rate. and it looked like the d.c.'s unemployment rate was about 65% of the national unemployment rate, performing better in those scenarios. so that was really, again, a significant driver of the quantitative aspect of the cecl model. and again, not much has changed in the last, call it, 12, 13 days.
catherine mealor -- kbw -- analyst
okay. that's really helpful. and then digging into the hotel portfolio. can you just give us a little color in that portfolio, maybe talk about some of your larger credits in that book, maybe the percentage of that book that's on payment deferral currently? and just any kind of and maybe how much of that portfolio is kind of luxury hotels versus limited service flagged hotels?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president
okay. catherine, it's jan. i will tell you that we have had two hotel loans that are on deferral right now. total exposure for those two hotels is about $85 million. so that certainly is part of the 90-day deferrals that we're working with. i think we've chosen not to go with the 180-day deferrals, except in the case of sba loans where the sba is making those payments. there are a couple of loans, including one specifically that's in construction. that's an sba 504 loan. we haven't seen any interruption with that. construction, i think probably the largest loan that we've discussed a time or two, is a hotel that's located in college park, maryland. it is presently closed as are most hotels. it is not currently deferred, but i estimate there are alternate sources for making payments. but i would guess with a crystal ball that there will be a request at some point for a deferral there. again, we'll be looking at probably a 90-day deferral or interest-only situation there. a number of our customers have asked for a deferral of the principal portion of the payment as opposed to entire payments. so we're looking at that on a case-by-case basis. and much will depend on how fast things turn around in terms of back to work, although i do think most folks, including me, expect hospitality to lag on the recovery.
catherine mealor -- kbw -- analyst
all right. and what was the balance of that college park hotel loan?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president
$100 million.
catherine mealor -- kbw -- analyst
okay. is that the largest credit in that portfolio?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president
yes, it is.
catherine mealor -- kbw -- analyst
okay. great. and then maybe one last one for charles, on the margin. can you help us or give us any color around deposit cost at quarter end? just to kind of give us a sense as to where we are going into second quarter? and can we see the same kind of magnitude of drop in the second quarter, that we've been seeing from all the type of companies?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, sure. thanks, catherine. so we made our move, obviously, as susan alluded to in her remarks, in the month of march. our top-tier money market rate now sits around 30 basis points. so i would expect to see a little bit of benefit from that going forward, as we said much higher for the first two months of the quarter. hopefully, that provides some help. but yes, we felt pretty encouraged by the fact that, again, cost of funds declined 11 basis points quarter-over-quarter right along with the loan right the loan yields. so i think it's also helpful to consider the fact that we have been able to maintain close to 30% in ddas, even with our growth over the quarter.
so yes, i think we should see some assistance there. also, while we're talking about the margin, we did note the additional liquidity that we experienced in the first quarter. we did have a run-up as, again, a lot of our customers saw or made the decision to move to cash. to the extent that some of those customers start to get more comfortable with the operating environment, the path forward, you could certainly see some of that cash start to normalize again, and that would certainly endure to the benefit of the margin.
catherine mealor -- kbw -- analyst
thank you so much.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.

our next question comes from the line of christopher marinac from j. montgomery scott. your question, please.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
hey, thanks. so good morning. i wanted to continue on the kind of credit questioning of the previous folks. and if we look big picture at all the deferrals that you have, i guess, if we add the $100 million hotel balance that jan just described, you're kind of now pushing $400 million or 5% of the portfolio. should we kind of consider those kind of quasi criticized loans? and does that go into the reserve build for the quarter? or would you kind of reassess based on where those go? and i guess also, jan, if you could just update us on general classified and criticized data at the end of march?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president
sure. we do take a report that consists of all modifications and segregated by industry, and they certainly get a much higher level of scrutiny. there has not been, as of 3/31, downgrade in the portfolio. that will change as individual credits are evaluated going forward. i think you'll probably see more pushed into a watch category. i don't know that they'll get to special mention or beyond unless there are underlying preexisting credit issues. so we're following the accounting advice that we've been given and staying on top of that. i think the overlay really based on economic conditions is what drove the additions to the reserve. none of the modifications really deal with substandard properties. in fact, we haven't modified anything that's classified or criticized that would result in a tdr as opposed to the safe harbor for these coronavirus modifications.
so i think we're pretty comfortable on that scale. in terms of what's in our substandard and doubtful categories, we're looking at pretty much flat levels, a modest increase. and they are a mixed bag. most of it is secured by real estate, whether it's residential or whether it's commercial real estate. we have a number of restaurants that we've pushed into that category. there are a couple of specialized quasi medical-type facilities that we're also looking at, although they haven't had, as of the end of march and the most recent financials, any particular problem meeting the covenants in their loans. we're cautious about going forward and are monitoring everything very closely. we've expanded the credit department's capacity for modifying i'm sorry, for monitoring the loan portfolio and bringing in additional seasoned professionals to assist us in that process. and i think we've really tried to be very proactive in reaching out to each of the customers in any impacted industry and see what we can do to assist and what longer-term plans we can put in place. we don't expect serial deferrals for these types of customers.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and i'd just add, chris, that as those additional resources are monitoring these credits and provide any kind of downgrade to those credits, that also will flow through our cecl model and should be reflected in our reserve going forward.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
okay. so will some of that get reflected in the next kind of filing for the 10-q? or do you already have that determined in terms of where the final watch in special-mentioned substandard figures are?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president
we do already have that determined for 3/31. that is based on the financials of the company. and if there was a problem with any of those companies at march 31, they would have been downgraded. right now, we're focused on anyone that had a deferral for 90 days is working with us on a long-term plan. and we would expect to remediate credit weakness in those loans and add enhancements as needed in return for any future concession the bank might consider.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
okay. great. that's all very helpful. and then just to clarify, when you have a watch rated credit, that is not considered criticized, is that right?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president
that's correct. yes.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
okay. perfect. and then just a quick follow-up for charles on liquidity. how did that change in the quarter? and just kind of roughly where are you today with kind of unpledged securities and fhlb access? and just a quick update.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. yes. so we again, we saw a significant influx of on-balance-sheet liquidity toward the end of the quarter. today, our fhl availability is at about $1.36 billion. we've got through, again, fed fund lines, access to networks like promontories, one we buy, and their insured network deposit network, another, call it, $1.3 billion or so in availability there.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
great. thank you very much for the background this morning.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. thanks.
janice l. williams -- executive vice president
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of brody preston from stephens, inc. your question, please.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
morning, everyone. i hope everybody's doing well.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey, morning.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
so i just want to stick with the liquidity right now. i know we're sort of living to death here, but just given the uncertainty with covid, you said you sort of maintained some excess liquidity on the balance sheet with the fed due to uncertainty here. just wanted to get a sense for if we could see you maintain sort of excess liquidity levels throughout the remainder of the year, just given the heightened uncertainty?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. again, as i mentioned to chris, i do believe we've got sufficient liquidity both on- and off-balance-sheet to meet the needs of depositors and any additional funding needs we may see throughout the year. i could certainly see maintaining a certain elevated amount above and beyond what would be in an otherwise normal operating environment, given concerns over covid. some of it is intentional, and some of it is us just thanking our customers and then moving to cash. so to the extent that they move out of cash, then that would be, again, a more intentional decision to draw down on some of the availability that we have. but i feel fairly comfortable where we are today. and again, the more clarity we get in terms of the outcome of the covid-19 pandemic, the more certain we can all be in terms of our liquidity position.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay. so that interest-bearing deposits and short-term investment planning, and is that this $904 million and change for the quarter, is that sort of trended down post quarter? or is that remaining around those levels?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. again, we've seen certain customers, certainly, again, getting a little bit more comfortable with the state of things and moving away from a little bit away from cash, but i don't want to make any forward-looking statements on that.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay. and then you guys moved pretty aggressively with the deposits, but you mentioned that others had not. just wanted to know if you could give us any color as to why others haven't been reducing rates as aggressively as you have?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it's hard for me to get us ahead of the competition. my best guess might be that they want to maintain an effort for to gain market share in kind of an uncertain time. but i'm not quite sure because it made all the sense in the world for us to manage our money cost down aggressively when the rest of the world did with short-term rates and the fed.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay. and then you mentioned that about half of the loan growth this quarter was due to increased line utilization. just wanted to know if you could give us what the utilization rate was as of 3/31?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i don't have that off-hand. but again, about half of the growth is, about $160 million or so above and beyond what we normally would see.
susan g. riel -- president, chief executive officer and director
i think that's something i can follow-up with for you. i'm sure you'll email after.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
all right. that will work. and then the deposit flow that you saw. i understand that you had some clients who moved to cash. was that a number of clients? or is that like one or two or three big clients that sort of moved to cash just because the savings and money market growth is eye-popping?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. it was some larger customers who are functioning kind of a financial intermediary capacity that did saw a lot of that inflow.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay. and then as we think about stress testing the portfolio. have you run any stress tests on the portfolio so far? and if so, could you maybe give us an inkling as to what some of the primary metrics look like in terms of cumulative losses and stuff like that?
susan g. riel -- president, chief executive officer and director
i think we've run stress tests every quarter. this quarter, we'll probably be running some specific to the industry segments we're most concerned about. but all of the stress tests that we run on income-producing commercial real estate and on construction have come back in pretty good shape. we would show that on an interest-only basis, about 84% of the portfolio would still continue to perform if we had a drop of 10% in income and an increase of 2% in interest rates. so we're going to be tweaking that with less of an increase in interest rates and more of a decline in income.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay. okay. and then two last quick ones from me. the sponsor that has the two ultra-high-end properties that are have been repossessed. do you have any more loans to the sponsor?
susan g. riel -- president, chief executive officer and director
sorry.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
insights into the sponsor associated with the high-end real estate?
susan g. riel -- president, chief executive officer and director
a very strong sponsor, very strong. high depositor.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
specifically, about the i'm sorry, but were you asking specifically about what was moved to oreo or just general?
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
no. i just wanted to know if you had any more exposure to this specific sponsor? if so, how you felt about the exposure?
susan g. riel -- president, chief executive officer and director
the sponsor on the oreo properties?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
correct.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
yes.
susan g. riel -- president, chief executive officer and director
i'm sorry. i misunderstood. i thought you were asking about the sponsor on the hotel property. on the sponsor on the two high-end properties is not hugely experienced in that market, and that was probably one of his bigger issues. i think you put too much money into the houses and ask for too much money when he has them listed. we're at a much more reasonable number when we do that. it's difficult to predict whether we'll see a recovery on those or not. but that those wheels were put in motion months ago. it was pre-coronavirus and the foreclosures occurred in january. so depending upon how long this lasts, we'll see what we're ultimately able to produce. but the current carrying value, i'm very comfortable with.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay. and then last one. susan, you understand the uncertainty and the impossibility of predicting the timing of the resolution to the investigations. but just wanted to clarify that it sounds like you all are still in the document production phase of the investigation. is that fair to say?
susan g. riel -- president, chief executive officer and director
we are still we believe we're at the end of it, but we are still in that phase.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay. all right. thank you very much, everyone for all the color i appreciate it.
susan g. riel -- president, chief executive officer and director
thank you.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to eagle bancorp, inc.'s second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to one of your speakers today, chief financial officer, charles levingston. sir, please go ahead.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
thank you, michelle. good morning. this is charles levingston, chief financial officer of eagle bancorp. before we begin the presentation, i would like to remind everyone that some of the comments made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements. our form 10-k for the 2019 fiscal year, our quarterly reports on form 10-q, and current reports on form 8-k identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning.
the company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, or future events, or developments unless required by law. this morning's commentary will include non-gaap financial information. the earnings release which is posted in the investor relations section of the company's website and filed with the sec contains reconciliation to this information, to the most directly comparable gaap information. our periodic reports are available from the company or online on the company's website or the sec website. i would like to remind you that it is our policy not to establish with the markets any earnings, margin, or balance sheet guidance.
now, i would like to introduce susan riel, the president and ceo of eagle bancorp.
susan g. riel -- president & chief executive officer of eagle bancorp, inc., president & chief executive officer of e
thank you, charles. as is our custom, our chief credit officer, jan williams is also on the line with us this morning. charles, jan and i will be available later in the call for questions. before i begin the discussion on -- of our financial results, i would like to extend our thoughts and hope for all of those on the call, our community here in the washington d.c. metropolitan area and especially our customers and employees during this time, the stress caused by covid-19 pandemic. the impact on the health, social, and economic aspects of our community has been significant causing us to change the way we live and conduct business. however, we are committed to providing the excellent relationship first service we are known for while maintaining a safe environment for our customers and employees.
we are equally committed to our role as a supporter of our local communities as we all work together to define the new normal. the second quarter results of 2020, we reported last evening was the first full quarter operating in the covid-19 pandemic environment. that environment was both unusual and challenging. considering all factors we feel our company performed well. the net income for the second quarter of 2020 was $28.9 million, as compared to $37.2 million a year ago, both basic and fully diluted earnings per share or $0.90 for the second quarter compared to a $1.08 for both measures in the second quarter of 2019. the net income of $28.9 million in the second quarter represented a 25% increase over the first quarter 2020 earnings of $23.1 million. the level of profitability and quality of our earnings remains strong, and we believe above peer group averages as the second quarter resulted in a return on average asset of 1.12%, a return on average common equity of 9.84% and a return on average tangible common equity of 10.80%.
the financial results for the second quarter were driven primarily by growth in average loans and deposits, top line revenue growth by non-interest income, maintenance of credit quality, and improved efficiency and operating leverage. however, during the quarter we did see a decline in the net interest margin, which was impacted by the abundance of a liquidity on our balance sheet by substantially lower interest rates during the quarter due to the actions of the federal reserve in march and by our participation in the payroll protection program. for the second quarter 2020, total revenue grew by 7% as compared to the second quarter of 2019. while over the same 12-month period non-interest expenses increased only about 5%.
the efficiency ratio was 37.18% in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to 38.04% in the second quarter of 2019 and 43.83% for the first quarter of 2020. the significant improvement over the second quarter of 2019 was primarily due to increased levels of non-interest income, primarily gains and fees generated from the sale of loans and modest growth in non-interest expense. our continuing attention to operating leverage with strong revenue growth combined with lesser growth of our non-interest expenses has traditionally been a key factor for our profitability and it certainly was in the second quarter of this year. compared to the first quarter of 2020, our second quarter efficiency ratio improved to 37.18% from 43.83%, due to both higher non-interest revenue and lower legal expenses.
we are pleased to report that the level of non-interest income was $12.5 million for the quarter, which is a 96% increase over the second quarter of 2019 and 128% increase over the first quarter of 2020. the growth as compared to the second quarter of 2019 included a $1.2 million increase in gains on the sale of residential mortgages, a $2.5 million increase in fees from the securitization, sale and servicing of fha loans and a $1.3 million increase in higher sba -- sbic income. as we have seen across the industry, the low interest rate environment has created tremendous demand for refi mortgages. and we have capitalized on that. our residential mortgage division closed $308 million of loans in the second quarter of this year as compared to $152 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $193 million in the first quarter of 2020. we are particularly pleased with success achieved by our fha division during the quarter.
as we have discussed previously, the revenue stream from the fha division is not smooth from quarter-to-quarter but tends to be irregular, almost lumpy due to the size of the transactions as compared to the high volume business of smaller transactions like the residential mortgage division. we were pleased with the mix of transactions during the quarter, as we saw loans that were straight, refinanced to allow the borrower to refinance at a lower rate as well as where the fha loan was the permanent financing to take out a construction or bridge loan we had originally financed. the small business investment corp. income recognized was from our investment in mezzanine financing of various small business projects for which the bank also achieves community reinvestment act regulatory benefits.
the trend of loan growth continued as the average loan balance for the second quarter increased 10% over the average loan balance in the second quarter of 2019 and 5% over the first quarter of 2020. about 90% of the loan growth during the quarter was from loans generated under the paycheck protection program, which was part of the cares act authorized by congress in march of this year. as reported earlier, we approved almost $500 million in loans to just over 1,400 businesses under the program. the balance of ppp loans was $456 million at june 30. other than the ppp loans, we had a net decrease of $276 million in the loan portfolio during the quarter. decreases were seen in both c&i loans and income-producing cre loans. as new loan activity was impacted by the covid-19 environment, we believe the c&i portfolio decline was largely tied to repayments of lines of credit advances that were initially drawn in an abundance of caution by many businesses at the end of march, as the covid-19 pandemic began to show more signs of business concerns.
we continue to see some demand in the marketplace but are being very selective in bringing new relationships into the portfolio at this point in the economic and credit cycle. our lending teams are spending most of their time tending and nurturing existing relationships. as we mentioned in the press release and have discussed many times on these earnings calls, we focus more on average balances, deposits than the end of period balances because our earnings capacity is more closely aligned with the average balances for any period. our experience during the second quarter really demonstrates that. the point-to-point end of period analysis shows a decrease in deposits of $206 million during the quarter with a balance a $7.9 billion at june 30.
however, the average deposit balances for the quarter were $8.5 billion, which comprised an increase of $786 million or 10% over the first quarter of 2020 and increased $1.6 billion or 23% over the second quarter of 2019. in part we attribute the second quarter 2020 disparity between average deposit balance changes and period-end balance changes to the large amount of deposit gains that occurred in the first quarter of 2020, plus 13%, which remained in the bank for much of the second quarter and we believe was withdrawn late in the second quarter as the stock market recovered strongly in june and balances moved out of bank deposits. this increase in average deposits is likely the result of the flow of liquidity into the banking system created by the policy decisions of the federal reserve over the last two quarters.
we have the benefit of these deposits because of our strong customer relationship with financial intermediaries, asset managers, law firms and entitled [phonetic] companies. however, these deposit balances do fluctuate and in this case the average balance for the quarter was significantly higher than the period-end balance. on the asset side of the balance sheet, loan yields dropped 44 basis points during the second quarter with about 7 basis points attributable to the low yielding ppp loans. the rest of the decrease in the loan yields is attributable to market conditions, which saw 105 basis point decline in average one month libor during the quarter. at june 30, 2020 the significant portion of our loan portfolio that is variable or adjustable rate. 55% had a majority of its loans in interest rate floors, which we feel gives us firm protection against the further declines in loan portfolio yield.
the yield on total average earning assets decreased 64 basis points during the quarter. in addition to the drop in loan yields the returns in the securities portfolio was negatively impacted by substantial prepayments of mortgage-backed securities in the quarter. the average loan-to-deposit ratio for the second quarter of 2020 was 94%, which is at the low end of a range we feel is prudent. we continue to maintain demand deposits at a very favorable level of 30% of average deposits for the quarter, which certainly benefits the margins. the efficiency ratio improved to 37.18% as compared to 38.04% in the second quarter of 2019 and 43.83% in the first quarter of 2020. as earlier mentioned, consistent with our focus on operating leverage, the improvement in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2020 was due to both the increase in non-interest income combined with a reduction in non-interest expenses.
for the quarter, we incurred a more reasonable level of legal expenses and a reduced accrual for expenses related to the resignation of our former chairman and ceo. the previously disclosed government agency investigations in class action lawsuit are ongoing. however, the associated expenses were lower in the second quarter as subpoena production and testimony subsided. and we've recovered on certain defense costs against an insurance claim for items otherwise expensed in previous years. we are maintaining our disciplined management of all other expenses while keeping in mind the need to continually improve our human capital and our it infrastructure as we hover near to the $10 billion asset size and evaluate the additional regulatory requirements, which are effective above that level.
we are very pleased that in june, we had two additions to our executive management team. sam pepper who is our new chief operating officer has extensive experience with community banks in the midwest and in new england. jeff curry, our new chief risk officer succeeds susan kooker who retired in april. jeff joins us from deloitte where he was an advisor to many bank clients on compliance and risk management functions. since the acceleration of the covid-19 pandemic in mid-march, we have been constantly reaching out to our borrowing customers to assist -- to assess the risk level of each borrower and offer support and where appropriate negotiate loan modification. we feel that the credit quality of the portfolio is manageable at this point but continue to monitor for potential deterioration and we'll adjust our assessments depending on the severity and duration of the economic downturn.
through june 30, 2020 we have approved payment deferrals on 708 loans totaling $1.63 billion or approximately 20% of the loan portfolio. during the second quarter, we saw a modest uptick in some of the credit quality statistics consistent with the current economic environment and we are reacting accordingly. at june 30, 2020 npas as a percentage of total assets were 0.69% as compared to 0.45% at june 30, 2019 and 0.56% at march 31, 2020. the absolute level of npas was $67.2 million at june 30, 2020 as compared to $38.8 million at june 30, 2019 and $55.3 million at march 31, 2020. the bank has consistently taken an aggressive approach to reviewing individual loans for impairment and accrual status. the allowance for loan losses was 1.36% of total loans at the end of the quarter and has increased from 1.23% at the end of the first quarter of 2020.
these allowance levels have been derived using the new cecl accounting standards. no allowance has been provided for the $456 million of ppp loans given that both loans are fully guaranteed by the u.s. -- united states small business administration, which has diluted the allowance ratio by approximately 8 basis points. annualized net charge-offs for the second quarter was 36 basis points of average loans as compared to 8 basis points in the second quarter of 2019 and 12 basis points in the first quarter of 2019. the charge-offs in the second quarter were primarily from one commercial relationship in the personal services industry. at june 30, 2020 coverage ratio of reserves to non-performing loans was 185% as compared to 193% in june 2019.
given the uncertainty about how long the covid-19 pandemic will impact the washington d.c. metropolitan area, we continue to monitor the economy and our customer base. the most recent reports from the fuller institute and the bureau of labor statistics indicate that during the period of march through may the region lost about 337,000 jobs or about 10.2% of our employment base. most of the jobs lost and business closings were in the accommodation and food service industries. so we will continue to closely monitor our exposure to that sector, which was 10%-about 10% of the loan portfolio at june 30. our exposure to the retail sector is about 1% of total loans. while the covid-19 pandemic has certainly had an impact on the income statement, we feel our balance sheet remains resilient. our capital position was again strong as of the end of the second quarter.
the total risk-based capital ratio was 16.33% at june 30, 2020 and the tier 1 capital to average assets ratio or leverage ratio was 10.63% at june 30, as compared to a year ago at 16.36% and 12.66% respectively. the reduction in the tier 1 capital to average assets ratio was largely the result of share repurchase activity. our capital ratios remain well in excess of both regulatory measures and internal policy levels. like many, we are concerned about the recent resurgence of covid-19 across several areas of our country. however, we remain cautiously optimistic about the strength of the regional economy. while we continually monitor that, our strong balance sheet, continued profitability and our dedicated customer-focused employees are why we feel we are well-positioned to work through today's challenging environment. this concludes my formal remarks.
we would be pleased to take any questions at this time.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott. your line is open please go ahead.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
hey, thanks, good morning. just wanted to ask about the charge off in the quarter, i know you gave a little bit of color here this morning on the press release. just want to know if that is something that is repeated by other borrowers or will be more one-off as you see?
susan g. riel -- president & chief executive officer of eagle bancorp, inc., president & chief executive officer of e
well at this point chris, it appears that it's a one-off item although depending upon the duration and severity of covid things could change. but as of right now this was a chain of hair salons and they were completely closed down and ultimately filed for bankruptcy so we went ahead and took the loss.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
got it. and do you have any, i guess, preliminary trends that you can share with us about classified and criticized and kind of how they have changed from last quarter to now and then maybe kind of what -- how that may play out as modifications go another quarter?
susan g. riel -- president & chief executive officer of eagle bancorp, inc., president & chief executive officer of e
criticized are up modestly, classified are down modestly. overall we have a slight uptick. we are keeping our eye on it as we go through deferrals and evaluate loans on an ongoing basis. we're pretty scrupulous about rerisk grading and adding to the watch list where necessary.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
okay. and then finally, just wanted to ask you if there is any kind of updated trend as we had late july on modifications -- would they have been different than what you reported at the end of the quarter?
susan g. riel -- president & chief executive officer of eagle bancorp, inc., president & chief executive officer of e
it's not materially different. it's been relatively flat through last friday. we had 718 modifications as opposed to the 708 that were through june 30. the dollar increase was roughly $15 million, yeah, rounding $17 million.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
okay, great. thank you for the background. i appreciate it.
susan g. riel -- president & chief executive officer of eagle bancorp, inc., president & chief executive officer of e
no problem.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of steve comery with g.research. your line is open. please go ahead.
steven comery -- g.research -- analyst
fha multifamily, i know the press release second quarter, the numbers can be uneven and i appreciate that. but maybe is there like a way we can think about maybe full year revenue opportunity, two-year revenue opportunity someway to like under -- to like handicap with the revenue opportunities there?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
sure. sorry steve. we only call a portion of that question but i think i got the gist of it. unfortunately we've learned to exercise some caution when it comes to counting on revenues associated with that line of business as we telegraphed that it can be pretty lumpy. we do feel good about our pipeline. we think we've got some or building some traction there. certainly what we experienced here in the second quarter was a pretty healthy pop. i wouldn't necessarily anticipate those kinds of levels going forward, but we are expecting some kind of contribution from that business over the next several quarters whether or not it all gets kind of baked into two quarters from now or three quarters from now is really tough to say unfortunately.
steven comery -- g.research -- analyst
okay. fair enough. and then maybe if we can move on to the deferrals, so should i understand these deferrals is mostly like 60- or 90-day deferrals? and then should we expect some of them to expire during the third quarter? and then if that's the case i guess kind of what's the process as deferrals expire?
janice l. williams, esquire -- executive vice president of eagle bancorp, inc., senior executive vice president & chief credit offi
yeah. this is jan. we are expecting that deferrals will -- which were originally predominantly 90 days, i think the sba were a little longer, they were 180 days because of the sba making the payments, but the overwhelming majority of everything else with a 90-day deferral. yes, we would anticipate that those would be terminating over the next couple of months. haven't seen a lot so far because most of them were done either in april or may, possibly june, so rolling into september -- rolling into july not that many have come up at this point but we have stood up an independent taskforce within the credit area that is devoted to evaluating the portfolio for covid ramifications. it is handling all of the requests for deferrals at this point and in evaluating whether or not it's prudent to move forward with the second potential 90-day deferral whether that be on an interest only basis or a complete payment deferral.
the taskforce made up of folks with strong credit skills. we'll looking at remediation plans and whether those plans effectively will be able to return the credit to performing status at the end of a potential additional 90-day deferral. and that's really going to be determinative of whether that is or even offered or not. i can give you a little additional color on our deferrals. we have at july 17th $1.65 billion in outstanding. that's about 20.5% of the portfolio, 87% of those deferrals are secured by real estate cash or marketable securities. the weighted average loan to value on that 87% is 62%. so we feel like we have good protection there, a fair amount of room to move on loan to values. the more immediate issue is whether they're going to become non-performing loans or not as cash flow and liquidity may be strained for some of these businesses.
hotels, we have $482 million deferred. rhe weighted average loan to value on those is 63%. restaurants, $156 million deferred. 47% of that is secured by real estate cash or marketables.
the average loan to value on the real estate securing that portion of restaurants is 61%. we also have pulled some other statistics; churches we have $87 million with deferrals. the weighted average loan to value there is 51%. art, entertainment and recreation we have $50 million deferred, $37 million is secured by real estate with loan to value of 38%. healthcare we have $46 million deferred, $38 million is secured by real estate and marketables. the real estate weighted average loan to value is 64%. and then we have a very small amount in education, $4.5 million, and $3 million of that secured by real estate with a weighted average loan to value of 70%. that will give you a little more color, i think on loss potential in the deferral area. i think we are fortunate that we do have 87% of the deferral secured by real estate cash or marketable. and as we move through the evaluation of whether or not a second deferral is deemed prudent we'll be looking at when we could expect these individual loans to cash flow and support ongoing performance.
steven comery -- g.research -- analyst
okay. that was was extremely helpful. thank you for that. that's it for me.
janice l. williams, esquire -- executive vice president of eagle bancorp, inc., senior executive vice president & chief credit offi
okay.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of brody preston with stephens. your line is open. please go ahead.
andrew terrell -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
hey this is actually andrew terrell on for brody this morning.
susan g. riel -- president & chief executive officer of eagle bancorp, inc., president & chief executive officer of e
good morning.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
good morning.
andrew terrell -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
good morning. hey. just maybe to start on the accommodation and food services portfolio, i guess taking the deferrals numbers you just gave relative to the outstanding balances. i get to call it close to 70% deferral rate. i'm curious do you have handy what the reserve that you currently have against those loans are?
susan g. riel -- president & chief executive officer of eagle bancorp, inc., president & chief executive officer of e
not on a specific loan basis, i don't have that information with me.
andrew terrell -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
i guess just in aggregate for the accommodation and food services portfolio?
susan g. riel -- president & chief executive officer of eagle bancorp, inc., president & chief executive officer of e
let me take a look and see if i have it split out that way. charles, i don't know if you have got it with you.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
i don't have it on hand, no. yeah, maybe we can get back.
susan g. riel -- president & chief executive officer of eagle bancorp, inc., president & chief executive officer of e
i may be able to get back to you on that. that's not information that we typically have provided in the past.
andrew terrell -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
no, that's totally fine. maybe moving over to the commentary you guys provided on loan originations. can you give us maybe a sense of how far below normal levels the originations were in this quarter and then maybe what the current pipeline looks like?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
yeah, sure. in terms of new loans generated in the quarter just as an example, we've typically originated somewhere on average of just over $300 million, $325 million a quarter over the last call it five quarters. and in this quarter the new loans originated were about a $115 million. so it's about a little more than a third.
andrew terrell -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
got it. thank you. and maybe last one for me, just kind of a housekeeping question, do you have what the average ppp balances, loans balances were in the quarter?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
well, the average ppp loan?
andrew terrell -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
yes.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
yeah. i mean it's just a little over i believe a little over $350,000 is my best recollection of what that numbers is. i think it just reaches that threshold of that first tier of the fee level.
andrew terrell -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
i'm sorry i meant the -- on the average balance sheet for the quarter what the average outstanding ppp loans were?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
yeah, $328 million.
andrew terrell -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay. that's it for me. thanks for taking my questions.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of stuart lotz with kbw. your line is open. please go ahead.
stuart lotz -- keefe , bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
hey guys, good morning.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
good morning.
susan g. riel -- president & chief executive officer of eagle bancorp, inc., president & chief executive officer of e
good morning.
stuart lotz -- keefe , bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
charles, i guess a question for you?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
sure.
stuart lotz -- keefe , bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
looking out the margin this quarter you guys made great progress lowering deposit costs and obviously some of that was helped by deposit inflows. how are you thinking about -- as some those non-interest bearing deposits start to flow back out, how are you thinking about deposit costs into the back half of this year? do you think we've reached the bottom but you still have some more wiggle room to get deposit costs down?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
yeah. if so, it's incremental. our top tier money market rate right now is 30 basis points. as you suggested, we did get out in front of it when we saw a lot of this activity happening. obviously we saw, significant drops in short term rates, libor was down -- period end call that 60 basis points, 150 basis points or so. actually i'm sorry more -- well, 160 basis points from 12/31, i believe. so i -- we've seen obviously some of the online banks start to come in our direction, which puts continued pressure on those folks. the only other aspect of our funding mix, where i do see a lot of room is it's certainly in our term deposits, in our cds. as those roll off and reprice, i would expect some additional relief there.
but on the money market front, it does look like those may roll out. we also talked or you also mentioned dda flows, non-interest-bearing flowing back out, yeah, to your point, a lot of the ppp loans that were funded -- funded into operating accounts. so we did see dda balances push up in the quarter as a result of that. i would expect as those funds get utilized that those would as you suggested flow back out, all things equal -- may reduce that dda balance on average. but yeah, provided that there is obviously a significant amount of liquidity sloshing around there in the marketplace that we can counter that outflow of ppp non-interest bearing deposits with actually collecting new deposits that could certainly be a helpful element as well if we're able to accomplish that.
stuart lotz -- keefe , bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
thanks for your color there. and then how are you thinking about the ppp, i know in this quarter, i think it was a 290 yield. how are you thinking about realization of the ppp fees? and do you expect -- i think some of your peers are kind of saying majority of that will i mean a lot is still uncertain, but a lot of that will probably flow through in 3q and 4q. how are you guys modeling that?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
yeah. that would be my hope i guess i would say, right, it is going to be dependent upon the details of the forgiveness process and i do think that there is some rails in there that would suggest that, that's not a bad bet, that we can get a lot of those through here in the third and fourth quarter. there's also certainly we've been having discussions. there's a lot of banks have about the potential that we could sell the portfolio, that no decision has been made there. but it's something that certainly we're having internal discussions about as we get a little smarter about what the process is going to be for forgiveness and the kind of operational strain that that might have. so, yeah, i think third and fourth quarter is a reasonable assumption at this point.
stuart lotz -- keefe , bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
okay, got it. and sorry, last one for me. i'm sorry if i missed it. what percent of your book, which floors is now out of the floor following the fed news in march?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
yeah. it's almost a 100%, about $3 billion, a little over $3 billion.
stuart lotz -- keefe , bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
okay. so putting that altogether, loan yields could probably stabilize by year-end even with the churn of the portfolio. is that how you're kind of thinking about?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
right. ppp obviously yeah, i mean we're putting on loans now. again, it was a modest quarter for production as we discussed earlier, about a $115 million in loans including the deferred fees and costs, call it a $460 million that they're being originated at. so we could see some stability there.
stuart lotz -- keefe , bruyette & woods, inc. -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions and congrats on nice quarter guys.
susan g. riel -- president & chief executive officer of eagle bancorp, inc., president & chief executive officer of e

thank you. and our next question comes from the line of erik zwick with boenning & scattergood. your line is open. please go ahead.
erik zwick -- boenning & scattergood, inc. -- analyst
good morning.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
good morning erik.
erik zwick -- boenning & scattergood, inc. -- analyst
i missed the first two minutes of the call. so my apologies if, if this has been asked already. i seem to recall the legal fees this quarter were about $2.5 million and i think when we had a conference call last quarter you mentioned that those fees could potentially kind of slow in the summer months and then pick up in the back half of the year. is that still the expectation and how should we be thinking about those expenses in 3q and 4q?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
yeah, i think that's right erik. we kind of discussed the potential for a little bit of a summer lull here and as activity might pick back up after those months you could see some additional expenses. although at this point we don't anticipate fees at the level that we certainly saw in the first quarter with -- we anticipate that the lion's share of the subpoena production and witness testimony aspects of this which are costly have wrapped up. but as we talked about internal investigations that we conducted they have been concluded in the first quarter. we don't necessarily expect or anticipate those kinds of levels. although again i have to caveat channeling my counsel here that we -- it is impossible to predict, what the outcome might be so with that caveat.
erik zwick -- boenning & scattergood, inc. -- analyst
thanks for the color there. and then just appreciate some of the earlier discussion on the deferrals and susan the detailed description you gave of how you'll look to kind of evaluate those borrowers who ask for extensions and i guess it sounds like an important part of it will be whether at the end of a second extension you think those businesses are back to a more normal cash flows. i guess so there are potentially other considerations as well in terms of kind of those borrowers other assets they have or for some businesses that might take a little bit longer to get back on their feet. i guess at what point do you decide to continue to extend or have to take some sort of charge off or even repossess some real estate at some point? just kind of curious, you're thinking as how this plays out as it may be a multi-quarter event that even extends into 2021 at this point?
susan g. riel -- president & chief executive officer of eagle bancorp, inc., president & chief executive officer of e
well, i think you're correct that we're looking at more than just projections of the business being able to return to a cash flowing operation that can support the debt in considering any second modification, we are going to be adding generally speaking credit enhancements in the form of additional collateral and guarantors support, whenever that's possible. we wanted to try to put the bank and the customer in the best position to continue to operate well without taking on equity risk at the bank. so we are pushing through that process, and i do think evaluating the opportunity to continue to have payments made whether from guarantors or pledged liquid assets is one factor. we're not interested in kicking the can down the road if there isn't a viable exit. we'd rather just push something into nonperforming status sooner rather than later. so all of that timing will depend on what we see as we start processing second request. and at this point, we haven't seen very many. it's too early in the quarter.
erik zwick -- boenning & scattergood, inc. -- analyst
thanks so much for taking my questions.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the eagle bancorp, inc. third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [ operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. [ operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to one of your speakers today, mr. charles levingston, chief financial officer. sir, please go ahead.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, michelle. good morning. this is charles levingston, chief financial officer of eagle bancorp. before we begin the presentation, i would like to remind everyone that some of the comments made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements. our form 10-k for the 2019 fiscal year, our quarterly reports on form 10-q and current reports on form 8-k identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning. the company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments unless required by law. this morning's commentary will include non-gaap financial information. the earnings release, which is posted in the investor relations section of the company's website and filed with the sec, contains the reconciliations of this information to the most directly comparable gaap information. our periodic reports are available from the company or online on the company's website or the sec website. i would like to remind you that while we think that our prospects for continued growth and performance are good, it is our policy not to establish with the markets any earnings, margin or balance sheet guidance. now, i would like to introduce susan riel, the president and ceo of eagle bancorp.
susan g. riel -- senior executive vice president-chief operating officer
thank you, charles. i'd like to welcome all of you to our earnings call for the third quarter of 2020. we appreciate your calling in this morning and your continued interest in eagle bancorp. as usual, jan williams, our chief credit officer, is also with us this morning. jan, charles and i will be available later in the call for questions. i'm very pleased to announce that during this very trying time, eagle bancorp had a very successful third quarter. despite the soft uncertain economy created by the pandemic and the very challenging interest rate and operating environment, our quarterly earnings were $41.3 million. that represents a 13.2% increase over the third quarter of 2019 and an increase of 43.3% over the second quarter of this year. and i am proud to say that for the period, we reached the highest level of quarterly revenue and net income our company has ever achieved. the return on average assets for the third quarter was 1.57%. the return on average common equity was 14.46%, and the return on average tangible common equity was 15.93%. at these levels, our profitability is among the highest level for community banks in the united states. for the third quarter, earnings were $1.28 per fully diluted share, which is a 19.6% increase over the same period last year and a 42.2% increase over the earnings per share in the second quarter of 2020.
the improved profitability in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2020 was driven primarily by an increase in noninterest income, combined with a lower provision and reduced levels of legal expenses associated with our publicly disclosed investigations and class action litigation. as for the generation of the noninterest income, we were extremely pleased by the performance of the residential mortgage division, which produced $12 million in gains on sale of loans during the quarter. in addition, we also achieved gains from the securitization and sale of fha loans from the successful sale of oreo property during the period and from the sale of sba guaranteed loans. we strive for consistent performance across all financial measurement indicators and are pleased to note that we had continued growth in the balance sheet with assets reaching $10.1 billion at september 30. for the third quarter, we achieved strong deposit growth, maintained solid credit statistics and very favorable operating efficiency. the strong performance in these areas, in addition to the increase in noninterest income more than offset the impact of further compression in the net interest margin and a slight decline in loan portfolio balances, notably in the construction loan portfolio. i would also like to speak in more detail about the results we had for noninterest income in the third quarter. not surprisingly, the historically low interest rate environment has been a real boon to the residential mortgage division for both refinance and purchase money loan activity.
for the quarter, gains on sales were $12 million as compared to $1.9 million in the third quarter a year ago and $3 million in the second quarter of 2020. we did change the accounting methodology for recognizing gains on residential mortgage loans locked on a best efforts basis to align with gaap by recognizing revenue upon the loan being locked versus when the loan is closed. this increased the revenue in the third quarter by $1.6 million. but even excluding that impact, our residential mortgage division had a very strong quarter. loan locks during the quarter were $593 million as compared to $282 million in the third quarter of 2019. during the quarter, we also recognized gains of $1.2 million from the sale of oreo assets. the fact that we were able to realize these gains are reflective of the disciplined and proactive approach we take to managing workout situations. additionally, we had good production during the quarter by our fha division of $912,000 from their securitization sales and servicing activities and $168,000 in premiums on the sale of sba loans. we've spoken many times about how these fee income business lines tend to be cyclical. like the residential mortgage division or not easily predictable like the sba and fha groups, but believe that over the long run, they add value to our franchise. we certainly saw that this quarter, and i would like to thank the employees in those groups for all of their efforts and congratulate them on a job well done. i would also like to recognize the impact that our emphasis on disciplined underwriting and conservative credit administration practices have had on our credit quality statistics, which continue at reasonable levels despite the slowdown in the economy. at september 30, nonperforming assets were 0.62% of total assets as compared to 0.66% a year earlier and 0.69% at june 30, 2020.
at quarter end, nonperforming loans were 0.74% of total loans, a manageable number. net charge-offs to average loans for the third quarter were 0.26% as compared to 0.08% one year ago and 0.36% in the second quarter of 2020. the charge-offs in the third quarter were due primarily to two commercial real estate loan relationships. at september 30, 2020, the allowance for credit losses was 1.40% of total loans, offset by eight basis points by the amount of ppp loans in the portfolio. also at september 30, the coverage ratio was 190% as compared to 128% a year ago. and we feel we are adequately reserved. the allowance level was determined in accordance with the cecl methodology adopted earlier this year. the third quarter 2020 analysis took into account an improved unemployment rate assumption and additional qualitative reserves for second deferrals as well as our higher mix of accommodation & food services industry loans. the provision was $6.6 million in the third quarter compares to a provision of $3.2 million in the third quarter of 2019 and a $19.7 million in the second quarter of 2020. additionally, our cecl reserve for unfunded commitments was reduced by $2.1 million. as to some of the specifics related to the covid-19 pandemic as of september 30, the balance of ppp loans was $456 million. we are starting to see more activity from our clients now that the treasury department and the sba has streamlined the application process for forgiveness of all loans under $50,000, but expect that the attrition of these loans from our portfolio will take a couple of quarters, at least.
regarding loans, which were deferred or modified, you will recall that in june, we had 708 loans totaling about $1.6 billion, 20% of total loans in that category. at which point, we formed a special task force to monitor and work with these customers. i am pleased to report that as of september 30, that pool of loans is down to 321 loans, about $851 million, which is 10.8% of total notes, which will continue -- we will continue to work with our clients to remediate these loans. we also continue to monitor the impact of covid-19 on the health and safety of our staff and customers. we have a spotlight on the at-risk industry exposure in our portfolio, our loan portfolio, most notably the accommodation & food services and retail industries, which together comprised 11.5% of the loan portfolio. however, we are still cautiously optimistic about the economy of the washington, d.c. metropolitan area. while there certainly has been an impact from the covid pandemic, the most realistic estimates are that the regional economy will shrink about 5.5% this year. at that level, the gross regional product would still be in excess of $500 billion per annum and the washington metropolitan area is the 5th largest regional economy in the united states. the rebound in job growth began in june. and since then, the region has recovered approximately 100,000 of the jobs lost in the spring. and that, we are on track to add another 40,000 jobs in 2021. we are carefully watching the vacancy rates for office space throughout the region, which shows some softening.
however, housing remains fairly strong for both the multifamily and single-family sectors. in fact, there is a shortage of inventory in single family homes. through june of 2020, federal contract awards for covid related matters in the region have been just over $3.5 billion. and there is no doubt that federal government spending has been a stabilizing factor for our economy. given the low interest rate environment, fostered by the federal reserve and the trend of margin compression across the industry, it is not surprising that in the third quarter, we saw a decrease of the net interest margin to 3.08%. the margin was down 18 basis points from the second quarter of this year and down 64 basis points from a year ago. the decrease in the margin was attributable to several factors. the yield on our loan portfolio decreased by 17 basis points to 4.46% for the third quarter as average market rates decreased during the period, reducing the yield on new bookings, and we reacted to competitive pressure to reprice loans currently on the books. we are also feeling the impact of the lower percentage of higher-yielding construction loans in the portfolio. long floors on the portion of the loan portfolio did provide a buffer against further decreases in loan yields. we were able to reduce both the cost of interest-bearing deposits and the aggregate cost of funds during the quarter, which fell by seven basis points.
however, the total yield on interest-earning assets declined 25 basis points during the period, a significant factor being the increased level of on-balance sheet liquidity, whose yield was only 12 basis points. in addition to the very low level of market interest rates, relatively flat yield curve and competitive lending environment, the margin was significantly impacted in the third quarter of 2020, by our asset liability mix and the level of liquidity we carried through the quarter. for the third quarter, the average loan-to-deposit ratio was 93%, while average overnight liquidity was above $1.3 billion. while we did increase our securities portfolio by an average of $86 million over the third quarter, we continue to maintain on-balance sheet liquidity as we adhere to our conservative asset liability management strategy as we monitor the effects of the covid-19 pandemic. the efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 38.10% as we continued our prudent approach to expense management. this is compared to 38.34% in the third quarter of 2019 and 37.18% in the second quarter of this year. while the efficiency ratio is little changed from a year ago, we need to remember that revenue growth has been hampered by the low level of interest rate. for the third quarter, the ratio of noninterest expenses as a percentage of average assets was 1.40% as compared to 1.49% in the third quarter of last year.
of note, during the quarter, we enjoyed the benefit of lower legal fees as legal accounting and professional fees were $3.1 million for the quarter as compared to $3.6 million in the third quarter of 2019 and $3.9 million in the second quarter of 2020. the net legal expenses for the quarter associated with the investigations and legal matters previously disclosed were $957,000. on the other hand, our occupancy expense for the quarter was elevated as we took a $1.7 million charge to properly value a lease extension and our fdic insurance expenses increased by $2.1 million over a year ago due to the growth in our balance sheet. given our asset size exceeding $10 billion, we will continue to judiciously manage expenses, but will also make the prudent investments necessary to have our infrastructure meet all regulatory expectations and to support the continued growth of our company. the company's capital position remains very strong as we continue to build it through the quarterly additions to retained earnings. at september 30, the total risk-based capital was 16.72% as compared to 16.08% one year ago, the common equity ratio was 12.11% compared to 13.16% one year ago, and the tangible common equity ratio was 11.18% compared to 12.13% in september 2019. these ratios recognize the impact of the share repurchase program.
our strong capital position was one of the factors behind our recent decision to lift the suspension of the share repurchase program, which the board initially put in place back in the spring at the inception of the pandemic. and as you know, we did declare another $0.22 per share cash dividend for the third quarter. the board is committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and is very comfortable with our capital position. thank you again for joining in the call this morning and for your continued support of eagle bancorp. that concludes my formal remarks. we would be pleased to take any questions at this time.

[ operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of casey whitman with piper sandler. your line is open. please go ahead.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good morning.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning. casey
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
so now that you guys have crossed the $10 billion asset threshold, i guess my first question would be, just can you remind us of how big of an impact durbin would have on your fees and the timing of when that would occur?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. yes, casey, that impact, based on my analysis, is somewhere in the neighborhood of about $1.3 million pre-tax, so just under $1 million or so. again, not a significant consumer book of business with the bank. so the impact is minimal.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and that's annual, correct?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
that's right. that's an annualized number, yes.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and what about the timing of that?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
right. my most recent read that if we maintain a balance of total assets in excess of $10 billion at year-end, that will kick in on the first of next year. i think that's right.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
understood. and then i guess as i think about expenses here, i mean, it seems like you're going to have -- you should have a drop in the occupancy expenses in the fourth quarter. but -- and i probably ask this every quarter, but with crossing $10 million (sic) [$10 billion] is there any kind of incremental expenses that we should expect to come from that? or do you guys feel pretty well positioned here?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i think as we've mentioned in prior discussions and calls, we've been building toward the establishment of an infrastructure that can accommodate a $10 billion-plus bank. and so we feel like we're in pretty good shape. i mean, there will be incremental costs associated with some additional people. but most of the systems, we feel like are generally in place. it's not going to be anything that's going to be exponential in terms of cost. we're growing into it.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
understood. and then maybe i'll switch gears. as you think about capital, and as you guys mentioned, restating your buyback, can you walk us through sort of your thoughts about how aggressive you could be with it? and then maybe what your appetite might be for announcing a new program once i think this one expires at the end of the year?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
right. yes. i mean, that's something that our board is continually evaluating. i note that these days, we are trading below book value. so any kind of acquisition of a repurchase of our stock is immediately accretive, which looks pretty attractive from my vantage. but it is something that our board will continue to evaluate each time we come together.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. i'll just ask one more and let someone else jump on. and jan, i don't know if you're on or not, but can you maybe walk us through where the watch -- special mentioned, substandard buckets kind of landed in the quarter? did we see some negative migration there, in particular within the average segments?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president and chief credit officer
yes, casey, i think you should expect to see significant migration into the watch category as we move anything in second covid mod into a watch status so that it's getting a heightened profile at the bank. so you'll see a significant shift, probably about net $520 million moving to a watch category.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it, but not into the special mention substandard?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president and chief credit officer
special mention will be up about $8 million substandard, up about $5 million.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you for the questions.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of steven comery with g. research. your line is open. please go ahead.
steven comery -- g. research. -- analyst
good morning.
janice l. williams -- executive vice president and chief credit officer
hey, good morning, steve.
steven comery -- g. research. -- analyst
i appreciate the commentary on the deferrals being $851 million versus $1.6 billion on $630 million. kind of wondering if you guys had any breakdown as to how much of that was second request versus first request? and maybe just some general color on how eaglebank is handling second request?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president and chief credit officer
yes. to break that out for you, there are roughly $620 million are in second deferrals and 2/3 of that $620 million are partial deferrals, they're interest-only deferrals as opposed to full payment deferrals. i'll give you an example of what we're doing when we are considering second deferrals, looking to provide credit enhancements. for example, we had a large hotel loan that we agreed to do a principal deferral on. and in return, received a $25 million principal curtail and that more than offset from our perspective, the risk associated with an additional deferral. another large relationship where we granted interest-only second deferral, also anticipating a 10% principal reduction as part of that deferral. so we're not really in a situation where we're kicking the can down the road. we're actually using the opportunity to build a stronger credit when these are coming through for their second 90-day deferral request.
steven comery -- g. research. -- analyst
okay. that's very helpful. maybe moving on to the margin. i guess, so sort of a meaningful decline in yields this quarter. i get that the press release and susan, you mentioned in your prepared comments, mentioned some floors, maybe sort of an update on how much of the loan portfolio has floors? and how many of the loans are on the floors? and then maybe bigger picture, would you expect -- do you think that the libor declines are fully in the run rate here? or should we see sort of more coming in in q4?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. there's about $3 billion of the loan portfolio in floors that are at the floors, and that's pretty much all of the floors. so yes, i think that protection does continue. i think -- and susan mentioned this in her comments to another challenge that i think we and a lot of institutions are facing is having borrowers coming in and looking to renegotiate rates, right? and so that can be a challenge. you weigh the calculus of going out and identifying business to replace that versus the rate request in terms of what's being lowered. so that can continue to be a challenge and provide some downward pressure. you had another part to your question. i'm not sure that i answered that the whole question, libor? libor, so yes, i do think to the extent that libor only moved down one basis point over the period, that a lot of that downward float is baked in. so yes, i think we've seen the majority of that at this point.
steven comery -- g. research. -- analyst
okay. i appreciate that. maybe one more for me, just sort of a more general question on sort of loan demand. loans were down on a period end basis, you did deploy a decent amount of liquidity in the securities book. is the demand just not there? or is the company being sort of more conservative with the credit it's extending?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i would say, steve, that demand is certainly a little bit slower, and we are being cautious about the kinds of deals that we're approaching and self selecting out of or otherwise giving a hard look to. so yes, our channel, our president of commercial lending, who says, there used to be the go go go days, and now it's just the go days. so yes, i'd say that there has been a little bit of a pullback in some of that activity to date, but we're still seeing some flow.
steven comery -- g. research. -- analyst
okay, thank you very much.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of catherine mealor with kbw. your line is open. please go ahead.
catherine mealor -- kbw. -- analyst
thanks, good morning. i wanted to start on just a follow-up. i want to start on just a follow-up on the margin. i know a lot of what's driving the margin lower is just the level of excess liquidity that you've got on the balance sheet. charles, how are you thinking about just the timing of how long this excess liquidity stays and any efforts to deploy that excess liquidity? maybe kind of how that fits into your overall big picture view of the direction of the margin into next year?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. yes. we did see that liquidity picture turn pretty quickly earlier this year when the pandemic hit. and all of a sudden, there was this glut of liquidity that's remained on the balance sheet. we are being judicious about how we deploy that. we don't want it to all be pushed out into the investment portfolio at one point in time. and if one tender it as it were. but we want to be cautious to the extent that it could turn again at some point. at the same time, we want to put that money to work. we're trying to actively manage that excess liquidity to the extent we can. and again, on the other side, we still want to be able to bank our customers. so that's a little bit of the tension there. obviously, a lever that can be used is price. and we certainly feel like we've pulled on that lever with our top-tier money market rate at about 25 basis points. so to the extent that there's more room to go down there to manage some of those funds down, that could be part of the solution. but in terms of deploying that liquidity, i think it's at a measured pace over the next several quarters to the extent that it sticks around.
catherine mealor -- kbw. -- analyst
great. okay. and then on the mortgage outlook, and this is a really strong mortgage quarter. how are you thinking about just kind of more seasonal normalized level as we look to fourth quarter?
susan g. riel -- senior executive vice president-chief operating officer
no, i would say, catherine, that, as you well know, the mortgage volume depends on rates. and it's anyone's guess as to what will happen. i think the rates will stay low for a while. and so our activity will continue to be pretty high. so we're looking forward to that. and we feel confident that it will continue for a while.
catherine mealor -- kbw. -- analyst
and remind me on the number this quarter, how much is just from the gains on the lock of the fair value -- the fair value lock on the pipeline. and then i know you mentioned this kind of change in best efforts methodologies, maybe is there a way to quantify how much of this quarter was just from kind of the accounting dynamics versus just true rate and volume?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. yes. that number was $1.6 million.
catherine mealor -- kbw. -- analyst
okay, great.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
did that answer? great, great.
catherine mealor -- kbw. -- analyst
yes, sir. thank you so much.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, no problem.
susan g. riel -- senior executive vice president-chief operating officer
thanks, katherine.
catherine mealor -- kbw. -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott. your line is open. please go ahead.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott. -- analyst
thank you, jan. i just wanted to go back to the watch comment that you made earlier. what happens to move something from watch into special mention going forward? and to what extent did the watch movement impact the reserve calculation at the end of september?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president and chief credit officer
well, chris, those are good questions. we have internal metrics that we use to calculate when loans are going to be moved from watch to special mention. and i think it depends on the severity and duration of the impact. right now, we're not looking at a whole lot of the second deferrals that are impacted in terms of their ability to make interest payments. so they're in the watch category, if there was a complete payment deferral, we would push that further. but i think overall, the majority, about $500 million of those second deferrals will show up in watch.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott. -- analyst
okay. and that's watch now? or would that be watch in third -- the fourth quarter reporting?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president and chief credit officer
well, i won't know what the end of the fourth quarter will look like. and we've reached the -- essentially the end of the first deferrals for all but $220-ish million in first deferrals that are outstanding. we're not anticipating that we're going to be going into second deferrals with those at this point, although circumstances could certainly change. i think there's probably more upside opportunity there than not as we look at whether a second stimulus package will happen in the fourth quarter. so right now, i think we've been fairly conservative in raising the profile on a lot of these loans by putting them into the watch category and having the covid task force focus on whether or not these second deferrals make sense.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott. -- analyst
got you. okay. that's great, jan. and then, susan, just a quick one for you. on the legal expenses that we see, is there anything that you would expect going forward? i mean, would those retreat after what you've spent year-to-date? or just any additional thought about that?
susan g. riel -- senior executive vice president-chief operating officer
at this point, we don't have any view into what those legal expenses will be at this point. so we expect them to be ongoing. we will continue to have elevated legal expenses as a result of the investigations in the civil lawsuit, but we can't predict at this point what they will be.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott. -- analyst
got it. great, thank you both for the information.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of brody preston with stephens, inc. your line is open. please go ahead.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
janice l. williams -- executive vice president and chief credit officer
hey, good morning brody.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
hey. so i just wanted to -- i'm sorry if i missed it in the prepared remarks. i hopped on a little bit late. just -- i appreciate, i think it was $500 million or so was second deferral, and i appreciate the breakdown that you gave of industry and collateral type. but i just wanted to hone in on the hotels and ask if you had given the weighted average ltv on that? or if i maybe skimmed over it in the release.
janice l. williams -- executive vice president and chief credit officer
yes, the weighted average loan-to-value on the hotel deferrals is at 60%, the highest on the second deferrals is 75%. everything else is below that level. i think i did mention that we had about a 25% pay down on our largest hotel loan as a principal curtail as part of the second deferral. so we're actively managing that portfolio.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay. okay. great. and then just as i think about crossing $10 billion, and i think you said it was like $1 million or so annualized in durbin related impacts from crossing $10 billion. i mean, it just seems like just given how de minimis that is, i guess, maybe assuming there's better growth opportunities early next year. is there any reason why you guys wouldn't just, i guess, maybe continue to grow the balance sheet and just push beyond that yourselves, without necessarily considering partnering with anybody?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i think that's right. we're going to continue to carry on. we'll always be opportunistic. there may be opportunities that present themselves. but at this point, we're fully prepared to continue to march forward.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay. and then, charles, absent -- i understand the floor renegotiations that you might have to face. but i guess, absent any significant amount of renegotiations. as you deploy liquidity, it seems like there's still some opportunity to reprice the cd book lower and maybe the money market incrementally lower as well. and so just as you deploy liquidity with those floors in place, it seems like there should be, i guess, maybe a natural margin tailwind that you see maybe next year? is that how you all are thinking about it?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
there's some fairness to that. certainly, we've seen some of the higher-priced brokered cds that we booked in the middle of late '18, start to roll out. i think there was $60 million or $70 million, that around a 260 weighted average or so that we were able to unload that came to term here in the last quarter. so we'll continue to see some roll-offs like that, which are very helpful.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay. all right. and then i understand that loan balances declined this quarter, and it looks like a big part of that was due to construction, which i can understand in this environment. but you all did do a nice job growing owner-occupied and income-producing cre. so i wanted to get a sense for what the -- what opportunities you're seeing there and what the drivers were this quarter of that.
susan g. riel -- senior executive vice president-chief operating officer
that's a really good question. we are seeing opportunities on deals. i think the big driver right now is interest rates and people looking at refis. that's a really competitive market in terms of pricing for the prime properties that we're looking at. so every deal is an evaluation. and we're not always the lowest priced bank in town. we provide the best service and can sometimes command a premium for that. but there's an awful lot of price shopping going on right now.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay. and then i just had one last one. there's just between the liquidity between the growth profile that you all have historically had, the really low efficiency ratio, strong profitability profile and the potential to buy back a decent slug of stock moving forward with excess capital. it just seems like there's a lot of tailwinds to your story and the one overhang is the investigation. and i understand that you can't necessarily speak to the specifics. but i was just hoping maybe you could help us better understand how frequent the conversations are? and do the conversations that you have with the investigators, do they ever give you a sense for when they feel like the investigation might conclude or not?
susan g. riel -- senior executive vice president-chief operating officer
we really don't have a picture into that. we would not be able to give you any more guidance on that. if there -- we finished the documentation phase. we believe we've finished the testimony phase. so you can read into that whatever you'd like to read into that, but we can't give you any more guidance.
brody preston -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay, understood. thank you all for taking my questions this morning. i appreciate it.
susan g. riel -- senior executive vice president-chief operating officer
thanks brodie thank you.

and our next question comes from the line of erik zwick with boenning scattergood. your line is open. please go ahead.
erik zwick -- boenning scattergood. -- analyst
hi, good morning.
janice l. williams -- executive vice president and chief credit officer
good morning, eric.
erik zwick -- boenning scattergood. -- analyst
similar to brody, i jumped on late, so my apologies if everybody addressed this question. just curious with regard to the two kind of large commercial real estate relationships that drove the charge-offs in the third quarter. can you provide any commentary to what industries they serve or just a little more color around those relationships?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president and chief credit officer
yes. one was a land loan in a vacation area, a couple of hours from washington. and that did result in a charge-off that we had reserved for previously of about $1.2 million. there was also a charge-off of about $3.5 million and a ground lease situation with a hotel tenant. those were the two biggest.
erik zwick -- boenning scattergood. -- analyst
okay. and were those something you guys have been watching prior to the onset of the pandemic? or was it maybe just exacerbated by the current environment? or were they both more recent?
susan g. riel -- senior executive vice president-chief operating officer
well, the first one we had reserved for several, gosh, quarters ago in anticipation of dispositioning the loan. we had had some inquiries regarding it. the second one was really covid related in terms of virtual cessation of operations for hotels and lack of cash flow to support the operating expenses.
erik zwick -- boenning scattergood. -- analyst
susan, i appreciate the commentary. that's it for me today.
operator
and i'm showing no further questions at this time. and i would like to turn the conference back over to ms. susan riel for any further remarks.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the eagle bancorp, inc. fourth quarter and year-end 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, charles levingston, chief financial officer. thank you. please go ahead, sir.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thank you, rebecca. good morning. this is charles levingston, chief financial officer of eagle bancorp. before we begin the presentation, i would like to remind everyone that some of the comments made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements. our form 10-k for the 2019 fiscal year, our quarterly reports on form 10-q and current reports on form 8-k identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning. eagle bancorp does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments unless required by law.
this morning's commentary will include non-gaap financial information. the earnings release, which is posted in the investor relations section of our website and filed with the sec, contains reconciliations of this information to the most directly comparable gaap information. our periodic reports are available from eagle or online at our website or the sec's website. i would like to remind you that while we think that our prospects for continued growth and performance are good, it is our policy not to establish with the markets any earnings, margin or balance sheet guidance.
now i would like to introduce susan riel, the president and ceo of eagle bancorp.
susan g. riel -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, charles. good morning, and welcome to our earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2020. this morning, i'd like to start off with a high-level overview of the quarter and the year and also make a few comments on 2021. then jan williams, our chief credit officer, will discuss her thoughts on loans and credit quality matters. and charles, who kicked off the call, will discuss our financials in more detail. the three of us will be available later in the call for questions. looking back at 2020, it is impossible to overstate the commitment and resiliency of our eagle team to adapt to a totally new environment.
it is through their efforts that eagle's assets reached $11.1 billion and finished the back half of 2020 with renewed strength. in the second half of 2020, our fourth quarter earnings were $38.9 million or $1.21 per diluted share. and our third quarter earnings were $41.3 million or $1.28 per share. at $80.2 million for the two quarters combined, these were our highest ever level of earnings in linked quarters, just above our earnings in the second half of 2018. for the fourth quarter, our return on average tangible common equity was 13.69%. this return continues to outperform others in the industry and is notable as our tangible common equity to tangible assets was a relatively high 10.31% at year-end. similar to the third quarter, our residential mortgage division continued to remain very active.
the fourth quarter loans locked of $427 million and gain on sale of $5.9 million for the year -- i'm sorry, $5.9 million. for the year, locked loans were $1.9 billion, with a gain on sale of $21.8 million. with market interest rates expected to remain low in 2021, we anticipate that the residential mortgage division will continue to contribute meaningfully to the bottom line. we also saw some gains from our fha group in 2020. fha trade premiums, origination fees and related servicing revenues was slightly less than $4 million during the year. while our traditionally strong loan growth has been impacted in 2020 with the covid-19 pandemic.
it was also impacted by our efforts to reduce the overall mix of construction lending in the first half of 2020. in the latter half of the year, lower rates sometimes forced us to say, no, rather than match the pricing of others. heading into 2021, we expect that the washington, d.c. market will continue to improve as the vaccine rollout continues and that our loan teams will continue to get its share of loans as the pace of economic recovery accelerates. jan will be speaking to both the improvement of the local economy as well as highlight our continued focus on loan quality. in terms of deposits, corporate deposits continue to flow into the bank. as we said in the past, we will continue to support our clients by holding their deposits.
while we have historically operated at an average loan-to-deposit ratio closer to 100%, we averaged just 86% in the fourth quarter of 2020. carrying this much liquidity contributed to net interest margin falling to 2.98%. however, the additional earning assets offset some of the margin compression and contributed additional net interest income and earnings to the company. charles will have some comments on the nim later in the call. expense control has been an important financial metric for us. our efficiency ratio at 38.3% for the quarter remains among the best in the industry. underlying this is our focus on commercial lending with a streamlined branch network, which has been our trademark since the bank launched in 1998.
over the past decade, we have seen other banks slowly begin to reduce their expensive branch footprint. more recently, the pace has increased. early on, we saw the value of being less reliant on branches and putting more emphasis on commercial relationships and technology. we see this as a validation of our banking model. with deposits averaging $9.2 billion in the fourth quarter and just 20 branch offices, our deposits per branch of $460 million is much higher than our peers. on the lending side, in addition to our 20 banking offices, we also have one loan production office. our on-the-ground philosophy has always been and -- to remain light and adaptable. all of our locations are leased. that includes our headquarters, all branches, the loan production office and back office locations.
this may change if we see property that warrants purchasing, but that has not been our normal practice. in february and march, as leases expire, we plan to relocate the best in gallery place branches to newer, better locations, and combine our two back office locations into one newer location. as we move through 2021, we expect to continue to focus on ways to maintain our efficiency. in sum, we believe we'll take a share -- our share of the loans as the market improves, continue to be laser-focused on credit quality and continue our long-standing practice of strong expense control. before handing it over to jan, i'd like to address our efforts to increase shareholder value, the recently announced stipulation of settlement and our efforts on diversity and inclusion.
for our shareholders, our earnings, combined with stock repurchases and dividends, are three ways we seek to increase shareholder value. at the end of september, we reinstituted our 2019 stock repurchase plan. and by mid-december, we completed share repurchases under that plan. in late december, the board authorized a new stock repurchase plan for 2021 for up to 5% of outstanding shares or approximately 1.6 million shares. one of the factors behind authorizing a new stock repurchase plan is our strong capital position. for the year, we repurchased stock valued at $61.4 million and declared dividends of $28.3 million, returning almost $90 million directly to our shareholders. also, during the year, tangible book value grew 9.4%, rising to $35.74 per share. shares outstanding were reduced by 4.4%, and we paid out 21.4% of earnings in cash dividends.
on monday, we filed an 8-k announcing that we had entered into a stipulation of settlement subject to court approval in connection with the previously disclosed shareholder demand letter. we are glad to put this particular matter behind us and look forward to implementing the agreed upon governance and control enhancements, many of which, as you know, are already under way. we are not going to address any of the specifics of the stipulation of settlement and will let the publicly filed stipulation paper speak for themselves. as disclosed in our earnings release, the payment of attorney's fees is in connection with the stipulation of settlement was accrued for in the fourth quarter of 2020 and is expected to be fully recovered from our insurance carriers. the previously disclosed securities class action against the company and several of its current and former officers and directors remains outstanding. lastly, in 2021, we will continue our focus on diversity and inclusion.
we have a diverse board with four women, including myself. we've recently added two new board members, one of whom identifies as a minority. last year, we formed a diversity and inclusion council, comprised of 16 employees and conducted an employee engagement survey. the council will be working on identifying areas of opportunity to focus on and programs to support those areas of opportunity. this is an initiative that is very important to the continued success of the bank and has the full support of the senior staff and the board.
with that, i would like to turn the speaking duties over to jan williams, our chief credit officer.
janice l. williams -- executive vice president
thank you, susan. good morning, everyone. i begin by reiterating susan's comments as we continue to focus on credit quality over loan growth in today's environment. asset quality closed out the year strong and steady, which enabled the bank to lower its loss provision in the fourth quarter and maintain reserve levels. comparing linked quarters, npas to assets were at 59 basis points, down slightly from 62 basis points. annualized net charge-offs to average loans were 28 basis points, up slightly from 26 basis points in the prior quarter. charge-offs in the fourth quarter were primarily attributable to a single restaurant relationship, amounting to $4.1 million.
the provision to the allowance was $4.9 million, down from $6.6 million. and the allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.41%, up one basis point from 1.40% in the prior quarter. the allowance was determined in accordance with cecl methodology adopted at the beginning of the year. while we noted that several banks reporting fourth quarter results have reduced or reversed the allowance for credit losses, we believe it's prudent to be cautious in this area. our coverage of problem loans remained strong at 180% as of year-end. considering all risk factors and our conservatively underwritten loan-to-value and loan-to-cost policies, we believe our reserves are adequate, including qualitative factors associated with the hospitality and food service industries and a qualitative overlay for loans that has second deferral.
for quantitative measures, the unemployment forecast is still the driving factor. during the fourth quarter, our covid-19 deferrals dropped significantly as the second 90-day deferral period expired prior to year-end for most customers. as of the year-end, deferrals consisted of nine customer relationships, totaling $72.4 million or 1% of gross loans. the table in our press release shows the migration of the third quarter's deferrals of $851 million. approximately $60 million were paid down or paid off during the fourth quarter, of the remaining $791 million, 88% or $698 million were classified as current. of this amount, all loans that had a second deferral were automatically placed on the watch list. this was done to raise the visibility of these loans within our portfolio and monitor their progress post deferral. another $73 million were 30 to 89 days past due and $20 million were nonperforming. the npas were a mixed bag that included several owner-occupied restaurant properties.
our largest exposure continues to be -- our largest vulnerable exposure continues to be in the hospitality industry. as a percent of our portfolio, the accommodation in foodservice industries comprise of 9.9% of our portfolio, down from 10.2% last quarter. outstanding ppp balances at the end of the year were $455 million, down only $1 million from the end of the third quarter. in total, only about a dozen loans were forgiven prior to year-end, as borrowers and the bank were waiting for more guidance from sba. with additional guidance received from the sba earlier this month, the process has begun to accelerate. in regard to the current round of ppp, we begin taking applications this week. we are primarily focusing last week, sorry.
we are primarily focusing on current clients and will assist them with both first or second draws. our loan team continues to originate loans and loan closings in the fourth quarter were higher than they were in the third quarter. as our focus has always been on cre, it's not surprising that cre accounted for the bulk of the loan closings. the c&i closings were also strong in the fourth quarter. the small decline of loan balances period-to-period in the fourth quarter was attributable to more -- more to higher loan payoffs than a lack of originations, including a $78 million payoff of one loan on december 30. while we have talked a lot about our focus on credit quality, we're also focused on maintaining loan yields.
as susan said earlier, we sometimes pass on credits, sometimes because of risk, sometimes because of rate. in the fourth quarter, our yield on loans were -- was 4.5%, up four basis points from 4.46% in the third quarter. absent ppp loans yielding 2.55%, the yield on loans would have been 12 basis points higher. looking at our market, while d.c., maryland and virginia have stepped up covid-related restrictions, the local economy has been recovering. unemployment in the washington msa fell to 5.7% in november, down from 6.9% in september. loan demand for government contracting and professional services sectors continue to show strength. construction contractors continue to move forward with projects throughout the region with both commercial projects and residential construction.
we expect to continue to remain cautious on new construction projects as we have for the past 18 months. with a new administration in place, there tends to be more loan activity with new government contracts being awarded and a rise in a variety of professional services. we anticipate that our, c&i team will pick up some of that activity and that the overall increase in activity will benefit the region. based on the strength of the local economy, in december, the district of columbia reversed its budget predictions -- projections for the current year and the coming year upward and project revenue in 2022 to exceed revenue in 2019.
the basis of the upward revision was in part because individual and business tax income revenue was stronger-than-expected and in part because of the vaccine rollout. as the vaccine continues to be distributed, it is expected to have an outsized positive impact on the restaurant and hospitality businesses in our market area. later in the year, we see that washington, d.c. return to being a major tourist destination as well as a major hub for government and private enterprise.
with that, i'd like to turn it over to charles levingston, our chief financial officer.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thank you, jan. comparing our performance over linked quarters, net interest income was up $2.4 million on a much larger asset base. the provision for credit losses was down $1.7 million, while the provision for unfunded commitments was up about $2.5 million. the largest change was in noninterest income, which was lower by almost $8 million, primarily from lower gains on sale from residential mortgage division -- from the residential mortgage division. as you may recall, third quarter locked loans were at record levels and are typically higher than in the fourth quarter. the other notable changes were lower noninterest expenses, with premises and equipment lowered by $1.8 million, but the prior quarter had a nonrecurring expense of $1.7 million to properly value the lease extension.
and legal fees were lower by $755,000, net of estimated insurance receivables under our d&o policies. bottom line, on a linked-quarter basis, earnings were lowered by $2.5 million. i would like to point out that -- i would like to point out, though, that our third quarter was the bank's highest level of quarterly reported earnings. at year-end 2020, assets were $11.1 billion, up $2.1 billion for the year and up $1 billion for the quarter. balance sheet growth in the fourth quarter and the third quarter were primarily driven by corporate deposit influence. overall, as a result of the deposit inflows, average assets for the fourth quarter were up $668 million from the prior quarter. these inflows continue to put pressure on the nim, which was 2.98%, down from 3.08%, the prior quarter. while the nim was down, the increase in assets kept net interest income from falling. net interest income was $81.4 million for the fourth quarter, up from $79 million the prior quarter.
a large portion of deposit inflows were noninterest-bearing, which keeps the deposit mix very favorable. in the fourth quarter, 33% of average deposits were noninterest-bearing and the cost of interest-bearing deposits declined to 61 basis points, down from 75 basis points the prior quarter. and the cost of funds was 48 basis points, down from 58 basis points the prior quarter. the bulk of this new funding went into overnight funds -- overnight fed funds. as a result, interest-bearing deposits with other banks increased to an average of $1.75 billion, up $476 million from the prior quarter. the average yield on this line item was just 11 basis points. the balance sheet of the deposit -- the balance of the deposit inflows was invested in securities, which averaged $1.1 billion, up $215 million from the prior quarter.
the average yield of the investment portfolio was 1.52%. looking at items that impacted nim, on december 15, we lowered deposit rates across the board by five basis points. going forward, we expect to continue to see higher cost time deposits roll off. at year-end, we had loans of $2.9 billion of floors, of which $2.8 billion are already at the floor. in terms of the deployment of excess liquidity, we will continue to judiciously deploy the funds into securities and loans but remain cognizant of the need to remain flexible to serve our client deposit needs and not overcommit in such a low rate environment.
with that, i'll hand it back to susan for a short wrap up.
susan g. riel -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, charles. as we move into 2021, i'm confident that eagle is well positioned to continue to deliver industry-leading results. our earnings, credit quality and capitalization remain strong. our employees are committed and resilient. the washington market remains a premier business center and the hospitality and food accommodation industries, which are an area of focus for the bank are the most visible economic beneficiary of the vaccine rollout. thanks again for joining us this quarter.
we will now open up the call for questions.

[operator instructions] and your first question comes from casey whitman from piper sandler.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good morning.
janice l. williams -- executive vice president
hey casey.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, so maybe i'd start off with just some questions for jan and congrats to you on navigating through 2020. so, just looking at the -- disclosures, it seems like -- a lot of the remaining deferrals are in the transportation and warehousing industry. so, can you maybe tell us a little bit about the makeup of that book and the types of collateral support, et cetera? thanks.
janice l. williams -- executive vice president
yeah, you're speaking about the $72 million still in the deferral phase?
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
that's right, yes.
janice l. williams -- executive vice president
yes, i can tell you that, yes, although technically, i would say as opposed to transportation that -- the largest segment is really associated with tourism. we do have a plan in place for these folks. what's deferred here is really some equipment leases predominantly. we do have real estate collateral that -- covers most of the debt that's involved. i think we're in good shape based on the cash flow provisions that have been provided to us and the liquidity on the books for this company. so, i'm feeling pretty good about that. i think, assuming the vaccine rollout happens and tourism ramps back up again late in the summer, i think we're going to be in fine shape on this. i don't count loss concerns. the nonperforming concern would come up if there wasn't a new strain of virus that hit that vaccines weren't effective against and prolonged -- the downturn in really what i'll call part of the travel and entertainment area.
i think other than that, we've got a property that is owner-occupied real estate that is a facility for adult care. it is one that has had an outbreak of covid that temporarily reduce the census level. we are working with them, and i do expect that they will continue to perform during the deferral period, which is an interest-only deferral, not a complete payment deferral and that is true, -- also of the customer i spoke about earlier that is in the travel tourism, entertainment business. we do also have a hotel that is still involved in a deferral -- i'm sorry, an office building that is still involved in a deferral that will wrap within the next 30 days.
we are monitoring all of these. other than that, there's nothing of significant size on this list that would really have a material impact on the balance sheet or on our income statement. we are staying close to every one of these credits, and our covid task force has worked hard to develop remediation plans that will put us into a better position and put the companies into a better position to continue to perform. does that cover that you're looking?
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
it does, thank you for all that detail. i guess, another question for you would be, well, thank you for the additional color on the watch list this quarter. i was wondering, first, it looks like you've got about $632 million within those sort of at-risk segments. is that going to comprise like the majority of what's on watch or just a portion of it, so then maybe we can assume there wasn't much...
janice l. williams -- executive vice president
yes.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay, got it. so, there wasn't much movement in the watch list this quarter and then, i guess, was there any migration that we should know about into the substandard or special mention this quarter? are those pretty stable from last quarter?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president
pretty stable, although i would tell you that there are occasional moves into special mention. there may be one or two credits that will be migrating there, or they have half migrated. i think we're doing a good job of staying on top of these and making sure that things come out, but for example, as a result of changes in the way that various jurisdictions have enforced indoor dining and prohibitions on bars and limited hours, that would put folks perhaps, migrating from watch to special mention. we expect to see those changes roll back as the vaccine is distributed and we're all hopeful that distributions happen with amazon-like precision, but that remains to be seen at this point.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it, very helpful. i'll let someone else hop on, thanks.

your next question comes from the line of steve comery with g. research.
steve comery -- g. research -- analyst
hey, good morning.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
good morning.
steve comery -- g. research -- analyst
wonder if we could start with the loan yields. appreciated the 4.62% during the quarter ex ppp. i was wondering, if you have the number for q3?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
i don't have that offhand, but that's something i can certainly give back to you on, steve, but yes, it would likely be somewhat of a similar shift, given the static balance of the ppp loans as well as a fairly flat average loan balance quarter-to-quarter.
janice l. williams -- executive vice president
i think, in third quarter, we were looking at $446 million without the ppp impact, since ppp loans didn't move significantly. it's probably pretty close to the same level of impact. so, i think you could, in general carryover the up four basis point number?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
i think that's a fair guess. yup.
steve comery -- g. research -- analyst
okay, ok. fair enough. maybe moving on to the construction projects and the payoffs. is that something that at this point, it looks like it's probably behind the bank and you'd expect lower payoff levels going forward? or is this kind of an ongoing thing and they kind of happen when they happen?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president
well, i think in construction, in general, you would expect similar projects are completed that -- in the instance of a commercial property, they're going to be looking for permanent financing to the extent that we can do that. we certainly try to get the first shot of that keeping a performing property in the portfolio. to the extent that we don't want to dip down to the rates that are being offered on some properties long-term now. we would expect to see that roll off. for the sale projects in the residential area, you're naturally going to see those drop down as units are sold. we are booking some new, carefully selected construction projects. so overall, it's going to be a timing issue, not necessarily, an abatement of the level of construction, overall.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
and i would just add, that's been part of the eagle story for some time, and we do see some large -- quarters of larger payoffs than others and we see that as successful and that these construction projects are being -- are complete -- are being completed and they're clearing the market in terms of permanent financing. so, it is something that i would expect that we would see continue, given the nature of our business.
steve comery -- g. research -- analyst
okay, and then maybe one more on the construction topic. so, construction balances on a period end basis, it looks like the mix was more owner-occupied versus commercial and residential versus last quarter. is that part of an active risk related strategy? or is that just reflecting the demand that was out there?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president
i think it's a combination of banks. i do think on the owner-occupied side, the fact that they're not supposed to be included in concentrations is certainly a factor. i think the underlying business that supports those particular properties is a factor, but i also think some of it is just the demand and where things are going at this point in time.
steve comery -- g. research -- analyst
okay, thanks. appreciate it.

your next question comes from the line of stuart lotz from kbw.
stuart lotz -- kbw -- analyst
hey guys, good morning
janice l. williams -- executive vice president
good morning.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
good morning stuart
stuart lotz -- kbw -- analyst
charles, if we could -- just dive in the buyback real quick, -- it was nice to see -- when you guys kind of reinstated that in the fourth quarter. -- what is your expectation for the cadence of buybacks this year? and do you currently anticipate using -- utilizing that full $1.6 million share authorization?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes, it's -- we are going to continue to evaluate that on -- an essentially a regular basis, but to the extent that the share price runs up to a point where we don't feel it's prudent to continue to purchase at certain levels, we won't be active, -- but it's really going to depend on the volatility in the share price throughout the year as to whether or not we see all those shares repurchased over the course of the year. can't give you a specific number, unfortunately.
stuart lotz -- kbw -- analyst
okay, no. that's helpful and maybe turning to the balance sheet. i think this quarter's deposit growth was pretty astounding. what is your anticipation for some of those deposits as we look at -- how has that trended so forth in the first quarter as we kind of taken the dynamics of ppp round two as well as some of the round one loans running off? do you anticipate your deposit book kind of holding this $11 billion -- sorry, the $10 billion level? or do you see that trending back lower?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes, stuart, the expectation is that liquidities will remain strong, all things equal, this year. i mean -- we'll need to see some kind of a catalyst for change, which obviously is the vaccine rollout, giving to that herd immunity, returning to normal and having the fomc make a change in -- their policy posture and to stop buying bonds and for other firms to see opportunities for investment, elsewhere, so that their funds aren't sitting idle, which -- seems to be the nature of things these days. so, i think there's a lot that goes into that, but our expectation now appears to be status quo for the majority of the year.
stuart lotz -- kbw -- analyst
so you think at -- is your current anticipation is for the kind of that core margin to stay around 3%? or do you see any near-term lifts, given ppp fees and some of the excess liquidity being deployed? v
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes, again, all things equal and within some reasonable standard deviation, my expectation, we would see a relatively stable margin throughout the year.
stuart lotz -- kbw -- analyst
okay, got it. great, thanks for taking my questions.
operator
your next question comes from the line of dave bishop with seaport global.
janice l. williams -- executive vice president
hi dave.
dave bishop -- seaport global -- analyst
hey, good morning guys. how are you?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
good, good. how are you?
dave bishop -- seaport global -- analyst
good, good. hey, quick sort of staying on that topic, charles, obviously, with the sort of influx of liquidity, even despite a little bit build here in this the fourth quarter. investment securities obviously have trended down as a percent of assets to below sub-10%. do you see that maybe tipping up over the course of 2021 was maybe some opportunity to sort of improve the yields read between that sort of surge funding and short-term liquidity and investments?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes, so good point. i mean, again, we mentioned in the comments, we do want to be judicious about how we deploy those funds. don't want to overcommit to a single point in the market. my -- if i were a betting person, i would say that a couple of years from now, we might not like the securities we're buying today, and that's provided, everything starts to improve, but then again, at that point in time, hopefully, there is a better opportunity to deploy funds into a more active loan market. so, we want to be cautious in that.
the tide can go out as quickly as it came in, so -- but at the same time, we're going to be looking to be, again, be careful about how we're deploying those funds, but make sure that we're making some money today to the extent we can and still manage the risk associated with all that excess liquidity. so yes, i would anticipate continued growth in the investment portfolio again to put higher earning assets on the book.
dave bishop -- seaport global -- analyst
got it and i think the narrative mentions in terms of the deposit flows this quarter, maybe some a flight to, i guess, liquidity from certain fiduciary clients. any way to ring-fence the dollar amount that was related to that inflow?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes, i mean that was a healthy -- balance or portion of the balance of funds brought in. i would say it's around $550 million or so.
dave bishop -- seaport global -- analyst
got it and then in terms -- i think, charles, you mentioned sort of the opportunity from the -- repricing of the time deposit cds. just curious maybe what the current onboarding rate for your cds are? and what the sort of the roll-off calendar looks like or the maturity calendar looks like over the first half of the year?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes, current -- our current rate sheet has one year cds at 12 basis points. looking at five year cds at 40 basis points, and you can interpolate the -- what's between that. there's not a lot of appetite at those levels, obviously, and certainly not a lot of appetite out further than that. but yes, we expect to continue to see those higher rate cds roll off here and hopefully, continue to help support our lowering funding costs over the course of the year and some of that is a little bit front loaded, but it's -- there's still some of those time deposits to roll off, yes.
dave bishop -- seaport global -- analyst
got it, appreciate the color and then, maybe one final one to maybe for jan. appreciate the continued color and the disclosure in terms of the loan deferral migration. just curious, the improvement from the third; quarter, the decline in the loans on deferral, the loans that are off deferral those are -- are they now making full p&i payments? or there's still some sort of modification? or is there sense or form like io or po in there? just curious, maybe some color in terms of the improvement in terms of the deferrals, how they're paying?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president
yes, if they were on interest-only before the pandemic, they're still going to be on interest-only. so, there will be a fair sized chunk within their interest-only. if they were amortizing pre-pandemic, then they return to amortization.
dave bishop -- seaport global -- analyst
return to amortization. great, thank you.

your next question comes from the line of feddie strickland with janney montgomery.
feddie strickland -- janney montgomery -- analyst
hi, good morning
janice l. williams -- executive vice president
good morning.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
good morning.
feddie strickland -- janney montgomery -- analyst
i'm just wondering what you're seeing so far this month on ppp forgiveness? i know the balances didn't really change that much in the fourth quarter and just kind of how you see that playing out over the next couple of quarters?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president
i think the sba has not been expeditious in bringing out final rules and regs on this. so, i think that's impacted the process and delayed it considerably. i do think we're going to see more progress going forward, and it probably will be at an accelerating rate. personally, i think a big driver of that is for those folks that are looking at second draw situations. they're more motivated to get through that forgiveness process, especially the larger customers. so i do think that, that's going to accelerate, but then you also have to consider whether the sba has adequate staffing to handle that and that's sort of the big unknown right now. so, other than things that will be ""automatically"" forgiven, i would imagine there are definite human resources challenges at sba.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
and i would add, i mean, my expectation, just one-man opinion is, is sometime in the second or third quarter that you see the lion's share of those come in. i mean the way that the sba is --handling those ppp forgiveness loan -- ppp forgiveness process for those loans that are under $150,000, given the recently passed stimulus, should expedite a good number of the volume of our loans. although it's not the largest -- dollar amount of those loans. so -- but i do think that, at that point, hopefully, the process will be a little bit better oiled, and we'll be able to get some more of those through, but it's been modest so far at best.
feddie strickland -- janney montgomery -- analyst
got you and kind of along that same line, i know it's only been like a week or so, but how has demand looked for the second round? i know it just started, but i'm just curious what the interest level is relative to round 1.
susan g. riel -- president & chief executive officer
it's definitely not at the level that it was the first round. we've seen significant decreases in that level. i would estimate, and i don't have clear number on that, but maybe 600 of them have been applied for now in the first round or in the second part of the first round. we did 1,400 -- over 1,400 loans. so it definitely is at a slower pace, and from what i understand, that's true with what other banks are feeling too.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
and again, that's relevant to our customer base, which limits the population obviously.
got it, awesome. thanks guys appreciate the additional color sure

operator
hello, and welcome to the eagle bancorp incorporated first quarter 2021 earnings call. [operator instructions]
it is now my pleasure to turn today's meeting over to chief financial officer, charles levingston. please go ahead.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
thank you, sean. good morning. this is charles levingston, chief financial officer of eagle bancorp. before we begin the presentation, i would like to remind everyone that some of the comments made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements. while our growth and performance over this past quarter has been positive, we cannot make any promises about future performance, and it is our policy not to establish with the markets any formal guidance with respect to our earnings.
none of the forward-looking statements made during this call should be interpreted as [technical issues]. our form 10-k for the 2020 fiscal year, our quarterly reports on form 10-q, and current reports on form 8-k identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning. eagle bancorp does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments unless required by law.
this morning's commentary will include non-gaap financial information. the earnings release which is posted in the investor relations section of our website and filed with the sec contains reconciliations of this information to the most directly comparable gaap information. our periodic reports are available from eagle online at our website or the sec's website.
this morning, susan riel, the president and ceo of eagle bancorp will start us off with a high-level overview, then jan williams, our chief credit officer will discuss our -- her thoughts on loans and credit quality matters. then i'll return to discuss our financials in more detail. at the end, all three of us will be available to take questions.
i would now like to turn it over to our president and ceo, susan riel.
susan g. riel -- president and chief executive officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and president and chief executive offic
thank you, charles. good morning and welcome to our earnings call for the first quarter of 2021. it is hard to imagine that when the covid-19 pandemic began a little more than a year ago, eagle would go on to post two of our highest-earning quarters. earnings are at record levels; equity has risen to an all-time high; asset quality continues to strengthen; efficiency remains a strength, and we believe our market area is making progress toward reopening. in these ways, we believe we are stronger now and in a better position than we were a year ago. we have also got some good news on the litigation front that i'll share with you later on.
focusing on earnings first. earnings in our most recent quarter were $43.5 million or $1.36 per share. this was a 1.53% return on average assets and a 15.33% return on average tangible common equity. earnings over the last four quarters, which includes the second quarter of 2020, when the nation was locked down totaled $152.6 million or $4.75 per diluted share. these earnings are positively accretive to our equity. common equity at the end of the quarter was $1.3 billion or 11.34% of assets.
turning to asset quality. at the end of the quarter, npas were 0.51% of assets. and for the quarter, annualized net charge-offs were 0.27% of average loans. these asset quality ratios combined with an improved economic outlook nationally and locally, as well as a decrease in total loans, informed our decision to make a $2.4 million reversal from our allowance for credit losses. even with this reversal, our reserves are 1.47% of loans, excluding ppp loans.
in terms of operating efficiency. we continue to be a leader with an efficiency ratio of 40.7% for the quarter. we just completed and mailed out our proxy. and compared to the 19 peers listed in our proxy, we reported the lowest efficiency ratio. this efficiency is achieved through strong revenue growth and expense control. total revenue for this quarter was $93.2 million, up 9.4% from a year ago. non-interest expenses were $38 million, up just 1.7% from a year ago. we are always prudent in our approach to expense management. as a small example, last quarter i mentioned, we were relocating two branches with expiring leases to improved locations and combining two back-office locations, also with expiring leases into a single new facility. these moves have been completed and are projected to save us $460,000 annually in rental expenses.
before moving on, i would like to once again mention the contributions our lending team and our residential mortgage division have made. during the quarter, our lending team worked with our clients on the latest ground of ppp and assisted them with the forgiveness process. and our residential mortgage division had another great quarter with locked loans of $303 million and a gain on sale of mortgage loans of $5 million. even with interest rates increasing slightly, we expect our residential mortgage division will continue to contribute meaningfully to the bottom line.
in regards to our market. a lot has changed in three months. on our last call, we noted that dc, maryland, and virginia were stepping up covid-related restrictions. since then, all three jurisdictions appear to be loosening restrictions on businesses, as the vaccine rollout continues and expanded its scope. the district is now allowing restaurants and gyms to open indoors at 25% capacity, and both the nationals and d.c. united stadiums are opened at limited capacity. maryland also loosened restrictions by removing capacity limits for indoor and outdoor dining and allowing larger venues, including convention and wedding venues to operate at 50% capacity. in montgomery county, where our headquarters is located, some stricter restrictions still apply. and in virginia, restaurants may open but must maintain physical distancing guidelines. indoor events at convention centers and concert venues may open at 30% occupancy.
publicly available industry data shows that nationwide hotel occupancy was approximately 55% in march. and restaurants, many with expanded outdoor capacity approached 2019 revenue levels in the month of march. it follows that unemployment has also improved with more people going back to work. in the washington msa, the preliminary unemployment rate was 5.8% in february. this is down from 6.5% in december and down from 6.9% in september. these improving dynamics are giving a lift to the local economy through increased consumer retail spending, which we believe typically proceeds a ramp-up in business spending and investment. moreover, our market areas should disproportionately benefit from any existing or proposed government stimulus.
this past quarter we faced headwinds in the form of low loan demand and a competitively low interest rate environment. we were also experiencing elevated payoffs and prepays, due in part to successful project completions and low nominal interest rates. we are excited about our strong pipeline and long-standing relationships in the community, where we continue to get looks on most available commercial projects. eaglebank intends to assertively pursue loan opportunities throughout the rest of 2021. we have the capacity to finance large commercial projects and we believe, we are extremely well-positioned to take advantage of any economic recovery, with common equity of almost $1.3 billion and risk-based capital of 17.86%. obviously, the timing for increases in loan demand will ultimately depend on market development, the competitive marketplace, and economic conditions. those uncertainties aside, we remain hopeful that loan demand will pick up once the pandemic subsides and society resumes its normal pace of economic activity and social interactions.
for our shareholders, we remain focused on building value. book value rose to $39.45 [phonetic] per share, up 9.2% from a year ago, and tangible book was $36.16 per share, up 10% from a year ago. we also increased the quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share and authorized a new stock repurchase program. although, with the run-up in bank equities, we were not as active in the stock repurchase market as we expected to be at the start of the year.
i would also like to welcome our two new independent board members, who joined in january, steve freidkin and ernie jarvis. steve, as the founder and ceo of his own full-service technology firm, brings technological expertise to the board and serve on our risk committee. ernie, as managing principal of his own real estate brokerage company, adds his expertise in commercial real estate to the board and serves on the banks directors loan committee. as i have said repeatedly, eaglebank is committed to have a diverse board in terms of gender and ethnicity, as we understand the value of different perspectives. notably, of our 10 directors; four are female and two of our male directors identify as minorities. in regards to other diversity measures, last month, the washington business journal ranked us 8th in terms of corporate diversity for mid-sized companies in the market. this was based on us having 61% of our staff being people of color. while we have a diverse workforce, we must also help out our people thrive. and this year, we created and launched a diversity and inclusion council, tasked with developing additional initiatives to support diversity, inclusion, and equity throughout our organization.
now onto the good news, i mentioned on the legal front. in the days following our non-binding mediation, which occurred on april 13, we reached an agreement to settle a previously disclosed putative class action lawsuit for a total payment of $7.5 million by the company in exchange for the release of all alleged claims in the suit, without any admission or concession of wrongdoing by the company or any defendant. the class action settlement agreement is subject to court approval and the payment amount is expected to be fully covered by our insurance carriers. in addition, the previously disclosed stipulation of settlement in connection with the shareholder derivative litigation still remains subject to court approval, with the preliminary hearing set for may 12, 2021. we are pleased to settle both our major commercial litigation matters and look forward to securing court approval and putting these matters behind us. in anticipation of some likely questions, there is nothing material to report on the previously disclosed government investigations. we continue to cooperate with the government and believe progress is being made toward the resolution of these matters.
before turning it over to jan, i would like to thank all of our employees for all their hard work and their commitment to support our clients.
with that, i would like to turn the speaking duties over to jan williams, our chief credit officer.
janice l. williams -- executive vice president of eagle bancorp, inc. and senior executive vice president & chief credit o
thank you, susan. good morning, everyone. with regard to the reversal of $2.4 million from the allowance for credit losses, the improved outlook for the economy, primarily the improved unemployment numbers. the improvement in the credit metrics of the loan portfolio and the reduction in total loans, all contributed to the reduction in the allowance. with the reversal of the allowance for credit losses to total loans, excluding ppp loans was 1.47%, down 3 basis points from the prior quarter-end. comparing metrics for linked quarters even with our lower allowance for credit losses, our coverage of non-performing loans increased to 195%, up from a 180% at year-end, as we saw a reduction in non-performing loans over the same period.
npas to total assets were 51 basis points, down 8 basis points from the prior quarter-end. in dollars, npas were down $8.6 million. the decline was primarily from payoffs on non-performing loans, a return to accrual status for some loans, and charge-offs, which primarily consisted of hotel, restaurant, and sba credits.
before i hand it off to charles, a quick update on the ppp program. in the first quarter, we once again jumped in to help our clients with the latest round of ppp. for the quarter, we originated ppp loans of $193 million and assisted clients in the forgiveness process with loans forgiven of $83 million. outstanding ppp loans at quarter-end were $565 million.
with that, i'd like to turn it over to charles levingston, our chief financial officer.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
thank you, jan. comparisons for the first quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2020 are difficult, as the current quarter contains a reversal from the allowance for credit losses and a substantial contribution from our residential mortgage team, whereas in the first quarter of 2020 we were building reserves and the impact of the covid-19 pandemic was just coming into focus, and we also had a mark-to-market loss on a hedge position. for these reasons, and to help compare apples-to-apples for the first quarters of 2021 versus 2020, we added a pre-provision net revenue table to our earnings release. it shows our ppnr at $55.3 million for the first quarter of 2021, up from $47.9 million in the first quarter of 2020. as a percentage of assets, annualized ppnr in the first quarter of 2021 was 1.95%, this is down 9 basis points from the first quarter of 2020, but the decrease is more from the 21.9% increase in average assets outpacing the increase in ppnr of 15.4%.
comparing our performance over linked quarters, net interest income was up $1.2 million [phonetic]. with the reversals on the provisions to the allowance for credit losses and for unfunded commitments, we had a positive swing of $8.1 million on the two provisions. noninterest income was up $700,000. contributing to this was the cancellation of a $50 million [phonetic] in the money fhlb borrowing, resulting in a $911,000 gain. offsetting these improvements, noninterest expenses were up $3 million, mostly due to annual incentive cost captured in the first quarter, and legal and professional fees were up $657,000, mostly attributable to non-legal advisory fees. these linked quarter changes led to an increase in pre-tax earnings of $7.1 million. bottom line, on a linked quarter basis, earnings were higher by $4.6 million, and the earnings of $43.5 million for the first quarter of 2021 was a record for the company.
when the quarter started, deposit inflows continued as they had in the prior two quarters. both assets and deposits were running a bit higher during the quarter by about $400 million. but these deposits float out by the end of the quarter. as a result, at quarter-end assets were flat at $11.1 billion and deposits were also flat at $9.2 billion. as deposits ended flat, we made some progress, putting a little over $200 million of excess liquidity to work and investments. investments were primarily 20 years, 2% agency mortgage backed securities and callable agency bonds. we will continually look to invest our excess liquidity to seek out higher-yielding alternatives to cash.
also, higher-cost cds continue to run off and costs on money market and savings accounts moved lower. in the first quarter of 2021 cds with a total balance of $230.9 million, with a weighted average rate of 1.69% matured. these cds had a weighted average term of 18 months at issuance. we added about half of that $230.9 million back in the form of -- in the form or lower cost -- of lower-cost cds and the balance was --the balance within other deposits. average cd balances for the quarter were 9.6% of average deposits, down from 10.8% in the prior quarter.
the average cost of our money market savings [phonetic] is now 33 basis points, down from 42 basis points in the prior quarter. overall, our cost of funds in the first quarter of 2021 decreased to 42 basis points, down from 48 basis points in the prior quarter. putting some excess liquidity to work and keeping funding costs low, helped us keep the nim steady at 2.98% for the first quarter of 2021, which was unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2020.
with that, i'll hand it back to susan for a short wrap-up.
susan g. riel -- president and chief executive officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and president and chief executive offic
thanks, charles. as we move further into 2021, we will continue our efforts to deliver positive operating and performance results, and we will continue to strive to serve both our investors and our community to the best of our ability. our earnings, credit quality, and capitalization remained strong. deal flow on development projects and income-producing credits continue at a decent pace. and the washington market remains a premier business center and tourist destination.
thanks again for joining us this quarter. we will now open up the call for questions.

[operator instructions] and your first question comes from the line of casey whitman from piper sandler.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good morning.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
good morning, casey.
janice l. williams -- executive vice president of eagle bancorp, inc. and senior executive vice president & chief credit o
good morning, casey.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
i think, i -- i'll just ask first bigger picture. as we think about, sort of, the balance sheet transition and the emphasis away from certain products, what kind of inning are we in that process? i think, maybe what i'm trying to go my head around is, as the economy reopens, perhaps we see growth across the industry, how confident are we -- that we -- are you -- that you'll participate in that fully or should we consider that there is still going to be some offset just from some of the strategic mix shift going on specifically at eagle?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president of eagle bancorp, inc. and senior executive vice president & chief credit o
in terms of the mix of our assets going forward?
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
yeah. i mean, maybe just in terms of the emphasis on construction and where that, sort of, is right now. and, do you think or...
janice l. williams -- executive vice president of eagle bancorp, inc. and senior executive vice president & chief credit o
yeah. and i think that we are fully prepared and are doing construction lending. i think that the economic forecast certainly adds a lift to the desirability of those loans, and i would expect we'll have opportunities to see them. we are now just below the regulatory threshold for concentration on the construction side. we've got room to lend there and i think there are going to be continuing opportunities.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. great. thank you. i'll just ask a few expense questions. just to clarify, the savings from the branch relocation consolidation is, some of that, the number is already or will that be realized, you think, in the first or the second quarter?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
yeah, i think that's going to be utilized more going forward. again, are kind of just -- our calculation is about $460,000 annually in savings on specifically rent expenses. yeah.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. one more expense one. congrats on the class action settlement. just wondering, can you give us the outlook for where the legal, professional fees expense line might run versus, i think it was at $3 million this quarter, and i appreciate that's already down materially from a year ago, but can we expect a little bit more relief to come on that line given the settlements you have or do you think it's a pretty stable level from here?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
yeah. obviously, the cost that we're going to be dealing with, as it relates to those private litigation matters are going to be related to the settlement of these --of the administration associated with these cases. but there is still the expectation that there'll be continued expenses associated with the investigations. although -- again, as we've mentioned previously, a lot of that production expense has tapered off, right, in terms of providing information, which is the bulk of the costs. so, i wouldn't expect significantly greater, but it's, as my counselor advised me, it's certainly an unknown. but yeah, so take that for what it's worth.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. so it sounds like this is a pretty good expense run rate minus whatever payroll taxes and whatnot, would have driven some of the salaries this quarter, for expenses?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
yeah.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. thank you for the call.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
great.
janice l. williams -- executive vice president of eagle bancorp, inc. and senior executive vice president & chief credit o
thanks, casey.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
thanks, casey.

your next question comes from the line of steve comery with g. research.
steve comery -- g. research -- analyst
hey, good morning.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
good morning, steve.
janice l. williams -- executive vice president of eagle bancorp, inc. and senior executive vice president & chief credit o
hi.
steve comery -- g. research -- analyst
wanted to ask about the securities book. charles, i appreciated your comments there on continuing to look for opportunities. maybe any thoughts on the pace of deployment of liquidity into the securities book if this liquidity stays on your balance sheet and loan demand remains a bit tepid?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
yeah, that. so to your point, steve, i would say our first choice is to deploy this excess liquidity into loans and that's what we have to do. but with the significant amount of liquidity that we have on the balance sheet, the next best option seems to be in the investment portfolio. our clip [phonetic] has been, call it between $50 million and $80 million a month deployed. and it is a bit of a balancing act between, like picking the right points and finding that healthy return and not going too far on the curve and exposing ourselves to additional price risk. but again, that is the next best alternative to loans. hopefully, that gives you a little bit of insight.
steve comery -- g. research -- analyst
yeah. yeah. that's helpful. maybe moving on to loans. so, i noticed that in the disclosure of accommodation & food services the exposure actually increased quarter-over-quarter. was that due to line draws or is the bank seeing opportunities in that area to make new loans?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president of eagle bancorp, inc. and senior executive vice president & chief credit o
there were certainly line draws. we had recently approved and increased to align from one of our very strong restaurant chain customers that's continuing to expand and grow. they had a very successful equity raise, at the same time, and quite large deposits with the bank right now. but we are seeing more usage of lines and we are selectively working with our existing customers. i would not say we're actively soliciting new restaurants, as customers at this point.
steve comery -- g. research -- analyst
okay. okay. thank you. and then maybe one more for me on low yields, which were up pretty solidly quarter-over-quarter. i wonder if maybe could have a discussion about the dynamics there and how much of the rise on loan yields was changing mix versus, like, what rates you're seeing in the market?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
sure. so, i would say, you know, that coupons that are being put on these days are, you know, call around 4%, but the pricing pressure continues. we did see some pre-pays in this past quarter that also made a positive contribution to the yield that we're seeing there. so to the extent that those continue will get some positive lift. but in terms of mix, it was, i guess in terms of c&i versus cre. it was a little lighter quarter on the cre front. then we -- we've typically had in the past. and it was definitely again seeing pricing pressures, particularly on the c&i side.
janice l. williams -- executive vice president of eagle bancorp, inc. and senior executive vice president & chief credit o
yeah. i think there is an awful lot of liquidity out there right now, which is contributing to the pricing pressure and all banks are looking to move into higher-yielding asset types. so we do see that, but we're also not making significant changes in the overall cre versus c&i composition of our books. i will say, we'll probably be shifting a bit more back into the construction side as i discussed with casey earlier.
steve comery -- g. research -- analyst
okay. thanks for that. and charles, i don't know if you want to put this number out. but anyway to, kind of, quantify how big of an impact the prepayments were on yields?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
let's see here. i have that number. i'll have to get back with you on that. but we did run that.
stuart lotz -- kbw -- analyst
okay. okay. no worries. thank you very much.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
yeah.
operator
okay. your next question comes from the line of steven, sorry, stuart lotz from kbw.
stuart lotz -- kbw -- analyst
hey, guys, good morning.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
hey, good morning, stuart.
janice l. williams -- executive vice president of eagle bancorp, inc. and senior executive vice president & chief credit o
good morning.
stuart lotz -- kbw -- analyst
charles, maybe if we can start on the reserve and maybe the outlook for provision, following some of the reserve release this quarter. do you expect that to continue in the next couple of quarters? could we continue to see, i mean, further negative provisions assuming you continue to let the -- your acl run down and charge-offs maybe come in line with where they've been in the last couple of quarters?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
yeah. it's going to be -- there is a lot of, i guess, it will be dependent on where we are really at next quarter-end, what the economic forecast looks like at that point in time. certainly, we are seeing some success with the deployment of vaccines out there. we saw a pretty good unemployment print. this morning we saw the consumer spending prints. last week, so the signs are seemed to be positive on those forecasts, but it will be dependent on that in addition to loan growth and how much loan, how many loans we can put on quarter-over-quarter, which will obviously also need additional provision.
jan, anything else you want to add?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president of eagle bancorp, inc. and senior executive vice president & chief credit o
yeah. i would say that it's also going to be dependent on the continued improvement in credit metrics within our portfolio, so certainly a possibility. but there is a lot of unknown out there in terms of when or if that actually is going to happen.
stuart lotz -- kbw -- analyst
and jan maybe -- i'm sorry if i missed this in the prepared comments. but can you just give any detail on where watch list or classifieds trended this quarter?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president of eagle bancorp, inc. and senior executive vice president & chief credit o
sure.
stuart lotz -- kbw -- analyst
i mean, i didn't see anything in the release. thanks.
janice l. williams -- executive vice president of eagle bancorp, inc. and senior executive vice president & chief credit o
yeah. the classified portion of the portfolio is down about $300,000, nothing significant, very stable there. the overall watch list is down about $41 million, so all signs are really positive on the credit metrics side. i think, we have continued to maintain a significant number of loans that received second deferrals in the watch category, as we wait for our period post ppp of sustained performance under regular payment plan. so it's -- assuming that, that goes well, i would think you would see further reduction in the future.
stuart lotz -- kbw -- analyst
got it. and maybe on loan modifications too. i think you guys were under 1% at year-end. and you kind of take back up closer to the two. what was driving that this quarter and [speech overlap] providing any color on this growth?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president of eagle bancorp, inc. and senior executive vice president & chief credit o
yeah. there's one hotel that is in that category that's on interest-only terms. and there are a couple of restaurants that are also on interest-only terms. we don't have -- there was nothing with a full deferral contributing to that number. and i don't expect to see anyone getting a third deferral, so these are essentially new to the second deferral class.
stuart lotz -- kbw -- analyst
yeah, it's very -- yeah, very helpful. and so, maybe just one more for charles. you guys announced the buyback in december and i think we were a little less active than we expected this quarter. and with tce back at 10.5% and if your currency has recovered a little bit. but how are you guys thinking about the buyback this year? and do you still plan on utilizing the full 1.6 million [phonetic] share authorization?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
yeah. i think it's something we continue to evaluate on an ongoing basis. we're certainly aware of our very strong capital position, which puts us in a great position for a rebound in the economy, obviously, to deploy into additional loans. but certainly and also as you know, we'll note that we did slightly increase our dividend and we're thinking about that as well in relation, so that's going to be evaluated also on a regular basis. but it is a tool in our toolbox that again, as as we see fluctuations in the marketplace we'll have an opportunity to deploy capital where we think the price is right to do that.
stuart lotz -- kbw -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions guys.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
sure.
operator
okay. your next question comes from samuel varga from stephens incorporated.
samuel varga -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
good morning.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
good morning.
samuel varga -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
i'm on for brody [phonetic] this morning. and i just wanted to ask another question going back a little bit to credit conversation. i wanted to ask a little bit about your office portfolio with regards to loan to values and coverage ratios, could you give us a sense of that? and maybe if i -- if you do have any insight to it? and what the portfolio items look like in terms of the work-from-home trend?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president of eagle bancorp, inc. and senior executive vice president & chief credit o
yes. the office portfolio has held up really remarkably well, despite the work-from-home atmosphere of covid. i think a lot of that has to do with the types of tenants that are in place. and we do have roughly $1 billion of office property in the portfolio. we would anticipate that if there is a permanent change to more remote working status. the impact of these are most significant in the central business district and it will occur over a period of time, you know, five years or so as existing leases mature and perhaps smaller footprints are desired in the future. so, we are looking at that and monitoring it carefully. i think at this point, we haven't seen any significant drop in average rents because we don't have properties that are right now on the income producing side, suffering a 100% roll in leases out of the blocks. but we have to stress test that portion of the portfolio every quarter as we do all income-producing product. and we've been making very severe incremental drops in revenues and to try to model out what that might -- what might happen in the future. i think we're feeling like this is a longer-term dilution [phonetic] strategy, but we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of the loan to values that we have currently in our office properties.
samuel varga -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
great. thank you, guys. that's very helpful. and then, switching back to cover a more big-picture perspective on the loan portfolio. we noticed that they were 5% quarter-over-quarter, quarter [phonetic] drops in cre and construction. and so, we just wanted to get a sense for what might have been driving that?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president of eagle bancorp, inc. and senior executive vice president & chief credit o
i think it's really a timing factor. it's very difficult to pick up [technical issues] time and make an assessment as to an overall philosophy about the loan portfolio. i think we're seeing lots of opportunities, including in the office area, by the way, but we are looking at a property with 15-year gsa lease, so it's not really as vulnerable as you might think. office properties would be, they're all very individual and evaluated individually. so we don't intend to be less assertive in our cre philosophy. and i expect that we'll continue to see that segment of the portfolio grow.
samuel varga -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
all right. great. thank you. and then, i guess one more question around ppp. i just want to get a sense for what your round three involvement, kind of, looks like big-picture and you've noted some items on that. and then the -- maybe the change in expectations around the forgiveness schedule? if you could give some color on that, please?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president of eagle bancorp, inc. and senior executive vice president & chief credit o
in terms of the forgiveness piece on the ppp portfolio, i think it's a much more arduous process than anyone would have thought it was [technical issues] at the beginning of the program. we are still getting, you know, almost daily flash information from the small business association in order to tell us how and when and what's needed in order to process forgiveness. so, it's difficult to say with any level of certainty, the rate at which we might expect to see forgiveness go forward.
charles, i think you've also been looking at that?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank
yeah. i mean, gears are moving albeit slowly on the forgiveness process. and we continue to work with our borrowers to submit those applications for forgiveness to the sba. but as jan noted, there is -- it's a difficult process. so, but we're moving in along.
samuel varga -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
great. thank you very much. and thank you very much. that will be for me.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer of eagle bancorp, inc. and eaglebank

good day and thank you for standing by. welcome to the eagle bancorp's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. after the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, chief financial officer, charles levingston. sir, please, go ahead.
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
thank you, michelle. good morning. this is charles levingston, chief financial officer of eagle bancorp. before we begin the presentation, i would like to remind everyone that some of the comments made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements. while our growth and performance over the past quarter has been positive, we cannot make any promises about future performance, and it is our policy not to establish with the markets any formal guidance with respect to our earnings.
none of the forward-looking statements made during this call should be interpreted as our providing formal guidance. our form 10-k for the 2020 fiscal year, our quarterly reports on form 10-q and current reports on form 8-k identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning. eagle bancorp does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments unless required by law.
this morning's commentary will include non-gaap financial information. the earnings release which is posted in the investor relations section of our website and filed with the sec contains reconciliations of this information to the most directly comparable gaap information. our periodic reports are available from eagle online at our website or the sec's website.
this morning, susan riel, the president and ceo of eagle bancorp will start us off with a high-level overview; then jan williams, our chief credit officer will discuss her thoughts on loans and credit quality matters; then i'll return to discuss our financials in more detail. at the end all three of us will be available to take questions. i would now like to turn it over to our president and ceo, susan riel.
susan riel -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, charles. good morning, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call for the second quarter of 2021. i'm pleased to report another great quarter for the bank. similar to last quarter, earnings again are at record-levels. equity has risen to an all-time high. asset quality remains high with favorable credit trends and efficiency remains a strength.
a key difference from last quarter is that there was an increase in total loans, excluding loans held for sale and ppp loans. it was a modest increase of almost $60 million, but it break the downward trend. focusing on earnings first, earnings for the quarter were $48 million or $1.50 per share. this was a 1.68% return on average asset and a 16.25% return on average tangible common equity.
the larger items impacting earnings this quarter included $4.7 million of accelerated interest income from the sale of ppp loans and $4.6 million reversal from the allowance for credit losses on loans and reserved for unfunded commitments. earnings over the last four quarters, which includes the third quarter of 2020 when the nation was still locked down, totaled $171.7 million or $5.35 per diluted share. these earnings continue to build our common equity, which at the end of the quarter was $1.3 billion or 11.92% of assets.
turning to asset quality. at the end of the quarter, npas were 50 basis points of assets and for the quarter, annualized net charge-offs were 30 basis points of average loans. these asset quality ratios, combined with an improved economic outlook nationally and locally informed our decision to make a second conservative reversal from our allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded commitments.
with a reversal of $4.6 million for the quarter, the total reversal for the first half of 2021 was $7.4 million. after the reversal, our reserves were 1.32% of loans, excluding ppp loans. in terms of operating efficiency, we continue to be a leader with an efficiency ratio of 37.1% for the quarter. we are always prudent in our approach to expense management.
for example, this quarter, we closed our rosslyn virginia branch as it had an expiring lease and our customers can be served from other northern virginia branches. the combined annual pre-tax cost savings in rental expense will be about $263,000 and there was no write-off of leasehold improvements as these had been fully amortized upon the expiration of the lease.
we are also pleased that all of the employees working at the branch have filled or will be filling positions within the company. additionally, given the bank's robust capital levels, we requested and received board and regulatory approval to redeem $150 million of subordinated debt issued in 2016. charles will have more details on this later.
before discussing loans, i would like to once again mention the contributions of the residential mortgage and fha teams. our residential mortgage team had another great quarter with locked loans of $248 million and a gain on sale of mortgage loans of $3.5 million. even with mortgage volume, off slightly from last quarter, we expect the residential mortgage division will continue to contribute meaningfully to the bottom line.
our fha team also did well, generating trade premiums of $2.6 million that are included in non-interest income. the revenue stream from the fha division is not smooth from quarter-to-quarter. comparatively, the fha division has larger transactions and less volume than the mortgage division, which has smaller transactions and higher value.
in regard to loans, last quarter on this earnings call, i said eagle bank intends to more assertively pursue loan opportunities. this past quarter, our funding for new loan originations and advances increased while payoffs and pay-downs decrease. as a result, loans excluding loans held for sale and ppp loans increased by $60 million. jan will talk in more detail about this later.
while still talking about loans, during the quarter, we made a decision to sell $170 million of our ppp loans, which generated nearly $4.7 million in accelerated net deferred fees and costs into interest income. the sale was to a well-regarded firm with significant expertise in the ongoing servicing and processing associated with ppp loans. additionally just below $160 million in loans were forgiven during the second quarter.
the ppp loans retained totaling $238 million with those that had already started the forgiveness process on our platform or those that we decided to retain for customer service reasons. the sale of the ppp loans and with the remaining loans moving through the forgiveness process will enable us to free up personnel to focus on originating new business and to continue to provide a high level of service to our clients.
in regards to our market, we serve a strong and robust market anchored by the federal government and government contracting, a growing technology presence, which includes amazon's hq2, many substantial domestic and international firms, several large hospital systems and a long list of the universities.
our home market continues to see companies open, hotels are doing more business, tourists have returned and many of the restaurants are full. internally, eagle bank, which has been operating remotely where possible since the beginning of the pandemic will have its workforce return in a hybrid environment on september 13.
we also have a legal update. we are pleased to have initiated discussions with commission staff about a potential resolution or settlement regarding the commission's investigation, which we first disclosed in july 2019. we hope to resolve the commission's investigation as it relates to the company within the next few months. this would be a welcome development for eagle bank and its shareholders. in addition, we are also pleased to have initiated discussions with the staff of the federal reserve board about a potential resolution or settlement regarding the federal reserve board's investigation. we also hope to resolve the federal reserve board's investigation as it relates to the company in a timely manner.
we also disclosed in yesterday's press release that our cfo, charles levingston received a wells notice in connection with the ongoing sec investigation. charles made a submission to the sec in response to the wells notice and is cooperating with the sec's investigation. charles is continuing to serve in his capacity as cfo.
while we can't comment on the allegations against charles, i want to stress that making the decision to have charles continue to serve as cfo the board evaluated the circumstances considered a number of factors and consulted with members of management and external advisors, including our independent auditors. the board's top priority is as it always has been to act in the best interest of the company and the company's stockholders, and we, and the board remain confident in the company's disclosure controls, accuracy of its financial reporting and the professionalism of the company's finance function and personnel.
we work closely with other members of the company's management, the company's disclosure controls committee, the company's independent auditors, the outside disclosure council and other advisors and consultants to ensure that the company maintains strong internal controls over financial reporting.
given that the investigation is ongoing, we obviously cannot speculate or comment further on these developments at this time, nor are we able to speculate or comment on former employees and directors' potential interactions with the sec. accordingly, we cannot answer any questions about the investigation during our q&a.
before turning it over to jan, i would like to reiterate that we remain focused on building stockholder value. book value rose to $40.87 per share, up 11% from a year ago and tangible book was $37.58 per share, up 12% from a year ago. we also increased the quarterly dividend to $0.35 per share. this is up from $0.25 from the prior quarter and $0.22 the quarter before that. based on recent stock prices for eagle, a dividend of $0.35 per share puts our dividend yield more in-line with our peers.
i would like to thank all of our employees for their hard work and their commitment to support our clients. additionally, we remain committed to a culture of respect, diversity and inclusion in both the workplace and the communities we serve. with that, i would like to turn the speaking duties over to jan williams, our chief credit officer.

thank you, susan, and good morning, everyone. first, i'd like to speak to the modest uptick in loan balances, exclusive of ppp and loans held for sale that susan mentioned earlier. as credit has improved and with a large portion of ppp loans sold or moving through the forgiveness stage, we're able to focus more of our efforts on quality opportunities we see in the market. in particular, we're focused on opportunities that offer good risk-adjusted returns. having said that, the pricing of loans continues to be a factor in our appetite for new loans.
of course, there is always going to be a time lag between identifying and securing lending commitments and ultimately loan funding. some of the uptick in loans may also be related to the timing on fundings for new loans originated in the past several quarters. booked and funded loan originations last quarter were on the lower side. however, we did have a few large loans with significant funding this quarter.
one of the larger loans was an $80 million multifamily financing for the montgomery county housing opportunities commission in economically strong bethesda maryland. as a community bank, we're very pleased to be able to offer support for these local efforts to bring affordable housing opportunities to our community. we also funded $26 million for the redevelopment of another very well-located property in northwest washington dc during the quarter.
in regards to the reversal of the $4.6 million from the allowance for credit losses and reserves for unfunded commitments, the reversal primarily resulted from the improved outlook for the economy and employment forecast, as well as improvement in the loan portfolio credit metrics. the unemployment rate for the washington area, which was 5.8% in february fell to 4.9% in may. at period-end june 30, loans 30 to 89 days past due fell to $3.9 million, the lowest level we have seen in more than a dozen years. with the reversal, the allowance for credit losses to total loans excluding ppp loans was 1.32%, down 15 basis points from the prior quarter end.
even with and lower allowance for credit losses, our coverage ratio was stable with coverage of non-performing loans and 187% which remains in the 180% to 200% range where it's been for the last six quarters. at quarter end, npas to assets were 50 basis points, down 1 basis point from the prior quarter end. in dollars, npas were $54.5 million, down from $57.3 million in the prior quarter-end. the decline in npas was primarily from payoffs of non-performing loans, a return to accrual status for some loans which exhibited sustained performance and charge-offs.
net charge-offs for the quarter were $5.6 million. the largest charge-off was a partial charge-off related to a note sale, sub-tiered by a smaller suburban office property at $3.5 million. the new sale closed in early july. the other charge-offs consisted of a partial charge-off of one other cre loan now fully resolved, a few smaller c&i loans principally in the restaurant industry and one small sba credit.
with that i'd like to turn it over to charles levingston, our chief financial officer.
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
thank you, jan. net income for the second quarter of 2021 and the second quarter of 2020 reflects operations in two very distinctly different environments as the current quarter contains a reversal from the allowance for credit losses and accelerated income from the ppp loan sale -- whereas in the second quarter of 2020, we were still building those covid 19 reserves.
in the earnings release to adjust for the impact of the ppp sale, we added a table for net interest margin, which backs out the $4.7 million of accelerated net fees in costs from net interest income and we also carried the adjusted net interest income down into the ppnr table. while adjusted ppnr for the second quarter of 2021 declined in comparison to the second quarter of 2020, it was a little changed from the prior quarter-end.
on a linked quarter basis, the net interest income, absent of ppp sale was down $2.7 million from the prior quarter. this primarily reflects the decline in margins to $2.88 million [phonetic] on an adjusted basis, down from [indecipherable] prior two quarters. non-interest income was up $338,000 from the prior quarter. while mortgage gain on sales were down on a linked quarter basis, fha trade premiums of $2.6 million dollars more than made up for the difference.
non-interest expenses were down $1.3 million from the prior quarter. most of the decline was in salaries and expenses in fdic fees, offset by the increases in legal and professional fees. overall, adjusted ppnr, absent the ppp accelerated income was down $1 million from the prior quarter. this quarter, deposit inflows finally abated and deposits at quarter-end were $9 billion, down $180 million from the prior quarter. this resulted in the reduction of excess liquidity as we continue to slowly and prudently build the investment portfolio. investment securities at the end of the second quarter were $1.7 billion up $311 million from the prior quarter-end. investments this quarter like last quarter primarily 20-year 2% agency mortgage-backed securities and callable agency bonds.
additionally while it doesn't show up in the investments, this quarter we invested $300 million and a reverse repurchase agreement with a well-regarded nationally known investment bank to get some additional earnings on our cash. also higher cost cds continue to run off. in the second quarter of 2021 cds with a total balance of $200 million and a weighted average rate of 1.21% matured. these cds had a weighted average term of 16 months at issuance. overall, our cost of funds in the first quarter of 2021 decreased to 37 basis points, down from 42 basis points in the prior quarter.
going forward, our cost of funds will be positively impacted by the redemption of $150 million of our 2016 subordinated debt on august 1, which is our first opportunity to call the debt. the debt had a rate of 5% in the second quarter, which translates into a pre-tax cost savings of $7.5 million on an annual basis and $1.9 million on a reported basis. this redemption however will accelerate about $1.3 million in deferred costs. so the impact in the third quarter will be minimal. to fund the repayment, we made a dividend of $100 million from the bank to the bancorp early in the third quarter.
the redemption of debt is possible, because our earnings have consistently generated capital that is outpaced the need for capital to cover risk-based assets. the redemption of debt will not impact our tier 1 or tangible capital at the bancorp but we reduced our capital at the bank level. even with this reduction, we have enough capital to fund future loan growth as well as fund large commercial projects.
with that, i'll hand it back to susan for a short wrap up. susan?
susan riel -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, charles. as we move into the second half of 2021. we will continue our efforts to deliver positive operating performance results and we will continue to strive to serve both our investors and our community to the best of our ability. but before we open up for questions, i would like to say that the bank posted its second consecutive quarter of record earnings. npas are 50 basis points on assets. loans past due 30 to 89 days are under $4 million. common equity is almost 12% of assets. total risk-based capital is almost 18%. we just raised the dividend and we got approval to redeem a $150 million in sub debt, the bank is doing well.
we'll now open up the call for your questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of casey whitman with piper sandler. your line is open. please go ahead.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good morning.
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
good morning.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
wondering maybe if you could start with just a ppp related question following the sale of the portion of the ppp and accelerated fees, how much is remaining in the ppp processing fees that have yet to be realized on that remaining $238 million balance and also like what's your best guess for the timing or forgiveness for the remaining balance.
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
yeah, i'll take that one casey. left on the balance sheet that we've got about $3 million or so, a little less than $3 million in net deferred fees on the ppp portfolio, the $230 million left. in terms of timing, your guess is good as mine, they've been moving along at a pretty good clip. i imagine they're going to be some stragglers at the end if they waited this long they may have their own challenges and gathering that information, but i would expect over the next couple of quarters, we'll see a meaningful decline in those ppp loans, but time will tell the tale.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
helpful. thank you. and nice to see the loan growth this quarter, you mentioned just some of the pressure on the yields, but do you have the numbers around where new production was coming on this quarter versus last maybe?
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
so, yeah, as you can see obviously that on an adjusted basis, our yields for the quarter on total loans is just above 450 out of 452. new production is coming on a weighted average coupon right, so ignoring the impact of the deferred fees and costs of right around just below 4% or so on a weighted average basis is where we were coming in the second quarter. so obviously that's going to, if that trend continues, we will create a little bit of a drag on the asset side of balance sheet.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
understood. a last question, i'll let someone else jump on. but just on capital you've raised your dividend a number of times recently. just how are you guys ultimately thinking about the right level with as you mentioned your yield kind of now more in line with peers. is there sort of a target payout ratio range, we should think about or how do you think about the level?
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
yeah, obviously, we do hold a significant amount of capital. i think that the rock and hard place for us is really that adc cre concentration number. we do, if you stack as against a larger peer group appear to have a larger capital, but we want to be mindful of those adc and cre concentration limitations. so that is somewhat of a gating factor. but we're going to be judicious about and prudent about that capital management, we want to make sure that we're being good stewards of the capital that we're holding and return it to our shareholders where appropriate.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
understood. and do you have that adc capital level now or should we wait for the call for it.
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
yeah, i would wait for the call and core [phonetic] to have it finalized, but it's going to be slightly improved from the prior quarter my expectation.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
all right, thanks. thanks for the call.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of david bishop with seaport research partners. your line is open. please go ahead.
david bishop -- seaport research partners -- analyst
thank you. hey, good morning guys, how are you.
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
hi, good morning dave.
david bishop -- seaport research partners -- analyst
hey. susan, i think you mentioned in the earnings narrative. the opportunity to originate loans for larger commercial projects. just curious, has your appetite increased or to do larger deals here, just given the strength the capital or maybe back and competition or just the quality or tenure of loans you're seeing in the market. just maybe some commentary in terms of the outlook for average loan size, how you see that playing out?
susan riel -- president & chief executive officer
i think our appetite has definitely increased. but we also are seeing that in the market and as you know, the market is tight. the pricing is tight and there's a lot of competition. so we are out there. our teams are aggressively pursuing deals and we've had a good deal of success recently.
janice williams -- chief credit officer
i would agree with that. i would also say that the larger opportunities that are coming through seem to have an incredible amount of equity in them. i think there's still a lot of money sitting around looking for a place to deploy. so the credit metrics on these larger deals has been especially strong. on the other hand, the pricing is pretty darn tight on them. so it's a balancing act.
david bishop -- seaport research partners -- analyst
just curious if you have any commentary what the loan pipeline looks currently relative to last quarter?
janice williams -- chief credit officer
i'm sorry.
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
the loan pipeline. we have [indecipherable] commitments of just under $2 billion currently it's slightly elevated from where we were last quarter which was closer to $1.9 billion i believe.
david bishop -- seaport research partners -- analyst
got it and then charles maybe from a credit perspective, obviously the numbers moving in the right direction here, but when you get to a point, maybe look out the future where we start to see the positive loan growth. just curious if you can give us a sense where you think you see the acl moving back to just update us what the day one ratio was and maybe what you'd be reserving new loan growth at.
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
right. our one calculation was right about 110 basis points, i believe, and obviously, here we are sitting at 128 basis points, 132 when you exclude ppp. so if we assume that day one is a normal environment. right, every environment is a little different then there is a little bit more room to drift down if can get back there.
david bishop -- seaport research partners -- analyst
got it. appreciate the commentary in the securities. if you do continue to see some excess liquidity in the market that doesn't funnel into loans. do you see that ratio of investment assets creeping up again. i think it's about 12% or 13% currently.
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
right. yeah, it's certainly likely. that's the place to go, if you can get to the loans. so again, we want to be. i'll use the word judicious again about it but that's the answer today as to the loan growth.
david bishop -- seaport research partners -- analyst
got it. and then i think you had mentioned the run-off of the cd book this quarter, any update on -- in terms of repricing opportunities that might lie ahead in third and fourth quarter?
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
all right. yeah. so those cds, i mentioned $200 million came off with the way leverage rate of a 121 basis point to 16 months in term. we had some of that reprice, i think was about $85 million reprice at about 12 basis points with average maturity of 12 months. so you are seeing obviously those funding costs continue to grind down as a cds roll-off and i think there is a little more opportunity for that, you can see the weighted average rate that we have for time deposits. that we have in the press releases, 136 basis points. so there is still some room to drift down there, if those continue to reprice. we also did bring down just slightly our deposit pricing on a rate sheet just by a couple of basis points, we continue to look for opportunities to improve funding costs.
again, the $150 million in sub debt is going to be called on august 1, we will have a significant impact, but from a liquidity standpoint rate, if you think every $100 million or so of excess liquidity means about 3 basis points on the balance sheet and the absolute cost associated with that to that 5% rate on the $150 million is a hefty price excess liquidity. so those savings make a lot of sense. and obviously if the need for capital returns at some point, we feel comfortable that we can reengage the capital markets and today clearly very, very attractive prices. so, but right now the need isn't necessarily there, so far more information than you wanted, but hopefully that answers your question.
david bishop -- seaport research partners -- analyst
do you have the schedule of both cd maturities in the third quarter and fourth, just the dollar amount and maybe rate.
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
not offhand, i do have that in my notes. so i'm not sure it's something that we're publishing now.
david bishop -- seaport research partners -- analyst
got it, ok. i'll jump off the line. let someone else ask some questions. thanks.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of catherine mealor with kbw. your line is open. please go ahead.
catherine mealor -- kbw -- analyst
thanks, good morning.
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
good morning catherine.
catherine mealor -- kbw -- analyst
maybe just a follow-up on the deposit and kind of excess liquidity conversation. would you expect some here for deposits to continue to shrink like we saw this quarter on an average basis or you calling for your pipeline is loan growth improved. do you see in even modest deposit growth?
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
yeah. i see deposits relatively flat as far as i can see at this point, there is still quarterly cost [phonetic] around out there and looking for a home and you still achieve some narrow spreads on some of that liquidity, when we find it at the right price. so i see them being relatively flat at this point.
catherine mealor -- kbw -- analyst
that's helpful. and then, how about on loan growth. can you talk a little bit -- i know, you answered a question on this earlier, but as the pipeline continues to improve what kind of level of growth rate do you feel like is appropriate for eagle at this point, you were historically kind of double-digit grower and were some changes in kind of i think risk appetite, and maybe balances of the amount of construction loans and you want to keep on the balance sheet. so what over kind of a longer period of time what type of growth rate do you feel like is right for your company?
susan riel -- president & chief executive officer
i would say, catherine that we've really do have a renewed appetite and are being more aggressive in going out into the marketplace and looking at different types of loans. we have looked much more favorably upon certain types of construction lending, and i think that number will be increasing in the future. based on what we've seen so far. we're not averse to it at this point in time and feel like the economy is in a much better spot than it was 2.5 years ago. charles?
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
yeah, again pricing is a challenge. we've certainly got plenty of liquidity to deploy. we don't want to compromise on credit. so the question in that vin diagram is that channel, our president of commercial banking. is that what are we willing to do on the pricing front. so that's the gating factor there. deal flow, it seems to be pretty good as we hear, there is opportunities out there, it's just, there's a lot of money chasing fewer deals.
catherine mealor -- kbw -- analyst
and then one last one on the buyback, you increased your dividend a significantly this quarter which was great to see park on the buyback, would you expect to be more active in the buyback in the back half of the year?
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
we're going to continue to evaluate that, we certainly want to make sure that we are buying it at a reasonable price and obviously there is. you want to rely on the metrics. right, there clearly is a little bit of the sticker shock from where we initially put that share repurchase plan in place but we want to rely on the metrics and look for a reasonable way to repurchase shares and do what's best for the shareholder, be it any more changes to the dividend or repurchase of additional shares. something we'll continue to look at.
catherine mealor -- kbw -- analyst
thanks so much.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of brody preston with stephens inc. your line is open. please go ahead.
brody preston -- stephens, inc -- analyst
hey, good morning everyone. hey charles, i just wanted to follow up on the loan portfolio. could you just give us a reminder what percent of loans are floating rate and what percent of the floating rate bucket is currently at floor levels?
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
yes. so we have about i think excluding ppp, you're talking about close to 60%, just under 60% is variable rate that's about $4 billion or so and just under $3 billion have floors on them, about $2.8 billion.
brody preston -- stephens, inc -- analyst
okay. and you know of those floors what amount is currently at their floor levels?
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
it is a significant portion. if you give me a second, i will give you that answer, if you want to ask another question, i can get to it.
brody preston -- stephens, inc -- analyst
yeah, that would be great. i'll ask jan a question. jan, there's been a couple of articles in the commercial observer lately about increased vacancy that some office buildings in dc, and so i just wanted to ask. and i think there was a small office property that you guys may be charged off or had an issue in this quarter. so i just wanted to ask is, are any of those vacancy issues kind of making its way in new york portfolio and if you could just provide some i guess maybe some broader color on what you're seeing in the broader office market?
janice williams -- chief credit officer
i think there's a lot of uncertainty out there with what's going to happen in the office market longer term in the near term. we don't really have one office project that was substantial. we have new construction. that is in dc, that is in lease and has been seeing increased activity lately, everything else that we have on the office side in dc is really been income producing. so we haven't had any significant blip in performance and the leases roll over a fairly long period of time. so, if there's going to be an impact, it's not going to be immediate. maybe three years or so as lease rollover start hitting. but i think that we're in a pretty comfortable loan to value. some would do stress test to our income producing cre for significant declines in operating income, increases in cap rate et cetera. it's an area where we're treading lightly, but we think leases in place do offer a buffer in a period of time to work through things. that said, there are a number of repositioning projects that are really more close in suburbs than they are in dc proper, but that's certainly something we're starting to see here as you've seen in other areas of the country.
brody preston -- stephens, inc -- analyst
okay, great, thank you for that.
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
and brody, just to get back to you. so, it looks like of the 40% or so, the portfolio that is at floor, that $2.87 billion that are the floors, it's only about $208 million that are currently at the floor.
brody preston -- stephens, inc -- analyst
okay, great. thank you for that. and then my last question, susan, i appreciate the update that you gave on the investigations both on the call and in the release. i hear you loud and clear, but this was the first time you gave a little bit of a time line, i guess, on a potential resolution. so, feel free to give me the stiff arm on this question if you need to, but i do feel compelled to ask. was there something that changed to this quarter, relative to last quarter that made you feel comfortable going to the federal reserve and asking them for a potential resolution?
susan riel -- president & chief executive officer
i would say there has just been increased discussion that we have had with both the sec and the federal reserve. that's where we're coming from with those responses.
brody preston -- stephens, inc -- analyst
all right, great. thank you very much for taking my questions. i appreciate it.
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
thanks, brody.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott. your line is open. please, go ahead.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
thank you and good morning. jan, i just wanted to drill down a bit more on credit quality. just curious on kind of trends that we might see coming soon on sort of special mentioned substandard loans and kind of how you think risk grades will play out in the next few quarters.
janice williams -- chief credit officer
well, i do think we're going to be seeing the loans that we automatically shifted onto the watch list because of deferrals start to come off, because at the end of next quarter, substantially all of the deferrals, would have been completed. as we see these loans having sustained performance under contractual terms, we'll be pulling them off of the list as far as special mention and substandard go. given the state of the portfolio right now and the level of past dues that we had that are really microscopic, i'm not seeing -- knock on wood -- and don't let this be a prediction, but i'm not seeing anything currently that would give me reason to think that we were going to have increases in classified loans.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
okay, great. and then just a follow-up. it has to do with that sort of pre-sold construction within the book and how often are you seeing homes or other properties kind of pre-sold on the front-end and is that still a high characteristic in greater dc market?
janice williams -- chief credit officer
okay. this is on the residential side?
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
yes. i think primarily residential.
janice williams -- chief credit officer
well, the residential market here is fire-hot. i have never seen that like this before. people are definitely in inventory shortage, things are moving a lot faster, we've had a number of our builders who come in and because the level of their pre-sales are so high, and we had some kind of locked into one-two spec situation and a limited number of pre-sales. now, they're really looking to increase the size of that availability, because of the number of pre-sales and the prices continue to increase. it's tough to say for sure, but the 10-year [phonetic] seems to be amazingly low. so, in thinking that, i don't see an end in sight for this right now. charles is a better predictor of the 10-year [phonetic] than i am.
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
right. obviously, there seems to be a very high correlation with how that 10-year tracks, and the kind of activity we see [indecipherable] operation. and clearly, with the dips that we had over the last couple of weeks, we think that may drive another strong couple of periods for them.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
okay, great. thank you for that color. and then just a final question, susan, back to you. on these legal matters that you disclosed, should we expect to see an update in the 10-q in a few weeks or will it take longer than that to kind of provide any incremental information on the matters to be?
susan riel -- president & chief executive officer
we really can't tell at this point. if something happens, obviously we will update. but we can't predict that at this time.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
and then is there any visibility on the legal expense from here? would it be presumably higher this next quarter? or is it too early to say?
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
yes. i think it's a little too early to say. clearly is as we approach the resolution on these matters, the legal activity is going to increase. so, that's something to be mindful of as you're thinking about it.
christopher marinac -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
sure. okay. thank you very much, i appreciate it.
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
thank you.
susan riel -- president & chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of david bishop with seaport research partners. your line is open. please, go ahead.
david bishop -- seaport research partners -- analyst
yes. hey, just had a quick follow-up, susan, in terms of i think you mentioned in the preamble, get an opportunity to participate, i think with the montgo affordable housing program with the larger credit. i know up here in howard county, that's a real issue in terms of housing affordability. are you seeing opportunity to maybe exploit that or take advantage of that drumbeat and maybe some of the dmb [phonetic] counties around here surrounding montgo and northern virginia. just curious if there's maybe some other opportunities to participate with some of the county governments to build out some of the affordable housing initiatives that are being pushed?
susan riel -- president & chief executive officer
we're constantly looking at that as a possibility. so, there are opportunities and our people are out there in dealing and looking to bring those on board.
david bishop -- seaport research partners -- analyst
in terms of loan yields, low on that, just curious, any sort of pricing and yield discussion you can provide on those types of opportunities? thanks. that's all i had.
janice williams -- chief credit officer
well, i can't really give you pricing information on a specific credit. in general, there is a lot of price competition for strong deals and i think we're seeing that and we just try to make sure that we are in the mix with the correct risk adjusted pricing and move forward with increasing the size of the portfolio at acceptable rate levels.
susan riel -- president & chief executive officer
right now, i think, charles said before or jan, we're not compromising on credit. pricing is tough, but we are holding tight on our credit requirements.
charles levingston -- chief financial officer
another factor i'd throw in there is obviously with all the liquidity that both we as an institution and a lot of our competitors have, both size and as both susan and jan said, support matter as transactions in those deals get pretty competitive when they are large like that with healthy sponsors.
david bishop -- seaport research partners -- analyst
understood. appreciate the color.
janice williams -- chief credit officer
it is great work. it's great type of lending and we do enjoy being involved in our community and working with our constituencies to really bring that sort of thing home. so if you've got an opportunity in howard county and you want to throw it our way, i'm happy to take your call.
david bishop -- seaport research partners -- analyst
i will definitely take that under consideration.
operator
thank you. and i'm showing no further questions at this time. i would like to turn the conference back over to ceo, susan riel for her closing remarks.
susan riel -- president & chief executive officer
just want to say in closing, we appreciate your questions and all of you taking the time to join us on the call. we hope everyone is enjoying the summer and we look forward to speaking to you again in a few months.
have a great day.

operator
good day, everyone, and welcome to the eagle bancorp third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
it is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to charles levingston, chief financial officer. please proceed.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, brian. good morning. this is charles levingston, chief financial officer of eagle bancorp. before we begin the presentation, i would like to remind everyone that some of the comments made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements.
while our growth and performance over this past year has been positive, we cannot make any promises about future performance. and it is our policy not to establish with the markets any formal guidance with respect to our earnings. none of the forward-looking statements made during this call should be interpreted as our providing formal guidance. our form 10-k for the 2020 fiscal year, our quarterly reports on form 10-q, and current reports on form 8-k identify certain risk factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning.
eagle bancorp does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments unless required by law. this morning's commentary will include non-gaap financial information. the earnings release, which is posted in the investor relations section of our website and filed with the sec, contains reconciliations of this information to the most directly comparable gaap information. our periodic reports are available from eagle online at our website or the sec's website.
this morning, susan riel, the president and ceo of eagle bancorp, will start us off with a high-level overview; then jan williams, our chief credit officer, will discuss her thoughts on loans, reserves and credit quality matters; then, i'll return to discuss our financials in more detail. at the end, all 3 of us will be available to take questions.
i would now like to turn it over to our president and ceo, susan riel.
susan g. riel -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, charles. good morning, and welcome to our earnings call for the third quarter of 2021. i'm pleased to report another great quarter for eagle. earnings, while not a record, were the second-highest in the bank's history. asset quality continues to improve, efficiency remains a strong point, and capital is building. and directly impacting our shareholders, we raised our dividend for the third time this year and we bought back some shares this quarter. the one area, though, that's lagged behind has been loan growth, which i'll also touch on later along with some comments on our market and a legal update.
focusing on earnings first. earnings for the quarter were $43.6 million or $1.36 per share. this was a 1.46% return on average assets and a 14.11% return on average tangible common equity. earnings for the first three quarters totaled $135 million or $4.22 per diluted share.
turning to assets. at the end of the quarter, nonperforming assets were 31 basis points on assets. and for the quarter, annualized net charge-offs were 8 basis points on average loans. both of these ratios are the lowest we've seen in the past eight quarters. these asset quality ratios combined with some factors, that jan will review, informed our decision to make a third consecutive reversal from our allowance for credit losses. with a reversal of $8.2 million for the quarter, the total reversal for the first nine months of the year was $14.4 million.
in terms of our operating efficiency, we continue to be a leader with an efficiency ratio of 41.7% for the quarter. we are always prudent in our approach to expense management, yet we always keep an eye on critical infrastructure, and investments, and controls that are necessary to operate a safe and sound banking institution.
this quarter we closed our dulles, virginia branch as it had an expiring lease and our customers can be served from other northern virginia branches. the combined annual pre-tax cost savings in rental expense will be about $187,000 and there was no write-off of leasehold improvements as these had been fully amortized upon the expiration of the lease.
we are also pleased that all of the employees working at the branch have filled or will be filling positions within the company, providing internal mobility opportunities to our employees wherever possible. it's a critical part of our relationship first culture. with earnings remaining strong, capital continues to build. at quarter end, the equity was $1.3 billion, up $25 million over the prior quarter end and up $108 million from a year ago.
for our shareholders, our earnings lead directly to increased capital, raising both book and tangible values. book value rose to $41.68 per share, up 9.8% from a year ago, and tangible book value was $38.39 per share, up 10.6% from a year ago. we also increased the quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share. this is up from $0.35 the prior quarter and $0.25 the quarter before that. with a dividend of $0.40 and earnings of $1.36, our payout ratio for the quarter was 29.4%. while we have increased the dividend three times this year, our intent was to increase our dividend yield to be more in line with banks our size. based on last night's closing stock price of $57.93 per share and a dividend of $0.40 per share, our dividend yield is 2.8%.
in regards to our stock repurchase plan, we repurchased 11,609 shares this past quarter at an average price of $52.94 per share. we still have almost 1.6 million shares authorized for repurchase remaining in the plan. on the ground, our market has proven to be robust. even with setbacks from the delta variant, government spending and contracting remained strong, hotels and restaurants are doing better, private companies are headed back to work, and construction on new projects continues. this summer, the washington business journal's list of the top 25 ongoing construction projects totaled $14.5 billion, up from $12.6 billion the year earlier. also reported recently by the washington business journal, an amazon economic impact report stated that amazon invested a total of $28.5 billion in northern virginia over the last 10 years. and based on government data, the unemployment rate in the washington area, dropped to 4.8% in august compared to 5% nationwide. and recently released census data shows the population in the washington region grew by 13% over the last decade. all very positive signs for our market and the community we serve.
before discussing loans, i would like to once again mention the contributions of the residential mortgage and fha teams. our residential mortgage team had another great quarter with the locked loans of $280 million and a gain on sale of mortgage loans of $3.3 million. this is on par with the prior quarter, and we appreciate our residential mortgage division for their ongoing efforts to obtain these results. our fha team, for the first nine months of the year, has generated trade premiums of $3.7 million that are included in non-interest income. the revenue stream from the fha division is not smooth from quarter-to-quarter. comparatively, the fha division has larger transactions and less volume than the mortgage division, which has smaller transactions and higher volume.
in regards to loans, over the past 12 months, our loans have decreased as payoffs and paydowns have outpaced funding advances and originations, but the market and our approach has changed. initially, at the onset -- outset of the pandemic, we chose to focus on serving existing clients and maintaining credit quality. more recently in the third quarter of 2021, the decline in loans was impacted by the competition to refinance at lower rates with lower amortization periods. in some cases, these refinancings were from non-bank lenders who are attracted to the strong dc market.
additionally, there is a lot of excess liquidity at other banks as well as many companies and construction project sponsors. additionally, many of our commercial clients are flush with cash, some of which has flowed into the bank in the form of deposits. however, on the loan side, this leads to lower utilization rates and a longer period from loan approval until the loan is strong.
over the past quarter, excluding ppp loans, loans were $6.85 billion, down 3.4% or $238 million from the prior quarter. however, both our cre and c&i teams are seeing an increase in deal flow and in the market. and given the market conditions, the bank has taken a more competitive stance on credit spreads on high-quality loan opportunities. the improvement can be seen in our unfunded commitments, which were $2.4 billion at quarter end, up $280 million over the prior quarter end. we have had significant success at booking new construction credit. balances on these loans are expected to increase over time.
before turning it over to jan, i have a legal update. on our litigation and investigations, we continue to make progress toward a resolution of all disclosed matters, although a bit slower than we had hoped.
the company received closure on the outstanding shareholder derivative action on monday, october 4th when the dc superior court approved the settlement of that litigation. and the class action settlement is on track, consistent with the federal rules of civil procedure with the court hearing to approve the settlement in the beginning of 2022. our dialogs with the sec and the federal reserve are ongoing and we continue to cooperate with these investigations.
additionally, the company believes it's possible we may exhaust our primary d&o coverage at some point in the fourth quarter, in which case expenses that would have otherwise been covered as insurance claims, will become a company expense. it's impossible to predict these defense costs going forward as they are highly dependent on the duration and outcome of the investigations, which are also impossible to predict. for more information on this update, please see the related disclosure in our earnings release. other than the historical expense number we provided in the earnings release, we are not in a position at this time to offer any guidance on these potential defense costs except to note that historical defense costs, including significant expenses in defense of litigations that have since settled as well as investigation subpoena production and witness cost. we remain hopeful that with each quarterly announcement, we will be in a position to announce progress toward a resolution of all disclosed matters.
with that, i would like to turn the speaking duties over to jan williams, our chief credit officer.
janice l. williams -- executive vice president of eagle bancorp, inc.; senior executive vice president and chief credit of
thank you, susan, and good morning, everyone. it's always good to present positive news, and credit continues to improve to levels we have not seen since before the pandemic. at quarter end, nonperforming assets were 31 basis points. this is down 19 basis points from the prior quarter end. at 31 basis points, you'd have to go back to the third quarter of 2018 to find a better ratio. in dollars, npas were $36 million, down from $54.5 million at the prior quarter-end. the decline in npas was primarily from payoffs of nonperforming loans, a return to accrual status for some loans and a few charge-offs.
gross charge-offs for the quarter were $2 million and net of recovery charge-offs were $1.3 million. the largest charge-off during the period was a c&i contract or credit for $1 million. in regards to the reversal of $8.2 million from the allowance for credit losses, the reversal resulted primarily from the decline in loans, but was also informed by an improvement in credit quality, which included a decline in nonperforming loans, and extraordinarily low levels of 30 to 90-day past dues. positive improvements and adjustments to both quantitative and environmental factors also contributed. for more detail, charles will be able to fill you in during the q&a.
with the reversal, the allowance for credit losses to total loans, excluding ppp loans, was 1.22%, which is down 10 basis points from the prior quarter end. even with our lower allowance for credit losses, the previously mentioned decline in nonperforming loans puts our coverage ratio of nonperforming loans at 265%, well above the 150% to 200% range where it has been for the last seven quarters. i'd also like to point out that our provision for unfunded commitments was up $716,000 this quarter and this ties in with the comments susan made earlier about funding draw delays and the increase in unfunded commitments.
with that, i'd like to turn it over to charles levingston, our chief financial officer.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, jan. for the quarter, net income was $43.6 million, which is $2.3 million more than the same period a year ago. looking at the top line, net interest income adjusted to remove the accelerated interest expense on redemption of the sub-debt was $80.4 million, slightly higher than the $79 million from the same period a year ago.
while the results are similar, net interest income for this quarter was based on average assets that are 13% higher than a year ago. the rise in assets was primarily driven by the inflow of deposits in the fourth quarter of 2020 and this past quarter. average deposits for this quarter were $9.95 billion, up $720 million versus the third quarter of 2020. for noninterest income, a year ago, the third quarter of 2020, was a record quarter for our mortgage division. so current mortgage production, while still significant, won't match that. to put it in perspective, our mortgage division had locked loans this past quarter of $280 million, which is up from the second quarter's $248 million. but both periods are well behind the record $593 million we generated a year ago when the market conditions were optimal.
additionally, in the second quarter of 2021, there was -- on a linked quarter basis, there was $2.6 million in gains associated with the origination, securitization, sale and servicing of fha loans. this bolstered noninterest income in the second quarter of 2021. it did not repeat in the third quarter of 2021. while much smaller in comparison, other noninterest income was $1.6 million for the third quarter of 2021, down from $4 million for the same period a year ago. the primary difference being the past quarter -- this past quarter, the company experienced no oreo gains, while the same quarter a year earlier, the company had gains of $1.2 million. for noninterest expenses, there was almost no difference in the total between the third quarter of '21 and '20.
for the quarter, noninterest expenses were $36.4 million compared to $36.9 for the same period a year earlier. the expense line items with the biggest changes were essentially offsetting. salary and employee benefits were up $2.8 million as a result of higher incentive bonus accruals based on the company's performance. premises and equipment were down $1.3 million as the third quarter of 2020 included a $1.7 million lease expense to adjust for asc 842, and legal, accounting and professional fees were down $1.1 million.
on the balance sheet, assets at the end of the third quarter reached a record high of $11.6 billion, up $1.5 billion from a year ago. the year-over-year increase was primarily driven by deposit inflows, which increased both investments and interest-bearing deposits with other banks. the excess liquidity generated by the influx of deposits continues to reduce our margin, which, excluding the accelerated interest expense from the sub-debt payout, the margin was 2.78% for this past quarter, down from 3.08% a year ago. we will continue our efforts to put the excess liquidity to work, but will remain prudent given the recent uptick in rates and the potential for deposit flows to slow or reverse.
a better measure of spread, absent the excess liquidity, is to look at our loan yields, which were 4.59%, absent ppp interest income, and our cost of funds, which was 35 basis points. also, while we did redeem our sub-debt on august 2nd, our cost of funds for this past quarter includes $1.3 million of accelerated interest expense from the redemption.
for ppp loans, with just $67.3 million of ppp left, which were mostly originated in mid-2020, we do not have a lot of accelerated fees and expenses remaining. we expect these loans to complete the forgiveness process over the near term. on the liability side, deposits increased $9.7 billion, up $1.5 billion from a year ago and long-term borrowings declined to $70 million as the bank redeemed $150 million of subordinated debt.
with that, i'll hand it back to susan for a short wrap up.
susan g. riel -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, charles. as we wrap up our commentary, i would like to thank all of our employees for all their hard work and their commitment to support our clients. additionally, we remain committed to a culture of respect, diversity and inclusion in both the workplace and the communities we serve.
before we open things up for questions, i would like to summarize our financial results by saying, the bank has posted its second-best quarter of earnings. npas are 31 basis points of assets, common equity is 11.5% of assets, total risk-based capital is 16.6% and we just raised the dividend for the third time this year. the bank continues to do well.
i would now like to open things up for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question will come from the line of casey whitman with piper sandler. your line is now open.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good morning.
susan g. riel -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, casey.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, casey.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
jan, maybe i'll start with you. congrats on the variable credit moves. so we saw the decline in watch loans this quarter in the release. can you provide any color on the movements within special mention or classifieds, is it safe to say that those came down as well?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president of eagle bancorp, inc.; senior executive vice president and chief credit of
there was some movement within categories as loans that had been substandard may have, at least in one case, a significant relationship was upgraded to special mention. there is a great deal of movement from out of the watch category as we had that sustained period of performance that we spoke about in our last earnings call. those were the loans that had had multiple deferrals and wanted to wait six months under regular payment structure in order to move them off of the watch list. so that's predominantly the reason for the drop. and the improvement did come in the area of classified loans as those were reduced, and in some cases, moved to the special mention category.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay, understood. and then, just looking at the big reduction in nonperformer this quarter, are those loans that returned to performing status or are they out of the bank in any particular industry?
janice l. williams -- executive vice president of eagle bancorp, inc.; senior executive vice president and chief credit of
performing and -- what -- you might recall that initially what we did with loans that had had a multiple covid deferral situation that's beyond 90 days, we moved them all on to the watch list to track them. and once those deferral periods were over and they had achieved six months of regular payments, we were able to move a significant number of those loans back into the regular past portfolio.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay, understood. maybe i'll just ask one more kind of bigger picture question. just given the increase in deposits and all the liquidity you guys have on the balance sheet, kind of what are your high-level thoughts on your plans to deploy that liquidity in the near-term? could we see increases in the securities portfolio or how should we think about that liquidity over the next couple of quarters?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. yes, certainly, an accelerated pace of deployment into the investment securities portfolio is likely. we've -- as susan mentioned in her comments, as well the unfunded commitments, there is a pipeline for construction funding that we expect will also absorb some of that excess liquidity, and then, additional loan funding, as we're getting looks at deals and fully funded deals, hopefully.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
and as you're getting -- i think, you mentioned getting more competitive on pricing and the higher balance of unfunded commitments, where are like new production yields coming in now versus last quarter?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. for the third quarter, we've seen -- we saw pricing on -- the coupon on the loan closer to 4%. whether or not that holds is a question, but that's where we were in the third quarter.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and then, again that's the coupon, we will add deferred fees and costs to boost these all.
casey whitman -- piper sandler -- analyst
understood. thank you.
susan g. riel -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, casey.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, casey.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from the line of catherine mealor with kbw. your line is now open.
catherine mealor -- keefe, bruyette and woods, inc. -- analyst
thanks, good morning.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, catherine.
susan g. riel -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, catherine.
catherine mealor -- keefe, bruyette and woods, inc. -- analyst
maybe as a follow-up to casey's question, just thinking about balance sheet composition, so securities is at 15% of earning assets, cash is now 23%. so i know, we would all love to put cash more into loans because that's higher yields, but as we think about how much of cash could go into securities, is there a max of how big you would allow the securities portfolio to grow as a percentage of your balance sheet?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i, again, want to be prudent about that and as we talk about the potential for liquidity to potentially reverse at some point and i'm mindful of that, although, obviously we're flush with it. short answer to your question is, i'd be comfortable going higher, certainly, on the investment portfolio, but i don't necessarily have a limit, but there is going to be a comfortable cushion on the cash side in the event that we see an outflow.
catherine mealor -- keefe, bruyette and woods, inc. -- analyst
okay. that helps. that makes sense. and then, how about on just the outlook for loan growth? is there -- i mean, is there a growth target that you think you could provide for us for next year and maybe kind of talk anecdotally about what kind of opportunities you're seeing and where you think the most growth could come from? and then, maybe just kind of some local geographical commentary will be helpful. i feel like the growth has been a little bit slower in the dc-virginia area versus some other markets we're seeing at least in the southeast. so just curious if there is anything that you think is happening from a regional perspective that's driving that slower growth. thanks.
susan g. riel -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, catherine. i do think we've been seeing a lot more opportunities lately than we have seen in quite some time, significantly this year, in the construction area. construction in the area is up quite a bit, so i'm not really seeing much of a lag. the difference right now, i think, is that there is so much liquidity out there that a lot of these projects have a tremendous amount of liquidity going in ahead of the draws. so there is going to be more delay in pulling down on construction lending and that could also be exacerbated by issues with the supply chain. but, i think, overall, that's a type of lending we're going to see impact us going forward. also seeing a lot of m&a, which i think is typical pretty much across the country right now as there is consolidation in various industries. so that's also giving us some opportunities. government contracting, again, is an opportunity area for us to grow as well. i think we're being quite competitive on pricing, provided we're getting a risk return on assets that's appropriate to the bank. so overall, i have cautious optimism.
charles, do you want to talk about liquidity a little bit or?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
look -- yeah, again, i mean, the notion that there is a lot of dollars -- way more dollars chasing a good pipeline of deals. again, just echoing your comments. that's really the challenge that's presented to us. and certainly, as it relates to pricing, as we grow.
susan g. riel -- president and chief executive officer
and i think the other thing that's encouraging is that the housing market here is still extraordinarily strong. there is a shortfall in housing in the dc area that's expected to take us several years at a minimum to catch up with the population growth that we've had and the delays caused by covid in certain projects. i think there is unmet demand out there that still needs to be handled.
catherine mealor -- keefe, bruyette and woods, inc. -- analyst
great, helpful. thank you so much.
susan g. riel -- president and chief executive officer
have a great day.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, catherine.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from the line of brody preston with stephens inc. your line is now open.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, brody.
susan g. riel -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey, i just had a question on the sub-debt real quick. just given that it -- you all redeemed that early in the quarter, is -- has that worked its way into the interest expense yet? so if i kind of look at the $3 million you reported for long-term borrowings and back out that $1.3 million accelerated interest expense, is that a good place to start for the fourth quarter on that run rate?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. we redeemed it on august 2nd, so you've got a day in there of the interest expense associated with that larger sub-debt. but yeah, that's a pretty good place to start.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay, all right, great. and then, just on the core loan yield and it's probably playing into some of the loan growth, loan runoff you all have had, but it's holding up pretty well. and so, i guess, when i think about what you all are originating in new production, understanding that it's not outpacing some of the runoff you're seeing, but what are you all getting for new origination yields?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so again, i think on the third quarter, we saw coupons of close to 4%, on a yield-average basis and what was the new loans that were originated and booked and funded for the third quarter, and then, there is obviously some component of deferred fees and costs that are added on to that to result in a yield slightly above that. again, whether or not that holds is a question. and again, things are very competitive, so that's where we were for the third quarter.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got it. okay. and susan, i heard you earlier about the lumpiness that can occur on the fha fee income side. but i guess, as i think about going forward annually, do you feel like the pace that you've done year-to-date is where you would shake out in the upcoming years going forward?
susan g. riel -- president and chief executive officer
yes, we do. we are optimistic on that side too. there is lot on our books that we expect to close. so we're moving along in a positive way on that.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay, great. and then, on the securities portfolio, charles maybe, do you happen to know what the effective duration of that portfolio is?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. effective duration of 3.8.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay. and then, my last one -- yeah, go ahead, charles.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sorry, just to provide a little bit more color. i mean, that's -- that number has certainly peaked up a little bit, right? and there is more price risk just like there are more price risks in a lot of investment portfolios these days, and many of our competitors seeking some kind of return.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got it. and then, my last one is just on expenses, particularly the salaries and employee benefits. could you remind me -- i wasn't able to find it in my notes, but are there seasonal increases that typically occur in the third quarter? and so, i guess, will this $22.1 million kind of be the new run rate going forward?
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, what i'd say on that is typically there is -- as you approach the end of the year and there is more clarity about individual performances of -- at the bank and the bank's performance overall, we have a better sense of what that annual incentive expense is going to be and make accruals toward that. so, yes, that is the nature of the way in which we are booking some of those. and obviously, this year was inordinately good with a lot of the reversals that we had in the allowance and in some -- the sale of ppp loans and other areas where we've seen some good benefit. so yeah, that -- hopefully that provides you a little bit insight there.
brody preston -- stephens inc. -- analyst
awesome. thank you very much everyone for taking my questions. i appreciate it.
charles d. levingston -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, sir.
