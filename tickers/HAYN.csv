gentlemen, thank you for your remarks. [operator instructions] we'll hear first this morning from edward marshall with sidoti & company. please go ahead.
edward marshall -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hey guys, good morning. how are you?
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer & director
good.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance, chief financial officer and treasurer
good morning, ed.
edward marshall -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hey. so i wanted to first touch on the max. some of the engine suppliers are talking about finally ramping down to 42 [phonetic] from 52 [phonetic]. i know it's hard for you guys to see that in your volumes. as i look at backlog, as i think about kind of the performance you've had in aerospace, do you think that at least for the first quarter or two, you'll start to see that impact in your material [indecipherable]? any comments around that?
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer & director
sure. ed, as you know, we spend a lot of time on discussing the 737 max. we spent a lot of time with our customers going through it. you know, the of recertification process continues to move along. we all know that if there is not good news, that is a significant issue for the supply chain as we move forward. but with that said, honestly, we've not seen a significant change in our order book related to the 737 max situation. this was emphasized at a series of customer meetings at both airframe and engine in late october, and the conversations continue to be very positive, and the conversations continue to be about making sure we continue to supply.
with that said, obviously, if there is news in the industry, which is going to either keep it low or even reduce it further, that's something we're all going to have to deal with, but we're not dealing with that right now. we feel good about where we are. the backlog -- we typically -- when you look at our q4 versus our q3, we've looked at the last five years, and in each of those five years, we've reduced our backlog. so don't look at that as unusual, and continue to get comments from customers that in the current state of events, they want us to keep pushing forward.
edward marshall -- sidoti & company -- analyst
and staying on aerospace for a second, i think in your prepared remarks you talked about pricing above base raw material pricing. and i'm curious if you can attribute any of that to the freed up capacity within your aerospace cold finish?
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer & director
yeah, i think part of it's that, but i really believe that from the aerospace perspective, haynes provides a high-value differentiated product that's in the technical support, that's in the inventory resupply, that's in the small quantities that we're able to deliver, it's even in the cut part. so i think a big part of our ability to get price is, we truly believe in aerospace, which as you know is 53% of our mix, that we have a high-value differentiated product and we feel very strongly we need to be paid for that. and we're very comfortable in talking to our customers about that. so that's a big part of it. i also look forward to when the max does come back, and there is a pull -- transactional pull, then hopefully, we can continue to drive our lead times down and take advantage of that, not only from the volume standpoint, but from the pricing standpoint.
edward marshall -- sidoti & company -- analyst
so, just if i understand you correctly, it sounded like it was more about the initiatives that you set the price -- the product appropriately as opposed to maybe just having the available capacity. is that...?
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer & director
i think part one is pricing for value, part two is, as we've expanded our tube in our cold-finish flat and plate capacity, it's allowed us to secure more. so, yes.
edward marshall -- sidoti & company -- analyst
got it. the r&d swell in the quarter, i mean, is there something unique that's going on in this particular quarter? i mean, it was up, looks like 25% or so sequentially.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance, chief financial officer and treasurer
it's funny, we spent a lot of time talking about cost reduction and what we need to do, but i am much more interested and we're much more interested in variable cost reduction. over the last couple of years in research and development, we've lost a couple of our high-end engineers, and quite frankly, some of our technicians. and the drop that has occurred in the past, has been because the loss of those people and our drive has been to pull that number back up. so what you're seeing now, is approaching what should be more typical for us. i have been amazed both as an outsider and now as an insider, by the technical development capabilities of this company. it's the backbone of what we do and this is one area i want to spend more than less, and continue to do that.
edward marshall -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. that sounds good. could you quantify the impact maybe from cobalt and the higher production costs in the quarter? and just higher cobalt or the change in -- i'm sorry, the change in cobalt also impact your volumes as well as customers kind of assess?
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer & director
yeah, i can start with the first part of that, i mean the -- it's a bit of a difficult number to quantify. so what we would say is, really roughly 1% have been impacting our margin. and that's the combination of both cobalt and the drever higher cost impacting the fourth quarter. so we would say roughly 1%, maybe slightly higher, but right around that range.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance, chief financial officer and treasurer
and ed, i don't think the cobalt pricing drop impacted volume. i think these are items our customers need. so i really don't think there is any material change to volume requirements.
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer & director
and as i mentioned going into 2020, this headwind really alleviates. everything seems to be more neutral on cobalt and the cost that we see from the drever outage, those are pretty much fleshed through the system. so, those headwinds alleviate. we have new headwinds coming up that i outlined, but moving on to 2020.
edward marshall -- sidoti & company -- analyst
and then if i do the math quickly, i mean it looks like the new cost offset by the absence of these two impacts in q4?
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer & director
roughly, roughly. i mean, the insurance will be mostly on cost of sales, which is a $2 million increase over the whole year. so just a quarter of that if you're looking at a quarter, but also the pension and post-retirement, most of that is below operating income, but there is a portion that is above, that will squeeze the margin a bit.
edward marshall -- sidoti & company -- analyst
right. final one from me is, just kind of what you -- as your operations improve, you're obviously generating more cash. you had pretty good comments about that. there's not a lot of need for major capex. i'm curious, what's the focus of the balance sheet now as you're starting to kind of put that cash back on the balance sheet in a pretty decent sum?
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer & director
well as far as capital allocation, we're always talking about that at the board level. so we certainly think about improving gross margins and generating more cash. and then what we do with that, we certainly continue to fund our pension plan and we think about what other capital allocation opportunities are out there. so really, the table -- everything's on the table as far as options at the board level.
david van bibber -- controller and chief accounting officer
i'm thrilled we're generating cash, i'm thrilled net income is leading to cash generation, makes a lot of sense. and then from that point forward, we'll do whatever makes the most sense for shareholder value.
edward marshall -- sidoti & company -- analyst
perfect. guys, thanks. thanks very much. i appreciate the comments.
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer & director
thanks, ed.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance, chief financial officer and treasurer
thanks, ed.
operator
[operator instructions] we will move next to chris olin with longbow research.
chris olin -- longbow research -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning.
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer & director
hi, chris. how are you?
chris olin -- longbow research -- analyst
i'm good, i'm good. thanks mike. a little bit of -- i guess, my first question is on the contracts and the transactional pricing increases that you talked about. i was wondering if you could put a little bit more color around that, maybe in terms of what type of realization you guys are getting and maybe how much of the aerospace business is going to be reset for 2020?
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance, chief financial officer and treasurer
as far as pricing, we feel very strongly that the overwhelming majority of the product [technical issues] in aerospace is our high-value differentiated product we started last year. and if we're 53%, that's roughly 10 million pounds and we're going after all of that as the contracts mature, both last year and this year to increase [technical issues]. but again, my point of emphasis here is we're talking about price increases beyond raw material pushes. these are pure bottom line increases. we also on the transactional side, are doing the same thing and are pushing that and continue to push that. we've had some cost pushes, for example, refractories and molds, and our goal is not only to offset those through transactional and contract price increases, but go beyond just offsetting them.
chris olin -- longbow research -- analyst
is the component of the transactional business moving higher?
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance, chief financial officer and treasurer
well, when we do measure, what we consider transactional is, we get an order and we can ship that order within a month or two. so it's less than a mill lead time. so i would not say it's moving higher. we do track that it was about $23 million of this quarter, which is around 18% or so, approximately 18%. so it's been holding pretty steady across the year. if you look back a few years ago, that was a higher number. so we have shifted a bit more into the lta and non-transactional, but it's holding pretty steady this year.
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer & director
marlin losch and his team over the last couple of years, just following up to what dan said, have looked to tie up more and more business in ltas. and -- so that's why the number is down from where it was, but i really think if we do see the 737 max come back and start to approach 57% [phonetic], that will have the opportunity for more transactional business and my mantra here is, the shorter the lead time, the higher the price can go, so it can be good for us.
chris olin -- longbow research -- analyst
okay, good. you guys did a pretty good job talking about the max net risk or impact. is there any overlap with the 787 or maybe the 777x? i was thinking maybe there is some issues with arcadia or any kind of tubing or push back?
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer & director
no, right now we have fairly steady demand. there is obviously puts and takes in the industry. i will tell you that arcadia, on the titanium side, their lead times, much to my chagrin, are continuing to push out, which means demand is extremely strong for titanium, which is all airframe. and so that's going well and we've seen no pullback whatsoever, as far as the demand for titanium tubing for us.
chris olin -- longbow research -- analyst
okay. and my last question is just -- and i realize it's not a one-to-one relationship, but we've been watching the rig count fall now for a number of months. and i'm wondering if that has any type of impact or any -- does that change your visibility at all in terms like the cpi business?
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance, chief financial officer and treasurer
while we are somewhat tied to kind of an indirect connection to the oil industry. so that could have an impact on chemical companies if they see rig counts going down and the oil prices weakening. we did have that impact us a few years ago when the oil market collapsed and that had a -- we called it a spillover impact on our cpi business. so it's not direct, and it's not significant at this point even with the rig count going down slightly.
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer & director
and chris, what tends to move the needle for us in cpis are our special projects and we're anticipating continued growth this year in our special project business.
chris olin -- longbow research -- analyst
okay, thanks guys.
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer & director
thank you.

and now for opening remarks and introductions, i am pleased to turn the floor over to controller and chief accounting officer, mr. david van bibber. please go ahead, sir.
david van bibber -- controller and chief accounting officer

with that, let me turn the call over to mike.
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer & director
good morning, everyone. with the close of fiscal '19, i'm pleased to say that we've moved from words to actions and from plans to results. while we have so much more that we believe we can do with volumes, costs, pricing, cash generation and margins, i'm very proud of our team and all that they've accomplished in fiscal '19. we've gained significant momentum over the past year. our employees focus on our monthly metrics and the actions required to change this business have been excellent.
a few highlights related to both q4 and fiscal 2019. the depths of thinking and the actions under way to implement proactive safety initiatives throughout the entire company have been excellent. we must continue to improve our safety performance and our employees' actions are a significant step in the right direction. our cash flow has been positive for eight of the last 12 months. we increased cash over $21 million in fiscal '19, of which $9 million was from q4. inventory was reduced by $10.3 million in q4.
our fourth quarter gross margin finished at 16.4%. this much improved result is despite the well-documented cobalt price collapse and the cost and yield issues associated with the planned furnace rebuild, both of which are now behind us. these numbers are also beyond anything we've seen in recent years.
as i stated last quarter, our goal is to move from worst to first in gross margin percent in our slice of the industry. we continue to make progress toward that goal. our gross margin percentage increase in each quarter of fiscal '19 from 10.6% in q1 to 11.5% in q2, 14.4% in q3 and as just noted, 16.4% in q4. our pricing actions and cost reductions are real and have had a significant impact on our bottom line. our price increase [technical issues] changes, therefore contributing to our improving margins.
on the cost reduction side, very positive results are being seen across all of our manufacturing locations. our efforts to create competitive advantage within -- via the supply chain -- excuse me, our efforts to create competitive advantage via the supply of high-value differentiated product has great focus and emphasis; first, in our r&d labs through alloy development; next, with our sales, marketing and application staff, who work closely with our customers to look for solutions to their materials-related issues; and finally, in our distribution facilities where we continue to grow our cut part business.
our company also made it back to the long-talked about 20 million pounds in fiscal '19, despite the loss of 3 million pounds of large frame igt business from our 2012 peak. as far as our backlog, it did decrease this quarter, but we ended fiscal year '19 with $19.2 million greater than at the beginning of our fiscal year. we believe that there is some minor rebalancing of inventories occurring in some segments of supply chain. we all look forward to the 737 max issues being resolved. we expect demand to strengthen once the build schedules are increased. also impacting the backlog during the quarter, are typically lighter bookings in the summer months along with shipments of some specialty application projects into the chemical processing market, which were booked in prior quarters.
as for the details of the quarter, volume shipped in the quarter was 5.4 million pounds, our highest quarterly volume in 4.5 years. the strong quarterly shipment performance put volume for fiscal '19 at 20 million, alleviating the margin headwinds associated with lower volumes. the prior three year's volumes were at lower levels with each year being between 18 million to 18.4 million.
net revenues were $129.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal ' 19 and $490.2 million for the year. net revenue for fiscal '19 was 12.6% higher than fiscal '18. each of our three major markets of aerospace, chemical processing and industrial gas turbines had revenue increases of greater than 13% each.
average selling price in fiscal '19 was $24.46 per pound, inclusive of our other revenue, up about 3.4% over last year's $23.66 per pound. this average selling price increase was led by the aerospace market where the average selling price increased 8.9% in fiscal '19 as compared to fiscal '18.
with that, let me move to our key markets. sales of the aerospace market accounted for 53% of our revenue at $68.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. this represents an increase of 11.3% from $61.4 million in the same period last year due to a 5.9% increase in average selling price per pound combined with a 5.1% increase in volume. we successfully initiated price increases in the aerospace market for both transactional business and with renewed customer agreements.
looking at the full fiscal year, volume and net revenue shipped into the aerospace market during fiscal year '19 was 10.3 million and $258.1 million, the highest in the company's history. backlog in aerospace decreased sequentially from q3 to q4 by 6.1%. however, our aerospace backlog over the fiscal year is up 10.6%.
sales for the chemical processing market accounted for 21% of our revenue at $27.8 million in the fourth quarter. this represents a solid increase of 19.2% from $23.3 million in the same period last year due to a 14.3% increase in volume, combined with a 4.2% increase in the average selling price per pound.
we improved shipments of specialty application projects, as well as better base business shipments. our backlog dollars in cpi decreased sequentially from q3 to q4 by 32.2%, primarily due to the shipment of special project orders from our backlog.
sales for the industrial gas turbine market accounted for 12% of revenue at $15.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. this represents an increase of 3.2% from $15.3 million for the same period of last year due to an increase in volume of 29.9%, nearly offset by a decrease in average selling price per pound of 20.6%. the decrease in average selling price is mix related. the increase in volume is primarily attributed both to an increase in small and medium frame engine builds combined with a resupply of material into the supply chain.
demand for the large frame turbines in the energy market continues to be weak. our backlog dollars in industrial gas turbines decreased sequentially from q3 to q4 by 2.9%. however, for the year, the backlog has increased 32.9% coming off of very low levels.
during the last quarter call, i mentioned that we do see meaningful potential opportunities for market share growth for haynes in our igt market. i am pleased to report that we recently received an order in november for roughly 100,000 pounds in the igt market, representing the start of market share growth for us.
finally, our other markets and other revenue accounted for 14% of revenue at $17.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. this represents a decrease of 20.4% from $22.3 million in the same period of fiscal '18. however, looking at the full fiscal year, revenue has increased 8%, primarily from an 11.5% increase in other markets pounds sold compared to fiscal '18. our backlog dollars in other markets increased sequentially from q3 to q4 by 14.4% during the quarter.
with that detail on the markets, let me now turn it over to dan for more details on our financials.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance, chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you, mike. fiscal year 2019 was a positive year financially, ending of the year with our highest quarterly volumes shipped in 4.5 years, as well as our highest quarterly gross margin percentage in three years. overall volumes shipped in fiscal 2019 increased 8.9% over last year. net revenues increased 12.6% and gross margin dollars increased 17.3% in spite of two significant margin headwinds. the two i'm referring to are, the fall in the market price of cobalt, which had a significant margin compression in the third and fourth quarters. and second, the impact from the cold finishing outage and upgrade. both of these headwinds are expected to be alleviated moving into fiscal 2020.
positive impacts on gross margin dollars in fiscal '19 include; one, higher overall volumes shipped achieving our goal of 20 million pounds; two, price increases beyond raw material changes primarily in the aerospace market; and three, cost reductions that include improved productivity, better scrap management, reduced melt costs and many other manufacturing cost reduction initiatives; and number four, improved sales levels of the specialty application projects, which were $9.6 million in the fourth quarter, increasing from the $5.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
our focus on increasing volumes, improving profitability has gained traction and positively impacted results with gross margins improving each quarter sequentially over fiscal 2019, despite headwinds. the fourth quarter gross margin as a percentage of sales was 16.4%. these efforts are continuous and we expect to keep pushing our performance higher.
moving down the p&l, sg&a including research and technical costs were $12.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. this is $1.2 million higher than the same period of last year, which related to incentive compensation that included a prior-year expense reversal from stock comp forfeitures and it's also related to foreign currency changes. we expect sg&a, including research and technical costs, in fiscal 2020 to be approximately $49 million to $51 million.
non-operating retirement benefit expense in the p&l was $879,000 compared to last year's q4 of $1.9 million, driven by the prior-year favorable valuation at 09/30/2018. as i mentioned last quarter, we were concerned about the lower discount rates to be used in the valuation of 09/30/2019 which determines the 2020 expense levels. this concern was warranted as the discount rate declined, which significantly increased our liability on the 09/30/2019 balance sheet and is expected to increase fiscal 2020 expense by $4.8 million as compared to fiscal 2019. approximately $3.4 million of this increase is expected to be reflected in non-operating retirement benefit expense in the p&l, and the remaining $1.4 million increase is expected to impact the cost of sales.
while on the subject of fiscal 2020 expense, let me also mention another significant item that is expected to increase. the market for property insurance has tightened dramatically. there is much less capacity available, which is resulting in an additional amount of expense of $2 million on less coverage, and is expected to be recognized primarily in cost of sales in fiscal 2020.
now back to fiscal 2019. our effective tax rate for this quarter was 22.1%, which is lower than last quarter, primarily due to reversing valuation adjustments on foreign tax credits, partially offset by the tax impact of certain types of stock compensation forfeitures that occurred in q4 and adjustments to our accrual for global intangible low tax income or gilti tax.
last year we incurred several tax adjustments stemming from the tax reform act and the tax impact from special items. to see these details, i refer you to the reconciliation of non-gaap measures table in the back of the press release.
and to finish off the p&l, net income of this quarter was $6 million or $0.48 per diluted share and the full-year fiscal 2019 net income was $9.7 million or $0.78 per diluted share. backlog decreased 7.7% over the fourth quarter coming off the june 30, 2019 levels that were the highest level since 2012. over the fiscal year, backlog increased 8.9% to $235.2 million at september 30, 2019. this is the highest fiscal year-end backlog since september 30, 2011.
outlook for next quarter. as we look into fiscal year 2020, we see strong momentum stemming from the continued implementation of our focus initiatives. we are optimistic about improved results in the long term. this optimism remains in spite of the uncertainty related to the 737 max and global trade tensions, as well as expected higher pension costs due to low interest rates and higher cost of property insurance. the first fiscal quarter of the year is typically seasonally impacted by holidays, planned maintenance outages and customers managing their calendar year-end balance sheets. based on that, we expect revenues and earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 to be lower than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. however, revenue and earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 are expected to be better than the prior-year first quarter of fiscal 2019.
moving on to liquidity, we have zero borrowings on our credit facility at september 30, 2019 and cash was $31 million, representing a $21 million increase over the fiscal year. net cash provided by operating activities was $43 million in fiscal 2019, driven by stronger profitability, combined with lower cost and inventory in a period of rising sales volumes. normally rising volumes would increase inventory and consume cash. thus, i believe it is a notable point that we generated cash this fiscal year. also contributing to cash generation was controlling capital expenditures. capital spending was $10 million in fiscal 2019 as compared to our depreciation level of $18.9 million. the forecast for capital spending in fiscal 2020 is $12 million.
in conclusion, we remain committed to continuing to push profitability higher as we focus on the execution of our strategic improvement initiatives. new headwinds are expected in fiscal 2020 as noted earlier, but also new opportunities are expected to further implement these initiatives focused on improving volume, product mix,, pricing and cost.
mike, with that, i will now turn the discussion back over to you.
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer & director
thanks, dan. it has been an exciting year as we have launched and implemented our series of focused initiatives designed to unlock the potential of our company. our goal is to grow this business by increasing revenues, profitability and cash flow, while continuing to be our customer's provider of choice for high-performance alloys, technical support and value-added processes.
with that, jim, let's open the call up to questions.

operator
thank you. the floor is open for questions. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from edward marshall from sidoti & company. go ahead, edward.
edward marshall -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. very nice job on the gross margin there.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
good morning, ed. thank you.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
thank you.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
i'm curious, you've got property insurance, pension -- higher pension costs, lower raw materials and the impact of that flow through in the gross margin. i'm curious, as we talk about breakeven points, what do you think the new level is from a volume perspective as it runs through your mill? a lot of variables there to consider. yeah, it's a good question. i mean, we have previously mentioned we need to get to that 5 million per -- 5 million pounds per quarter level to really alleviate that headwind, and we were certainly below that this quarter at 4.3 million and still generating $3.3 million in earnings. so we would expect our new breakeven point to be somewhat lower than the 4.3 million pounds. exactly what that is, i'm not sure. you mentioned raw materials, this quarter we had a really an increase in raw materials. it's since decreased to current levels, but that increase had only really a slight tailwind to margins and helped margins, but really only a moderate or slight level.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
it's mike. for us the key -- and we've talked about this for quite a while, the key is truly finding ways to change this business by increasing our gross margin and driving, as you said, the breakeven down. the large majority of this is related to the price increases and cost reductions, which are occurring throughout the company. so we're proud of that, and we're thrilled with where it's taken us, given the 4.2 million pounds that we shipped.
edward marshall -- sidoti & company -- analyst
got it. and maybe i can ask it a different way then. maybe you talked about best-in-class margins, and i'm curious, what are you targeting not necessarily from a roll number perspective, but maybe from timing? and then ultimately, where do you think breakeven points could go as volume -- as your business improves, your cost scenario improves?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
i don't think we've seen the end of, where we can go on gross margins. i think there is room to continue to improve them. obviously, we have some headwinds related to absorption at the volume levels we have. but as i've said before, to be best-in-class, we've got to be north of where we are now at 17.3 [phonetic], and continue to look percentage point by percentage point increase. we are far from done in what we're trying to do related to cost reduction throughout our operations and even eke out incremental price increases even in this environment. so there is more out there. we've got to get some volume back, obviously as the markets cooperate.
edward marshall -- sidoti & company -- analyst
you have a -- you talked about aero volumes this year, and i'm curious, when i think about the trajectory of aero volumes in 2020, do you have a sense as to what the impact might be for haynes as we move through from a volume perspective?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
yeah, let me give you some facts. we've obviously spent a fair amount of time on this, and honestly as everyone says, we have also stayed very close to our customers and have tried to understand where they are. and they're still learning. they are still trying to figure this out both on the airframe and on the engine side. but when you take a step back and look at the max and the impact, our estimate is the max is about 8% of our volume. and when we say that, obviously, we know fundamentally there are very good trends in the industry. you've seen them as i have with where they -- where airbus has gone 2018 to 2019, where the a320 has gone with the 777 now coming online, even with the gen ge9x, which are -- with our proprietary alloy on it. so we've got good stuff going there.
but going back to the point, we've got 8% estimated volume in 737. in addition to that, and i referenced it on the call, pratt & whitney 1100 engine again to the a320 proprietary alloy, we were trying to catch up for probably a year and make sure we did a great job in supply. well, we did a great job and now that supply -- or the supply chain there is full. but that -- as we move into this calendar year, that will drop off also. we know what's happened with the lead production.
what we've seen with our customers is some cautiousness and some cash conservation. so our customers are saying beyond the 737 if they have platforms with full supply chain, they will pull back a little on that. the offset to that of course is military and defense is good, mro continues to be strong. so it's -- we certainly are going to see an impact. when we look at our business overall, we did $105 -- $108.5 million in the quarter, and typically rough number 23% plus or minus of our sales are in that q1. so it gives you a feel for where we'll be.
edward marshall -- sidoti & company -- analyst
got it. thanks for that color. one from me, you're generating earnings again. you've done that for a couple of quarters now, and that's leading to better cash. you talked about some inventory initiatives and some receivable kind of pluses and minuses around your receivables. but i'm looking at as we start to generate more cash in -- some may say you're slightly under-levered from this point. is there any change to maybe the capital allocation, what you might do from using your balance sheet a little bit too kind of spur your growth. any thoughts there?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
a couple of things there. i can't talk about capital allocation unless i mention the fact that we did build $23 million of inventory in the quarter. and dan spelled out in his script the reasons why. and we've got to continue to find ways as we get a handle on the business and the volumes that we'll be dealing with in driving that down. and i'm confident we will be able to do that as we move forward.
as from capital allocation standpoint, number 1 priority for me is to look ahead, try to look around the corner and prepare ourselves when the aerospace business gets out of this having flexible short-term inventory available. so we've invested some money as our volumes have dropped in putting inventory in, in what we call our supermarket. so we have short lead time, potentially higher price opportunities when this thing begins to turn around. and so that's number 1.
number 2, we're always looking to make sure that we enhance what our core competency is, which is our technical strength. so bringing in the people -- and we talked about this in the last call. bringing the people we need to bring in to make sure that we continue to maintain our lead, what we are doing related to our alloy and our market development. beyond that, obviously, we've got the pension, and we and the board look at the pension every day. and then beyond that, obviously, we will work with the board and try to determine whatever is best for shareholders we will look to do.
edward marshall -- sidoti & company -- analyst
great. thanks for your comments, mike, dan. i appreciate it. thank you so much.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
thank you. thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from michael leshock from keybanc capital market. go ahead, michael.
michael, are you on mute?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
kat, we're not hearing anything on our own.
operator
yeah, i'm -- he must be on mute. [operator instructions] michael?
michael leshock -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hello.
operator
oh, there you are. okay.
michael leshock -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. sorry about that. so firstly, i just wanted to ask about the magnitude of the nickel price tailwind in the first quarter to gross margins? and kind of what you're forecasting there to see in 2q assuming prices remain around the levels they're at right now?
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
right. for us, being a mill and service centers and global service centers, generally, we're long and nickel. so an increase in nickel which happened from the quarter we're talking about here would be a bit of a tailwind and expansion of margins. but really it went up for such a short time, that's a pretty small impact for this quarter. we measured it at well under $1 million. so since then, prices have declined. nickel, i think, is now around the $5.75 [phonetic] level, at least it was yesterday. so that would likely unravel as well, but still a very small negligible amount on our earnings and earnings per share. does that help?
michael leshock -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. yeah. and then you mentioned you're seeing some of the adjustments in the supply chain outside of the 737 max. can you provide any more color around what you're alluding to there or if there are any specific platforms more prominently associated with the shift that you're seeing in the supply chain?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
sure. couple of things on our end. i mentioned this when i was responding to ed. we have proprietary alloy in the pratt & whitney engine, which is going in the a320. and that -- we are now in a position where the supply chain of our customer is fairly full. so that is something which is a temporary issue, which will bounce back early in this calendar year. then the other thing in general terms, obviously, we're not supplying directly to the engine manufacturers or to the airframe manufacturers. we're supplying to customers that have products going in the various platforms.
and what we've seen from them is a concern on what will be coming with 737. so they are a bit more cautious about what else they have. everybody for the past 1.5 years, 2 years [phonetic] has been catching or has been running to catch up to make sure their inventory supply chains are full. they've done that. and so they are being a little more cautious across platforms, not necessary -- not necessarily a specific product. just starting to bleed off some of their inventory and their supply chains.
michael leshock -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then looking at your other markets segment, there was very strong pricing you realized there in the quarter. could you talk a little bit about what products drove that increase in pricing, and if you view that sustainable going forward?
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
yeah. that market, obviously -- other markets category have many different and diverse submarkets to it. so really when you see changes in average selling price there, it's likely more related to product mix than it is pricing. i mean, certainly we're always pushing pricing on our high-value differentiated products. and certainly anything with a contract, not so much in other markets, but a lot of annual contracts come due here in january. so we'll certainly be pushing it there as well. but in other markets, it's really a mix issue more than price increases.
michael leshock -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. and then just lastly from me. any long-term aerospace contacts -- or contracts that are on the radar that might be coming up for renewal or in the negotiation process?
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
we have contracts that come up throughout the year for us. typically, january is the heaviest period for us. we've negotiated those contracts. we feel good about where we've ended up related to pricing on those. but this is an ongoing process for us and nothing out of the ordinary. so we'll just keep pushing along, and working very hard not to make sure -- to make sure our pricing momentum continues.
michael leshock -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. thanks guys.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
thank you, michael.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
thank you.
operator
and we have ed marshall again from sidoti & company. go ahead, edward.
ed, are you live?
edward marshall -- sidoti & company -- analyst
i'm sorry, that's a mute function that i forgot. in quarters past, you provided kind of some color or some granularity around the backlog dollars. i'm curious if you can kind of talk about, so i can get a gauge on the order book mainly between the three different segments and how the components may have grown or slowed in backlog in the fourth quarter -- in the first quarter? if you have that detail?
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
yeah, i mean we kind of outlined a bit in mike's script you. you -- as i mentioned as well, the big increase that we saw was in the industrial gas turbine market. so that had a pretty substantial increase in the backlog, and that is really a market that's coming off the bottom. so we're seeing some signs of life there, especially in the larger frame engines, which in our past calls, we've been pretty pessimistic on the large frame power generation, and that seems to be having a little more improvement than we've seen. and some of the small frame, medium frame is slowing down a bit, but of course offsetting that is a large frame. so that went up pretty dramatically.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
before we go on, just a point of color i met yesterday with one of our sales guys, and obviously, we go through the markets, and what's going on. and for the first time since i've been here, when i brought up large frame igt his eyes lit up and talked about some potential opportunity. so we're at the bottom. we're bouncing off the bottom. but it's good to hear some positive comments. sorry, dan. go ahead.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
that's fine. and aerospace went down slightly, 1.4% backlog in dollars, kind of offset by other markets went up 1%, and cpi down 4%, and i think that's related to what we've been speaking here about the china retaliatory tariffs and all that. and we certainly have our eyes open to the coronavirus and what that may due to the markets. obviously, we're not really pulling that much product from china, but we're more shipping into china. but if the overall economy of china slows that would be a headwind to us, but we're keeping our eyes on that as well.
edward marshall -- sidoti & company -- analyst
got it. and to mike's previous question about the other markets. would the decline [phonetic] there be represented -- would that represent less flue-gas desulfurization? i mean would that improve the mix dollars per pound that's being shipped in that business? you said -- i think you said in the press release that you saw less of that content.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
yeah. fgd for us has the potential to have some volume, but at very, very low margin. so we continue to look at that market to understand if we can continue to find ways to reduce our costs. but that is a -- when it's in here, it's higher volume and it's a very low margin.
edward marshall -- sidoti & company -- analyst
got it. thanks again, guys. i appreciate it.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
thank you, ed.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
thanks.

good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the haynes international first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
at this time, it is my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, david van bibber, controller and chief accounting officer. sir, the floor is yours.
david van bibber -- controller and chief accounting officer

with that, let me turn the call over to mike.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
good morning. haynes has had great momentum for the past year, including above average revenue growth in our slice of the industry, a meaningful improvement in gross margin percentage and significantly improved profitability and cash flow. our initiatives related to safety, pricing, cost, volume, cash and overall business process development continued to show excellent progress with meaningful improvements in our performance.
based on the actions taken and the results driven by our team at haynes, we accomplished the following very significant items. our safety rates have continued to improve. we completed calendar year 2019 with an osha recordable rate well below that of calendar 2018. we've lowered our earnings breakeven point significantly by improving pricing and reducing costs, generating $3.3 million in earnings in our first quarter of fiscal 2020, despite shipping only 4.2 million pounds in the quarter.
over the past five quarters, our sequential gross margin as a percentage of net sales rose from 10.6% in q1 of fiscal 2019 to 11.5% in q2, 14.4% in q3 and to 16.4% in q4, and now to our just reported 17.3% in q1 of fiscal 2020. our q1 gross margin of 17.3% is 670 basis points above the same quarter last year, and our operating profit is $7 million higher than last year's q1. our cash on the balance sheet increased to $33.6 million at december 31st, 2019.
the progress and performance of our business has been excellent. our team is now focused on continued improvement in each of the following; our safety performance; share gain in certain key accounts; continuing to price for value; cost containment due to the lower volumes; product yield and cost improvements; staying close to our customers; and managing our inventories. in addition, we remain very well positioned to supply into the growing current and new generation aero engine platforms, most notably with our patented haynes 282 and haynes 244 alloys.
with that said, as you have read in our first quarter earnings release, the uncertainty around the boeing 737 max build schedule and other significant issues are now causing volume reductions across our aerospace customer base that we believe will continue to impact our business throughout fiscal 2020. the duration of the current 737 max build shutdown is obviously still uncertain. while the 737 max is the majority of our projected reduced demand in fiscal 2020, we are also experiencing additional demand reductions. those demand issues are as follows.
first, we experienced slow overall summer bookings due in large part to nickel volatility and aerospace supply chain inventory concerns. in addition, we are seeing reduced demand for material for the engines of the a320neo, primarily due to an inventory build in the supply chain impacting our customers' production activity that will continue in early calendar year 2020. next, our us and european based aerospace customers are working through a fairly full supply chain and are in an inventory reduction mode across many of the platforms they supply. finally, we have seen base business cpi slow this quarter, likely related to china trade tariffs, our typical seasonality issues, as well as global and economic and political concerns.
we look at these overall demand environment reductions as a significant, but temporary pause in our growth. we remain enthusiastic about the actions we've taken and the impact that they are having on our business. our team will proactively manage this demand low, and we are also taking the necessary actions to prepare for the anticipated return of robust aerospace demand.
now, as far as details for the quarter. volume shipped in the quarter was 4.2 million pounds, which was 1.2 million pounds lower sequentially than q4 of fiscal 2019 and 100,000 pounds lower than last year's q1. we are typically impacted in fiscal q1 by planned maintenance outages, holidays and customers managing their calendar year-end balance sheets. however, in addition to that, as i previously mentioned, we believe uncertainty in the aerospace market with a grounded 737 max along with the other demand reduction issues, such as lower base business cpi, impacted the quarter.
net revenues were $108.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, which was 1.3% higher than last year's first quarter. other revenue contributed to this increase was solid increases in toll conversion over the past year. average selling price in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was $25.69 per pound, inclusive of our other revenue, up about 3.9% over last year's first quarter.
with that, let me move to our key markets. sales to the aerospace market accounted for 54% of our revenue at $58.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. this represents an increase of 7.9% from the same period last year, due to 9% increase in volume, partially offset by 1.2% decrease in average selling price per pound. the increase in volume is due to the planned outage that was undertaken last year in the first three months of fiscal 2019, partially offset by lower shipments as the supply chain was beginning to be impacted by the aerospace issues previously mentioned. sequentially, revenue in aerospace markets declined 13.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. backlog dollars in aerospace decreased sequentially from q4 to q1 by 1.4%.
sales to the chemical processing market accounted for 15% of our revenue at $16.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. this represents a decrease of 11.7% from the same period of fiscal 2019 due to a 12.2% decrease in volume, partially offset by a 0.7% increase in average selling price per pound. base business volumes have decreased in the first three months of fiscal 2020 from the same period of fiscal 2019, partly due to a decrease in sales to china, driven by continued retaliatory tariffs. however, partially offsetting this base business decline was an increase in specialty application project revenue in the first three months of fiscal 2020 compared to the same period last year.
sequentially, revenue in the chemical processing market declined 39.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 due in large part to seasonality issues, china tariffs and lower special project shipments. backlog dollars in cpi decreased sequentially from q3 to q4 by 4%.
sales to the industrial gas turbine market accounted for 13% of revenue at $13.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. this represents a decrease of 2.3% from the same period of last year, due to a decrease of 3.9% and average selling price per pound, partially offset by a 1.7% increase in volume. the small increase in volume is primarily attributable to a slight increase in large frame turbines, which represents a favorable turnaround after the previous quarters of reported demand weakness. however, partially offsetting this is a slight decrease in demand in the small and medium frame engines, which has slowed down, mainly due to the oil and gas market. overall, we still believe challenges remain in the industrial gas turbine market.
sequentially, revenue in this market declined 12.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. backlog dollars in the industrial gas turbines increased sequentially from q4 to q1 by 31.8%, coming off a very low levels. we continue to see meaningful potential opportunities here for market share growth for haynes.
other markets accounted for a 11% of revenue at $11.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. this represents a decrease of 16.9% due to 39.9% decrease in volume, partially offset by a 38.3% increase in average selling price compared to the same period of fiscal 2019. the decrease in volume was primarily due to a decline in sales to the flue-gas desulfurization market. the increase in average selling price reflects a higher value product mix and improved pricing. sequentially, revenue in the other markets, increased 7.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. backlog dollars in our other markets increased sequentially from q4 to q1 by 1%. other revenue accounted for 7% of revenue at $7.3 million in q1. this represents an increase of 40.3% from the same period of fiscal 2019. the increase was primarily due to increased toll conversion. sequentially, other revenue increased 8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.
one final item before i hand the call over to dan. i wanted to acknowledge the important message sent by the ceo of blackrock, our largest shareholder, in his recent letter to ceos. larry fink has urged the companies in which blackrock invest to address the issue of sustainability and risk management of climate change-related issues. we take seriously our responsibility for responsible environmental stewardship, as well as being aware of the impacts we have on all stakeholders at haynes. i intend in the coming months to work with our board and management team to evaluate our practices and disclosures as it relates to sustainability and climate change risk, and we will report in due course on our progress in assessing and managing the risks related to these issues.
now let me turn the call over to dan for more details on our financials.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
thank you, mike. this quarter we achieved a gross margin as a percentage of net sales of 17.3%. this is our highest gross margin percentage in 16 quarters, going back to fiscal 2015, which was a year with many special projects. this solid gross margin percentage shows the traction we are achieving in our improvement focus initiatives related to better pricing, lower costs and better efficiency. in addition, it has lowered our earnings breakeven point, lessening the absorption impact when volumes are lower. this quarter we generated a $3.3 million in earnings despite volume of only 4.2 million pounds.
the gross margin headwinds that we discussed in prior-year fiscal 2019 related to cobalt and our cold finishing upgrade have alleviated as expected. as we move through fiscal 2020, additional challenges exist. three notable challenges include; number 1, aerospace market uncertainty outlined in detail already by mike; number 2, tariffs that remain on product we ship into china; this is unfavorably impacted our base business chemical processing volumes and continues to be a difficult competitive environment with non-us producers; and number 3, property insurance. as we mentioned last quarter, the market for property insurance has tightened dramatically. there is much less capacity available, which is resulting in an additional annual expense of $2 million recognized primarily in cost of sales. the specialty application projects this quarter were $8 million compared to last year's first quarter of $6 million and compared sequentially to q4 of fy19 of $9.6 million. we achieved a better margin percentage in these special projects in q1 than was achieved in any quarter of last year.
moving down the p&l, sg&a, including research and technical expense, was $12.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. this is $400,000 higher than the same period of last year, which related primarily to foreign currency changes. we expect sg&a including research and technical expense in fiscal 2020 to be approximately $50 million. with a solid gross margin percentage, operating profit improved by $7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the same period last year on only slightly higher revenue.
non-operating retirement benefit expense in the p&l was $1.7 million, which nearly doubled compared to last year's q1 of $900,000. this was due to the 09/30/2019 valuation in which the discount rate declined, which significantly increased our liability on the 09/30/2019 balance sheet and is now increasing fiscal year 2020 annual expense by $4.8 million as compared to fiscal 2019. approximately $3.4 million of this increase is reflected in non-operating retirement benefit expense in the p&l or $850,000 per quarter. and the remaining $1.4 million or $350,000 per quarter is an increase in cost of goods sold.
and to finish off the p&l, our effective tax rate for this quarter was 26% and net income was $3.3 million or $0.26 per diluted share. backlog increased 1% over the first quarter to $237.6 million at december 31st, 2019, and was relatively even with backlog at the end of the first quarter of last year. as mike pointed out the backlog increase was driven by the industrial gas turbine market.
outlook for next quarter. we are anticipating a continuation of the reduced demand into the second quarter of fiscal 2020, due to the uncertainty in the aerospace market surrounding the boeing 737 max production. as we manage through these issues, our improvement initiatives continue to positively impact our results. we expect revenue and earnings in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 to be higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as we move past seasonality issues that impacted the first quarter. compared to last year's second quarter, we expect revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 to be lower than the prior year second quarter of fiscal 2019. however, earnings are expected to be higher than prior year.
moving to liquidity. we continued to have zero borrowings on our credit facility at december 31st, 2019. cash on the balance sheet was $33.6 million, representing a $2.6 million increase over the quarter and a $22 million increase compared to the end of the first quarter of last fiscal year. net cash provided by operating activities was $7 million in the first three months of fiscal 2020, in spite of cash used from increasing inventory of $20 million. offsetting a portion of the inventory was cash generated from accounts receivable with solid cash collections from the previous quarter's higher sales and profitability.
the inventory increase this quarter was due to a few different factors. number 1, lower shipping levels left a bit more in finished goods than normal. number 2, when production slows and melt shop consumes less scrap, the hard scrap in inventory typically increases. and number 3, we have placed strategic inventory and work in process semi-finished and finished inventory stages to allow for quicker response time when demand improves, especially in the aerospace market. heading into q2, we expect inventory to drop moderately as we work through excess scrap at our kokomo mill. a more substantial reduction would be contingent on the timing of a bounce back in orders expected once the aerospace uncertainty is resolved.
capital spending was $2.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared to our depreciation level of $4.8 million for the quarter. the forecast for capital spending in all of fiscal 2020 is $12 million.
in conclusion, looking forward, we see short-term challenges, which are expected to impact our fiscal 2020 volume levels. our team is managing through this period of lower demand, and we believe that we will continue to show positive momentum stemming from the execution of our improvement initiatives. this combined with our continued strategy of thoughtful capital allocation is designed to enhance shareholder value over the long term.
mike, with that, i will now turn the discussion back over to you.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
thanks, dan. we've made steady progress as we first launched and then implemented our series of focus improvement initiatives designed to improve the performance of our company. as we look forward, we see short-term challenges in the aerospace market, which are expected to impact our fiscal 2020 shipments. our team is managing through this period of lower demand, and we believe that we will continue to show positive operational momentum stemming from the impact of our improvement initiatives.
before i hand the call over to questions, one more thing. i would like to welcome our new board member, general larry spencer, retired united states air force 4-star general. we look forward to working with larry, and leveraging his experience and leadership skills gained in the air force and through his extensive knowledge of the aerospace industry. we are fortunate to have a person of larry's accomplishments join our board.
with that, kat, let's open the call to questions.

operator
[operator instructions] and our first question will come from steve o'hara with sidoti. please go ahead.
steve o'hara -- sidoti -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my question. how are you.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
good. good morning, steve.
steve o'hara -- sidoti -- analyst
good morning. so i guess, obviously, a tough quarter with volumes dropping and things like that, i guess and you talked about revenue being in line with 3q and 4q, would you see the same types of margins or maybe margin impacts as you had in the third quarter? or is the third quarter adjustment and things like that? do they kind of help smooth that process out or do you have to do it again in the fourth quarter based on the volumes?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
steve, a couple of things. we are looking for the bottom of the aerospace decline, and we're looking for improvement in whenever it may come in cpi and igt. so this is a business right now as many in the aerospace or almost all in the aerospace are that is going to be with very low volumes. and with low volumes is going to come direct charge. what we've been encouraged by, and when you look at our pricing, we're, year-on-year, still up in pricing. so our team has done a very good job with that. and we're also encouraged by our efforts on the cost reduction side, and dan detailed that. that being said, the low volume is going to lead to direct charges, and therefore, we will continue to encounter a difficult time, at least for the next quarter and then we'll see beyond that. dan, anything you want to add?
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
yes. i mean, it's obviously quite a challenge with variable costs are a bit easier to manage it, as you can imagine, but the fixed cost are what's quite challenging, and many of our costs were kind of semi-fixed as well. so when volume drops this significantly, spreading those fixed costs over those low volumes can be challenging. so it has as time goes on, we'll do what we can to reduce those fixed costs as best we can, but it's really tough to keep up with volume reductions at this level. but i'm pleased with the traction that we have gotten so far on our cost reductions, and we'll just keep pushing that as the quarters go forward.
steve o'hara -- sidoti -- analyst
okay. and then maybe just a follow-up on the inventory. so do any of these actions change any of the cost of goods sold profile in future periods? or is this something that's just kind of a onetime thing? i guess i'm just wondering, would it lower the cost of inventory as you sell it in future periods?
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
no, it would not. i mean this is the fact that the costs cannot be overcapitalized in inventory. so what is capitalized in inventory is kind of normal levels or normal amounts. so as that inventory gets sold, that will look like a normal cost of goods sold. so that's what we're obviously avoiding is overcapitalizing. so later when that inventory is sold, you've got a real squeeze on the margin, we're getting the squeeze on the margin now, which is the proper way to do it, so that when the product is sold, it will look like a normal gross margin when it's sold.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
it's an interesting time for us, because, obviously, our volumes are way down. but we feel very strongly we can responsibly also reduce inventory as our business levels abound, which further complicates the issue with absorption in our plants. but it's obviously the right thing to do as we focus on generating cash.
steve o'hara -- sidoti -- analyst
okay. and then maybe just one last follow-up. if you in terms of the cuts and the adjustments you've made so far, what types of volumes are you kind of ready to deal with next year? i understand, fixed costs are fixed, i guess, in the short run, but in the long run, i think a lot more costs are variable, i guess. so can you just talk about the cuts you've made so far? and i mean, i know you don't want to cut too much or too deeply, but how that prepares you for the potential outcomes next year and going forward?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
at this point, for the short term, we've got to consider revenues about where we are now. so what we are doing, both on the salary side and on the variable side is making the cuts. we have to, to try to squeeze the difference between our volume drop and our cost drop to try to improve that as much as possible. and so we are continuing to look at what our volumes are, and then we meet daily to try to match up what those volumes are. with what our cost structure is and try to improve that going forward. the other thing that we want to make sure we're prepared for is, one of these days, there we don't know when, obviously, there will be improvement in this market as a vaccine comes, and we want to make sure it will be prepared for the upturn. so we're always looking at that also.
steve o'hara -- sidoti -- analyst
okay, thank you very much.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
thank you.
steve o'hara -- sidoti -- analyst
thanks for question
operator
[operator instructions] and our next question comes from michael leshock with keybanc. please go,
michael leshock -- keybanc -- analyst
hey guys, good morning. i just wanted to get your take on what you're hearing within the aero supply chain in light of some of these cuts from boeing and airbus this week, specifically on wide-body platforms? but was the supply chain, were they anticipating some of these cuts? or could this drive activity even lower?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
it's concerning. whether you're talking about continued delays with the 777 and the ge9 times engine, which, by the way, we have two proprietary ends on that as we understand, is being pushed out further, which obviously is not a good sign. but the other thing that's happened is, and i'll take the workhorse engine that i mentioned on single aisle, the leap engine, ok? the forecast that we had seen in mid-2019 for leap engine production in 2020 was 2,300 engines, 2,360 engines, whatever the number is. and now, when we put this script and the information together, we were looking at only 900, and now that number is 800. so it's two things: it's not only a 2/3 cut in the number of engines being built, but it's inventory that exists within the supply chain. so certainly, we're looking for the first bit of good news, michael, but we certainly haven't seen anything.
michael leshock -- keybanc -- analyst
yes. that makes sense. and on the share gain initiative, you touched on those, are these longer-term negotiations where you'll recognize the increased share in the future? or are you actually seeing this in the near-term more in the expense of price at the expense of price?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
no, not at the expense of price. the share gain that we have talked about and focused on is in power generation in igt. and what's really interesting in our igt numbers is, even though our volume and our revenues are down year-on-year and sequentially, our backlog in igt is up, i don't have the number in front of me, between 25% and 30% year-on-year backlog. and what we're seeing with that is, not only finally a land-based gas turbines demand equals supply as opposed to taking it out of inve
michael leshock -- keybanc -- analyst
ntory, but we're seeing positive growth because of share gain that we have begun to experience, we have begun to ship. it was a significant company out there, and it will help us not only now but as we go into the future.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
i'll start by talking about where we are in cash generation. obviously, we reduced our inventory in the past quarter by $16 million despite the very low sales and generated cash of about $13 million. and our plan is to continue our cash generation well into next year or through next year. that being said, we're committed to our dividend, and we realize the importance of it to our shareholders. so at this point, no change in the policy. obviously, given the market, we're continually evaluating at the board level, this ever-changing economic environment and if conditions warrant us to reconsider, we certainly leave that door open. you can be confident that we'll make thoughtful decisions regarding all capital allocation during this impressive environment. so we need to continue to understand where this market is. we need to continue to understand where the market is going, how long it will take to begin to see a recovery and how successful, and i believe it will be very successful, our cash generation capability will be.
michael leshock -- keybanc -- analyst
got it, thanks.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
thank you.
operator
and we have a follow-up question from steve o'hara with sidoti. please go ahead.
steve o'hara -- sidoti -- analyst
yeah, thanks for taking the follow-up, i guess just kind of on the along the lines of the inventory in the supply chain and potential recovery, so i guess i'm just wondering what the industry's recovery might be and what the time line for your recovery would be? given the inventory and the supply chain, does that delay your recovery i guess, if you get back to kind of, let's say, 2019's volumes in 2022, which seems like a long shot, and i'm not saying that would happen, but i guess how long before you could get your margins back to where they kind of should be based on the way you've kind of started running the business?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
first thing, i think that as that happen, steve, we've got to understand where bottom is. and we believe we're approaching the bottom. but we also think, based on all the news out there, we've taken on is look, we're not going to see an uptick for at least another six months with all the airframe manufacturing pulling down the production rates, and again, we're all waiting for the first piece of good news, and we haven't seen it yet. and we're expecting, obviously, with that a slow recovery in our revenue passenger miles, we believe the sector will be down for at least 24 months, more likely 36, and i'll go back to something, dave calhoun, from boeing, said recently, we said it will take two to three years for travel to return to 2019 levels, and additional few years beyond that for the industry's long-term growth trend to return. so this is tough. it is still a bit hazy.
i think it's a very fair question, and i think we have to continue to understand what's happening in the world related to vaccines and what how that will drive revenue passenger miles. so i think it's a question we've got to continue to ask as we go forward. but we certainly don't see anything short-term that says there's going to be an uptick anytime soon.
steve o'hara -- sidoti -- analyst
okay. no, that's fair. and then, i mean, if there's any let's say, the recovery maybe would it be fair to say that you guys have additional levers to pull if necessary, either if the slow environment kind of drags on continues to drag on or gets worse over time? i mean, are there additional levers you guys can pull to kind of preserve cash and liquidity and things like that?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
sure. and again, you've seen our inventory levels as we went into this. so we have got a significant amount of inventory. and what we continue to work on is shortening our lead times and improving our reliability. and so the number one lever for us is becoming very reliable and significantly shrinking our lead times, which will allow us to continue to generate cash, given the amount of inventory that we have. in addition to that in addition to the positions dan talked about in the $12 million or $13 million in costs for people, we continue to work on our variable cost to manufacture.
we were, last quarter, somewhere between 500 and 600 basis points better in gross margin, and that was pricing, and it was cost momentum, variable costs from that and doing things differently. obviously, i'd be a little foolish to talk about we're in a good pricing environment now, but we still have an enormous opportunity on the variable cost side to continue to focus on improving yields and improving our cost to manufacture. so yes, there are definitely levers out there, both on the cash side and on the cost side.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
and one thing i was just saying, one thing i might add to that is just our structure with a mill and service centers, having service centers in an environment like this when customers as things start to get better, they're going to order more and then they order in smaller quantities and be very conservative in their ordering patterns. when we have product in the service center, we can ship those smaller quantities versus the mills who will ship just full mill quantity. so it's a bit of an advantage for us as we're coming out of a downturn. so we'll be well positioned for that one in the curves.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
i think, dan, that is a great point. as you look at coming out of this, whenever that may be, i think air customers are going to be very conservative continue to be very conservative on the cash side, and we are a mill that has their own distribution centers that can cut thesis for customers, it can provide just-in-time inventory. so it really our business model works well as far as short lead time out of the distribution center, cut pieces, doing things to the customers that otherwise they may have done and limiting the amount of net all customers to buy. so it really helps us. great point, dan, thank you.
steve o'hara -- sidoti -- analyst
okay. and then just maybe sorry, one more follow-up. i think you guys had some shutdowns in the quarter, and i mean, i would assume there wouldn't be any shutdowns in 4q unless maybe there's an outbreak or something like that. i mean, obviously, maybe you're not producing enough, so you have to shut down to preserve costs, i don't know. but what's the is there a beneficial impact of not having to shutdown for some period of time going into the fourth quarter that wasn't in the third quarter at all?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
yes. thanks for the question. we shut down at the end of march because there seem to be so many unknowns, and we were concerned about our employees' health and safety, and we wanted to get a handle on this, and that's what we did. and obviously, that shutdown extended into the quarter we're now reporting on. taking down steel mills and then bringing them back up is not the best thing in the world, but we did put safety first. we do not anticipate another shutdown. however, i will say that, when we look at what's happening in the country right now, our tubing plan is in louisiana, and i believe i heard yesterday, the highest per capita infection rate right now is in louisiana or at least one of the highest. so we're watching it very carefully. we have no shutdowns planned, but we'll continue to look at what's best for our employees as we go forward.
steve o'hara -- sidoti -- analyst
all right, thank you very much for the call.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director

good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to your haynes international, inc. third quarter fiscal 2020 financial results call. [operator instructions]. it is at this time, it is my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, david van bibber, controller and chief accounting officer. sir, the floor is yours.
david sean van bibber -- controller and chief accounting officer
thank you very much for joining us today. with me today are mike shor, president and ceo of haynes international; and dan maudlin, vice president and chief financial officer. before we get started, i would like to read a brief cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements. this conference call contains statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation and reform act of 1995 and section 21e of the securities and exchange act of 1934. the words believe, anticipate, plan and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
thanks, dave. good morning, everyone. the current economic environment resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, along with a significant drop in aerospace demand, are certainly not what any of us expected at the beginning of our fiscal year. however, i'm pleased that our team was able to immediately pivot to focus on cash generation as the economic issues with the pandemic became apparent. our bottom line focused efforts over the past two years led to 18% gross margins right before the pandemic, positive cash flow over the past year and at least a 20% reduction in our breakeven point compared to the prior fiscal year. our goal of worst to first in gross margin percent in our slice of the industry was within reach.
these successful actions, along with the fact that we have strong liquidity stemming from a carefully managed balance sheet, should assist us in writing out this terrible storm and position us for profitable growth once an aerospace recovery begins. the drop in our business has been significant. we're looking forward to seeing the first signs that the aerospace industry has bottomed and a recovery is ahead of us. as you can see by our results for the quarter, we saw a drop in revenue of $31 million or 28% sequentially and $45 million or 36% compared to the third quarter of last year.
these reductions in revenue match with the recent aerospace news that we have all seen and experienced, specifically of note from this news are the following four items: first, commercial aircraft builds in 2020 are projected to drop 40% to 50% versus 2019; next, leap engines the workhorse engine for single-aisle commercial aircraft were mid last year, projected at over 2,300 engines to be shipped in 2020. that number for 2020 is now estimated to be less than 900 engines, a drop in short-term builds of at least 60%. in addition, this rapid drop in short-term demand has resulted in excess inventory throughout the aerospace supply chain. we are estimating that six to 12 months of excess inventory may exist in some areas of the supply chain. finally, in addition to the significant changes in demand, we are also seeing our customers show very conservative ordering patterns for cash management reasons, even where demand does exist. as far as our results, the volume drop is causing a significant impact on our margins. direct charges are hitting the p&l from expenses incurred related to under absorption.
this concept is simple. despite our success in significantly dropping our breakeven point at these abnormally low volumes, we simply cannot spread the fixed cost load we have over significantly less produced pounds and remain profitable. we can't overcapitalize inventory with these costs, and therefore, they are required to be directly expensed as period cost. it's important to note that these direct charges are not additional or unusual charges, but our normal operating cost, most of which are fixed that were put in place to support the projected higher production volumes. dan will provide further details on this in his financial update. in addition to the significant changes in demand, we are responsibly reducing inventory as we prioritize significant cash generation during this time. this strategy further decreases the mill volumes in all of our facilities.
we reduced inventory by 1.7 million pounds in q3, which is very significant when compared to our volume shift of 3.2 million pounds in the quarter. this added to our absorption fixed cost coverage issue. beyond the direct charge as noted, we are encouraged by the positive impact that our price and cost work have had in driving down our projected breakeven point. in addition, we continue to work to lower our expenses to minimize the impact of our unabsorbed costs, but we are facing a difficult period due to historically low production volumes. our produced pounds in our kokomo mill in q3 declined 33% from the pounds produced in q2 and declined 40% from the pounds produced in last year's q3. we have quickly responded to this downturn. one of our first actions was a 10% reduction in executive team and board of director cash compensation.
we have also offered incentives for a voluntary separation program for employees, gone through a salary reduction and force, and implemented reduced hours at certain locations. our team is taking the actions design the actions designed to reduce our year-on-year sg&a expense by at least 20%. we have also continued layoffs in our operations and continue to work on our variable cost reduction throughout all of our facilities. we want to be prepared whenever volume does return to reignite the positive margin and earnings momentum that we have generated over the past year. a few final thoughts. our company, our industry and our country are encountering very difficult times.
at the same time, i'm encouraged by what the future may hold for haynes. my experience in this industry tells me not to draw negative conclusions about a company at the low points or to think that the good times will never end when it periods of peak demand, both can lead to false conclusions and actions. even though these are difficult times, i believe firmly that the future for haynes is bright. what i do not know today is the timing of any recovery. we continue to monitor all of the key indicators so that we are well we're not concerned.
the reason for my optimism about the long-term future pains are as follows, and i'll quickly cover nine points here: first, we have strong liquidity; next, we are projecting positive cash flow for the balance of the year despite very low revenues; in addition, pre-covid-19, we took our gross margin from high single or low double digits to 18%, and we see even more potential for profitable growth once our volume returns; our past price and cost work are real, and we proved how they could result in bottom line improvement; we've invested what we needed to, to position this company for the projected long-term aero demand; future capex needs will likely be below depreciation for at least the next three to five years; in addition, i believe that our alloy and application development work is second to none in our industry; we continue to focus on bringing in orders for high-value differentiated applications and products; we remain very, very close to our customers, i continue to be impressed with the depth of our customer relationships; also, our business model is very well suited for recovery.
we plan to continue to provide customers with the smaller quantities they need as we come out of this tough period, and we will continue to perform the value-added operations for our customers, such as piece cutting and just-in-time inventory; finally, the past aero growth was steady and very strong. it took a pandemic to stop the momentum. revenue pass-through miles will eventually begin to improve. when it does, i'm expecting the same pre-pandemic fundamentals to drive aero growth in our future.
now let me turn the call over to dan for more details on our specific markets and on our financial results. dan?
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
thank you, mike. last quarter, we estimated that overall volumes could be sequentially lower by 15% to 30% this quarter. volumes actually declined sequentially by 26.7% and to 3.2 million pounds. this is a sequential decrease of 1.2 million pounds and a corresponding decrease in revenue of nearly $31 million. third quarter sales to the aerospace market accounted for 50% of our revenue at $40.4 million. this is a decrease of roughly 32% sequentially from q2, and a decrease of 39% from the same period last year.
the pandemic has had significant effects across the aerospace industry with announced reductions in commercial aerospace build schedules, combined with a reduction in repair, maintenance and overhaul activity. complicating the demand situation includes the elevated amount of inventory throughout the aerospace supply chain, the significant number of undelivered new planes already built, the significant number of parked planes taken out of service and the cash preservation mode occurring with many customers in the supply chain, resulting in a very conservative order entry trends. backlog dollars in aerospace decreased sequentially from q2 to q3 by 22%. the third quarter sales to the chemical processing market accounted for 15% of our revenue at $12.1 million.
this is a decrease of 23% sequentially from q2 and a decrease of 43% from the same period last year. volume was down primarily due to decreased demand caused by covid-19, but also due to low oil prices, with the impact of chemical companies delaying capex spending. backlog dollars in cpi decreased sequentially from q2 to q3 by 4%. third quarter sales to the industrial gas turbine market accounted for 17% of our revenue and $13.7 million. this is a decrease of 18% sequentially from q2, and a decrease of 14% from the same period last year. the decrease is attributable to conservative purchasing methods due to covid-19, combined with small and medium frame engine builds slowing due to the oil industry slowdown. our share gain initiatives continue. however, given the current economic conditions, shipments are not yet consistent quarter-to-quarter. backlog dollars in industrial gas turbines increased sequentially from q2 to q3 by 6%.
third quarter sales to other markets accounted for 14% of our revenue at $11.2 million. this is a decrease of 12% sequentially from q2 and a decrease of nearly 29% from the same period last year. demand was impacted from the effects of the covid-19 pandemic blowing from lower oil prices. decreases were largest in the flue gas desulfurization, automotive and oil and gas markets. backlog dollars in other markets increased sequentially from q2 to q3 by almost 5% during the quarter. third quarter other revenue accounted for 4% of our revenue and $3.2 million. this is a decrease of 55% sequentially from q2 and a decrease of 54% from the same period last year. toll conversion sales decreased sharply due to the covid-19 pandemic. overall, the steep drop in volumes compressed gross margin significantly this quarter, especially challenging is reducing spending commensurate with reductions in production volume in this environment.
if spending does not decline in line with production volumes, then margin compression occurs. in the third quarter, we charged $5.9 million directly to cost of goods sold for fixed and semi-fixed overhead spending that did not decline commensurate with the abnormally low production levels, which per generally accepted accounting principles, could not be capitalized into inventory. also impacting the gross margin percentage was fixed period costs spread over lower volumes. we also incurred charges to cost of goods sold due to adjustments in inventory reserves and severance costs related to workforce reduction measures. and finally, additional margin compression occurred due to nickel prices dropping since the beginning of our fiscal year. the lme nickel 30-day average price at september 30, 2019, was $8.02 per pound compared to june 30, 2020, of $5.76 per pound. sg&a, including research and technical expense was $10.7 million in the third quarter.
this is $1.1 million lower than the second quarter this year, primarily due to significant cost savings undertaken, which i will outline further in a moment. some actions were taken during the quarter and some actions were implemented after june 30. the actions which occurred in q3 included a cost to implement of approximately $200,000 in separation expenses in sg&a. as mike mentioned, our target is to reduce sg&a by more than 20% year-over-year. nonoperating retirement benefit expense in the p&l was $1.7 million, which nearly doubled compared to last year's q3 of $900,000 due to the lower discount rates we discussed in previous quarters. interest expense was slightly higher this quarter due to the draw on the revolver, which occurred in mid-march. our effective tax rate for this quarter was impacted by a valuation adjustment of nearly $1 million related to state r&d tax credits that are not expected to be realized prior to their expiration. all of that resulted in a net loss for the quarter of $8.1 million.
cost reduction initiatives have been executed in both q3 and q4, and they include the following five categories: number one, implemented a 10% reduction in salaries of all members of the executive team and cash compensation of the board of directors, discontinued monthly accruals for management incentive compensation, in addition, implemented a global hiring freeze and eliminated annual merit increases for all salaried employees; number two, furloughs implemented for certain production, maintenance and salaried employees; number three, offered voluntary separation programs, implemented involuntary reductions in force and decisions not to replace open positions, all of which eliminated roughly 162 positions, both in salaried and production positions, which represents roughly $12.6 million in annual salaries, wages and fringes; number four, requiring salaried employees to take one week of unpaid time off during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.
this represents a roughly 8% reduction in that quarter; and number five, significant focus on reducing discretionary spending as well as reviewing and prioritizing capital expenditures, focused on reducing inventory, which has and is expected to continue to generate cash. we will continue to evaluate cost reduction initiatives going forward. backlog was $174.6 million at june 30, 2020, a decrease of $30.1 million or 14.7% from $204.7 million at march 31, 2020. outlook for the quarter. the company continues to see elevated uncertainty across all its markets, especially in the aerospace market, with announced reductions in commercial aerospace build schedules, combined with higher inventory levels in the supply chain. the company expects revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 to be comparable to the third quarter of fiscal 2020, and the company expects to continue to generate cash from cost reduction initiatives, along with inventory reductions.
earnings for the fourth quarter cannot be reliably estimated during this time of unprecedented market and economic conditions caused by covid-19. further adverse market conditions may result in additional charges to earnings in future periods, including expenses for unfavorable fixed cost absorption, impairment charges and valuation reserves on inventory or taxes. moving on to liquidity. cash increased by $13.1 million over the third quarter, driven by inventory reductions. total liquidity was approximately $155 million, with cash at june 30, 2020, at $65.5 million, and approximately $90 million available on the credit facility. our strategy continues to be cost reduction initiatives and reducing inventory levels in order to increase our cash flow from operations.
this strategy is driving our expectation of an increasing cash balance in q4 of fiscal 2020. capital spending was $7.1 million compared to our depreciation level of $14.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020. the forecast for capital spending in fiscal 2020 is between $9 million and $10 million, to allow for maintaining reliability within our operations. in conclusion, looking forward, we continue to see significant demand challenges ahead, which are expected to result in comparable revenue levels next quarter. despite these challenges, we continue to feel that we are well positioned to weather this potentially prolonged downturn, because of our ongoing efforts to reduce cost and reduce our breakeven point, our expected continued inventory reduction leading to cash generation and our solid liquidity position.
mike, with that, i will now turn the discussion back over to you.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
thanks, dan. short term, these are tough times for everyone in the aerospace industry. however, we gained confidence as we look at the long-term view, and as we see our core competencies leveraging future value, such as developing new alloys and new applications, our unique mill manufacturing capabilities and our value-added service center processing. seeing beyond this, pandemic is important, and we are well positioned to get there. with that, christie, let's open the call for questions.

[operator instructions] we'll hear first from steve o'hara with sidoti.
stephen michael o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hi, good morning.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer, director
good morning, steve.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance, chief financial officer, treasurer
good morning.
stephen michael o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. i guess if you look at -- you mentioned the inventory levels and where they are right now in the channel. can you just talk about have they improved at all or are they still kind of high? and do you need kind of a real pickup in demand for that to improve or are things kind of maybe progressing where inventory is getting cleaned up a little bit here and there as we progress?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer, director
hey, steve. sure. we obviously spend a lot of time talking about this both internally and getting insight from our customers. we believe that inventory reductions throughout the supply chain are going to go on for another few quarters. said another way, based on a lot of customer feedback, there is still probably six to 12 months of inventory in many areas of the supply chain. obviously, there's going to be exceptions to this. we're seeing some exceptions. so we could see a modest uptick in '21, but that will just be the first step, in our opinion, to the recovery.
our view, and i really think a great way to look at this is to look at the leap engine, because i think what happens with the leap engine tells us what's going to happen with the aerospace industry. you all know the story. 1,736 engines in '19; initial forecast of 2,300 [phonetic] in '20 [phonetic]; down to 800 this year and somewhere between 800 and 1,000 next year. so what we're still dealing with is inventory in the supply chain to make over 2,300 engines initially projected in 2020 and that dropped to 800. so, still inventory out there. it's a good news for us. projections are for the leap back to over 2,000 a year as people start flying again starting in 2023, meaning that we believe the supply chains will be cleaned out and metal will start to flow in large quantities to support this late '21, early '22. makes sense?
stephen michael o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
yeah, no, that's very helpful. thank you. and then, maybe just on the cost cuts. i think you mentioned kind of a $14 million annualized cost savings. is that something that is kind of a true pickup starting in 2021 and maybe how much of that kind of is incremental in '21 maybe. and then is the $5.6 million that you mentioned i think on the pension, is that included in that $14 million?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer, director
okay. i'll let -- i'll let dan address the pension after i talk about the cost. i think when we look at costs, you got to look at it from three points of view. first is the sg&a and salary cost reduction that we went through. that was obviously very difficult to implement. not something that any of us looking forward to. but they're certainly there, and we'll move throughout our upcoming fiscal year. at some point, obviously, when business returns, we're going have to bring some of that back, but given the pain we went through to get to these levels, it will take some time.
on the variable cost side, there's really a couple of ways to look at this. first, when -- what we have done to get to our high point pre-pandemic of 18% was not only price increase but significant variable cost reduction, and that work continues, both on yield improvement and overall variable cost reduction. i'm very proud of those efforts. one of the things that happen, though, if you've reduced cost on a per pound basis, you don't get as much cost reduction with 2.9 million pounds as you did with 5.4 million pounds, obviously, so that hurts. so, as we move forward, some of our past cost reduction is muted until our volume comes back, but also on the variable side, we continue to focus in all of our facilities in driving cost down. dan, you want to cover the -- the $5.6 million steve asked about?
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance, chief financial officer, treasurer
sure. yeah, the pension reduction and the retiree healthcare reduction really has -- is not part of that -- that $14 million that i referenced. that was only related to the permanent reductions that had occurred over the course -- that occurred somewhat in, mostly in 2020; a little bit spilled into 2021 because i mentioned to you the october number, but that was -- the majority of that number has already been realized in some of the numbers we're seeing for the fourth quarter and even a little bit in the third quarter of fy '20, but unrelated to the pension. and i will say this too. it's also unrelated to other cost reduction measures that we've taken like the unpaid furloughs, is not part of that $14 million number. the 10% reduction in the executive staff salaries is not part of that as well. that's just one piece of a bigger cost reduction strategy. does that help?
stephen michael o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
yes, very helpful. thank you. and then maybe last one. you noted cpi remains i think kind of low given the economy, etc. i mean, what are the biggest markets there? i mean, it seems like homebuilding tends to be one of the bigger drivers of chemical and then auto seems to be the other big one. are there other markets that we should think about in terms of getting that market back to maybe improvement other than just general gdp?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah, the oil prices have a significant impact. so when oil prices are down, there is less spending in the cpi market. so that's -- significant large pipeline projects are not out there. in general, we are seeing many chemical processing projects on hold, specifically related to covid and everyone being a bit conservative with their spending. so that's one side. the other side is our special project side. we actually finished our fiscal year '20 in a pretty good spot related to year-on-year, staying plus or minus about even on our revenues, on cpi. we're actually going to, on special projects within cpi, we'll see that drop somewhat because there is very few projects being let. but i would say in addition to what you said, it's oil price, it's large pipeline projects in general and it's our special projects.
stephen michael o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. thank you very much. i'll jump back in queue.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer, director
thank you, steve.

our next question will come from chris olin at tier4 research.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
hey, good morning.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance, chief financial officer, treasurer
hey, chris.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer, director
good morning, chris.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
hey, mike, you referred to order rate improvements, although they were from a low level. i was curious if there was a specific end market was driving that or was it a broad-based improvement?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah, let me -- let me get some facts here, chris. the best way that i like to look at this is our book-to-bill. and it's kind of interesting when you look at pounds on what we book versus what we bill. in q1, obviously pre-pandemic, it was at 1.0. i'll get to the markets in a second. q2 was 0.7; q3 was 0.6; q4 bounced back a little, which obviously gives us some hope; it was at 0.9. and to specifically answer your question on the book-to-bill, aero was still down; it was at 0.7 book-to-bill for the quarter. but cpi was slightly over 1. igt was slightly under 1. and other was over 1. so aero was lagging as we would expect as we talked about with inventory, but the others are coming back. again, we've got a long, long way to go. we -- we say we're in the road to recovery, but it's from very low levels, chris.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
interesting. okay. and then just want to make sure i understood what you said there on the special projects pipeline -- or revenues. what was the actual number? i wasn't sure i caught that. and then i was just curious -- did you talk about the pipeline like any prospects in terms of what it could look like for the -- for the next fiscal year?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer, director
yeah, we -- the special projects were approximately $25 million in fiscal '19. we're probably plus or minus $1 million over that in fiscal year '20 because the lead times on these very complex products are very long, so a lot of what we had in there were things that had been ordered before the pandemic hit us. i'd expect a drop in our -- current -- in our current fiscal year. don't know the level at. we have some numbers, but we're always pushing for more. so i would say year-on-year, that's going to be down. what we like is where the margin is and what's coming in. it's been a fairly rich mix over the past year, plus or minus. dan, anything you'll add to that?
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance, chief financial officer, treasurer
no, i think you nailed it. just to give you a specific number. in fy '20, special projects, $26.3 million, where in fy '19, $25.5 million. so you were right on in your -- in your numbers, mike.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer, director
see that, chris, i'm generalizing and dan comes in, cleans it up, gives the actual number. thank you, dan.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
perfect. you guys have done a great job on the cost reduction side. i'm just trying to think about the normalization of volumes when we start looking out to like '22 and such. when you think about the 183 positions that were removed, would a lot of those jobs need to come back to increase production or is there a way to think about how much of the cost reductions would stick going forward?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer, director
i think it was obviously very painful to remove people both on the production side and through the salaried side of our business. i think it was also fairly expensive for our company to do that. so certainly, as volume comes back, there will be a lag, but there will be a need to bring back some of our production workforce in our facilities. but we will do that very slowly. and on the salaried side, we're going to have to be very careful after spending money to have to remove them to bring them back. certainly, there will be some that have to come back, but it will be a very slow process to bring them back.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
okay. thanks a lot.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer, director
thank you, chris.
operator
[operator instructions] next, we'll hear from michael leshock at keybanc. please go ahead.
michael david leshock -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey, mike and dan, good morning.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer, director
good morning, mike.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance, chief financial officer, treasurer
good morning.
michael david leshock -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
so first just on your internal inventory destocking. i know you said you're looking to destock more inventory into 2022. but looking at the fiscal 1q, how should we expect the magnitude of the destock to be versus the sequential change that we saw this quarter?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer, director
we've seen what -- in the second half of last year, we aggressively removed about 2.8 million pounds of inventory. this is a real balancing act for us because we have to keep some metal flowing through our plant. obviously, our shipment level is not as high as it's been in the past. so -- and q1, by the way, is typically a tough quarter for us to reduce inventory. so i don't know, to be honest with you, the spread across the year. but we do expect to continue to incrementally, quarter after quarter, to find ways to reduce inventory. dan?
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance, chief financial officer, treasurer
yeah, i think that's a good way to look at it. i mean, obviously when we reduced inventory originally in fy '20, just volume itself going down is going to reduce what's in work in process, what additional raw materials you're buying. so that's a bit of a somewhat natural reduction with volumes overall going down. i think we -- as we get into fy '21, it shifts a little bit in that the pace may not be quite as strong. and it will shift a bit more to the -- maybe the finished goods side of it where we're reducing more out of the finished goods side rather than wip and raw materials.
but we're looking at really every pocket of inventory, looking for any kind of stranded inventory, you might say, in work in process and trying to clean it up as best we can. we have an inventory steering committee that studies this quite heavily, and we report to senior staff, inventory levels, at least weekly, if not more often than that. so it's a big push for fy '21. we're confident we can continue to reduce inventory. as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, our inventory level as compared to sales is still quite high. our turns could certainly go up. so i think we still have a lot of room to improve, and that will generate cash.
michael david leshock -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. that makes sense. and then on the 737 max, given the recent news that we've heard there, i know that's about 8% of normalized volumes for you. how is the supply chain gearing up for the return to service? i know you mentioned the leap engines, but any other color you could add there on the max?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer, director
i think when you look at best estimates out there for max production and 2021 actual planes built, it's only probably 120 planes to be built. so i still believe there is significant inventory out there. obviously, went from the high levels in the 50s down to zero and now probably plus or minus at the current time for a month. so there is still significant inventory out there. so i think a return and a bounce-back in demand will be very gradual. we're looking hopefully at 31 a month starting in 2022 and as they begin to need material for that is what i think we'll begin to see a pull.
michael david leshock -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
and then just lastly for me, you mentioned the new igt customer. anything you can tell us in terms of the magnitude, how we should think about that customer and then your expectations for more share gains in the near term? thanks.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer, director
sure. don't think i want to get into the actual volume for us. in a company that only shipped 2.9 million pounds last quarter, it is certainly significant volume. it's a key piece in our puzzle. it's something we targeted and went after and we feel real good about that. by the way, on igt, the other thing that we really like about this market is we're finally seeing the supply chain at steady state. so instead of talking about all the inventory in the igt supply chain, which we've been talking about forever, there is no more inventory reduction. when there is demand, we're seeing a pull-forward. so we feel good about that in general, and what's happening with that specific customer and for us, it is significant.
as far as other share gain, i believe the value that we provide with our service centers, with our just-in-time inventory, with our technical service, with our alloy -- or alloy development, i think there is opportunities everywhere and which we can find ways to out-service others out there and that's what we're focused on doing. this is the one which has -- that has happened, so it's good to talk about, but we're certainly focused on others, whether it's here, aerospace or other areas.
michael david leshock -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. thank you.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer, director
thanks, mike.

and gentlemen, we do have a follow-up coming in from chris olin once again at tier4.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
hey, sorry, i had a couple of more i thought i'd just [indecipherable] here. i wanted to ask about arcadia for two reasons. one, i know there has been a little bit of disruption in the titanium supply situation. i was wondering [technical issues]
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance, chief financial officer, treasurer
chris, we may have lost you.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer, director
we lost you, chris. we can't hear chris.
operator
mr. olin, are you reconnected, sir?
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
hello?
operator
gentlemen, i believe i did that on my end. i do apologize.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
okay. to be clear, i'm online, right?
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance, chief financial officer, treasurer
yes, you are.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer, director
you are.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
okay. yeah, i'm not sure where i got knocked out there. i wanted to ask about arcadia. there had been some changes in the titanium supply situation here over the past few months. i was wondering if that was an issue for that business on the quarter as well as the issue with covid and kind of louisiana getting hit. just kind of see maybe can you give an update there.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer, director
sure. as far as the starting stock for arcadia for titanium tube supply, not an issue at all. it's a very controlled process in which if processes change in coming, we are deeply involved and our end use customer is deeply involved with that. so we don't see anything there. it will be a very controlled changeover. our people and our supplier are all over that one. so no issue at all.
covid, significant issue, chris, not only in arcadia but in all our facilities. we're doing everything we can: social distancing, staggered shifts, ending shifts early, whatever we need to do to try to protect our people. but it's very difficult. so yes, we have significant issues in arcadia. our team is doing a great job of keeping things going, and i could say that about every facility we have. our offices -- the plant in kokomo going through similar items. it's not just what happens in the plant, obviously. it's what happens when people go out in the public or with families. we're all worried about what happens over thanksgiving. but so far, team has done one heck of a job in keeping things going while working to protect all our employees.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
okay. and, dan, you mentioned the covid-related cost. does that continue into the next year? did you mention that?
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance, chief financial officer, treasurer
yeah, i think those would. i said $250,000 to $300,000 that's related to staggered shifts and teams cleaning different areas, as mike was just kind of referencing there. i think that cost would continue as we continue to try to keep everyone safe and keep everyone separated, and anything we can do to -- to help and protect their health, we're trying to do. so that will have a cost to it, but pretty manageable.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
okay. and then the last question i had was, i thought i recalled ge talking about increasing production of the turbines or maybe the outlook getting less negative. has that helped your business, and are you thinking about that market any different at all?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer, director
on power generation, i say on the mid and small size turbines, as dan said in his prepared remarks, a lot of that's going into oil and gas. so that's certainly down. we finally see nice projections for the large-frame engines, and our alloy content in those is good and continues to grow, especially on the proprietary side. so that's good. so we will see that coming in. as i noted, i think, in one of our responses along here, we no longer see supply chain full of inventory there. so when they start to build, we will feel it. has it come yet? not necessarily, but we do believe it will come. not certainly in huge quantities, not to where it was when we peaked in this market many years ago, but it certainly will begin to improve.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
thanks, again.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer, director
thank you, chris.

with that, let me turn the call over to mike.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer, director
thanks, dave. good morning, everyone.
as our team leads our company through the impact of the pandemic, i thought i would start this call by highlighting some of the positives from this past quarter. while this has been a difficult period, we have executed well, and i'm proud of our team's accomplishments.
first, starting in late march, we prioritized cash generation. after generating $13.1 million in cash in our third quarter, we generated an additional $11.7 million in q4 for a total of $24.8 million in the second half of our fiscal year. we've also developed plans for positive cash generation to continue throughout fiscal 21. next, we have strong liquidity, no debt and $47.2 million in cash in our balance sheet. due to our high level of confidence in operating cash in fiscal '21, we paid off the $30 million precautionary draw on our revolver in september 2020. many years of tightly managing our balance sheet has set us up well to manage our way through the pandemic.
in addition, our team is strategically positioning our company to exit this downturn with a competitive advantage by leveraging our mill direct and service center routes to market. we are building flexible intermediate inventory in the mill to allow for consistently shorter lead times in the future for our high-volume alloys while our service centers are targeting stock for even shorter lead time requirements and small order quantities. we also plan to continue to invest in value-added cutting capacity to provide a high-value differentiated product and therefore build additional competitive advantage. throughout this pandemic, we have stayed in close contact with our customers, continuing to provide what they need when they need it and to gain their insight into current business conditions and future demand requirements.
next, we are pursuing market share gains and have moved from talking about it to achieving it in our industrial gas turbine market segment where we began shipping increased volume to a new customer in q4. in addition, we continue to focus on our value-based pricing for our high-value differentiated products while at the same time seeking to be competitive on the commodity alloy portion of our cpi mix in order to drive volume. our average selling price, both sequentially and year-on-year, has held up well despite the drop in volume. our entire team continues to emphasize the value that we provide via our unique proprietary alloys, our quality, our technical and sales service and our just-in-time inventory.
next, we reacted swiftly after the pandemic began in the us to take costs out of the organization with salary reductions, unpaid furloughs, headcount reductions and other actions to reduce our costs as we managed through the pandemic. while it's difficult to reduce cost in full proportion to our volume reductions because of the many -- many of our costs are fixed, we analyzed all discretionary spending and made very difficult but necessary decisions. although the work on sg&a and volume related cost reductions is very important, also important for the long-term health of our business is the ongoing work to improve yields and lower manufacturing costs. our cost and yield initiatives in q4 are expected to further benefit us as our volume comes back. after the pandemic, these actions should keep us on track to improve our gross margin percent which reached 18% in the two months prior to the pandemic.
in addition, sequentially, our gross margin improved in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, going from 3.3% to 4.9% in spite of volume and revenue declines. this shows our ongoing commitment to reducing costs in this low volume environment. dan will have additional details on this in his financial update.
a couple more positives. our alloy and application work continue to provide high-value opportunities for us in unique applications. we're currently working on opportunities involving both new alloys and new applications for existing alloys. i continue to believe that innovation is a core strength for our company and the foundation of haynes.
our safety rate has continued to improve throughout the year. our process improvement initiatives keep safety front of mind for everyone in our company. i'd like to take a moment to congratulate our arcadia, louisiana, tube facility which completed a full year without a recordable incident in september.
i'm very proud of our team. this has been a difficult eight months for everybody. we've continued to effectively focus on the health and safety of our team while also dealing with the significant business implications of the virus. our team has continued to show focus, termination and leadership.
now a few final summary comments from me on revenue, cost reduction and cash generation before i hand it over to dan. our very low business levels in the second half of 2020 -- fiscal 2020 were challenging and resulted in an unprecedented step-down in revenue levels. we continue to monitor -- monitor the respective markets and look for favorable signs of the recovery. i'll point out that our order entry has begun to improve and move in the right direction from the very low levels we saw in may and june to a slightly higher level in q4. while we have a long way to go, it is certainly a step in the right direction. on the cost and margin side, our past price and variable cost work led to significant gains in year-on-year gross margin percent in q1 and q2 and a reduction in our breakeven point from the much talked about 5 million pounds per quarter to less than 4 million pounds a quarter.
our january and february gross margins of 18% show what we are capable of. however, with our q4 sales volume being just 2.9 million pounds, we are incurring losses, the majority of which can be attributed to the unfavorable fixed cost absorption resulting in direct charges. in addition to the significant reductions in pounds sold from lower demand, we also reduced inventory levels by another 1.1 million pounds in the fourth quarter. this combination of lower sales levels and inventory reduction led to a sizable reduction in pounds produced in our kokomo mill in the fourth quarter. that reduction was 49% year-on-year. we simply cannot spread the fixed costs we have over 50% less produced pounds.
as discussed, we have successfully increased our cash balance since we pivoted to a cash generation focus as the pandemic began to impact all of us. i'd like to talk about the fact that our inventory reductions were done responsibly, meaning that we have our customers' needs as our priority even as we reduce inventory. as an example, despite reducing inventory by 2.8 million pounds in q3 and q4 combined, we actually built a modest amount of strategic work-in-process inventory in our high-volume alloys, allowing for lead time to be reduced to more quickly support our customers when business levels do improve.
i'll now turn it over to dan who will provide more details on our specific markets and on our financial results.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance, chief financial officer, treasurer
thank you, mike.
let me start with a lookback at our quarterly volumes. at the end of last year, fiscal 2019, our fourth quarter volume was 5.4 million pounds, which was the company's highest quarterly volume in four and a half years. moving into fiscal year '20, the first half was impacted by the grounding and production halt of the boeing 737 max lowering aerospace volumes, combined with weak oil prices, which lowered volumes in our chemical processing market. volumes in the first and second quarters were 4.2 million pounds and 4.3 million pounds respectively. the second half of fiscal '20 was then significantly impacted by the covid-19 global pandemic, which lowered volumes in q3 and q4 to 3.2 million pounds and 2.9 million pounds respectively. the fourth quarter volume of 2.9 million pounds represents a 46% reduction from the 5.4 million pounds in last year's fourth quarter.
net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 was $79.9 million.
looking at each of our major markets for the fourth quarter, sales to the aerospace market accounted for 42% of our revenue at $33.6 million. this is a decrease of roughly 17% sequentially from q3 and a decrease of 51% from the same period last year. the pandemic has had significant effects across the aerospace industry, with announced reductions in commercial aerospace build schedules, combined with reductions in repair, maintenance and overhaul activity. complicating the demand situation continues to be the elevated amount of inventory throughout the aerospace supply chain. destocking is expected to continue in fiscal year '20. backlog dollars in aerospace decreased sequentially from q3 to q4 by 16% and down 46% year-over-year.
fourth quarter sales to the chemical processing market accounted for 23% of our revenue at $18.5 million. this is an increase of 52% sequentially from q3, but a decrease of 33% from the same period last year. the sequential increase from the very low level relates to a pickup of shipments into asia. it is also reflective of our approach to seek higher volumes from commodity cpi transactional business with more competitive pricing. this market will continue to be impacted by covid-19 and an environment of low oil prices causing chemical companies to delay their capex spending. backlog dollars in cpi were flat sequentially from q3 to q4, but down 13% year-over-year.
fourth quarter sales into the industrial gas turbine market accounted for 16% of our revenue at $12.4 million. this is a decrease of 9% sequentially from q3 and a decrease of 21% from the same period last year. shipments into this market can be lumpy quarter to quarter. the decrease is attributable to conservative purchasing methods due to covid-19, combined with small and medium-frame engine builds slowing down due to the weakness in the oil industry. our share gain initiative continues. however, given the current economic conditions, the shipments are not yet consistent quarter to quarter. backlog dollars in industrial gas turbines decreased sequentially from q3 to q4 by 15%; however, are up 11% year-over-year.
fourth quarter sales in other markets accounted for 12% of our revenue at $9.2 million. this is a decrease of 17% sequentially from q3 and a decrease of 16% from the same period last year. again, demand was impacted from the effects of the covid-19 pandemic. decreases were largest in the flue-gas desulfurization, automotive and oil and gas markets. backlog dollars in other markets increased slightly from q3 to q4 by 2% and 1% year-over-year.
fourth quarter other revenue accounted for 18% of our revenue at $6.2 million. this is a solid increase of 94% sequentially from q3, but a decrease of 8% from the same period last year. solid toll conversion sales drove the sequential increase both on our four-high rolling mill but also conversion work in our melt shop.
overall, fourth quarter volume was 2.9 million pounds. while this low volume compressed gross margin significantly this quarter, the compression alleviated somewhat from the third quarter by 160 basis points. gross margin in the fourth quarter was 4.9% compared sequentially to the third quarter's 3.3%. this margin expansion occurred even though volumes declined.
the amount of fixed overhead costs that we charge directly to cost of goods sold as opposed to capitalizing into inventory as our plant capacity was underutilized decreased this quarter compared sequentially to last quarter. last quarter's direct charge was $5.9 million in q3, but favorably declined in q4 to $4 million. we are continually and diligently striving to reduce our cost to better align our cost structure to these new lower volume levels. this quarter was also challenged with heavy costs in three different categories: first, increases in inventory reserves of $1.5 million, which was about $500,000 higher than q3 and about $1.1 million higher than last year's fourth quarter; second, costs of roughly $250,000 to $300,000 of covid-related costs such as for staggered shifts, quarantine pay, cleaning tasks and cleaning supplies; and third, additional severance-related cost of approximately $300,000 in the fourth quarter.
in total, we have reduced headcount by roughly 183 as of october 31, 2020 or 15% of our global workforce. this equates to approximately $14 million in annualized salaries, wages and fringes. in addition, during the fourth quarter, the executive team and the board of directors continued their 10% pay reduction and salaried employees continued their one-week unpaid furloughs.
sg&a, including research and technical expense, was $9.1 million in the fourth quarter. sg&a was reduced this quarter due to the reversal of incentive compensation accruals of $1.2 million, which was accrued in prior quarters, but fully reversed in the fourth quarter. excluding this reduction, sg&a was $10.3 million as compared to last year's fourth quarter of $12.5 million or a reduction of 18%.
three additional points to finish out the p&l. first, non-operating retirement benefit expense on the p&l was $1.7 million, which nearly doubled compared to last year's numbers as we have talked about previously. but we have some good news for fiscal '21. in a moment, i will further discuss our new valuation and next year's expense. the second item to finish off the p&l, interest expense in the fourth quarter, was slightly lower as we repaid the precautionary draw on our revolver, which occurred mid-march. and third, our effective tax rate was adjusted lower this quarter to 21.2% as we finalized our year-end tax provision. all of that resulted in a net loss for the quarter of $5.7 million, which sequentially improved by $2.4 million.
let me circle back to the topic of our recent valuation at september 30, 2020, of our pension and retiree medical plans. the actuarial valuation was favorable. although the valuation included a reduction of the discount rate used to measure the plan liabilities, which is unfavorable, it was offset by favorable items, including higher-than-expected return on plan assets for the pension plan and favorable retiree healthcare spending as we have been actively managing our retiree healthcare costs. this is expected to significantly reduce non-cash expense in fiscal '21 by $2.2 million for the pension plan and $3.4 million for the retiree healthcare plan. this combined $5.6 million will be reflected primarily as a reduction of non-operating retirement benefit expense in the p&l in fy '21.
moving to backlog. while we have experienced low order entry levels, primarily due to the pandemic, order entry rates slightly increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 compared to the third quarter but still below shipment rates. backlog was $153.3 million at september 30, 2020, a decrease of $21.3 million or 12% from the $174.6 million at june 30. for the full fiscal year, backlog decreased $81.9 million or 35% from the $235.2 million at september 30, 2019.
capital spending was $9.4 million in fiscal '20, and the forecast for capital spending in fiscal '21 is $10 million, which continues to represent a level well below our depreciation levels.
liquidity. the company had cash of $47.2 million and zero borrowings against the credit facility as of september 30, 2020. the company repaid the $30 million precautionary draw on the revolver in september, due in part to generating $24.8 million in cash in the last six months of the fiscal year, primarily from inventory reductions and the company's confidence in its ability to generate future cash and its overall liquidity position. in addition, subsequent to year-end, in october of 2020, the company replaced the $120 million credit facility set to expire in july of '21 with a new $100 million credit facility expiring in three years. the new credit facility contains an accordion feature that permits an increase up to $170 million at the request of the borrower if certain conditions are met. you can find the details of our new credit facility in our filings with the sec.
outlook for next quarter. we continue to experience market uncertainty driven by the covid-19 global pandemic. we expect revenue in the first quarter of fiscal '21 to be lower than the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic as well as the typical end-of-year holiday-related business slowdown, maintenance schedules and customers managing their calendar year-end balance sheets. earnings for the first quarter cannot be estimated during this time of unprecedented market and economic conditions, low volumes and unfavorable fixed cost absorption. we expect to continue to generate cash from inventory reduction in fiscal '21, and we continue to position the company favorably for the recovery.
in conclusion, looking forward, we continue to see significant demand challenges ahead. despite these challenges, we continue to feel that we are well positioned to weather this period driven by our ongoing efforts to align our cost structure and inventory levels to current demand levels. with inventory levels at $246 million at september 30, 2020, which is 65% of fy '20 sales, we believe additional inventory reduction is achievable. the strategy is expected to yield an increase in cash balance over fiscal year 2021.
mike, with that, i will now turn the discussion back over to you.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer, director
thanks, dan.
this has been a stressful time, obviously for the world, our country, our families and our businesses. i again want to thank our employees. they all continued to push forward, initially to protect the health of our employees, and obviously that's ongoing, and then to jointly lead haynes through these turbulent times by pivoting to cash generation, focusing on what differentiates us from the competition and implementing the actions required related to our key metrics for success.
with that, jim, let's open the call for questions.

operator
certainly. [operator instructions] your first question is coming from stephen o'hara. your line is live.
stephen michael o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking the question.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
hi, steve. hope you're well.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
hi, steve.
stephen michael o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
yeah, you too. i mean, i know it's been a challenging period for you guys, and it seems like you guys have done a really great job kind of maintaining the balance sheet, generating cash. and you talked about kind of the previous gross margin work that you've done. can you talk about maybe, is there a way to frame kind of without that work done in the past, and where we'd be today? i mean, it would seem like that work could be a lot more difficult, maybe a lot more painful in the face of a downturn, obviously necessary. but is there a way to kind of think about without that where we'd be today?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
let me just put it in perspective for you. we were -- again, we could all through '17 and through '18, we couldn't make money unless we hit 5 million pounds shipped a quarter. and when you look at our history, 5 million pounds is not that common, which is why we're losing money through '17 and '18. we obviously focused on price and we focused on our relentless cost reduction. and i think, the most telling signal for us is, once the 737 issue hit before the pandemic hid, our volume dropped from 4 million to 5 million to about 4.2 million pounds a quarter. and even with that, we were wrapping up pre-pandemic times at about 18% gross margin. so, significant difference from where we were when we started this thing, and obviously, when we look back at where we could be, if we had not made those improvements there would be a concern.
stephen michael o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, now that's helpful. and then just, i don't think this is the case, but i mean, you guys haven't received, i mean, again i think the cash flow is pretty significant, and obviously, i think that you guys have done a great job there. i mean, there is no -- i mean, there is no government stimulus in there or anything like that or cares act benefits or anything, is that kind of -- is that the fact?
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
that's correct.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
that's correct. we did not take any kind of a ppp loan or anything like that. i mean, there is a little bit of deferral of payroll taxes, paying those, but that's not significant.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer 
the team has done, steve, i think a real good job of not only reducing inventory, but very closely monitoring our payables and receivables. and obviously, that's led to real nice cash generation since this thing began [speech overlap] cash flow every day.
stephen michael o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. now, that's helpful. and then maybe last one, and i'll jump back in queue. but, just i mean, if you listen to the airlines, it sounds like they expect capacity to be kind of well above where demand is, their liquidity is. i think united's was about 3 times what it was in march as of 4q. and i'm just kind of curious, i mean, does that help at all? i mean, are you starting to see maybe some more positivity there just based on the capacity coming back? and then maybe that's kind of the precursor to getting some of these maxs back in fleets and getting that production started again? or is that kind of just maybe wishful thinking at this point based on what you're hearing from the customers?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
i think, it's going to take a little while for inventory in the supply chain to come down. i mean, when you -- i love the positive comments we've all read about pent-up demand and all the rest of that, but i also check as we all do almost every door every day, the number of flyers going through tsa checkpoints, and that is continuing to be very low. the facts are the airlines were little below 50% fewer flights in' 20 versus '19, passenger traffic is down 67% in 2020. the number of flights operated in 2020 was the lowest level since 1999. so, you put those things into account and then you look at what was supposed to happen with the leap engine for the a320 and the max, and the amount of material in the supply chain. bottom line is people need to start flying again. and my view is we're certainly in the early stages of the vaccine. but as the vaccine comes and as people start flying again, then obviously, there's going to be great interest in starting to build aircraft. and the only advantage of having -- being on this end of the supply chain. one of the advantages is when they believe that demand will come, will feel it very quickly because of lead times. so it's going to take some time. we're expecting probably plus or minus six months to start seeing aerospace orders come in, based on what we see in the inventory supply chain, but it is going to take some time to get there.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
and one thing i might add to that is, we talk about how we're positioning ourselves for the upturn, and just our basic business model as mike mentioned in his prepared remarks, being a mill and service center. having inventory on the ground in a service center will allow customers to order smaller lots if they want to start slow on this demand recovery, but that will help us immediately through the service center. so we're prepared for the upturn, and can we afford to be here? obviously, the vaccine and the max flying, again i think are very positive things, but it will still take some time.
stephen michael o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, all right, thanks. i'll jump back in queue.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
thanks, steve.

thank you. your next question is coming from michael leshock. your line is live.
michael leshock -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey, mike and dan, good morning.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
good morning, how are you.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
good morning.
michael leshock -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
doing well. so you said you're at or near the bottom, you think. that said, i just wanted to get your take on how you're thinking about potentially bringing back some of the head count in terms of your hiring cadence over the next several quarters if we get a recovery here? and if you could provide any color as well on the cost cuts you've taken during the pandemic in terms of how much will be coming back versus being structural, that would be helpful?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
sure. we got to look at where we are capacity wise or volume wise. we're down in a wire facility, a third. we're down in kokomo, our produced pounds down about 50%. and in our tube facility, they're down even more. so when you look at that, in the january to november time period, we took out 211 people, which is 17% of our overall workforce.
so two points on that. number one, we will be slow to bring people back because you want to make sure what we begin to see is real. so we are going to make sure both on the production side and on the salary side that we take full advantage of the employees we have, and be very careful when we bring people back. again, the key here for me, especially in aerospace, is the slope. we're not sure how fast this will happen. we read everything that everyone else reads, so we're going to take this a little bit of the time. on the salary side, we'll certainly continue to bring people in that are going to help us on continuing to promote our high-value differentiated products, but it will be slow to bring many salaried people back.
michael leshock -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and i wanted to get your take on the recent push-outs by boeing and airbus, specifically on the slower than expected ramps on the max and a320, and you talked about the leap engine, but also on the 777x, i know you have proprietary alloys there on the ge9x. so how -- and to what extent did you anticipate some sort of slowing here based on what you've heard from the supply chain? and are you seeing any hesitancy within customers because of these announcements?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
we've done, as we've talked about before, the leap engine for single-aisle is really the key metric for us, and watching the leap and what happens with the leap and what happens with the builds there is significant. and i think many in the industry are saying somewhere in the range of about 850 leap engines being built in the year we're now. and it's interesting when we've done the math multiple times. if you assume that there is no change whatsoever in current build schedules, said another way, 40 airbus, 40 a320s and 10 boeing planes, that's 797 planes plus spares. if you think -- if you go with the, what i now would say is an aggressive look, which is airbus getting to 47 within six months, which none of us think is going to happen and boeing getting to 17 within six months, which anyone could take a bit on that, that's 929, so -- plus spares. so the 850 [phonetic] is a most likely level for us, and that's what we're planning on and that's why we think there is still six to nine months in the supply chain.
as far as 777 and the genx, it's disappointing. we  our whole fundamental business model is all about, proprietary alloys, and as we've talked about, and i'm sure everyone is tired of hearing. we have two proprietary alloys in the genx, ge9x engine, and that's significant for us. and that being pushed out to 2023 is a concern, but we continue to go after the other business and continue to look for ways to develop new alloys for next generation engines elsewhere.
michael leshock -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. that's really helpful. and then just lastly for me on capex. it was pretty low in the quarter. i think of your base maintenance around $8 million to $10 million annually. is that a fair range? and how do you see that trending? thanks.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
yeah, well as far as long-term trends, we've spent the money we need to spend, in particular in the aerospace business, with our $120 million we invested between 2012 in 2018, plus or minus. so we believe and we've said, next three to five years in that range, we'll be well below depreciation in that $10 million plus or minus range. and what we said publicly is about $10 million this year. so we're going to stick to that for now, got off to a slow start, but there is plenty of people banging on my door and dan's door as far as money that they need to spend. so i think, $10 million is a good maintenance number for us. i think below that is a concern. but i don't think we'll get above that.
michael leshock -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. thank you. thank you.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question is coming from chris olin. your line is live.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
okay.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
hi, chris.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
yeah. sorry about that. good morning.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
good morning.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
good morning.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
so dan. i was wondering if you, maybe i missed it, provided any information regarding special projects where we're at outlook, i guess just to tie on that. should we assume that those numbers are going to stay low for a couple of quarters until -- until capex budgets come back up.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
yeah. i mentioned special projects this quarter. they were about $4.4 million, a little down from q4 by about $1.5 million. and if you look at last year, we had a really good quarter last year in q1, had about $8.5 million last year. so the delta, q1 to q1 is a little over $4 million in special projects.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
hey, chris. let me add some additional color to that. you know in these times, we're all looking for some positives, and when we dove [phonetic] in the special projects, the numbers that dan is talking about, what we really found is there is really two components in there. there is the lower-end more commoditized alloys that are in there that we are helping our customers getting the applications in our upgrades for them, but they're relatively high volume and to be honest, they're relatively low margin. so we decided between dan, and thank you ishwar and myself, that we would take a second slice of special projects. so, by the way, just to back up special projects for us as we talk about our non-aerospace, typically theyre cpi and other.
so what we did, and this is a different slice for you. as we looked at just the proprietary and specialty alloys, not the commodities that were in there, that we did drive in applications. and what's interesting in fiscal '20 versus 19, they were up 24% and in fiscal '21 versus '20, they're about flat. so what is not in there is a lot of the more -- the products that we drove in applications, but the more commoditized products. so i feel good about our team continuing to drive the high-value differentiated products even in these tough times. sorry for the long answer, but it's a different way to look at it.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer 
yeah. and when we look at special projects without some of those commoditized alloys, the margin that we track on it definitely goes up. so what we're looking at here are the higher profitable special projects.
chris olin -- tier4 research  analyst 
interesting. okay. mike, you were talking about market share wins on the igt side and kind of your success there. we've seen some movement within your competitive space in terms of people targeting different products, different mixes. i'm just wondering how you feel about protecting that market share going forward?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
i feel really good about it, chris. and you really have to take it by a market, ok. we've talked about power generation, ok. and we have -- we obviously cannot name our customer, but we've gained for us significant share in that market, and i love it, because dan and i talked about it and then it actually happened. so that was a real good thing. also, we've got an alloy called 282, one of our proprietary alloys with an igt, which is being specked in to make engines more efficient, both in new engines in certain categories and will be eventually with some spare parts. so feel really good about our share growing in igt. in aerospace, we follow with every customer, every every contract we have. and obviously, on the transactional side, there's going to be pluses and minus, there always is every day. but contract side, we renegotiated in january, 10% to 15% of our contracts, which is all the high-value differentiated products. we did not lose anything there. so feel really good about where we are in aerospace.
chemical processing, it's really the world of two different groups of products there. on the special project side, again in this market, to grow from 20 to 21 and stay stable, 21 versus 20 so far. we feel great about that. on the commodity side, the c alloy side of this for us in cpi. we see people going after some larger or some intermediate sized projects they hadn't gone over before, so i won't be surprised on the cpi side if temporarily we've lost a few orders. but that is not unusual, as companies get aggressive. and i can tell you based on history, they will be back to us.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
last question, just kind of tying into the inventory comments you've made regarding aerospace. i was just wondering if you could separate it between the tubing, the titanium tubing business and nickel alloys? is there a difference between how you see the inventory playing out or are they same?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
yeah. good question. we've seen as far as cancellations, and i'll use that as an example, because cancellations typically go with what's going on with inventory in the backlog. we've seen that most nickel and cobalt cancellations are behind us. but we're still seeing on the airframe side cancellations, which we expect to go on for probably another six months plus or minus. so my -- i also believe there was a real demand crunch pre-pandemic on titanium tubing. so i think there was -- on the airframe side, there was a lot of inventory builds beyond even everywhere else. so i see titanium tubing taking longer to come back than i see engine business coming back.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
okay. that's what i thought. thanks a lot. i appreciate it.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question is coming from stephen o'hara. your line is live.
stephen michael o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
yeah, hi. thanks for taking a follow-up. just on the -- moving back to kind of trends in aerospace and things like that. i mean, if we think about the trend towards esg and green technology, things like that. i mean, it seems like most industries including airlines have made some pretty -- you might say grandiose projections back -- how little carbon theyll emit within certain periods of time. is that -- does that trend, i mean the trend, obviously i think is real. but i mean, did that trend benefit haynes, as the technology needed to make engines more efficient, whether it's either to save money or to cut emissions. i mean, does that benefit you guys long-term? is that a long-term secular trend that benefits you guys?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
the answer is yes. and it's not only aerospace, but it's power generation. the use of our 282 alloy being specked into a fair amount of power generation engines is allowing for more efficiency. so when we talk about esg and the environmental side of esg, we're not only talking about what we're trying to do within our company, but we're talking about the impact it has in aerospace engines being more fuel-efficient, being able to burn hotter because of being able to use some of these unique alloys. so it definitely helps. and it's also no different than what we've got going into the ge9x engine and what's happening there. so yeah, i think it helps.
and then when you take a longer-term view of this thing and look at -- okay, what's going to happen in 10 years, okay. is hydrogen going to play a bigger role in this? we've got our technical people all over trying to understand the role of hydrogen in power generation technology and engine technology going forward and how we felt the need there. so yeah, we feel really good about that.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer 
then if you think about the hydrocarbon industry now, oil and gas, we have some slight exposure to that, but not a huge exposure for us. oil and gas is not one of our major markets. so kind of the shift away from that is not going to be that big of a take away for us, but certainly see some gains on the other side.
stephen michael o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay, all right, thank you very much for the time.

operator
good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to haynes international inc. first quarter fiscal 2021 financial results conference call. [operator instructions]
it is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, david van bibber. sir, the floor is yours.
david van bibber -- controller and chief accounting officer
thank you very much for joining us today. with me today are mike shor, president and ceo of haynes international; and dan maudlin, vice president and chief financial officer. before we get started, i would like to read a brief cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements. this conference call contains statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation and reform act of 1995 and section 21e of the securities and exchange act of 1934. the words believe, anticipate, plan and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. although we believe our plans, intentions and expectations regarding or suggested by such forward-looking statements are reasonable, such statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and we can provide no assurances such plans, intentions or expectations will be achieved. many of these risks are discussed in detail in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission, in particular, form 10-k for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2020. the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
with that, let me turn the call over to mike.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
thanks, dave. good morning, everyone. it's interesting for me to take a step back and look at where we've been since the pandemic began, and where i believe we are headed. six months ago, during the q3 earnings call, we discussed the significant impact that the pandemic-driven volume reduction was having on our business. at that point, we were still in the discovery phase of understanding how far volume would drop. three months ago, during the q4 earnings call, we highlighted the actions that we were taking to stabilize our business during these very difficult times. while visibility is still unclear, our recent conversations with customers as well as our recent order entry trends, leads us to believe that q1 is at or near the bottom of this unprecedented downturn.
this quarter, as compared to last year's q1, has volume down 34% and revenue downed 33.4%. gross margin percent this quarter was a volume-impacted 1.4% versus 17.3% last year. net loss this quarter was $8 million, compared to net income of $3.3 million last year. these are difficult numbers for us to see. they reflect the full weight of the pandemic. as a team, we are focusing our attention on properly positioning our company for the future. we believe that this would begin the process of emerging from the downturn, we do so with strong business fundamentals. i'm proud of our entire team for accomplishing what we committed to, both before and during the pandemic, specifically related to gross margin, significantly lowering our breakeven volume and cash generation.
i'll now provide a few comments on each of these areas. our previous work on improving gross margins was critical to our long-term success. we achieved 18% gross margin prior to the start of the pandemic, expanding our quarter-on-quarter gross margin percent by 670 basis points in q1 of fiscal '20, and by 580 basis points in q2 of fiscal '20. this was accomplished by our team's focus on pricing for value and relentless cost reductions. an important point achieving 18% was not an endpoint for gross margin percent progress, but it was a great step in the right direction. we believe that our efforts to significantly improve our gross margin will result in a substantially lower volume breakeven for haynes. and based on this, we believe that a return to profitability can occur at much lower volume levels than what we exhibited in fiscal years' 2017 and 2018.
the quarterly data from '17 and '18 show that our company could not be profitable unless we shipped at least 5 million pounds a quarter. based on the cost reduction and pricing for value work accomplished by our entire workforce, we believe that our breakeven volume should now be below 4 million pounds, meaning, that our breakeven should be reduced by at least 20%. while our current level of losses due to just 2.8 million pounds being shipped in the quarter are of concern. we are focused on the positive impact that our work should have on the speed in which our company can return to profitability.
as the pandemic came to the u.s., we pivoted to cash generation driven by responsible inventory reduction. we generated $24.8 million in the last half of fiscal '20, and an additional $14 million in cash has now been generated in our fiscal '21 q1. everyone in our team has a role to play in this, and we believe that we will continue to reduce inventory and hold a solid cash position in fiscal year '21. in addition to our cost, cash and pricing initiatives, both our performance on alloy and application development and our technical and sales service, in my opinion, are second to none in this industry. since we are both a mill and a global distributor of our products, we're able to provide our customers with unique alloys and products, just-in-time deliveries, small quantities, and value-added cutting capabilities. our customer-focused actions and capabilities continue to be core competencies and key differentiators for haynes, and position us very well with our customers, for the recovery from this pandemic.
we understand that the path back to the commercial aerospace levels we saw in 2019 will take time. but we believe that as vaccines and confidence in safe air travel expand, we will all want to fly again, and the commercial aerospace sector will once again show sustained growth. the only question is the timing and slope of the improvement in the commercial aerospace build schedules. we also expect to see modest growth in both the cpi and igt markets, as the general economy begins to open back up from the pandemic. our recent share gains in the igt market has helped offset the decline in this industry. industrial activity also seems to be picking up. overall, we're starting to see the first signs of improvement. coding activity is up, and additional pockets of demand now exist. these data points signal that improvement may be ahead.
wrapping up my comments, i believe that our team has positioned us very well for the future. our focus is clear. we are a customer-focused technical and sales solutions provider for high-value differentiated nickel and cobalt-based alloys. we help our customers solve their manufacturing and process-related issues through the supply of high-value alloys, along with best-in-class technical and sales support. our formula for success is understood by our entire workforce, safety, speed, agility, quality, alloy and applications, engineering, differentiated products, and outstanding customer service. this is what will continue to separate us from the competition.
with that, i'll now hand the call over to dan.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
thank you, mike. volume shipped in the first quarter of fiscal '21 was 2.8 million pounds, a reduction of 1.4 million pounds or 33.9% from the same period last year, and a 5.2% reduction sequentially from the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. this significantly lower produced and shipped volume continues to be the primary issue impacting our financial results. many of our customers are in a cash preservation mode, which resulted in conservative quarter entry trends, combined that was elevated inventory throughout the supply chain, particularly in aerospace, also contributed to lower volumes. sales to the aerospace market accounted for 34% of our revenue at $24.6 million. this is a decrease of roughly 27% sequentially from q4, and a decrease of 58% from the same period last year.
the aerospace market has been the most impacted by the pandemic, with reductions in commercial aerospace build schedules and reductions in repair, maintenance and overhaul activity. complicating the demand situation continues to be the elevated amount of inventory throughout the aerospace supply chain. destocking is expected to continue during fiscal '21. notable milestones in the aerospace industry include the start of the vaccine rollout and its impact on people's confidence to fly again, combined with the recertification of the boeing 737 max to fly. as mike mentioned, it's expected to still take time to get back to pre-pandemic aerospace levels. backlog dollars in aerospace decreased sequentially from q4 to q1 by 11%, and down 51% year-over-year.
first quarter sales to the chemical processing market accounted for 21% of our revenue at $15.3 million. this is a decrease of 18% sequentially from q4, and a decrease of 9% from the same period last year. demand in this market continues to be impacted by covid-19, and generally the lower oil prices causing chemical companies to delay their capex spending. the commodity side of this market is highly competitive, with many producers seeking volume. special project revenue, most of which is reflected in chemical processing was $4.4 million, which is a $1.5 million lower than the fourth quarter and $4.1 million lower than the same period last year. backlog dollars in cpi increased slightly by 2.4% in q4 to q1, but is down 7% year-over-year.
first quarter sales to the industrial gas turbine market accounted for 19% of our revenue at $14 million. this is an increase of 12% sequentially from q4 and an increase of 1.5% from the same period last year. our share gain initiative continues to help volumes. however, volumes can still be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, and this market was impacted by the pandemic. we expect modest growth in industrial gas turbines as conditions slowly improve. backlog dollars in industrial gas turbines decreased sequentially from q4 to q1 by 10% and down 25% year-over-year.
first quarter sales to other markets accounted for 18% of our revenue at $12.8 million. this is an increase of 38% sequentially from q4 and an increase of 8% from the same period last year. this increase was driven by flue-gas desulfurization applications this quarter. backlog dollars in other markets increased sequentially from q4 to q1 by 22%, and were also up 22% year-over-year. first quarter other revenue accounted for 8% of our revenue at $5.6 million. this is a decrease of 9% sequentially from q4 and a decrease of 23% from the same period last year. the decrease was due to toll conversion, including toll customers that have exposure to the aerospace industry.
the overall low volume of 2.8 million pounds resulted in significant compression in gross margins in the first quarter of fiscal '21 to 1.4%. the company continues to face the industrywide challenge of reducing spending commensurate with reductions in production volume in this current environment. in addition to low volume shipped during the quarter, the company also reduced inventory by $9.8 million or 4% during the quarter, which further reduced production volume in our plants and reduced the utilization of our equipment.
in the first quarter, the company charged $5.9 million directly to cost of sales for excess fixed cost overhead per pound incurred due to abnormally low production levels that could not be capitalized in the inventory. this direct charge of $5.9 million compares to zero in the first quarter of fiscal '20, and $4 million sequentially in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. we are continually and diligently striving to reduce our cost to better align our cost structure to these lower volumes. this effort is balanced with keeping employees safe related to covid-19. last quarter, we reported covid-related costs at roughly $250,000 to $300,000 that were for staggered shifts, quarantine pay, cleaning tasks and cleaning supplies. this quarter, this is up moderately due to some additional precautionary quarantine cases that we had this quarter in an effort to keep everyone safe.
sg&a, including research and technical expense was $10.5 million in the first quarter, as compared to last year's first quarter of $12.4 million, or a reduction of 15%. just a reminder, that sequentially last quarter, sg&a in q4 of '20 was reduced by $1.2 million due to the reversal of incentive compensation accruals. excluding this reversal, sg&a was $10.3 million in q4, similar to this year's q1.
two additional points to finish out the p&l. first, the non-operating retirement benefit expense in the p&l was $1.3 million lower in the first quarter as compared to the same period last year. as i reported last quarter, our actuarial valuation was favorable due to lower retiree healthcare spending, as we have been actively managing our retiree healthcare costs and higher-than-expected return on plan assets with the pension plan. and secondly, our effective tax rate was 21.2% in the first quarter of fiscal '21 as compared to 26% in the same period last year. this lower effective tax rate is unfavorable due to our pre-tax loss. all of this resulted in a net loss for the quarter of $8 million, which as mike put it, is difficult for us to see, and reflects the full-weight of the pandemic.
as far as our outlook for next quarter, we continue to experience market uncertainty due to the covid-19 global pandemic. while visibility is still unclear, conversations with customers as well as recent order entry trends lead us to believe that our first quarter volumes and revenue are at or near the bottom of this unprecedented downturn. earnings for the second quarter cannot be accurately estimated during this time of market and economic unpredictability, low volumes, and unfavorable fixed cost absorption. we expect to continue our solid liquidity throughout fiscal '21 and to be favorably positioned for the recovery.
moving to backlog, backlog was $145.1 million at december 31, '20, a decrease of $8.1 million or 5.3% from the $153.3 million at september 30, 2020. backlog dollars --i'm sorry -- backlog pounds increased sequentially during the first quarter by 2.2% as compared to september 30, offset by a decrease in average selling price reflected, reflecting a change in the product mix. liquidity, as we increased -- we increased cash $14.1 million this quarter, driving total balance sheet cash to $61.3 million at december 31, 2020, compared to $47.1 million at september 30, '20. our increase in cash was largely attributed -- attributable to reducing our inventory by $9.8 million to $236.3 million at december 31. additionally, there were zero borrowings against the line of credit.
as we mentioned in our last earnings call, we have refinanced our credit facility to a three-year agreement, and now have $100 million of borrowing capacity if needed. capital spending during the first three months of fiscal '21 was $1.1 million, and total planned capital expenditures for fiscal ' 21 are expected to be approximately $10 million, to allow for maintaining reliability within our operations.
in conclusion, these are challenging times, but they are temporary, and we believe that we are at or near the bottom of this unprecedented time period. since pivoting to cash, we have generated $38.9 million, that's $24.8 million in the second half of fiscal '20, and an additional $14.1 million this quarter. we believe our liquidity is strong with the ability to weather this period, and we are well positioned for the expected future improvement in demand in our markets.
mike, with that, i will now turn the discussion back over to you.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
thank you, dan. i want to thank all of you for your continued interest in haynes, and your patience as we weather these unprecedented times. i, again, also want to thank our employees. together, we continue to work on protecting the health of our workforce, on enhancing what differentiates haynes from our competition and on implementing the actions required related to our key metrics for success.
with that, matthew, lets open the call up for some questions.
",2021-Q1,HAYN
1.0,1.0,,,":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from steve o'hara, with sidoti & company. please state your question.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
yes. hi. good morning. thanks for taking the question.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
sure. no problem.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
i guess just quickly on the -- it looked like prices declined in the quarter, average pricing, i guess, sequentially. and i'm just -- when i think about raw material costs, you noted higher raw material costs, i think, was a benefit to margin, and raw material costs, i think, have gone up kind of across the board. how does that -- i guess i'm just trying to figure out how that jives with the pricing going down in the quarter.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
steve, pricing is not necessarily an indication of mix or, for that matter, of profitability. what happened, obviously, is we were being hit with significant direct charges because of our fixed costs and our lack of volume. we continue to go after some business, which would allow us to absorb some of those costs in our plant. so to me, it's more of a mix than anything else, which is what caused the price to go down.
but overall, we feel really good about what's happening. and in fact, when you look at the gross margin, given the lack of aerospace, we feel real good about where that's going.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
yes. and i can add on to that, as well. if you look at kind of the detail by market, you can see that our other markets is really where there was a pretty large decrease in the average selling price. and there's really mix related within that other markets category. there's some flue gas desulfurization projects, for example, that we had shipments on this quarter, which that's a certain alloy that has a lower average selling price.
so from a mix point of view, certainly, the incremental increase in volume that we got, which was very beneficial, obviously, to revenue and to margins, with better absorption, from a mix point of view that was a bit of a headwind just related to that incremental volume being at slightly lower-valued alloys, in some cases.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
i am sorry. let me just add back in. what we're very cautious of and what we did very well in my mind through the downturn is in the high-value portion of our mix there were no reductions in our selling prices through this. so what we did to pursue volume is obviously more on the cpi side, get aggressive on some transactional business when needed. but overall, as far as pricing, going forward, we feel great about where we are ltas and what the capability is going forward.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
yes. and i'll also mention, you had brought up raw materials. raw material, nickel, obviously up, and cobalt, but nickel being the bigger impact. and that was kind of a moderate tailwind for us. we have escalators and de-escalators on our contracts and try to offset that as much as we can. but it was a tailwind to margins of around $1 million, roughly. and i think i mentioned in my prepared remarks that nickel has come back down. so that's probably going to neutralize next quarter. but it was a small, maybe $1 million, improvement in margin.
the big thing is the volume and the lower direct charge and the better absorption of those fixed costs.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. that's very helpful. just maybe on the out-of-period costs. they came down a lot in the quarter, volumes ticked up. is there an expectation going forward for those? and then does that help cost of goods sold, going forward, and make kind of margins a little bit better than they normally would be? or does that keep margins kind of where they should be, going forward, because of these costs?
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
the direct charge is going to keep margins where they should be. what it is, it's not really out-of-period costs, at all. it's fixed related costs that we incur in the quarter and, normally, maybe capitalize them into inventory. and as the inventory is sold, it's recognized in cost of sales. however, when your volume is so low, you can't capitalize that much per pound. so those have to be kind of direct-charged to the p&l rather than capitalized in inventory.
so it's not out-of-period cost necessarily, and it's not unusual costs. it's kind of normal related, mostly fixed type costs that you can't vary with volume. so that is expected to reduce as volume improves. the more volume we get, the more that goes down and diminishes until it goes to zero.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. and then lastly, just would you guys -- with the potential infrastructure bill, is that something that you guys would benefit from? or not really? what parts of your industries might benefit?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
i think the benefit is an indirect benefit with the infrastructure build, more jobs, more travel, more energy use, and the ability for, obviously, us to take advantage as commercial aircraft travel continues to move forward. so to us, because of the nature of our alloys, which are for severe corrosion applications and high-temperature applications, not necessarily directly, but i would say indirectly i think everyone will benefit.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
and especially things like the base chemicals going into housing and different things. like, our applications for acetic acid, that goes into adhesives, that goes into paint, that goes into things that a general improvement in the economy and infrastructure will be helpful for us. so an indirect impact, for sure.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. thanks. [indecipherable]
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
thanks, steve.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from michael leshock, with keybanc. please state your question.
michael leshock -- keybanc -- analyst
hey, mike and dan. good morning.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
good morning, mike. how are you?
michael leshock -- keybanc -- analyst
good. first, i just wanted to ask on labor. i wanted to get your take on how much of the headcount reductions you expect to bring back when volumes improve. and do you have a rough ballpark of maybe where volumes need to be before you start bringing some of that labor back?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
sure. on the salaried side, when we went through the reductions we went through, they're obviously always extremely difficult to go through. and we will do our best to make sure that when we bring back, it will be at a relatively slow pace on the salaried side. we've rightsized, and we feel very good about that.
on the production side, in particular, in kokomo, we have begun to bring back production and maintenance employees. we have seen great activity in our bookings both in february and march and, in fact, also in april. and so with that, we want to be prepared.
i believe one of the keys in this industry going forward is short lead times. customers don't want excessive inventory. and so what we are doing is we're bringing back the people that we need, in particular, in our primary operations to ensure that we can maintain shorter lead times and maintain what we call our supermarket, which is our high-volume, high-moving intermediate stock of very popular grades.
so we don't have everyone back, but we have begun the process of bringing people back. my hope is that we get to the point we bring everyone back as our volume continues to improve.
michael leshock -- keybanc -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then what impact did you see from winter storms? i know your arcadia facility was down for a bit but did that cause anything to be pushed into the current quarter?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
no. it wasn't easy, in particular, in arcadia, with the ice and the storms that they felt, but our team did an outstanding job down there of making sure, number one, they kept our employees safe, kept them off the roads, and then brought them back to work and caught up. so we feel very good about that. no real impact either from the customers we serve in that region. so i would say nonissue for us.
michael leshock -- keybanc -- analyst
okay. then lastly, just wanted to get your take what you've been seeing on the max platform in terms of order activity. obviously, it's still early innings in the ramp, but have you seen any pickup, just given max is about 8% of normalized volumes?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
we have had an increasing amount of communication with our customers who, number one, are beginning to slowly place orders; number two, getting their places in line; and number three, as i mentioned related to the leap, beginning to make sure that we've got the manpower and capacity we need.
the statement that i made in my script is very significant. at this point, it appears by the end of 2022 calendar year that the 1b, obviously, the 737 engine from leap, the 1b engine will be back to 20 engines a week, which is getting us back to 2019 levels.
so when you look at the tsa numbers, they're coming back very strong. i was always hoping to get over one million passengers a day through tsa. and now we rarely see below 1.2 million or 1.3 million.
so we believe that engine production on the leap, which is obviously single-aisle, will come back very strong and be back on a weekly basis to where it was in '19 in '22. and of course, we're the beginning of this process. so we expect to see orders mid-'21 to support that.
so optimistic and thrilled. the customers are pushing us to make sure we've got the low lead times that we need to support them.
michael leshock -- keybanc -- analyst
great. thank you.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from steve o'hara. please state your question.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
yes. hi. thanks for taking the follow-up.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
sure.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
i just want to see if i understood correctly. in terms of the volumes going forward, is it safe to assume where you stand right now, you should see volumes improve sequentially from here or at least not go down from here? and then what about the cash on the balance sheet? what's the plan there? or will that be used up as you invest in working capital?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
i'll talk first about the volume, and then dan will talk about the cash. okay?
as far as volumes, as we said in our guidance, we expect q3 to be similar to q2 as far as our results, including our revenues. we do expect to see and we have seen some bookings increase, and we expect that to continue to grow as we move forward.
remember, our aerospace business year-on-year is down 48%. and so we do believe that's going to start to improve as we hit midyear and beyond. but remember, bookings have to turn into manufactured product to ship, which is why that will move out toward later in the year.
dan will cover the [indecipherable].
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
and on cash, that's my favorite subject, we monitor this every day and very proud of our strategy of when we pivoted to cash, how much we've been able to generate, as i mentioned. since this pandemic began, we've generated $47.4 million. so a number nearly $70 million on the balance sheet now.
now going forward, we're expecting, as we mentioned, kind of sequentially revenue in the same neighborhood as q2. so as we start to look beyond and we think about the aerospace ramp-up later in the calendar year, there's going to be some investment in working capital that will be required. we're going to do that very carefully and try to make that a pretty consistent cash across the quarters. but we want to grow with that top line. we want to grow with demand. and if that takes some investment of working capital to get there, then we can do that. but we'll be very careful about it and expect it to be pretty flat across the next couple of quarters.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. great. and then you said, i think, 2019 levels by 2023 in terms of the production for the engines, the leap engine. and how soon -- so if you expect a recovery, let's say, if we get back to 2019 levels in 2023, what's a typical time period for that to start to hit your books? i think the inventory is pretty lean in the channel. would that make it earlier than typical? or are people maybe a little more cautious, given what we've gone through?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
i think we've got to divide this into airframe, where we supply titanium [indecipherable], and then engine for us on the other side. airframe, there seems to continue to be -- on airframe for us, it is single-aisle. but there is excess inventory in that supply chain, and we expect that to continue until toward the end of the calendar year.
given what we are seeing, and hearing more than seeing, from our customers, we do believe we'll begin to see improvements as we move throughout this year. certainly, there will be some caution there because of what we've all been through for the past year. but we have seen increased bookings in february and march. we've seen the same thing now in april. and we expect that to continue to tick up. so midyear and beyond we do begin to see that improve and start to chop into that 48% year-on-year decrease we saw in aerospace.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
okay. thanks very much.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
sure.

operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the haynes international, inc., second quarter fiscal 2021 financial results call. [operator instructions]
at this time, it is my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, david van bibber. sir, the floor is yours.
david van bibber -- controller and chief accounting officer

with that, let me turn the call over to mike.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
thanks, dave. good morning, everyone.
the pandemic's impact over the last 12 months has been difficult on our business and on our families. i'm proud of our entire team. they have worked together to guide us through the challenges we faced and to position haynes very well for the future. we believe better times are ahead for our company.
we now believe that for haynes, q1 of fiscal '21 appears to be the bottom as far as the pandemic's impact on us and that q2 represents the beginning of our recovery. our key metrics showed good progress when comparing q2 to q1.
the most intriguing part of the progress we've made to date is that the commercial aerospace market has not yet recovered and will most likely not have a significant incremental improvement impact on our business until late this calendar year. this means that the improvement shown in q2 has been based on our continued relentless focus on cost reduction, on maintaining our prices for our high-value products throughout the downturn, and on sequential growth in the quarter, led by market share gain in our igt business. we look forward to seeing the rebound in aerospace and the incremental impact that a return of meaningful aerospace market growth is expected to have on our business.
i'd like to now highlight the progress that our team has made in the second quarter. first, our revenue for the quarter was $82.1 million, exceeding the revenue of q1 by $9.9 million, or 13.7%. our share gain in igt came through loud and clear in the quarter, with sequential igt volume increasing 33% and sequential igt revenue increasing 17.7%.
our gross margin was 10.2%, up 880 basis points from q1. this was accomplished despite shipping just 3.5 million pounds in our second quarter. as noted previously, our costs are down, coverage of our fixed cost has improved, our selling prices are stable and we've grown our igt market share.
as i've said in the past, we've improved our gross margins from when we experienced high-single-digit and low-double-digit gross margins in 2017 and 2018 to an average of 18% gross margins in january and february of 2020. when our markets and volumes eventually improve to our 2018 and 2019 levels, given our alloy and application innovation success, our unique manufacturing facilities, our distribution system and cutting capability, and our outstanding sales and customer service, i look at the 18% achieved in early calendar year 2020 as a new starting point for our future.
while our operating income was still negative for the quarter, it improved sequentially by $5.8 million, driven by all of the factors that i've already mentioned. we continue to believe that our breakeven point, given the work of our team over the past two years, has been reduced by at least 20%. our q2 results show that despite our very low volumes, we've made real progress compared to two or three years ago.
our sequential ebitda was improved by $5.9 million in q2, with a positive quarterly ebitda of $2.2 million for the quarter. after seven of the prior nine months produced negative ebitda, we were positive in each month of this past quarter.
as far as backlog, our q2 backlog is showing signs of leveling off, down a total of $4.3 million for the quarter, with aerospace down $4.2 million.
it's very interesting to review the book-to-bill data. the overall revenue book-to-bill stabilized in the quarter and was 1.0, with a negative aero trend still evident. for the quarter, aero was 0.9; cpi was 0.9; and igt was 1.1. for the first six months of the year, book-to-bill revenue data shows the total of 0.9, with aero at 0.7 and all other markets at 1.0 or greater.
as aerospace is expected to return toward the end of this calendar year, we have a possible opportunity to see growth in each of our three core markets.
finally, we generated $8.6 million in net cash in q2 and have now generated cash, despite our covid-related losses, for four consecutive quarters.
since april of 2020, when we pivoted our team to a focus and emphasis on responsible inventory reduction and cash generation, we've reduced our inventory by 4.6 million pounds, or 20.7%, and we finished the quarter with a cash balance of $69.8 million.
our conclusion from all of this information is that our efforts to make fundamental improvements to our business have positioned haynes well for the future.
we've had two overarching goals since our team began our journey to sustain improvement. first, a rapid and significant increase in gross margin, leading to the significant reduction in our breakeven point that i've already noted; and then, as the pandemic's potential business impact was evident, a pivot to cash generation. we have been successful in achieving our goals. i am proud of our entire team and their focus on what's important to our shareholders, for their ongoing pursuit of a safe work environment, and for the teamwork shown by all haynes employees.
it's important to note that we continued to operate below our breakeven point in our second quarter due to the low volumes sold. the positive news is that given our q2 results, as already noted, we believe that we will achieve profitability at a much lower volume than in the past.
however, given lead times and current bookings, we expect q3 revenues and earnings to be about the same as q2. we expect to begin to see aerospace bookings growth later in calendar 2021. as stated on last quarter's call, the aerospace recovery will likely be gradual, but we believe that this market will return to pre-pandemic levels, with single-aisle aircraft leading the way.
now a few comments on our markets. it took a pandemic to halt the long aero growth cycle. the reduction in aero demand continues to be the driver of our overall low business levels. year-on-year, aerospace volumes were down 47.9% in q2 of fiscal '21, despite the 737 max issues impacting the q2 fiscal year '20 data.
we have confidence that more people will begin to fly again and that we will see market improvement as the year progresses. i've traveled a fair amount recently, and i've experienced check-in lines that are longer, concourses that are full of people, and planes that are at capacity. these are all good signs that the recovery in domestic revenue passenger miles has begun. passengers through u.s. tsa checkpoints have increased, with domestic passenger traffic now approaching 60% of 2019 levels. obviously, single-aisle planes will lead the way here, with international travel lagging.
we believe leap engine builds have bottomed out. external data shows that the expected number of builds this year will be at or above 850 engines and is projected to increase rapidly from there. monthly leap engine build rates are now estimated to approach 2019 levels by the end of 2022. it's honestly refreshing to hear our contacts in the industry requesting that we have the manpower and capacity in place to handle this anticipated improvement.
also, the new 777, which has a delayed start-up, is now estimated to fly in 2023. when it does fly, this aircraft will have two haynes proprietary alloys on the ge9 times engines powering it. the haynes alloys spec'd in are haynes 244, our latest low-thermal expansion alloy that offers high-temperature capabilities over current alloys, and haynes 282, our [indecipherable] hardenable alloy that provides a superior combination of fabricability and high-temperature strength over 718 alloy.
the application of these two proprietary alloys into the ge9 times engine shows the past, the present, and the future core strength of our company; that is, the proven ability to innovate and to develop alloys for tomorrow's difficult and demanding nickel- and cobalt-based high-temperature and corrosion applications.
as far as our cpi market, our quote and order activity is up. specific to special projects, we are expecting lighter shipments in the second half of fiscal '21 as a result of covid-impacted ordering patterns in prior quarters. however, we are beginning to see more funding for special projects in this market and higher quote activity. as the economy continues to open back up, we expect this positive trend to continue.
on igt, we are seeing an improvement in this area, for four reasons. first, haynes 282 continues to gain market applications in both new and existing turbines. next, we have gained market share from an oem. third, one of our long-term customers has gained share. and finally, there is general improvement in this market.
a few additional points before i hand this over to dan. safety continues to be a core value for haynes. we had no recordable injuries in any of our facilities in march. we've continued to train and educate our employees as well as invest in our facilities to provide everyone a safe work environment. we have an excellent cadence of communications and meetings across our operations to help reinforce our safety culture.
next, on covid, our work on protecting our employees is far from complete. throughout the pandemic, we've continued to inform and educate our employees on the ways to keep themselves, their families, and our workplace safe, and we continue to take many actions to deal with the challenges brought on by the pandemic. as new information is gained and access to vaccines continues to increase, we will continue to assess the changes we need to make throughout our operations.
related to esg, haynes has always been conscious of our environmental impact, and we are actively working to reduce our carbon footprint. over the past few years, we have made investments of over $2 million in energy conservation programs, which has helped us reduce energy demand by about $1.6 million a year. we are now conducting studies in each of our manufacturing locations to further our energy conservation journey. this information is being used to develop additional energy conservation programs, capital investments, and our long-term goals and objectives.
finally, there is one point that i've talked about in the past that i'd like to stress here. haynes has a 109-year history of innovation, alloy and application development, and outstanding sales and customer service. our most recent example of our company's outstanding history with alloy and application development is the mars rover. we are very proud to have had our alloy, haynes 230, used on the sky crane that lowered perseverance onto the surface of mars in february. the alloy used for the sky crane thrusters was selected for its excellent combination of high-temperature strength and environmental resistance properties.
the use of haynes 230 here is just another example of one of the most significant facts that tells the story of our company; and that is, that over 50% of what we sell was invented by us. that's both a great story and, given our continued focus on alloy application and process innovation, a great indicator of what the future may hold for our company.
with that, i'll hand the call over to dan.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
thank you, mike. our total volume shipped of 3.5 million pounds this quarter was the best quarterly volume since the pandemic began in the u.s. roughly one year ago. volume in all four of our market segments improved sequentially, with total volume improving 26.1%. it seems we may have come off the bottom of this covid-driven downturn from a volume perspective, and we welcome the start of a recovery.
as a reminder, our volume at the beginning of the pandemic was already being impacted by the boeing 737 max production halt. if you go back and look at the second half of fiscal 2019, prior to both the pandemic and the 737 max production halt, we did $255.7 million in revenue and volume of 10.5 million pounds. that's an annualized run rate of $511 million in revenue and 21 million pounds. returning to that type of run-rate would likely require support by a meaningful recovery in the aerospace market, which we believe will begin late in calendar year '21.
this quarter, sales to the aerospace market accounted for 37% of our revenue, at $30.6 million. this is an increase of 25% sequentially from q1, but a decrease of 48% from the same period last year. this significant year-over-year reduction in aerospace demand continues to be the main cause of our low overall volume levels, which lowers our margins. these margin challenges are expected to continue to alleviate when aerospace volumes improve. backlog dollars in aerospace decreased sequentially from q1 to q2 by 5% and down 44% year-over-year.
sales to the chemical processing market accounted for 18% of our revenue, at $15.1 million. this is flat sequentially from q1 and a decrease of 5% from the same period last year. special project revenue, most of which is reflected in chemical processing, was $4.8 million, which is $780,000 lower than the first quarter of last year and $1.7 million lower than the same period last year. backlog dollars in cpi decreased by 4.2% q2 to q1 and down 6% year-over-year.
sales to the industrial gas turbine market accounted for 20% of our revenue, at $16.4 million. this is an increase of 18% sequentially from q1 and relatively flat versus the same period last year. our share gain initiative continues to help volumes. however, volumes can still be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. backlog dollars in industrial gas turbines increased sequentially from q1 to q2 by 12% and down 9% year-over-year.
sales to other markets accounted for 19% of our revenue, at $15.5 million. this is an increase of 22% sequentially from q1 and an increase of also 22% from the same period last year. backlog dollars decreased sequentially by 5% but was up 21% year-over-year.
other revenue accounted for 5% of our revenue, at $4.4 million. this is a decrease of 22% sequentially from q1 and a decrease of 38% from the same period last year, which was primarily due to [toll] customers that have exposure to the aerospace industry.
the sequential improvement in overall volume, from 2.8 million pounds to 3.5 million pounds, resulted in an 880-basis point gross margin expansion in the second quarter, to 10.2%. this improvement includes the reduction in the direct charge from $5.9 million in the first quarter to $2.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal '21, with better absorption of overhead costs.
also contributing to the margin expansion was our continued diligent cost reduction efforts.
in addition, our raw material increases provided a moderate tailwind to margins this quarter of roughly $1 million, but this is likely to neutralize next quarter.
overall, this margin expansion occurred despite continued inventory reductions. during the quarter, we reduced inventory by $9.4 million, making it a $19.3 million reduction in inventory this fiscal year and $53.5 million reduction since this time last year.
to once again go back and look at the beginning of the pandemic, we were just beginning to gain traction on our gross margin improvement, where we averaged 18% gross margins in january and february, right before the pandemic impacted our results. it's our expectation that when volumes recover to those levels, we can resume our margin improvement strategy.
now back to q2 of fiscal 21's p&l. sg&a, including research and technical expense, was $12.1 million in the second quarter, as compared to last year's second quarter of $11.8 million. this year-over-year increase was mainly due to changes in incentive compensation accruals and foreign currency losses.
two additional points to finish out the p&l. one, as i've mentioned before, our nonoperating retirement benefit expense on the p&l was lower by $1.3 million this quarter as compared to the same period last year due to our favorable actuarial valuation, driven by lower retiree healthcare spending, as we've been actively managing our retiree healthcare cost, and, on the pension side, higher-than-expected return on plan assets last fiscal year. looking to our next end-of-year evaluation, current view on potential rising discount rates points toward a potential additional reduction next fiscal year.
and number two, our effective tax rate was 17.3% in the second quarter of fiscal '21, as compared to 21.2% sequentially in q2. this reduction relates to certain non-deductible compensation accruals. this lower effective tax rate is unfavorable due to the pre-tax loss.
all of this resulted in a net loss for the quarter narrowing to $3.6 million, compared to the $8 million in q1.
as far as outlook for next quarter, the reduction in aerospace demand continues to be the main driver of the company's overall lower sales levels. the company believes that the aerospace market will begin to show meaningful incremental improvement late this calendar year. therefore, it's expected that the upcoming third quarter of fiscal '21 revenue and earnings will be similar to the second quarter of fiscal '21.
the company expects continued solid liquidity throughout fiscal '21 and be favorably positioned for the recovery.
moving to backlog. backlog appears to be leveling out, at $140.9 million at march 31, '21, a decrease of $4.3 million, or 2.9%, from the $145.1 million at december 31, 2020. backlog pounds at march 31, '21, increased sequentially during the first quarter of fiscal '21 by 0.3% as compared to december 31, 2020.
liquidity. we increased cash by $8.6 million in the second quarter, making a $22 million increase this fiscal year and a $47.4 million increase in net cash since this time last year. strong total liquidity of $169.8 million, with cash at march 31 at $69.8 million and $100 million available on the undrawn credit facility.
capital spending during the first six months of fiscal '21 was $2.1 million. we're still expecting to spend approximately $10 million for the full fiscal year, with a higher pace of capex in the second half of the year.
in conclusion, it is encouraging to see our financial results beginning to improve. as we've mentioned, the anticipated recovery will likely be somewhat gradual and would likely require support by a meaningful aerospace recovery, which is expected to begin late this calendar year.
we've worked hard to manage through this downturn, and we will work equally hard as the recovery begins. this includes carefully investing working capital and carefully managing costs as activity levels increase, with the goal of earning more than our cost of capital. with nearly $70 million of cash on the balance sheet and the full credit line available, we have the flexibility to improve with the anticipated recovery of demand in the markets we serve.
mike, with that, i'll now turn the discussion back over to you.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
thanks, dan. our team is encouraged by both the direction and the potential for our business. i want to thank all of you for your continued interest in our company.
with that, operator, let's open the call up to questions.

[operator instructions] and our first question comes from michael leshock from keybank capital markets.
michael david leshock -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
hi, guys. good morning. so as we look at the third quarter, it was much better than where you guided to. volumes were only up a bit, the 3.7 from 3.5 the prior quarter. i just wanted to know what drove that profitability in the quarter. i know there was some benefit from raw materials, but how much did mix play as a factor? and is this something that's sustainable as we look into 4q?
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer and director
let me address the mix. dan will touch on the inventory side of this and the raw material side on this. but what we're very excited about is what we believe can continue to happen in the future. since you brought up mix, we see opportunities for mix improvement as aero comes back. so as we look at mix, we saw minor mix improvement, mike, from q3 versus q2. but that was mainly because of a reduction of some of our higher volume orders that we took at the depth of the pandemic to try to work through and address the direct charge.
these orders were good for the company, but they were very low margin. and so q3 did not have some that q2 had. but to me, a very key point, as we look at mix and what can happen in the future. we saw year-on-year, as what i just gave you was sequentially. year-on-year, we saw a fairly significant deterioration in mix. so q3 fiscal 2021 versus q3 fiscal 2020. and it makes sense. we've been very open that our aerospace business is the majority of our high-value differentiated products. and when you look at the year-on-year stats, we had igt up, a good thing, cpi up, a good thing, but aero down year-on-year. so we were missing that component of the mix.
so as we look forward, we see great opportunities for mix to further improve. and beyond that, remember right before the pandemic hit us, we had 18% gross margin in january and february 2020. so our work on pricing, our work on cost not only was done back then, but it continued through the pandemic, and we think more is to come. dan?
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president of finance, treasurer and chief financial officer
yes, let me just hit on the inventory build and the raw material. and it was very moderate, actually, starting with raw material, nickel and cobalt increased. so we estimated that to be about a $1.5 million favorable benefit. but last quarter, it was about $1 million. so just slightly above what it was last quarter. so nothing too significant. and then on the inventory build side, we did build inventory about $3.9 million. so you think about that and what that may do to margins and what kind of contribution that kind of would have. but still, that's even less than or right around about $1 million impact on the month, and that would be about a one point change in the gross margin.
i think the one thing that surprised us on profitability more than anything is what mike kind of mentioned, and that is the initiatives to reduce breakeven, the initiatives to increase prices and reduce costs, how that gets realized as volumes start to go up. and i think we've got some great traction on those initiatives, and it's really starting to show up in the margin, and we really are excited. as we look forward, that continuing and that momentum building and expanding margins further.
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer and director
let me just add one more thing to it and that's special projects, which dan touched on in his script. we've been in this trough of spending by our customers in the industry. so with that, there's not been a lot of money left to start some of these projects. so we're down year-on-year. we're even down sequentially in special projects. so as that begins to come back, that offers us future potential also as far as continuing to improve the performance of the company.
michael david leshock -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
and then on the cost side of the business, what have you seen or do you expect to see going forward in terms of inflationary pressures? and maybe how much of the cost you took out during the downturn are structural in nature versus what portion might come back?
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer and director
when you look at during the pandemic on the people side, we took out a significant portion of our workforce. i think it was 18% of our workforce line variable and fixed side of this thing. and at this point, the overwhelming majority of our variable workforce, our production maintenance workforce has been called back. we're obviously going to drag our feet as best we can. on the salary side we spent money to, unfortunately, remove positions, and we want to be very cautious about bringing back, but we are doing it. and we're trying to continue to reinforce what our core competencies are by hiring people that fit in those jobs and make the most sense for us.
i think we are continuing to gain momentum on the cost side on the variable cost to manufacture. we've done a great deal to improve yields, to improve our processes and to enhance the way we make our products for our customers. and we had great momentum going in the pandemic. you don't get as much of an impact when your volume goes as low as ours has gone. but we continue to work on those projects. and as we see higher volume, we're going to see additional cost reduction going forward.
michael david leshock -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
and then capex was basically 0 in the quarter. and right now, you're kind of running below your base maintenance level at $7 million, if we call it, $8 million to $10 million maintenance roughly. should we expect a meaningful uptick there in capex in 2022, if there's any maintenance you might be deferring?
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president of finance, treasurer and chief financial officer
yes. we're deferring no maintenance. what we find with capital, and i found this my entire career, and i should learn from it already, is you never spend as much as you think you're going to spend. so we actually had to talk. we're going to have to start budgeting more than we're actually going to spend because there's always carryover. there's always an occasional delay here and there. i don't like being at $7 million, and we expect to start approaching depreciation, not going over, but approaching it for the next three, four years, plus or minus. so we'll get back on the capital van wagon and that was not an intentional pull down. that's just timing of projects.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from marisa hernandez from sidoti.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti & company, llc -- analyst
hello, thank you, and good morning everybody. so wondering if you can comment on the outlook for gross margin in the second half of the calendar year. it seems to me that there's a number of moving pieces here with the mix of aerospace and the other segments. at the same time, you have cost-saving efforts but you're having to put in more resources as the recovery takes place. and at the same time, there's this decline in asp that you reported in this quarter for both aerospace and the chemicals segment. so if you could put all of those in context for me that would be great.
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer and director
sure, we'd love to. first, i've got to start because we've got an entire team that have been working on this for three years plus. we're thrilled with the team's efforts to fundamentally improve our business with a focus on driving our gross margin up significantly. no secret. our goal has been in our slice of the industry to be the best as far as gross margin. we have focused, marisa, on cost reduction, price increase alloy and application innovation, which, by the way, can significantly help our gross margin and best-in-class sales and technical service to drive improvement.
what i'm really encouraged about, it's great that we hit 15.5%. we just love that. but what i'm really encouraged about is what the future can hold for us related to gross margin. we said before that the 18% we hit before the pandemic is a great starting point as our volume comes back. and when you take a step back and think about it, we've raised prices on transactional business, not just on aerospace, but across the board, 7% to 10%. and we're just beginning to see the impact of that and then contracts will follow after that.
we're working, as dan said, to eliminate the direct charge. we still incurred $2 million in the past quarter on direct charge, we will have a significant impact as volume comes back in general, just because of the marginal net volume, when the aero orders comes back, that typically is our highest margin product. and so that will help our mix. we've got an enormous number of alloys and -- or we have alloys and applications in our pipeline that will help as we get those products going. as i mentioned, special projects are poised to come back. and then in general, we have a relentless focus on yield and variable cost reductions. so while dan stares at me to make sure i don't give a number, which i will not.
i will tell you that we have high confidence that we can continue to grow our gross margin. sorry for the long answer.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president of finance, treasurer and chief financial officer
just going to mention you had also brought up average selling price, asp going down. and really, what that's reflecting isn't price decreases by any means. it's just the mix. as mike referenced earlier, the mix this quarter was not optimal without aerospace. and we looked to the future and we see with aerospace recovering later this calendar year with orders, and then we'll see where that goes in 2022, that should only help us as far as mix goes and average selling prices go.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti & company, llc -- analyst
that's helpful. and are you expecting any improvement already in the september quarter in the mix of aerospace? i understand that you're not looking for a huge increase in volumes yet. but on the mix side, have we tracked here or not yet?
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer and director
so sequentially, our aerospace revenue obviously did go up in the past quarter, and we are beginning to see an uptick in aerospace. but we're beginning to see our customers talk about orders and begin to let some orders. but we really don't expect to see the orders come in till little later this calendar year in full force. and then once we get those orders, we have to manufacture them. that's why we're only expecting slight improvement quarter-on-quarter.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti & company, llc -- analyst
thank you. and can i squeeze one more?
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes, please.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president of finance, treasurer and chief financial officer
absolutely.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti & company, llc -- analyst
thank you. so can you give me a flavor of what your utilization rate is at this time? and i understand that may vary across sites. but what investment, if any, do you need to make to position yourself for the expected recovery?
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer and director
as far as positioning ourselves for recovery, the number one thing that we've done is we are well into the process of bringing our production and maintenance workforces back to full force. so we're doing that. and then what i believe is very important for us is taking a step back and understanding what our competitive advantages are. and one of our major competitive advantages is speed. and what we've highlighted and what we focused on for over a year now is keeping our lead times low and our response time quick. and we keep talking about this supermarket that we put in place for high-volume grades.
and as we come out of this, the shorter the lead times, the more orders we can get. and to be frank, the shorter the lead times, the more price flexibility we have. so bringing our people back, making sure they're trained, making sure they understand what we need to do from a safety perspective and positioning our inventory are, to me, the things that we are focused on now to come back.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president of finance, treasurer and chief financial officer
and i would even say, if you step back a little bit and you talk about investments for the recovery, keep in mind, we spent a significant amount of capital in prior years to increase capacities in certain areas. so we have significant headroom to increase capacities beyond where we were. 2019, what i believe in volume was a record year for us in aerospace. and we have additional capacity beyond that with the investments we had made previously. so we're not needing to invest significant above our depreciation levels in the future, and we'll be able to grow the top line beyond where we were before.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti & company, llc -- analyst

daniel w. maudlin -- vice president of finance, treasurer and chief financial officer

good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the haynes international, inc. third quarter fiscal 2021 financial results conference call. [operator instructions] at this time, it is my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, controller and chief accounting officer, david van bibber. sir, the floor is yours.
david sean van bibber -- controller and chief administrative officer
thank you very much for joining us today. with me today are mike shor, president and ceo of haynes international; and dan maudlin, vice president and chief financial officer. before we get started, i would like to read a brief cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements. this conference call contains statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation and reform act of 1995 and section 21e of the securities and exchange act of 1934.

the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. with that, let me turn the call over to mike.
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer and director
thank you, dave. good morning, everyone. our results continued to improve this quarter, and our momentum is building. the details are as follows: we returned to profitability in our third quarter despite shipping just 3.7 million pounds. our end of quarter cash balance was $74.2 million, representing an increase in cash since march 31, 2020, of $51.8 million and an increase of $4.3 million over the past year. our gross margin continued to improve despite our direct charges related to low volume and despite the lack of meaningful incremental aerospace shipments to date. we finished the quarter at 15.5% gross margin.
this represents a 530 basis point improvement sequentially and a 1,220 basis point improvement from last year's q3. as i've stated in the past, we look at the 18% gross margins achieved in early 2020 as our starting point once our aerospace volume returns. the results of q3 and our improving gross margins confirm what we've said for the past year. that is our cost reduction and pricing work have had a significant positive impact on our business, driving our breakeven point from roughly five million pounds shipped a quarter, to, as shown in our q3 quarter, four million pounds or less. our cost and price improvement initiatives that have driven our margin improvement are continuing. our current and future price and cost efforts should continue to have a meaningful incremental improvement impact on the future of haynes.
as noted in our may 27 press release, we've increased transactional pricing by 7% to 10%. on the cost side, our efforts to improve material yields and refine our processes are also expected to continue to have a meaningful impact on our variable cost of manufacturing. our ebitda was positive for each month of the quarter and totaled $7.3 million for the quarter. our backlog increased for the first time since the 2019 issues with the 737 max. backlog dollars improved by $10 million in the quarter, increasing 2.4% in aerospace, 22% in cpi and 19% in igt. we are seeing the impact of our share gain in igt, the improvement in capital spending in the cpi market and the initial signs of renewed aero activity. our book-to-bill in dollars was 1.1, with aero at 1.1 and both cpi and igt at 1.2.
in addition, our focus on maintaining a competitive advantage through industry-leading lead times and providing just-in-time inventory and near net shapes from our company-owned service centers has resulted in satisfied customers and incremental price increase opportunities. to support this, we've continued to place highly flexible intermediate inventory into stock in our facilities to keep our lead times for our high-volume alloys below what is typical for the industry. this can create a competitive advantage as the recovery progresses. our team continues to internally track over 40 key measures on a monthly basis.
the focus, commitment, accountability and energy shown by our entire team have resulted in innovative alloy and application offerings, cost reductions, yield increases, price improvements, margin expansion, initial volume growth, lead time improvements, significant process improvements in safety and inventory reductions. as a result of our actions and significantly improved performance, along with the current level of cash on our balance sheet, the overall expected business recovery in the horizon and the current favorable pension valuation information that dan covered in our last earnings call, we have announced in a separate press release, a multistep capital allocation strategy.
this includes a share repurchase plan as we believe our current share price is well below its intrinsic value, the adoption of a glide path for our u.s. pension, along with the u.s. pension plan accelerated funding strategy. these actions show our optimism about the future of our company and our efforts to strive to eliminate the largest liability on our balance sheet. dan will provide additional details. now as far as our markets, our igt market improved by over 49% in pounds shipped this quarter versus last year's third quarter. our igt growth continues beyond market growth rates because of three factors: gain share gain at an oem share gain by one of our customers within the igt supply chain and the additional continued application of a haynes proprietary alloy, haynes 282 alloy in both new build designs and replacement components.
our cpi market is showing positive signs, both with increased revenues and increasing backlogs due to current oil prices, which impact capital expenditures in aero cpi market, the restart of significant projects in the industry that have been delayed over the past year and our very competitive lead times. in our aerospace market, we are seeing a significant pick up in activity, starting with customer calls to us related to supply capability and lead times, followed by inquiries on available finished product in our haynes distribution facilities and now the beginning of ordering activity. it's very important to note that our aerospace shipments are still well below steady state levels. as a point of reference, pounds shipped into the aerospace market this quarter are 47.5% below what they were two years ago in june of 2019.
significant growth opportunities are still ahead of us. the news from boeing airbus and the single-aisle engine manufacturers continue to be very positive. we expect an increase in aero ordering by the end of this calendar year. summarizing q3, the efforts from our team have resulted in increased sequential revenue and a return to profitability. revenue for the quarter was $88.1 million, exceeding q2 by 7.4%. we achieved profitability despite shipping just 3.7 million pounds, proving that our breakeven has been reduced by over 20%. gross margin was 530 basis points above q2 of fiscal 2021, driven in part by cost controls, cost reductions, outstanding customer and technical service and incredible innovation at both the alloy and application levels. i'm very proud of our entire team. they have shown what focus, accountability and a relentless drive to improve can mean to company performance.
we believe that significant incremental business improvement can occur once the anticipated upcoming aerospace orders turn into shipments. we are seeing the first signs of market and backlog improvement. while excited about what can be, we do not expect to see a significant increase in our commercial aerospace orders until later this calendar year. given this, we expect our q4 results to be slightly better than our q3 performance. to close out my comments, i want to again highlight one of our key business differentiators, specifically, our innovative alloy and application development efforts.
last quarter, i highlighted our role with the mars rover. this quarter, i'd like to highlight what we are best at, developing innovative alloys for unique applications in our markets. today, i'll touch on our aerospace market. we now have proprietary alloys flying on the pratt & whitney 1100 on the a320neo, the pratt & whitney 1500, on the a220 and on the pratt & whitney 1900, for the embraer e195. we also have two alloys spec'd into the ge9 times on the 777. in addition, haynes 233 alloy is in the advanced stages of property and specification finalization with a major aero oem. i'm proud of the work of our team. now let me turn it over to dan for more details on our financial results.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president of finance, treasurer and chief financial officer
thank you, mike. returning to profitability is an exciting milestone as we are emerging from what we believe are the early stages of the recovery. our continued focus on initiatives to increase margins from price increases and cost reductions has successfully reduced our breakeven point. this quarter, our total volume shipped was 3.7 million pounds, resulting in positive net income as compared to our prior breakeven of roughly five million pounds. these improvement efforts are expected to continue to gain momentum; first, as volumes increase; second, as more orders are shipped that are priced with our recently announced price increases; and third, as our cost reduction efforts related to improved yields, productivity and process improvements are realized with higher mill production levels.
mike already covered a discussion of each market, but here's a bit more detail on the numbers. the quarter sales to the aerospace market accounted for 38.5% of our revenue at $34 million. this is an increase of 11% sequentially from q2, but a decrease of 16% from the same period last year. this year-over-year reduction in aerospace demand continues to be the main cause of our overall low volume levels, which is compressing our margins. as mike mentioned earlier, our volume decreased by 48% from the third quarter two years ago in fiscal 2019. these margin challenges alleviate as aerospace volumes improve.
backlog dollars in aerospace increased sequentially from q2 to q3 by 2%, but have decreased year-over-year by 27% from the pandemic's impact on the aerospace industry. sales to the chemical processing market accounted for 19% of our revenue at $17 million. this is up 13% sequentially from q2 and up 40% from the same period last year. special projects revenue, most of which is reflected in chemical processing, was $4.6 million, which is $211,000 lower than the second quarter and $743,000 lower than the same period last year. backlog dollars in cpi increased by 22% q3 versus q2 and is up 19% year-over-year. sales to the industrial gas turbine market accounted for 20% of our revenue at $17.8 million. this is an increase of 8.5% sequentially from q2 and up 30% from the same period last year. backlog dollars in industrial gas turbines increased sequentially by 19% and is flat year-over-year.
sales to other markets accounted for 16% of our revenue at $13.7 million. this is a decrease of 12% sequentially, but an increase of 22% from the same period last year. backlog dollars were flat sequentially, but up 18% year-over-year. other revenue accounted for 6% of our revenue at $5.6 million. this is an increase of 28% sequentially and an increase of 77% from the same period last year. the sequential improvement in overall volume from 3.5 million to 3.7 million pounds contributed to the 530 basis point gross margin expansion in the third quarter to 15.5%. this is after an 880 basis point improvement sequentially last quarter.
this improvement includes a reduction in the direct charge from $2.8 million in the second quarter to $2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 with better absorption of overhead costs. also contributing to the margin expansion was our continued diligent focus on cost reduction mentioned earlier, and our price actions related to prior actions related to pricing increases. raw material cost increases for both nickel and cobalt provided a moderate tailwind to margins this quarter of roughly $1.5 million. sg&a, including research and technical expense was $12.3 million in the third quarter, which was similar to the second quarter's $12.1 million, but higher than last year's third quarter of $10.7 million. this year-over-year increase was mainly due to incentive compensation accruals as last year had 0 accruals in q3.
the nonoperating retirement benefit expense in the p&l was lower by $1.3 million as compared to the same period last year due to our favorable actuarial valuations we have discussed before. i will have more comments on pension activities in a moment when discussing our recently announced capital allocation strategy. our effective tax rate was high at 39.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily related to valuation allowances recorded on a certain foreign operations net loss carryforwards not likely to be realized. all of this resulted in net income for the quarter of $422,000 compared to a net loss of $8.1 million in last year's q3 and a net loss of $3.6 million sequentially last quarter.
profitability and improving financial results are a welcome outcome as we continue to execute our improvement initiatives. backlog. we have begun to experience an increase in order entry over the past quarter, though still below pre covid levels. backlog was $150.9 million at june 30, 2021, an increase of $10 million or 7.1% from the $140.9 million at march 31, 2021. as far as our outlook for next quarter, we are seeing the first signs of demand and backlog improvement in our core markets.
however, we do not expect to see a significant increase in order entry in the commercial aerospace market until later this calendar year. we expect revenue and earnings to be slightly better in the september quarter, our fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to the third quarter. the company continues to believe it is favorably positioned as the recovery progresses. capital spending during the first nine months of 2021 was $4.2 million. we lowered our estimates for capex for the full year to approximately $7 million. liquidity. cash on the balance sheet was $74.2 million at june 30, 2021, with an increase in cash of $4.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, resulting in a total net cash increase of $51.8 million since march 31, 2020. strong total liquidity continues at $174.2 million, with $100 million available on the undrawn credit facility. capital allocation.
we announced wednesday, in a separate press release, a multifaceted capital allocation strategy that we are very excited about. it includes, first, a share repurchase plan of up to $20 million as we believe that repurchasing our stock at current market prices represents an attractive capital allocation strategy for the company. we feel this is a unique opportunity to repurchase shares well below the intrinsic value of the company, given the outlook of our markets, particularly the anticipated recovery in commercial aerospace, combined with our gross margin expansion strategies. second, the recent adoption of a glide path for our u.s. pension plan to help secure improvements in our funding percentage realized this fiscal year.
this is driven by better-than-expected return on assets, combined with higher interest rates and is expected to reduce our roughly $100 million pension liability by potentially 50%. in addition, this strategy includes a customized liability-driven investment strategy that is expected to substantially reduce the plan's future interest rate risk and an asset allocation designed to reduce the plan's equity risk, both of which are expected to reduce the volatility of pension expense going forward. and third, a u.s. pension plan accelerated funding strategy with the intention of fully funding the plan with a 0 net liability in approximately three years. this strategy entails an additional $15 million in planned contributions this year in addition to our current $6 million funding level, so $21 million in total.
additional future funding will be determined based upon market conditions and our financial position. these steps represent significant actions to de-risk the plan and strive to eliminate the largest liability on our balance sheet. we are excited to begin this capital allocation strategy. in conclusion, it is encouraging to see the milestone of a return to profitability. and it's interesting to think of what is still in the future, still ahead of us, includes an expected recovery in the commercial aerospace market, expected better fixed cost absorption with normalized volumes, more traction in our manufacturing process improvement strategies when volumes recover, and the realization of recent price increases favorably impacting our bottom line.
we believe all of this, combined with executing our value-creating capital allocation strategy will create value for our shareholders. and mike, with that, i will turn the discussion back over to you.
michael l. shor -- president, chief executive officer and director
thank you, dan. our team continues to be encouraged by both the direction and the potential for our business. i want to thank all of you for your continued interest in haynes. with that, kat, let's open the call up to questions.

[operator instructions] your first question for today is coming from marisa hernandez. please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti and company -- analyst
hi, good morning, marisa hernandez from sidoti and company.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
good morning, marisa.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
hi, marisa.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti and company -- analyst
hi, so, congratulations on the results. a couple of questions here. so i think that you call out the contribution of higher nickel prices in the quarter. can you provide that on a quarter-over-quarter basis. i think you provided it on an annual year-over-year basis?
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
yeah, actually the number that i had in my script was $1.8 million was the tailwind for nickel and cobalt because cobalt is going up quite dramatically as well and that is just for the quarter. now last quarter, we also had a bit of a tailwind for raw materials of about $1 million. so the delta between q3 and q4 is about $800,000. does that help?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
marisa --
marisa hernandez -- sidoti and company -- analyst
okay.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
if you don't mind i'll add to that, because certainly we had the tailwind related to the $1.8 [phonetic] million in nickel and cobalt, but i think it's really important to emphasize there's so much more that's driving our margins. as you and i -- as all of us have talked about before, the 18% we hit in january and february of 2020, we looked at as a starting point as we continue to get our volume back. over the last three years, as dan said in the call, we've reduced our breakeven significantly. our best estimate is down 25% percent of current mix and i think we've been able to do that because of the incremental work on both cost reduction --sustained cost reduction, yield improvement, and pricing. so we're very encouraged about what the future holds.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti and company -- analyst
excellent. so let's see, so if we were to adjust your gross margin in the september quarter to compare it apples-to-apples to the june quarter, could that be approximately 16.7%?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
i think what we have not done is give specific estimates related to gross margin. what i can say though is our volume is coming back, our aerospace business is coming back. we saw on special projects, the lowest quarter in revenue than we've seen in a long time. the direct charge is obviously behind us as we move forward and start to exceed this 4 million pound level that we were at and so we feel good about where everything is related to our products and we feel great about what we're doing both on the pricing side and on the cost side. so again, as far as we're concerned and we're not giving estimates as far as when, but we do look at our 18% we hit in the two months before the pandemic struck as a starting point. so we expect to exceed that as we move forward.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti and company -- analyst
yeah, i was not asking about an estimate, i was asking for the quarter adjusted, but that's ok.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
oh, sorry.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti and company -- analyst
yeah, no worries, we can take that offline, but yeah, so i wanted to ask on the aerospace demand that you're seeing, i believe you were expecting an order pickup to start materializing later in 2021, so around right now i guess. it appears that it's happening a bit earlier. is that accurate? how would you characterize it versus your prior expectations?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
yeah, i think what we are hearing from the engine manufacturers and the airframe manufacturers are a concern for ability to supply metal in the supply chain. so we are having a large amount of contact and we, as you can see by our numbers with the aerospace sequentially up and certainly year-on-year up, we're beginning to see that. to me, it's really at this point as simple as looking at the leap engine. we know single-aisle jets are 75%, 80% of what's going to be built and when you look at what's happened with the leap engine account, down to [indecipherable] now in '21 and somewhere in the 1,500 plus range in '22 and if that's what has to happen, there is about a year between us making metal and when the engines are being built to be put on a plane. so it's good timing and timing is about right for us to begin to see this pop that we are.
the other thing that i think is really worth noting, even though our business has improved, the numbers are striking. so we talk about this 14.8% increase in aerospace up to $39 million and how much it's greater than 2020, but when you compare that to '19, our sales in q4 '19, obviously pre-pandemic, were $68 million in aerospace. so there is a lot of room to move obviously and i believe because of everyone's belief and what's happening with the a320 and the max and certainly seeing it the leap numbers that it's got to start to happen now and it is.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti and company -- analyst
okay, so i wanted to ask about a couple of your other markets. you've had a lot of market share gains on the turbine market. how is that looking from a sustainability perspective and how would you characterize the outlook for that market?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
i think the outlook is good. just a small amount of history. everyone went through five plus years of no growth in large frame power generation and a lot of inventory in the supply chain and now we're beginning to see growth and we're beginning to see much less metal in the supply chain. so when there's demand, we're feeling the pull for it. our share gain is sustainable. these are contracts that we have signed, we feel great about it.
we've not only seen some share gain that we've talked about for the last 18 months, but we're also seeing -- obviously, we've seen some work stoppages out there by others and we've been able to see certainly not to the extent of our major share gain, but some additional business coming into us. and then on top of that, what i talked about with our innovation with haynes 282. this is an alloy that is being substituted into both existing large frame engines and also in some being specked in. so this is definitely sustainable.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
and one thing i noted marisa related to igt is the market share gain that we have is a little more consistent as well. at first, it was a little spotty quarter-to-quarter, but now we are seeing more consistency quarter-to-quarter in what we're shipping related to that share gain.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti and company -- analyst
got it. and i think i heard you say that the decline sequentially here of chemical processing business is due to the timing of sales, is that correct?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
yeah, when you look at what's happened with our backlog being up in cpi 40%, our book-to-bill which i like to look at being at 1.6 and the fact that we've hit in special projects a multi-level multi-year low, yeah, we feel good about the future both in our base cpi business and in special projects.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti and company -- analyst
thank you so much. i will go back in queue.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
thank you.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer

the next question is coming from michael leshock. please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.
michael leshock -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey you guys mike leshock with keybanc capital markets, good morning.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
hi, mike, good morning.
michael leshock -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
first, i just -- i wanted to ask on your outlook commentary how should we think about the term substantial for aerospace growth in fiscal '22 just per the verbiage in your guidance. do you think of that as a percentage change year-over-year on an absolute basis relative to historical levels. could we get back to pre-pandemic levels in aerospace this year. i'm just trying to get a better sense in how to frame that wording there?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
sure and what i'll do is, is use what we've heard and what everyone has heard related to build rates on single-aisle jets. again, 80% of the market, what we've heard is by the end what we've actually heard mid to late, but i'll say by the end of 2022, build rates pretty much equivalent to what was steady state in 2019. and again, we're talking build rates of engines and planes and so from a metal standpoint, it's got to start coming sooner. obviously, what's not in there is the wide-body, that 20% plus or minus component, which is going to be a couple of years out from now. so we feel great that we believe build rates certainly on the leap engines and therefore on pretty much the single-aisle aircraft are going to be at 2019 levels on a engine build rate level by the end of 2022 is what we continue to hear.
michael leshock -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
and then as i shift to cpi. i know those -- you had mentioned that you've seen an improvement year-over-year off these lower '20 -- fiscal '21 levels, but i know those projects are typically higher margin as well as the spot business, which is pretty hot right now versus historical levels. so do you expect those special projects within cpi to drive a stronger mix in '22. is that fair to think about it that way?
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
i think when you look at our revenues in special projects in '21 -- the full year fiscal '21, they were a little over $19 million in revenue versus the prior three years, all ranging between $24 million and $26 million and there is great reason why we were down at $19 million -- why we were down at $3.2 million in the fourth quarter. these projects take long time once from idea to finish and we're still in the timeframe that the ideas would have been right in the middle of pandemic. so, yes, to answer your question, this is higher margin product. we expect special project work to expand and as you said, we also are seeing on the transactional side in our base cpi business significant improvements in average selling price.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
and some very strong improvements in the backlog that we mentioned. so orders are starting to come in.
michael leshock -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. and then just lastly for me on the pension payment that you made in the quarter. would you expect to make any more lump-sum payments like that in the coming year. and then, if not, what's your strategy behind any excess cash going forward?
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
i'll start with that one. we have the capital allocation strategy and one of the main goals of that strategy is to get the u.s. pension plan to a net liability of zero as quickly as possible and we kind of were thinking when we started this, that would be two to three years and obviously, we're a bit ahead of schedule going from $105 million down to $26 all in one year. so we'll be watching this. will we make another lump-sum payment this year? possibly. i think what we're going to do is look at our cash positions, look at other capital allocation opportunities that are out there and we'll make a determination what is the best capital allocation for the cash that we have. so it is a possibility, but i'll tell you with such great strides we made this year, it may not be to that magnitude or it may be pushed to later as we look forward and see where our capital allocation strategy will go from here.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
and just add to that, you know the story in the capital allocation for us, we've used our cash for the dividend. now we're using it especially in our q4 to fund our inventory growth. we've got the current stock buyback going on. we've got what dan has talked about with the pension and so obviously, that's using our cash right now, but we do believe as we look at the aerospace cycle that it will continue to grow and we continue to look at what else is out there once we get beyond these specific items to invest in to improve shareholder value.
michael leshock -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. appreciate the color, guys.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
thank you.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
thanks, mike.
michael leshock -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thank you.

[operator instructions] your next question is coming from chris olin. please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
i am with tier4 research.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
hey, chris.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
good morning, everyone. how are we doing? so, it looks like the strategy is starting to come together, mike. so, congratulations there.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
thanks, chris. our team has spent a great deal of time focusing on making sure we're supplying these high-value differentiated products, making sure we get paid for them and that's been a journey since 2019 and then these relentless sustained cost reductions and i'm thrilled with where we're headed.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
great to hear. i don't believe in your opening remarks, you mentioned it or maybe i missed it, but the 787 situation, is that not much of a factor in terms of your guidance or your business or an indirect, direct. is there anything going on?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
we don't believe at this point going forward that it will have a negative effect on us. let's face it, the build rate was already down at what two a month and so if we see any increase, call it, up to four, up to five by the time we get to 2023, then it will be a good thing for us, but right now, it's not in the base because it's so low. so really don't see any issues with it. and then the other side of that is the 777. we've talked about this quite a few times but ge9x has our two proprietary alloys and they are actually talking about building 38 engines in 2023. so that's certainly going to help.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
the titanium tubing business, did that contribute to the sales growth quarter-to-quarter? any insights there in terms of like the inventory situation with your customers?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
dan, you're going to have to help me if it contributed to the sales growth this year, but i will tell you that we have seen in the titanium tube area until this current quarter an oversupply of titanium tube and we're beginning to see that coming on in and beginning to see things pick up again for us, specifically related to boeing in the airframe business.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
okay, the other question i had is related to the issues that seem to be going on with some of your competitors today whether it's labor-related or tech-related and i guess i'm wondering if that helped you in terms of picking up business or changing market share, any positive benefits from that?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
yeah, we've seen some benefits related to some smaller contracts in particular in the power generation segment that it has helped us. also obviously, as people are out on strike, there is less supply and therefore there is the opportunity to continue to focus on making sure that we at least offset our inflationary pressures with price increases and even more if possible. so yeah, we're seeing that, there is no doubt about it.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
sticking with that price increase topic there. there has been a number of them announced by haynes over the past few weeks or months and i guess i'm wondering right now how big the spot business is in terms of that realization and how should we think about contract rollovers and when that starts to kind of flow through to the other customer groups?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
our largest group of contract rollovers are in january and we have set ourselves up because of the transactional price increases that we put in place. the difference now, chris, versus pre-pandemic is when we talked about transactional or price increases or even contract price increases in the past, i always talked about it being on the top-end of our mix. if you go back two to three years ago, i talked about our 50% of the product, which is truly high-value differentiated product.
the difference today in what we're doing are price increases across the board. we're getting price increases pretty much on every product that we manufacture. so it's a different world than it was and it's our opportunity to continue to sell the value that we provide, including our company-owned distribution facilities and make sure we were getting what we need as far as increases.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
is it a big number of contracts rolling over in january or do you think about it percentage wise?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
i don't have the percentage wise at this point. dan, do you?
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
not an exact percentage, but i would estimate our overall contracts are about 45% to 50% of our business and about probably 20% of that is annual type of contracts. so maybe a third or half of that would roll over this year would be my estimate.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
okay, that's all i have. congratulations on that solar panel investment. i didn't realize the sun actually hit indiana. so great to hear that and keep up the good work.
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
by the way that -- thanks, chris, we appreciate the little slap at indiana, but the solar installations are in our facility in mountain home, north carolina.
chris olin -- tier4 research -- analyst
okay.
operator
there is a follow-up question coming from marisa hernandez. marisa, your line is live.
marisa hernandez -- sidoti and company -- analyst
thank you for taking my follow-up. on the other market revenue, you have a very good growth this year and you call out the fgd market. is that a significant portion of that other market revenue and can you talk about the outlook for that market?
michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
yes, i would -- our flue gas desulphurization or fgd business is on the commodity side -- on the low-end of the commodity side of our mix. what we did when we were in the pandemic and when we were incurring significant direct charges because of our absorption issues we had with lack of volume, we pursued more fgd business and were successful and it was a great business decision for us because it helped keep our employees at work and helped steel moving through our assets.
what i said in my script comments though is that as our business improves in aero, in igt, in the chemical processing market, we will be de-emphasize significant growth in fgd because it uses the same assets and quite frankly it's not nearly as profitable. so the outlook for that market is very strong, but it typically is very high volume business, which is not our wheelhouse of business and so i would say that we will begin to see over the next couple of quarters some decline in the fgd business for us and that would be an intentional move, a mix move.

michael l. shor -- president and chief executive officer; director
thank you, dave. good morning, everyone. 3.5 years ago when our teams improvement journey began, we were frequently unprofitable. for those of you that follow us, you know the story. our gross margins were just too low and not representative of the high-value differentiated alloys, products, and services we offer. because of the low margins, haynes in fiscal years '17, '18 and early '19 struggled to be profitable below the fairly robust shipment level of 5 million pounds a quarter.
as we complete our fourth quarter of fiscal year '21, i'm proud to say that our employees' relentless focus on what's important has resulted in top of the class gross margin percentage in the second half of our fiscal year '21 in our slice of the industry. this was achieved despite the continued low aerospace volumes that the industry is experiencing. we've done what we said we would do on gross margin improvement, on cash generation, and on lowering our breakeven point by about 25% with the current mix. this is not the haynes of the past, but a company prepared to continue to do each of the following.
prioritize safety and continue to improve our safety processes; be profitable at volumes well below past breakeven points; improve gross margins by leveraging both a lower cost structure and higher base pricing; thoughtfully and strategically allocate capital; work with our customers on an ongoing basis on our outstanding alloy and application development; and finally, be well positioned to capitalize on the upcoming anticipated volume improvement in our largest market, that being aerospace. i'm very proud of our entire team. our fiscal year '21 q4 performance shows the enormous strides our team has made.
some of the highlights are as follows. revenue was up 8.1% sequentially and 19.2% year-over-year. net income was $2.6 million despite shifting slightly below 4 million pounds. our gross margin percentage was 17.5%, up 200 basis points from q3 and up 1,260 basis points from q4 of fiscal '20. next, we implemented our capital allocation strategy using cash for the dividend for a build in wip to address our increasing backlog and for our previously announced stock buyback and for the significant reduction in our u.s. pension obligation.
dan will provide additional details, but i'd like to note that after beginning fiscal '21 with a pension liability of $105 million, we begin fiscal year '22 with a liability now at $26.1 million. our combined pension and healthcare expense is expected to be reduced by $6 million in fiscal '22 versus fiscal '21. continuing with the highlights of the quarter, our backlog increased by $24.4 million or 16.2% over the past quarter. our alloy and application development activities continue to generate the innovative solutions that have always been and continue to be the backbone of our company. and finally, our company had no osha recordable injuries in the last two months of the quarter. i'm proud of our team's focused leadership, safety process development and communication. their efforts continue to make a real difference.
in addition, our work on esg continues. in the quarter, we saw an improvement in our social esg score. the labor, health and safety sub-category of the social score improved significantly as we continue to show leadership, improvement, and transparency in our safety initiatives. in addition, still related to esg, we are now making a significant investment and have begun construction of our first solar installation, one that we expect will generate one megawatt of electricity at our haynes wire facility in mountain home, north carolina. this installation will supply approximately half of our electricity needs at this location.
now, transitioning to our markets. from a market perspective, the numbers show the impact of our igt share gain initiatives, the impact of our continued efforts to grow our applications beyond our three core markets, and also the impact of the expected upcoming improvement in aerospace. in aerospace, we are seeing the initial signs of a recovery. revenue was up 14.8% sequentially and 16% year-on-year. book-to-bill was 1.3 and our backlog grew 13.6% over the last quarter. we believe these numbers represent the beginning of the return of our largest market. a key point to make is that we believe we are just at the beginning of the aerospace recovery. consistent with that belief, fiscal year '21 aerospace revenues were just 50%, five-zero percent of our fiscal year '19 aero revenues.
in igt, revenue was up 3.9% sequentially and 49% year-on-year. our innovative alloys and our excellent customer service resulted in the market share gains that we've talked about over the past 18 months. in cpi, our revenue was down both sequentially and year-on-year, but our book-to-bill was 1.6 and our backlog grew 40% over the past quarter. the reduction experienced in our q4 was related to the timing of orders shipped and we expect special projects and our base cpi business to improve year-on-year.
our other markets category includes products that are used in wear fgd or flue gas desulphurization, electronic ceramics, automotive, renewable energy, oil and gas, and waste incineration applications. our unique alloys along with our excellent technical, marketing, and application development provide solutions for difficult to solve problems in these industries. this overall segment grew 17.1% sequentially in our q4 led by increases in shipments to the fgd, oil and gas, marine and navy nuclear and wear markets.
as far as fgd, where the largest growth occurred, as our business conditions continue to improve in the aerospace, igt and cpi markets, we will most likely see a reduction in our fgd shipments as we utilize our manufacturing capacity on higher value products. wrapping up my market comments, i'd like to briefly highlight another of our differentiators, the growing use of the proprietary alloy haynes 282 in the industrial gas turbine market.
as i've discussed each quarter, innovation, inventing alloys, and developing new applications to help customers meet their demanding needs has been and continues to be a core strength for our company. haynes 282 alloy has already been specified by certain major oems into some of their most advanced gas turbines. this alloy was selected due to its unique combination of high temperature strength and fabricability to increase the efficiency and power generation capabilities of these engines. other major oems are also in the advanced stages of either conducting field trials or specifying our alloy. in addition, beyond haynes 282, haynes 244 alloy due to its low coefficient of thermal expansion and high temperature strength is now being tested in certain major industrial gas turbines. finally, our newest high temp alloy haynes 233 with its outstanding combination of high temperature strength and oxidation resistance is now being tested by oems.
wrapping up my comments, the efforts of the haynes team have changed the future of our company, our focus on providing high-value differentiated products, on getting paid for the product and service value provided, on relentlessly pursuing opportunities to increase our yields and lower our variable cost of manufacturing, and on finding even more opportunities to be innovative have all resulted in cash generation, higher margins, and a significantly lower breakeven point. we've truly moved from words to actions to bottom line results and i'll turn the call over to dan for more details on our financial results.
daniel w. maudlin -- vice president-finance; chief financial officer; treasurer
thank you, mike. let me start with a detailed update of our value creating capital allocation strategy including our favorable year-end actuarial valuation. as you recall last quarter, we were excited to announce a multifaceted capital allocation strategy that first included a share repurchase plan as we feel this is a unique opportunity to repurchase shares well below the intrinsic value of the company. this is based upon the outlook in our markets, particularly the anticipated accelerating recovery in commercial aerospace combined with our gross margin expansion strategies.
in the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 113,000 shares for $4.2 million. this part of the strategy is executing as expected. the second part of our capital allocation strategy included the recent adoption of a glide path for our u.s. pension plan along with a $15 million lump-sum contribution in q4 as we work to reduce what was the largest liability on our balance sheet. the result of these actions combined with a favorable overall valuation has impressively exceeded our expectations.
the u.s. pension funded percentage and net liability started the fiscal year at 68% funded and a net liability of $105.2 million, but ended the year at 91% funded and a net liability of $26.1 million representing a liability drop of over $79.1 million combining this with a favorable valuation on our retiree medical plan, reducing the liability $10.4 million and improvement in our u.k. pension of $3 million. all combined, this is an improvement of $92.5 million, an impactful value creating balance sheet transformation.
and further, our expense for fy '22 for pension and retiree healthcare is expected to decreased $6 million compared to fy '21. our pension asset allocation at year-end was 30% equity and 70% fixed income, but additional glide path triggers were hit in october and november as we are now at a funded percentage of 93% putting the current allocation today at 19% equity and 81% fixed income with the fixed income portion in hundreds of individual bonds designed to match the duration of cash flows of the pension plan essentially creating an interest rate hedge.
this reduced interest rate risk combined with the reduced equity risk is expected to reduce volatility creating more stability at this lower expense level. overall, this strategy is executing well and we can see the path to achieve our goal of zero net liability for the u.s. pension plan potentially sooner than we expected. this is an all-around favorable outcome from this value creating strategy.
moving on to the financial results for the quarter, we expanded our revenue and profitability this quarter with revenue at $95.3 million and net income at $2.6 million. this profitability level was accomplished at just under 4 million pounds shipped, proving once again our lower breakeven point with the current mix. our gross margin percentage expanded by another 200 basis points to 17.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, which exceeds the gross margin percentage in the quarters leading up to the pandemic.
our margin improvement strategies have been successful and are expected to continue to gain momentum going forward. we expect volumes to increase and the anticipated accelerated growth in the aerospace recovery which should further improve our fixed cost absorption and more fully realize the benefits of our cost reduction efforts. these cost reductions have been related to improved yields, productivity and process improvements, which are expected to be further realized with higher mill production volumes.
in addition, shipped volumes increasing as expected, we anticipate that our previously announced price increases will continue to help margins. market price increases for nickel and cobalt provided a moderate tailwind to margins this quarter of roughly $1.8 million. the direct charge was only $800,000 this quarter with better absorption of overhead costs compared to $2 million in the third quarter of fiscal '21 and $4 million in the fourth quarter last year. we have not been immune to the industrywide challenges in the labor market or supply chain issues as well as inflationary cost pressures.
these have been significant issues to manage through and at this point, we have been rather successful with no material impact on our financial results. we expect it will continue to be a challenge that will require ongoing management team focus. mike already covered a discussion of each market, but here's a bit more detail on the numbers. this quarter, sales to the aerospace market accounted for 41% of our revenue at $39 million. this is an increase of 14.8% sequentially from q3 and an increase of 16% from the same period last year. this appears to represent the beginning of the recovery. however, much more is expected.
aerospace volumes in fy '21 were 31% below volumes of fiscal year '20 and nearly 52% below volumes of fiscal 2019. published build rates of single-aisle aircraft show significant growth expected in fiscal year '22 and generally a return to 2019 levels in fiscal 2023. backlog dollars in aerospace increased sequentially from q3 to q4 by 13.6% and were relatively flat year-over-year. sales to the chemical processing market accounted for 17% of our revenue at $15.8 million. this is down 7% sequentially from q3 and down 14% from the same period last year.
special project revenue, most of which is reflected in chemical processing was $3.2 million, which is $1.6 million lower than the third quarter and $2.6 million lower than the same period last year. as mike mentioned, this reduction relates to timing issues of products being shipped in the quarter. backlog dollars in cpi increased by 40% q4 versus q3 and is up 68% year-over-year. sales to the industrial gas turbine market accounted for 20% of our revenue at $18.5 million. this is an increase of 3.9% sequentially from q3 and up 49% from the same period last year.
shipments from market share gains continue to be more consistent quarter-to-quarter in this market. backlog dollars in industrial gas turbines increased sequentially from q3 to q4 by 13.4% and 35.1% year-over-year. sales to other markets accounted for 17% of our revenue at $16.1 million. this is an increase of 17% sequentially from q3 and an increase of 73% from the same period last year. backlog dollars were up 4.9% sequentially and up 22% year-over-year.
other revenue accounted for 6% of our revenue at $5.9 million. this is an increase of 4.8% sequentially from q3, but a decrease of 4.2% from the same period last year. sg&a including research and technical expense was $11.9 million or 12.5% of net sales in the fourth quarter, which was lower than fthe third quarter's $12.3 million, but higher than last year's fourth quarter of $9.1 million. the year-over-year increase was mainly due to last year's fourth quarter reversal of incentive compensation accruals, creating a credit for the fourth quarter of last year.
non-operating retirement benefit expense in the p&l of $0.4 million was lower by $1.3 million this quarter as compared to the same period last year due to our favorable actuarial valuation last year. this line in fy '22 is expected to be an income of $1.1 million per quarter versus the current $0.4 million expense or a reduction of $1.5 million per quarter or a significant $6 million annual improvement for fy '22.
our effective tax rate was high at 37.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 primarily related to a change in the u.k. tax rate, which required a revaluation of their deferred tax liability creating $400,000 charge to earnings this quarter. we achieved these results despite shipping volumes 20% below our previous breakeven point. all of the above contributed to a net income for the quarter of $2.6 million compared to a net income of $0.4 million in the third quarter and a net loss of $5.7 million in last year's q4.
it certainly feels good to see the anticipated beginning of our recovery with profitability expanding and a more robust positive outlook for the commercial aerospace industry. order entry and backlog, we are not yet back to pre-pandemic order entry levels. however, order entry rates continue to increase each quarter in fiscal '21. backlog was $175.3 million at september 30th, '21, an increase of $24.4 million or 16.2% from june 30, '21 levels. after year-end, our backlog continued to increase ending october 31st, '21 at $186.4 million.
as far as our outlook for next quarter, the first quarter is historically our lowest revenue quarter impacted by holidays, planned maintenance outages, and customers managing their calendar year-end balance sheets. we believe this first quarter seasonal impact will be offset by our business improvements and the strengthening demand that we are experiencing. therefore, the company expects both revenue and earnings in the first quarter of fiscal '22 to be similar to the fourth quarter of fiscal '21.
based on our increasing backlog and accelerating commercial build rate schedules, we expect to see significant year-on-year aerospace growth that will positively benefit the company over the balance of the fiscal year. capital spending was $5.9 million in fiscal '21 and we are increasing our expected capital spending in fy '22 to $17.7 million, a sizable increase and approaching our depreciation levels. liquidity, cash on the balance sheet was $47.7 million at september 30th, '21 after outlaying a $15 million lump-sum pension contribution and $4.2 million in share repurchases in accordance with our value creating capital allocation strategy. we have strong total liquidity of $147.7 million of which $100 million is available on our undrawn credit facility.
in conclusion, it is encouraging to see expanding profitability with the recovery of our gross margin percentage now exceeding pre-pandemic levels while still ahead of us, we also have expectations of significant growth in volume and revenue from the anticipated aerospace recovery combined with the expected additional margin percentage expansion as our process improvements are more fully realized. this transformation of the business combined with the significant value creation achieved from the execution of our capital allocation strategy results in a truly different company. we are a company with impressive earnings power potential and a strong transformed balance sheet as the foundation for growth and continued value creation for our shareholders. mike, with that, i will now turn the discussion back over to you.
